00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.340
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good morning.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.060
Good morning, everybody
and welcome to the African

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.830
and Middle Eastern Division
and to the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.360 position:56%
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb, Chief of the
African and Middle Eastern Division.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.320
And I and my colleagues
here at the Library,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.440
Jane Sanchez who is the
Chief of the Humanities

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.610 position:56%
and Social Sciences Division, the --

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:53.530
our Deputy Associate Librarian
who is here, especially to meet

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.540
with you today, Sandy Lawson
and Sibyl Moses, Marieta Harper,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.430
Eve Ferguson, Robert
Casper, Paul Zany and many,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.700
many others who have worked so
hard to make this event possible.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.810
We are all delighted to see
you here to celebrate together

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.490
at the Library the 150th
Juneteenth Anniversary

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.120
which has been celebrated
in Galveston,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.690
Texas since June 19, 1865.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.760
It is Maria Fenton, the President
of the Juneteenth Book Festival

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.070
who we must all thank for coming
up with the idea of having an event

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.540
at the Library to celebrate
this occasion with a symposium

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.640
on black literature and literacy.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.760
But before we begin, we need
all to stand up for a minute

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.410
in silent prayer for the
victims and their families

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.900
of the tragic shooting on
Wednesday in Charleston

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.440
at Mother Emmanuel Charleston
Emmanuel African Methodist

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.100
Episcopal Church.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.490
Described in 2013 by its pastor,
the Reverend Clemente Pinckney,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.700 position:56%
who was slain two days ago as a very
special place because this church

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.000
in this site, in this area have
been tied to the history and life

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
of African-Americans
since the early 1800s.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.400
Thank you.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.430 position:56%
This tragedy reminds us of the price
so many have had to pay for freedom.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.590
For all the freedom
is a universal right.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.740
It is not always recognized
as such and we should never,

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.880
never take freedom for granted.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.620
There are still today an
estimated 30 million people

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.070
who are illegally enslaved in
Asia, Latin America, and Africa.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.500
What is important is to remember
that freedom is not only a matter

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.340
of physical freedom i.e. to be able
to live where one wants to live,

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.580
to travel wherever one desires, to
choose how to earn one's living.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.350
But it is also the freedom
to say what one thinks,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:34.420
the freedom to follow one's
faith, the freedom to read, write,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.670
create in a way that
is unhindered and free.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.500
In many parts of the world, people
are killed for their beliefs,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.820
imprisoned for their writings,
flogged for their blogs,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.250
beheaded for their views.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.120
So today, we should remember all
those who gave their lives to fight

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.340
for those freedoms and again, we
should not ever rest on our laurels

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.630 position:56%
and believe that freedom is a given.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.910
We should always in every
way defend those rights,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:22.610
speak up against attempts to limit
or to curtail them in any way.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.030
And today, we have you here.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.510
We have you here to speak to us
of black literature and literacy.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:42.270
Of this important, incredibly
important issue of the right

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.140
to speak up, to write, to
think freely, to create

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.970
and to share with others.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:58.240 position:56%
So let me pass on now the microphone
to our Deputy Associate Librarian

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.130
who has been here, who has come
especially today to welcome you

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.030 position:56%
in the name of the Library, in the
name of the Librarian, Sandy Lawson.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.340
&gt;&gt; Sandy Lawson: Thank
you, Mary-Jane.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.640
And good morning, everyone.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.640
I do bring greetings to
you from Library Services.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:22.550
The Deputy, the Chief of
Library Services, Mark Sweeney,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.460
the Associate Librarian
for Library Services,

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.640
and also from the Librarian.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.710
This is a very special occasion,
a very special celebration.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.110
Today is Freedom Day.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.480
Today is Emancipation Day.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.370
And today is Juneteenth.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.680
We celebrate today the end of
slavery in the United States

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.580
and this -- with this exciting
Juneteenth Book Festival Symposium.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.860 position:56%
I want to thank the staff of the
African and Middle Eastern Division,

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.710
the Humanities and Social
Sciences Division, the Poetry

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.260
and Literature Center,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.250
and the Juneteenth Book
Festival Incorporated

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.970
for sponsoring this event.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.250
And as Mary-Jane said,
unfortunately,

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.560
we must also reflect today during
this celebration, the devastation

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.940
that took place in
Charleston, South Carolina.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.800
We have to keep the victims,
their families, friends,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.940
the City of Charleston in our
thoughts as we look at the program

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.790
and listen to the speakers today.

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.450
Thank you to all the speakers
and to all the honored guests

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.900
who are here today for bringing
the literacy and literature

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.530
of the people of the African
diaspora to the forefront.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.350
We're all in for some very
exciting panel discussions

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.370
and some interesting
information I'm sure will emerge

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.290
from this symposium.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.240
So I hope that you all enjoy it and
thank you for inviting me and hope

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.510
to see you and talk
to you later today.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.310
Thank you.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.890
[ Applause ]

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.830
&gt;&gt; Jane Sanchez: Good morning.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.680
Thank you for joining us for the
Juneteenth Book Festival Symposium.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.080
We welcome you and we are
pleased to welcome you

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.820
to the nation's library,
the Library of Congress.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:30.630
My name is Jane Sanchez and I,
along with the very talented staff,

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:35.660
comprise the Humanities and
Social Sciences Division.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.330
When the opportunity to co-sponsor

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.810 position:56%
and support this symposium presented
itself, we seized the opportunity

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.930
to join with the African and
Middle Eastern Division, the Poetry

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:54.160
and Literature Center and the
Juneteenth Book Festival Inc.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.860
We did that because the subject
of Juneteenth encompasses so many

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.220
of the disciplines that we are
responsible for in the Humanities

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.380
and Social Sciences Division.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:13.240
We are responsible for developing
collections for that area

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:18.230
and so many different areas that
include African-American history

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:25.490 position:56%
and culture, education and literacy,
literature, political science,

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:33.680
local history and genealogy,
poetry and many, many other areas.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.540
We hope you will enjoy
today's symposium and we hope

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:43.350 position:56%
that as a result, you will develop
new strategies and new opportunities

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:49.230
for publishing and promoting black
literature, enhancing literacy

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:56.220
and for capturing the stories and
lives of Africans in diaspora.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:02.080
Please come back and make use of
the rich and varied collections

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.250
that we have preserved
in your nation's library.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.690
We hope to see all of you again.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.510
Thank you.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:15.420
[ Applause ]

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.680
&gt;&gt; Maria Fenton: Good morning.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.980
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:22.000
&gt;&gt; Maria Fenton: This has
been a long time coming.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.760
And I'm not just talking
about the 16 months

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.960
that I've been working
on this project.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.220
I'm talking about 150
years a long time coming.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.060
And I welcome you all and I
feel so welcome and I want

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.440
to first thank the
Library of Congress

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.770
for making me feel so very welcome.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.510
And yeah --

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.040
[ Applause ]

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.120
And making it not just a nice
little cliché, but an actuality,

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.220
and a knowing that
you can do anything

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.930
that you apply your
mind and your heart to.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.710
But it has to be a combination

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.100
of both the mind and
the heart, the both.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.310
So why Juneteenth?

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.510
Why a book festival?

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.530
Why you? Juneteenth?

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.660
Book festival, for real?

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:19.540
So first of all, I'm an immigrant.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.840
I was born in London.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.770
I came over as a young child.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.220
And so I don't have the
African-American story.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.170
I have the African story.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.680
And the beauty of the African
story and the African diaspora is

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:43.630
that waters, borders,
governments set lines and this is

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.230
where this one begins and this is

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.810
where that one ends means
nothing to the African people.

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.970
You know your people, right?

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:56.830
And so for me, being
able to say, "Okay,

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:03.710
I want to put together something
that celebrates the thing

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.430
that I love which is words, the
thing that was given to me early

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.730
on in life which is words.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.920
Whereas we didn't have a lot
of money, we didn't have a lot

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.490
of access to a lot of things but
we had access to the libraries.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.060
Libraries at school, libraries
at home and we made use of them."

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.700
So when things happen that were
as wonderful, I went to a book.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:27.660 position:56%
When things -- something happened
that was horrible, I went to a book.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:33.130
And that's exactly what
they were doing back 1865 --

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:40.770
1773, Phyllis Whitley was
writing when it was uncalled for.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.820
She was supposed to just survive.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.390
How dare she sit back and create?

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:51.280
How dare she take the word and make
it her own, form her own sentences,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.930
create her own thoughts,
write her own story?

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.410
Write her own story.

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:02.060
That is what I want us to remember
is to write our own stories.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.960
Be stewards of our stories.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.490
One of the things that makes
a person free is the ability

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.450
to define and think for yourself.

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.820 position:56%
There's a reason why we're doing
this here in the Library of Congress

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.900
because this is the land of
the primary source, people.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.730 position:56%
You don't have to go to another
source to have something fed to you.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.030
You can go to the source.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.050
It is open and available to you
and find out and write about it

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:35.040
and critique it for yourself.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:43.940
Juneteenth is about, yes, Galveston
and the emancipations and it's kind

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:49.340
of story but the history of
emancipation is a storied history.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.940
There are, we have
emancipation Day on April 16th

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:56.730
in DC then you have Juneteenth
on June 19th and people kind

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:58.030
of throw their hands up in the air

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.570
because they don't
really know what it is

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:03.540
because that's exactly
how it unfolded.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.420
It was storied.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.710
It was complicated and then
the story was retold in ways

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:14.670
to benefit some and
to demote others.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.770
But what I'm calling for
us to do, this festival --

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.570
yes, we want to celebrate
but it is a call to action.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:23.990
It is a call to read your books.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.470
It is a call to publish
books of quality.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.290 position:56%
It is a call to write your own story

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.270
and to critique the
stories that are out there.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.560
Engage with it.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:41.460
So yes, I'm excited that we get to
celebrate it but as what's going

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.380
on in South Carolina, as
what's happened in Baltimore,

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:48.580
what happened in Chicago with all
the places that are around us,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.520
all the violence, all
of the tragedies.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.410
One of the key things that we
get to do is know our stories

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:01.890
and own our stories and
retell and share our stories.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:06.630
And I hope that this festival
is an inspiration for those,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.660
for average people, right?

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.840
I'm an average woman.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.080
For average people to say,
"I'm going to make my mark

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.460
and I'm going to lead it and why?

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.730
Because it needs to be led."

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.510
So thank you and thank
you for coming.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:28.280
[ Applause ]

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.810
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Okay and
now we call upon Hari Jones,

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.550
the curator of the African-American
Freedom War Foundation and Museum.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:39.000
All right.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:48.710
&gt;&gt; Hari Jones: Good morning.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.650
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:56.830
&gt;&gt; Hari Jones: Today, I will
begin by telling you a lie.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:07.970
That lie is that on June 19, 1865,
slaves in Texas finally learned

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.270
that they had been freed

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:15.290
by the Emancipation
Proclamation on January 1, 1863.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:22.850
This lie has been advanced in
legislation, in the popular culture

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.250
as an explanation for
Juneteenth celebrations.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.940
This lie is predicated on a
fundamental misunderstanding

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:38.610
of the Emancipation
Proclamation and its enforcement.

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.990
President Abraham Lincoln issued
the Emancipation Proclamation

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:47.160
on January 1, 1863 as, "A
fit and necessary war measure

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.130
for suppressing said rebellion."

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.820
In that fit and necessary
war measure,

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.000
President Lincoln declared forever
free all persons held as slaves

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.840
in the 10 states that were
at war with the United States

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.510
for the independence
on January 1, 1863.

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.710
And the five still holding states
that did not Abraham Lincoln as --

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.890
that accepted Abraham
Lincoln as president;

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.030
the Emancipation Proclamation
did not apply.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.440
It only applied to the states
that had to be brought back

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.560 position:56%
into the Union by military conquest.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.850
On September 22, 1982,

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.080
in the preliminary
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:27.090
Lincoln warned the rebellious
states, giving them 100 days

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.630
to return to the Union or he was
going to declare free their slaves.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.810 position:56%
Frederick Douglas, eight days later,
wrote in his monthly that in order

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.680
for the Emancipation
Proclamation to free any slaves,

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.830
two conditions had to be met.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.020
The first condition was that the
states in rebellion still had to be

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.290
in rebellion as of January 1, 1863.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:51.950
And the second condition was,
"We must have the ability

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:53.440
to put down the rebellion."

00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:03.360
In late 1862, the enslaved
knew that an order to be freed

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.010
by the Emancipation Proclamation,
they would have to contribute

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.360
to suppressing the rebellion
thus to preserving the Union.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.590
And this would have to be done
through military conquest.

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:21.510
Thus begun -- thus began
their military campaign

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.410
for emancipation and union.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:32.060 position:56%
It was understood by many members of
Congress, the President's Cabinet,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.900
the Confederate Legislature
and Jefferson Davis,

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.200
the President of the Confederacy,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.760
that the Emancipation
Proclamation was a cry for help

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.280
to America's African-descent
population.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.360
Jefferson Davis told the
Confederation Legislature

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.410
in January 1863 that the
Emancipation Proclamation was,

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.170
"An authentic statement by the
government of the United States

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.910
of its inability to subjugate
the south by force of arms."

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:07.210
Meanwhile in Texas, there is clear
evidence that enslaved persons

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.910
in Galveston knew

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.230
of the Emancipation
Proclamation in late 1862.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:18.210
Galveston was captured the
Union Navy in October 1862 --

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:23.730
a navy comprised of 25%
African-American sailors.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.810
The Austrian Council at
Galveston wrote a letter

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:33.030
to the Union Naval Commander,
Admiral William Renshaw,

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.690
stating that Texas
slaves had run away

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.480
and been given refuge
by Renshaw's fleet.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:45.720
The Council wanted to know
if his slaves ran away,

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.720
would the Admiral return them?

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.960
Renshaw unequivocally said, "No."

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.940
Only a small army force, the 42nd
Massachusetts Infantry was assigned

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.800
to occupied Galveston and the
rebels recaptured Galveston

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.010
on the day the final Emancipation
Proclamation was issued,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.230
January 1, 1863.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:11.520
Union soldiers and sailors
were taken as prisoners of war

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:16.850
and these Union soldiers
and sailors with knowledge

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:20.090
of the Emancipation
Proclamation reported contact

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:26.510
with enslaved Texans as some were
assigned to the POWs as cooks.

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.200
The Union strategic plan
neglected military operations

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:35.780
in Texas through much of 1863.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.320
Lincoln's priority in the west was

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.290
on controlling the
Mississippi River.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.530
And Lincoln believed that the
only way the Mississippi could be

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:51.650
controlled is with the help of
the African descent population.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:56.630 position:56%
When General Nathaniel Banks started
a Texas expedition along the Red

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.730
River, he was ordered back
to the Mississippi in support

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.740
of General Ulysses Grant's
campaign against Vicksburg.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.310
The Louisiana Native Guards,

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:10.450
the first African descent regimen
mustered into the Union Army

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:14.060
under the field command of African
descent commissioned officers led

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:18.410
by Captain Andre [Inaudible]
assaulted the rebel position

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:25.590 position:56%
at Port Hudson along the Mississippi
three times on May 27, 1863.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:31.400
Though these sable soldiers
failed to capture the rebel fort,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.390
they were successful in keeping
the rebels at Port Hudson

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:38.740
from reinforcing the
rebels at Vicksburg.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.920
Therefore they had accomplished
their primary objective.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.860
Grant captured Vicksburg
on July 4, 1863.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.120
Now Lincoln had called
Vicksburg the key to victory.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.830
And after capturing Vicksburg,
Grant wrote to President Lincoln

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.130
and told President Lincoln

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.890
that Vicksburg could not have
been captured when it was

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.460
without the help of these
African-American soldiers.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:03.480
The general goes on to tell the
President, "By arming the Negro,

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.370
we have added a powerful ally."

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:10.580
Such powerful allies
would participate

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.680
in General Banks' Texas
expedition in November 1863.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.210
Rebel blockade runners
were able to bring supplies

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.170
into Texas along Texas'
southernmost coast.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:28.480
And Banks was ordered to take
that part of the Texas coast.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.910
Five [inaudible] regiments --

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:33.420
regiments comprised of
African-American soldiers

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:40.490
from Louisiana took part in Banks'
successful Texas expedition making

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:43.990
up 10% of the conquering force --

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.070
capturing and conquering
the Texas Gulf coast

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.770
from Indianola to Brownsville.

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.710
These conquering soldiers
brought word

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.330
of the Emancipation
Proclamation to Texas.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.320
John Bates was 10 years old

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.270
when these military operations
were going on in Texas.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:07.960
Bates pointed out in his WPA
slave narrative that word,

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:13.310
"traveled purty fast," and
that's P-U-R-T-Y [laughter] --

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:18.140 position:56%
traveled pretty fast in Limestone
County, Texas where he was enslaved.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.150
Indeed Bates goes on to report
that it was the enslaved

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:22.820
on the plantation where he was

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:27.330
that told the planter
that they were free.

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:33.100
The first state in
rebellion to be brought back

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.480
in the Union thus having
its enslaves free --

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.650
enslaved free by the Emancipation
Proclamation was Arkansas.

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.120
It took one year and four months

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.250
to enforce the Emancipation
Proclamation in a rebellious state

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:53.730
and that state was not Virginia
with its proximity to Washington.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:59.740
That state was the western state
of Arkansas bordering Texas.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.940
When Arkansas was brought back
into the Union as a free state

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:07.090
on April 11, 1864 there
were thousands

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.300
of African descent soldiers
enforcing the Emancipation

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.400
Proclamation in Arkansas.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.500
Meanwhile back in the East, in
1864, African descent soldiers

00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:22.680
for the first time were deployed
in the Army of the Potomac

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.810
after General Grant became
the general in charge

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:28.030
in command of all the armies.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.790
In December 1864, General
Benjamin F. Butler,

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:33.950
the commander of the
Department of Virginia

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:38.640 position:56%
and North Carolina organized the
25th Army Corps, the only Army Corps

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:44.110
in American history made up of
only African descent regiments.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.930
Butler wrote of his
African descent soldiers,

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.400
"Better soldiers never
shouldered a musket."

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:56.960
General Grant wrote in his
memoirs that on April 3, 1865,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.680
the 25th Army Corps
under the command

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.390
of General Godfrey Weitzel
captured Richmond, Virginia --

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.170
the capital of the Confederacy.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.640
The headlines in the
Washington, DC newspaper,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:13.790
<i>The National Republican</i>
read, "Glorious Fall

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:18.180
of Richmond Captured
by the Black Troops".

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:22.830 position:56%
These sable soldiers of the 25th
went on to stop Robert E. Lee's army

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:26.580
at Appomattox Court House,
Virginia forcing their surrender --

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.880
his surrender there
on April 9, 1865.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.520
Though some contemporary
scholars falsely claimed

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.980
that these highly regarded soldiers
were prohibited from participating

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.890
in the grand review of the armies
in Washington on May 22nd --

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:47.780
23rd and 24th, 1865
because of their race.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:53.210 position:56%
Without complaint, these highly
motivated sable soldiers stood ready

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.850
to go to Texas and enforce
the Emancipation Proclamation

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:59.030
in May of 1865.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.360
Thomas Morris Chester, an
African descent war correspondent,

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.050
reported that on the
eve of the grand review,

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.390
the word that they were
embarking for Texas was received

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:15.190
in their camps, "With a
great deal of satisfaction."

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:20.370
Out in Texas, African descent
soldiers who had been there

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:26.730
for months engaged rebel
soldiers in combat in May of 1865.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:34.790
Galveston was captured and occupied
by the Union Navy on June 5, 1865.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:39.060
By the end of the first week
of June, the 25th Army Corps

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.740
and thousands of other
reinforcements were arriving

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.430
in the Lone Star State.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:50.750
In the early morning of June
15, 1865, the rebel governor

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.890 position:56%
and thousands of rebel soldiers
were chased out of the United States

00:25:54.890 --> 00:26:00.320
into Mexico by this
imposing Union force.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:06.480 position:56%
The tradition of the Juneteenth Ball
on June 16th was thus established.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.010
General Gordon Granger
was the commander

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.540
of the New Department of Texas.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.500
His immediate superior, General
Phil Sheridan, ordered Granger

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.420
to publish general orders
informing the people of Texas

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.890
that all the laws enacted by the
rebel governor and legislator --

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:29.670
legislature were null and
void, that federal laws applied

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:35.700
and thus the Emancipation
Proclamation had freed all the

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.070
slaves in Texas forever.

00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:46.190
Granger arrived in Galveston on
June 19, 1865 and he reported

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:51.270
to General Sheridan that
when he arrived that morning,

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:58.000
there was a brigade of the 25th
Army Corps already in Galveston.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.630
Over a thousand African-American
soldiers, heroes of Virginia,

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:12.550
were in Galveston over a week
before Granger showed up.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:16.720
Later that day, Granger published
General Order Number Three

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.330
and the military campaign
for emancipation

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.800
and union was officially
declared over.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:31.630
Let us therefore celebrate the
150th anniversary of the end

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:36.960
of the successful campaign
for emancipation and union.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.780
On this Juneteenth, let us
embrace the truth, reject the lie,

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:47.170
and pledge ourselves to achieving
liberty and justice for all

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.690
in this our indivisible
American republic.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:52.490
Thank you.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:28:01.390
[ Applause ]

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:02.690
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank you.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.640
Thank you for setting
the story straight,

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.250 position:56%
telling us the history the way it is

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.930
and for a most inspiring
presentation.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:12.520
Thank you so much.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:19.820
And now, we call upon Michael
Graham, a poet and 2015 graduate

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:24.290
from the Washington Latin
Public Charter School.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:25.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Graham: So my
name is Michael Graham.

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.800
I'm Maria Fenton's son.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.880
I have -- I'm actually the
youngest member of the JVF team.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.750
Oh sorry, and I'm going
-- thank you.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.580
I'm going to be sharing two
poems by Paolo [Inaudible]

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.300
and one poem I made for myself.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.470
So, should I [inaudible]
the name -- title?

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.770
Oh, sorry.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.070
Wait just a moment --

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.540
Oh, iPhone, iPhone,
iPhone -- okay, all right.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.100
So the first one's called "Love and
Grief" by Paolo Lawrence Dunbar.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:05.390
Out of my heart, one
treacherous winter day,

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:10.330
I locked young love
and threw the key away.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:14.240
Grief wandering widely,
found the key,

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:18.120
and hastened with it
straightaway, back to me.

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.960
With love beside him,
he unlocked the door

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.740
and bade love enter
with him there and stay.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.000
And so the twain abide forevermore.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.970
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:41.580
The second one is called "Life's
Tragedy" Paul Lawrence Dunbar.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:45.590 position:56%
It may be misery not to sing at all,

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:49.640
and to go silent throughout
the brimming day.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.940
All right.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:56.260
It may be misery never to
be loved but deeper griefs

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.980
than these beset the way.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:03.400
To sing the perfect song, and
by a half-note, lose the key.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.710
There the potent sorrow,
there the grief.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:11.200
The pale, sad staring
of life's tragedy.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.090
To have come near the perfect
love, not the hot passion

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:23.040
of untempered youth, but that which
lies aside its vanity, and gives,

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.880
for thy trusting worship, truth.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:33.080
This is indeed to be accursed for
if we mortals love, if we sing,

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.050
we count our joys not
by what we have,

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.300
but by what keeps us
from that perfect thing.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:45.290
Okay, now here's a poem I
actually made on the spot.

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:50.470
I was on a youth leadership trip in
Tennessee this past month, I think,

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:55.200
and there was a talent show and I
had to make up a poem on the spot.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.760
So here's my poem.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.090
I entitled it -- I'm sorry.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:01.390
I'm very nervous.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.640
I don't have much to say.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.390
Except the experience
for my life in DC.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.460
Please listen to me.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.780
They want me to fail.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.580
That's all they want me
to succumb to, failure.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.740
The prying eyes of the
ones who despise me try

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.480
to make me feel like I have failed.

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.690
What they do not know is
that I have prevailed.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.750
Prevailed over the prying
eyes for they look up to me.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.370
So I watch the sneaking
eyes trying to look

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.410
at the mystical figure
that they despise.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:30.170
On the train, I smile and laugh.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.210
At work behind the bar, I smile

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.250
and chuckle while keeping
up my belt buckle.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.150
Trying not to be that
black DC stereotype.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:44.750
Yes, that is all they see, the
tall violent untamed black animal

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:49.310
with the dangerous
locks, the DC inhabitant.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:52.270
Hating on me because
I do what they can't.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.780
Now this is not only
for the people of white

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.650
and red combined skin
before other complexions.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:04.750
This is about the war between
the light skins and dark.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.150
That's what they, those of the
higher power want us to say.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:12.380
Light versus dark, dark
chocolate versus not.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.230
What we are fighting each other
on the ground for attention,

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.010
we are blinded by the
constant gun smoke.

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:21.390
Our lungs are filled
-- our lungs are filled

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:22.690
because of the weed smoke.

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:26.000
Mother Earth's weed smoke
chokes us for pleasure.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.970
We get caught for the earth --

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.190
we get caught for the earth
that we bought and breathed.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:34.230 position:56%
You best believe that our protectors
are now our fear dealing defectors.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:38.570
And now aren't -- yeah, I
myself tried to be friendly

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.210
and give the killers a smile
so I can walk around with them

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.600
for a while and not
minding their blank smiles,

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.600 position:56%
hiding the hate but keeping control.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.420
I would rather not like them.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:56.020
I hang my head in fake like I have
respect in order to protect myself

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:59.620
from lying on the floor silent
because of the bullet hole.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.580
They want that to be my future so
they could see another black one

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:05.540
down and give no cares
and yes, it sucks.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.420
And so they realize
the best drink made

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.760
for them isn't made
by me in Starbucks.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:15.830
It is I in public they do not
want to see but behind bar

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.780
of a coffee shop or
eventually prison.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.520
But like I said, I have
risen above the contempt

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.290
and kept my sanity in check.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:25.880
For I am that young black --

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:31.510
young black adult who had not
succumbed but surpassed failure.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:36.340
Before my body leaves the stage,

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.320
before I go away, I
have one thing to say.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.670
I'm sorry I'm so nervous.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.510
Thank you.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:52.670
[ Applause ]

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.690
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank you,
Michael and I know that every one

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.470
of us wishes you the
greatest success.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.290
We know that you will succeed.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:01.760
Thank you.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.520
And now, we are going to
start with the first panel.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:14.360
And I would like to call upon
the moderator, Sibyl Moses

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:24.170
and Dr. Haki Madhubuti, Yanick
Rice-Lamb, and Ethelbert Miller.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:30.530
We'd love to have you up on
the stage for the first panel.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:31.940
Thank you.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.050
[ Applause ]

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:41.130
&gt;&gt; Sibyl E. Moses: In 1969,
Amiri Baraka issued a call, SOS,

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:45.020
calling black people,
calling all black people.

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:48.630 position:56%
Man, woman, child, wherever you are.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.770
Calling you, urgent,
come in, black people.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.250
Come in wherever you are.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.980
Urgent, calling you,
calling all black people.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.000
Calling all black people, come in.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.410
Black people, come on in.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:08.110
Today we invite you to come in.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:10.580
Come in to celebrate Juneteenth.

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:14.840
Come in to explore, celebrate
and embrace the creativity

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.740 position:56%
of all black people without
publishers and bloggers on the state

00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:23.700
of black literature, our
stakeholders in literacy

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.500
and our independent artists
engaged in telling our stories.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:33.980
We also invite you to come in
and come in again in the future

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.000
to make use of the Library

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.770
of Congress' vast collections
both primary and secondary sources

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:44.880
about the black experience
and created by people

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.700
of African descent
all over the world.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:54.520
So please come in, listen, learn
and contribute as we are here

00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:00.660
to once again -- Haki --
change the conversation

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:05.590
and to define what is needed
and to go forth and create more.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:09.810
We welcome our three distinguished
panelists for the publishers

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:13.830
and bloggers on the state
of black literature panel.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.510
We have Dr. Haki Madhubuti.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:21.320
We all know the prolific author,
Third World Press publisher,

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.710
and founder, one

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:26.920
of the longest-running independent
black-owned publishing companies

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.570
in the United States.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:32.910
We welcome Yanick Rice-Lamb,
Associate Professor,

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:38.120
Department of Media Journalism and
Film, Howard University, author,

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.950
former newspaper reporter
and editor, and co-founder

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:49.240
of FierceforBlackWomen.com, a
digital health and fitness network.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.940
We welcome with most love --

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:57.880 position:56%
our most love, the distinguished E.
Ethelbert Miller right here from DC,

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.690
a literary artist,
activist, poet, and editor,

00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:06.490
former chair of the
Humanities Council of DC

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:09.850
and a teacher of many of us.

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.540
And so, we will begin with
our panelists [applause].

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.380
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: Good morning.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.090
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:17.500
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti:
I'm happy to be here.

00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.400
My wife is with me, Dr. Carol Lee

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:25.200
and we both came in
last night to DC.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.530
I think first, it's in
order to give, you know,

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.710
deep thanks to Dr.
Deeb, and Chief Sanchez,

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:36.450
and Executive Director Fenton
for this wonderful day.

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:39.320
It's not easy to do
this kind of work.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:43.110
My wife and I have been doing this
kind of work for over 45 years

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.960
in Chicago and the
rest of the nation.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:51.040
And I'm here primarily
because of, I guess, my work.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.720
I've published many books
and actually I taught

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.080
at Howard University
for seven years --

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:59.920
eight years that when I met the
distinguished Ethelbert Miller.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.810
And I'm really happy
to be here with him.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.920
I haven't seen him for some time.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.840
My journey to this place
has been a long one.

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:15.570
In 1967, with $400 and a
used mimeograph machine,

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:21.350
I founded Third World
Press a basement apartment

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:26.830
in South Side Chicago with
a used mimeograph machine.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:28.130
I started there.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.430
We now own half-a-block in Chicago
where my wife and I, and others,

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:30.730
not only operate Third World Press.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:35.820
We have four schools for our
children, the New Concept School,

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.610
the Betty Shabazz International
Charter School,

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:45.440
Barbara Ann Sizemore Academy, and
the DuSable Leadership Academy.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.070
And we serviced over a thousand
black children each and every day

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.370
with an African-centered education.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.940
Our journey has been a long one.

00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.240
It's been a difficult one.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.040
But it's one that we chose.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.760
And with all the problems that
we've endured in terms of trying

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.610
to build these institutions,
this is what we chose to do.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:05.370
This has been our job,
our task and our journey.

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:10.170
My journey started actually in
Little Rock, Arkansas 73 years --

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.860
I'm 73 years old -- 73 years ago.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:18.600 position:56%
With my mother, at that time, father
had escaped up towards Detroit,

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:23.250
Michigan and as Juan
Killens would say.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:28.670
And then the journey somehow my
mother who is not with us now --

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:32.970
in fact my mother -- this is
my memoir, <i>Yellow Black </i>.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:36.140
This is my mother here.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:41.420
You see, she's a very
beautiful woman.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:47.000
She was in the sex trade and by
the time she was 34, she was dead.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.660
But before that time, she
introduced me to literature.

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.750
I write about it in <i>Yellow Black</i>
and I write that and I talk

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:58.050
about libraries because
my mother introduced them.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.400
My introduction to the
library was the first place

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.700
where I could -- I could hide.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.000
Libraries are free, brothers.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.800
It was kryptonite.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.640
An oxymoron to the 10th power.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.240
Libraries in Detroit in the
1950s were white, quiet,

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.050
safe and sacred places with books,
ideas and white children trying

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.210
to feed their minds and stay ahead.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:19.340
For me, the necessity of
libraries was early liberation

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:22.010
to my young mind and soul.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:24.170
I devoured their content
like running oil

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.830
in a bad engine of a used car.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.430
I was hot for knowledge
and the more I received,

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:31.500
the greater I realized
the supreme ignorance

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.330
of my ways and that of my family.

00:40:34.330 --> 00:40:37.470
For the first time, hope for
me appeared on the horizons

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.400
with the acquisition
of my knowledge.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.450 position:56%
Defining the pure, practical answers

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:44.450
that seldom entered the
black community propelled me

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:48.260
into a long [inaudible]
that I would never leave.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:52.260 position:56%
To talk about ideas other than those
of the books, other than the work,

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:56.270 position:56%
beating weakened women and money
placed me according to most brothers

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.220
on another planet [laughter].

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:00.660
It was like a musician discovered
the beauty and brilliance

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.810
of Charlie Parker and
Dizzy Gillespie,

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.890
realizing that their music
was genius and wondered

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:08.310
if he could ever do that.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:12.640
The real task of getting the
young musicians to try books

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.490
and music encouraged me to try.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:20.600
Maybe it was God and
[inaudible], our supreme judge

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.630 position:56%
who instructed my mother to actually
go to the Detroit Public Library

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.230
to check out <i>Black
Boy </i>by Richard Wright.

00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:31.480
I, at first, refused to go
because I did not want to go

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.560
to a white library and ask a white
librarian for a book with black

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.200 position:56%
in the title authored by a black man

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.530
who I was told was challenging
white America's concept

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.930
of itself and black people.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.540
Apartheid America had worked.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:50.860
I was completely ashamed of who
I was, felt inferior, inadequate

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.300
and unprepared to answer the
simple question if asked,

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.540
"Why do you want to
read <i>Black Boy </i>?"

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.710
I found <i>Black Boy </i>with
luck on the library shelf.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:02.510
There were two copies.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:05.810
I took one of them, walked into
one side of the reading room

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:09.280
and sat down and began to read.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.560
I was immediately captivated by
the boldness of the language,

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.220
the clarity of the ideas, the
similarity of the [inaudible]

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.070 position:56%
and living experience within my own.

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.300
The familiarity of the
landscape, the intellectual genius

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.090
of the protagonist to get what
he needed at any given time,

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:28.200
the feeling of Richard
Wright to present a world

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:36.060 position:56%
in which our people were completely
locked down emotionally, physically,

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.360
economically and culturally --

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.660
yet still functioning
as whole human beings.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.480
Which brings us most certainly
to what happened in Charleston.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:46.310
Whole human beings being shot
down by you know, white supremists

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.050
and I know Miss Fenton spoke about
it this morning but I just wanted

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.440
to again -- bring it back up that
our hearts go out to our brothers

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.440
and sisters in Charleston.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.560
But as I read each word,
each sentence of paragraph

00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.860
after paragraph, page after page,

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:03.590
it was like a sledgehammer
hitting me upside my head,

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.840
stating in no uncertain
terms, "Wake up, Negro!"

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.650
I checked out <i>Black Boy </i>.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:14.460
Ran home, went to the room I shared
with my sister and read all night.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.860
The next morning upon
completion of the book,

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.900
the first serious book I
read in less than 24 hours,

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:24.290
I was not a different person
but a different questioner.

00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:30.300
Wright gave me content, a long
content as I was beginning to move

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:36.300
to the age of 14 and now
they focused on direction

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.180
for my own culture and
intellectual development.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:49.720
His words formed the circle in our
own investigation into the ways

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.020
and whys of white folks and my own.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.320
Life suddenly, suddenly it
slapped me right in the face.

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.910
Read the white books,
newspapers, magazines and journals

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:01.310
and [inaudible] and questioning
what was read is fundamental

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.650
to developing a quicker
consciousness and world view.

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:08.440
Knowledge of oneself, of
one's culture shapes a person.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:13.060
I do not know how my mother felt
about the literature she read.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.540
We never talked about it.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:19.040
All I remember is that she
once wanted me to read.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.880 position:56%
She was never angered by my spending
countless hours in the library.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.960
As our lives slowly slipped into
another world, mine did too.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:32.780 position:56%
Into the pavement of countless of
books that put me into other worlds,

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:35.370
cultures, places and
without me knowing it,

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:38.380
helped to determine my future.

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:41.980
Black music had freed me creatively
and black literature began

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:45.350
to find [inaudible] me
intellectually and culturally.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.350 position:56%
For the first time in my young life,

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.030
I realized that life
has greater meaning

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.870
than my personal circumstances.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:55.550
And I began to chance a smile
in between books, concepts

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.100
and what I perceived was a
fine girl interested in me.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.820
I also picked up a pen and
began to write my own thoughts.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:08.480
I didn't call my words poetry but
became like square in a 12-round --

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.070
sweat in a 12-round fight that
you didn't know you could win.

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:14.530
Over proper training, there
was always a possibility

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:20.530
of gaining ground if only a
yard, a word, a round at a time.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:27.140
You know, there's more but this
whole question of literature

00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:30.600
and reading, it is
absolutely necessary.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.760
For the last 75 days, I've been
getting up every morning at 4:30

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:41.040
in the morning to write this book
which will be published in August.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:47.220
The title of the book is
"Taking Bullets" -- black men --

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:50.390
black boys and men in 21st
century America fighting terrorism

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:53.280
and violence and seeking
human space.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:57.310
And what set me on
this task and many

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.410
of you may know I've written
two other books on black men.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.460
<i>Black Men: Obsolete,
Single, Dangerous </i>,

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.470
African-American family
transitioning <i>Tough Notes:</i>

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:07.400
<i>A Healing Call for Creating
Exceptional Black Men </i>.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.750
That my life has revolved
around black people.

00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:14.530
My wife and I spend over 90% of
our time in the black community.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.790
And I've had all -- you know,
I've taught at research one

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.260
in universities, in urban
universities for the last --

00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.110
I'm retired now, for
the last 22 years.

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:26.000
But the point is that our
community needs so much --

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.340
-- and needs so much.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.640
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, yes.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.940
So much.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.240
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti:
And the great majority

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.290 position:56%
of our people do not know it, do not
understand what we are dealing with.

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:42.610 position:56%
You know, we're dealing with empire.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:44.820
The United States is
the last empire.

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:46.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.420
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti:
And these brothers are

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:49.010
in these family corners,
you know, talking, "Mac,

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.470
you know, this is my turf.

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:51.770
They paying rent."

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.070
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:54.370
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: They
don't own it, you know.

00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.310
I've lived here for
eight years in DC.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:03.410
Commuted every week
between Chicago and DC

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:07.450
and I don't even know
this place anymore.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:08.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:10.050
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti:
And we don't know it.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:11.350
&gt; That's true.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:12.650
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: And if such
a question to ask, "Who are you?

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:13.950
Who are you?"

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.280
You ask 10 black people out on
the streets, "What's your name?

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.590
Who are you?

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:19.270
Where'd you come from?"

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.860
You will get 10 different answers.

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:28.470
In fact sometimes,
20 different answers.

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:29.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: If you don't know
who you are, anybody can name you.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:32.370
And they will.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:33.670
And so we find ourselves
in this continued war,

00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:34.970
this continued pattern to just
to be human, just to be human.

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:36.270
Black people don't have
no place else to go.

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:37.570
And you know, these clowns
are like, "Go back to Africa."

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:38.870
What?

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:40.170
[ Laughter ]

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:41.470
You talking about Africa,
Mississippi?

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:44.640
You know, Arkansas?

00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:50.120
And so for us, my wife and I
and -- and trying to create,

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:53.030
we need independent
black institutions.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:56.360
Not Negro institutions, not
imitation white institutions.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.140
We need institutions that
are essentially going to talk

00:47:58.140 --> 00:48:00.450
about us, to give us direction.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:03.370
We need family.

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:05.240
We need community.

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.940
And people say, "Well, why -- you
know why does black [inaudible]?"

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.990
You know, black-on-black
crime exists

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:11.720
because of white-on-black crime."

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.020
&gt;&gt; They all do.

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.320
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: What we
do, we've been taught to do.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.620
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.260
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: You see, women
taught to kill white people,

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:21.600
not in [inaudible] -- the people
who raped us in another continent

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.090
so we don't do that but
we kill black people

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:26.160
because we devalued
black people's lives.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.300
You see, so we got a
lot of drive-by shooting

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.990
but we got drive-by looters.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:36.670
The central problem in America is
white supremacy based upon white

00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:39.070
nationalism, you see.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:42.870
That has infiltrated itself
and lived within the context

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:44.170
of these institutional structures

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:45.870
and most certainly
the police structures

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:49.130
in this country -- the
military and police.

00:48:49.130 --> 00:48:50.960
I've served three years
in the military.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.110
I understand what exactly
that meant there.

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:57.930
And so, in trying to build these
independent black institutions

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:02.600
in Chicago, our focus
has been what do we have?

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.390
What do we own?

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.480
You see, I'm not talking about
your, you know, 18 suits.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.810
I'm not talking about
your Lexus from Japan.

00:49:09.810 --> 00:49:11.410
What do you own?

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:12.710
You see what I'm saying?

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:14.010
And this is critical.

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:15.310
And I just got to -- and
what I do in this book,

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:18.410
I talk about the United
States' empire

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:22.980
but what's critical
about empire is wealth.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:27.240
We have no idea of what wealth
is in the black community.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.060
Bill Gates is worth $79 billion.

00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.360
That's with a B. Warren
Buffet is worth $73 billion.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.840
That's with a B. If you look at
the total wealth of black people

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.810
in the United States
including Oprah Winfrey

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:39.240
and Michael Jordan,
this [inaudible].

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:41.370
[ Laughter ]

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:44.510
And Beyonce and Jay Z
and all the athletes,

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:46.950
you're only talking
about $20 billion.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.790
That's chump change
in the real world.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:55.070
And so we have been detached
from each other and what we hope

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.280
in one level of literature, and I
started telling what [inaudible],

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.820
we have to tell our own stories.

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.270
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:06.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: If you don't tell
your own stories, somebody's going

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:15.610
to tell it for you and that
is essentially what happened.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:19.450
The winner tells the story.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:27.460
And the winner's getting the
story out very quickly and we end

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:36.140
up studying their story
rather than our own story.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:37.440
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:46.320
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: And so, you
know, brothers and sisters,

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:56.280
this has been a long journey and
I'm rather passionate about it.

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:00.730
And every day, you know, poetry
and [inaudible] are the same

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:09.110
but for the last 75 days, I've
been working on this manuscript

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:16.370
and all my life, all my adult
life, I've been involved

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:21.810
in literature, in books, you see.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:29.400
And I think that books in
part represent an answer --

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:34.410
not the only answer
but an answer, you see.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:40.100
And I'll just end with this.

00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:51.430
When I wrote -- when I published
<i>Black Men: Obsolete, Single,</i>

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:58.070
<i>Dangerous </i>, I got invitations
from all over the country.

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:02.840
[Inaudible] a lot of folks
and the brothers down there.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.740
We sold the books to prisoners all
across the country for a discount.

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.040
So I was invited to
a lot of prisons.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.340
And what I learned, you
know, clearly and I got --

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:08.730 position:56%
I've got a brother in prison now
and another brother who's in and out

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:10.110
of prison as well, another
sister in and out as well.

00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:11.410
But what I learned
quickly and very forcefully

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:12.710
that the average brother
cannot read in prison,

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:14.010
cannot read at a sixth-grade level.

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.310
If you can't read at a
sixth-grade level, you can't write

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:16.610
at a fourth or fifth-grade level.

00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:17.910
If you can't read at a sixth-grade
level, you can't write at fourth

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:19.210
or fifth-grade level, what can
you do in the black community?

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.550
And you find all across this
country, black communities

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:21.850
around 50 blocks, you see.

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:23.150
We still segregate
their lives and stuff.

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:24.450
And so what can you do in that
community other than go back

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:25.750
to the [inaudible] which is
largely illicit, illegal.

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.050
What can you do?

00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:28.350
And so education what can --
how do you bring young men,

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:29.650
young women into an
educational system?

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:30.950
When as you said, they're
pushing us out.

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:32.250
And one of the reasons and
this -- my wife is brilliant.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:33.550
She's educated.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:34.850
I'm a poet [inaudible] and
what we found was that you have

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:36.150
to have your home must become
a mini-learning institution.

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:37.450
That the children must be --

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:38.750
the babies, the children
must be introduced

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:40.050
to literature early and often.

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:41.350
I mean, we have to
read to our children.

00:52:41.350 --> 00:52:42.650
We have to read to ourselves.

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:43.950
We have to be involved in the elite
intellectual pursuit of knowledge.

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:45.250
Knowledge -- and I'll
just end with this.

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:46.550
One of the major problems this
nation I think is facing --

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:47.850
we have ignorant people telling how
to keep [inaudible] other people

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:49.150
on it -- 85,000 black churches in
this country, 2.3 million black

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:50.450
and brown boys locked
up in the [inaudible],

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:51.750
in the criminal justice system.

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.050
There's a disconnect there.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:54.350
Thank you.

00:52:54.350 --> 00:52:55.650
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:56.950
[ Applause ]

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:58.250
&gt;&gt; Yanick Rice-Lamb: Good morning.

00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:59.550
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:00.850
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:02.150
&gt;&gt; Yanick Rice-Lamb: I'd like to
thank all of you for being here

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:03.450
and I consider all of us word
warriors and thank Maria Fenton

00:53:03.450 --> 00:53:04.750
and the organizers at
the Library of Congress

00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:06.050
for putting this program together.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:09.710
And it's an honor to be
between these two giants.

00:53:09.710 --> 00:53:13.150
I first met and heard
Dr. [Inaudible] --

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:16.310
Haki Madhubuti when
I was at Ohio State.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:17.840
We used to have a bus to go

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:21.370
to the invitations conference
at Howard University.

00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:22.670
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: Oh great.

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:23.970
&gt;&gt; Yanick Rice-Lamb:
You were speaking.

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:25.270
This was in the late '70s.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:27.930
And Ethelbert Miller, of course.

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.220
I was introduced to
him by my cousin,

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:32.650
Van Jordan, who's also a poet.

00:53:32.650 --> 00:53:37.280
And he considers Ethelbert a mentor
as to why and he's also helped me

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.480 position:56%
with some of my own writing and also
my students with their writing too.

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.490
And some of the things that he
mentioned earlier, I agree with.

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:48.640
The library was very
important to me and my sister,

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.220
Michelle, who's out there.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.280
But we lived on up the
street from the library.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:55.120
It was four blocks from us so
we spent a lot of time there.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.670
There were a lot of
books in our house.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:58.960
We started reading
and writing early.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.810
I read the newspaper
with my grandfather.

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:04.880
And my grandmother told me at an
early age that I would write a book

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.830
and it seemed an impossible
feat but I have done that.

00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:12.390
And that time, it was a seed that
she had planted at an early age.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:16.610
And growing up, I also wrote poetry
as a child and wrote short stories.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.820
I escaped through books and some
of you remember back in the day,

00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:23.800 position:56%
the list that they would give us at
schools where you could take it home

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.700
and talk to your parents into
trying to buy these books for you,

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.250
little paperbacks and
things like that.

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:32.670
So my mother, whether she had the
money or not, she always, you know,

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:34.970
set some aside so we
could order books.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:38.450
And we also, like I said, we
went to the library a lot too.

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:41.190
And so I focused on
looking for something

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:43.900
for my life's work that's
related to English and art.

00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.540
Those were the areas
that I was focusing

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.190
on which led me to journalism.

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:52.330
Because I didn't see myself in the
media and I learned that I wanted

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:54.550
to give voice to the
voiceless and try

00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:56.620
to tell stories that
weren't being told.

00:54:56.620 --> 00:54:59.670
And then also hearing a lot
about my own family history

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.790
and the stories that, you know,
my parents and my grandparents

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:07.030
and my aunts and uncles would
tell us about our family tree.

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:10.740
And the importance of reading and
I tried to do with my son also

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.520
when he was a baby, reading to him.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.150
And it got to the point
where he wouldn't go

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:17.940
to sleep unless I read him
a story or he would say,

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:20.000
"Tell me a story about your life."

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.360
And I would tell him
about our family history.

00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:25.180
And sometimes -- and this is, I
guess, something for those of you

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.860
who are parents, for other
people who are parents --

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:30.500
sometimes, we're tired after a
long day and it's hard to find

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.510
that time to read to our children.

00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:33.810
And sometimes, I couldn't --

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.110
literally couldn't
keep my eyes open.

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:39.050 position:56%
And so then I would tell him to tell
me a story or read a story to me.

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:40.470
And he could -- really
couldn't read yet.

00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.100
But he knew some of
the stories by heart

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:45.670
and he would turn the
page at the right place.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:49.140
And I remember once we were at
a naming ceremony for a child

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:51.610
and someone ran to me and
said, "Your son can read!"

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:54.120
And I was saying, "No,
he can't read."

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.820
He just knows some of
the stories by heart

00:55:55.820 --> 00:55:57.310
and he turned them at
the appropriate page.

00:55:57.310 --> 00:56:01.120
They thought he was
reading early [laughter].

00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.200
But, you know, as an
instructor now --

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.780
I'm teaching at Howard University.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:09.240
I can see the difference in
students who were read to,

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.640
in students who have a
love for reading growing up

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.550
and students who continue to read.

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:17.720
And if you look at any
statistics, children who were read

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:21.350
to at least three to four times
a week, they performed two

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:24.680
to the time -- two times or at
least a third better than children

00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.510
who aren't read to on every
level that you can look at.-

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:29.230
Whether it's learning
their alphabet,

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.300
whether it's reading stories,
whether it's taking tests

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.940 position:56%
or whether it's getting into college
or the reading comprehension.

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:37.600
So it's really important
that we do that.

00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.610
And whether we have children
or not, we have to kind

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:43.990
of expand the village with
our nieces and nephews,

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:47.770
the children in our
neighborhood, giving books as gifts

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:51.250
so that we can get them away from
the video games and also trying

00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:53.330
to counter align this
teaching to the test.

00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:56.560
Because students, they've
learned through the test.

00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.410
So at this point, some students
only retain as much information

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:03.930
as they think is necessary to
pass a test and that follows them

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:05.470 position:56%
in the way they handle their courses

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:09.390
or the way they handle
information throughout their lives.

00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:13.330 position:56%
And we spoke earlier about you know,
the opportunities that people have

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.410
for their careers or
whether they're participating

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:17.160
in the underground economy

00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.410
if they don't have the
skills of literacy to read.

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:24.550
And we have to make those
examples by what we do, you know,

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.070
so we practice what
we preach in terms

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:28.830
of reading ourselves
and sharing that.

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:32.050
And sometimes even with -- my
younger brother didn't like to read

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:33.800
but he was very into sports.

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:37.620
So I would buy him sports
magazines so later on,

00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:38.970
now he reads a lot of books.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:42.670
And I always give my nieces
and nephews books as gifts.

00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:43.980 position:56%
And sometimes, they would look at me

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:46.640
like there's Aunt Yanick
again with another book.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.940
But I didn't care.

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:50.150
I was going to give
it to them anyway.

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:56.150 position:56%
So what I've done, I've worked -- I
started off at newspapers and worked

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:58.360
at the <i>Toledo Blade </i>, then
later the <i>Journal Constitution </i>,

00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.660
<i>The New York Times </i>.

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:01.500
Then switched to magazines
so I've worked

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.820
at <i>Child Magazine </i>, <i>Essence </i>.

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.120
I was editor-in-chief

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.760
of <i>BET Weekend </i>and
<i>Heart and Soul Magazine </i>.

00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:11.210
And now, I've started a website
called FierceforBlackWomen.com

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:13.790
and another one called
Fully-Connected.com.

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:17.100
And with Fierce, one of the points
of that is to tell our stories

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:18.820
through health and fitness

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:23.070
because we set the wrong
records when it comes to health.

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:25.440
And those stories aren't
always being told.

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:29.060
So we're also interpreting a lot
of things like different studies

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.670
that come out and we don't know
to eat this, don't eat that

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:35.400
or take this, don't take that
-- and how that affects us.

00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:38.310
And as writers, I also encourage
people to do whatever, you know,

00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:42.830
write by any means necessary so
even, you know, I write books.

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:44.250
I used to write poetry.

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:46.970
I'm not as good as these two
here so I kind of abandoned

00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:49.610
that a little bit or do
it every now and then.

00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:53.300
Articles, blogs, people are
telling stories through tweets

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:55.860
but if you would say you want
to be a writer, you must write

00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:57.160
and you must do it often.

00:58:57.160 --> 00:58:59.620
And it's really important
to tell our stories.

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.350
And also -- and I think
another reason it's important

00:59:02.350 --> 00:59:04.770
to tell our stories because there's
so many distractions out there

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:06.210
and there's a lot

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:08.480
of disproportionate
focus on some stories.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:12.610
So in the past week or so,
we've had disproportionate focus

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:15.020
on a certain person
who shall go unnamed

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:19.810
but she's been everywhere all over
social media, all over the news

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:22.210
to the point where it
overshadowed a lot of other things.

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:25.400
And some people started
putting out lists of 10 stories

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.700
that you didn't pay attention to
because you were focusing on her.

00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:32.210
So there's that, you know,
accountability that we have

00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:36.810
as consumers, as readers, and also
as writers in terms of what we put

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:40.500
out and how we put it out
and being good at what we do.

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.480
A lot of times, people
also want to write

00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.370
but they're not developing
the skills they need

00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:46.850
and there are a lot of
resources out there.

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.780
There are other people that we can
bond with to help us, you know,

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:53.470
develop into the writers
that we want to be.

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:56.620
And also trying to put
those stories out there.

00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.520
There are a number of different
places to do that -- whether you --

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.040
there's an abundance of stories.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.010
Sometimes, there's not always the
outlets if you're looking at going

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:08.220
through traditional routes
because in some of the places,

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.610
if you were a publishing
company, there's fewer imprints

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.540
that we're focused on our stories

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.850
and fewer editors at
those companies.

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:17.640
But we also have Third World Press.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.240
We also have self-publishing.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.800
A lot of people are
doing eBooks now.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:25.570
But the important thing is
to understand the process --

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:27.190
understand all the facts of it

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:29.420
and know what you're
getting yourself into.

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:32.100
And making sure it's sustainable
too because a lot of times,

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:37.040
we've lost institutions whether
they're magazines or newspapers

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.600
or book companies or
bookstores for various reasons.

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:44.280
And so we have to make sure that
they're financially sustainable

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.000
and that we support them as well.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.240
So understanding what we're getting
ourselves into and making sure

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.430
that we're also focusing on
marketing and distribution and all

01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:54.590
of that -- and word of
mouth is very important

01:00:54.590 --> 01:00:56.860
in terms of supporting people.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.400
A lot of times, particularly some
of my friends who are writers,

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.700
if they have a book signing, if
they have three, six stops here --

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.240 position:56%
I'll go to every single one of them.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:10.590
Because as writers, some of you
who write, you value every face

01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:13.560
out there whether you have
six, 60 or 600 out there

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.610
in the audience is really important

01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:17.820
so do everything we
can to support them.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:21.300
And in this area, we've lost a lot
of bookstores, the Caribbean chain

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:23.970
and on and on and throughout
the country.

01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.940
So it's important to kind of
support the ones that we have

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:29.870
and to find new ways of telling
those stories and making sure

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:31.220
that people know about them.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:36.660
Let me see, what else
didn't I mention?

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:41.130
Also that, you know, and that
also goes to literary festivals,

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:45.270
book clubs and also
starting book clubs.

01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:48.010
I'm in two book clubs, one

01:01:48.010 --> 01:01:49.800
of them has a number of
journalists in there.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.680
If you don't read, you feel guilty
and ashamed if you're behind.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:55.420
And sometimes, if I haven't had
a chance to finish the book,

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:59.120
I try to talk about the first
chapters that I have [laughter].

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.430
Lately, I have finished them.

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:02.720
But the other one is
the neighborhood --

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.370
it's in my neighborhood
and some people are content

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:09.260 position:56%
to have the most prolific readers
in our group tell them what happened

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:12.500
in the story and it's more
of a socializing situation.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.580
But it's an opportunity for
me to make sure that I read

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:19.990 position:56%
because I'm juggling a lot of things
and also we started a writer's group

01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:23.210
as an offshoot of the Color
Me Red book club that I'm

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:26.350 position:56%
in because we discovered that we all
had stories on the shelf that we --

01:02:26.350 --> 01:02:28.700
some of them we hadn't
done anything with.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.540
So some -- we have worked
together on screenplays and books.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:36.620
And we encourage each other by
meeting together to write together,

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.850
meeting together to read
our work, doing it by email

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:43.440
when we can't read together,
meet together and do the process.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.090
I was able to finish the
first draft of my first novel

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:50.870
and another member
finished her screenplay.

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:54.230
So I also worked on <i>Born to
Win, The Authorized Biography</i>

01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:56.830
<i>of Althea Gibson </i>and <i>The
Spirit of African Design </i>,

01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:58.900
which is a coffee table book.

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:03.460
<i>Rise and Fly </i>which is about Bid
Whist and space but also weaves

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.060
in history and all of our kind

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.770
of wild behavior playing
cards sometimes.

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:12.420
And various anthologies, writing
about my Aunt Rose who lived

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.470
to be a hundred but I didn't know
she was a hundred until I walked

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:17.350
to her wake because she lied
about her age [laughter].

01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:21.750
We lived in New York and one of the
reasons she lied about her age is

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:24.300
to make sure that she
got good healthcare

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:29.500
so people wouldn't ignore her
when she was in her 80s and 90s.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:35.560
And then a piece called <i>Daddy, My
Brother Barack and Me </i>which was

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.580 position:56%
in a book called <i>BET on Black </i>,
African-American Women in that write

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:42.330
on fatherhood in the
age of Barack Obama.

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:46.560
So a number of women -- we wrote
about our brothers, our fathers,

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.250
our husbands and other men in
our lives who were good fathers.

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.550
And that's really important --

01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:55.700
Father's Day is coming up and we
have a piece on Fierce this weekend

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:59.390
that will encourage women to make
sure that they keep the fathers

01:03:59.390 --> 01:04:02.430
in the lives of their children.

01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:05.320
But as I -- again, as I said, I
think it's really important for us

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.080
to give voice to the
voiceless, to tell our stories.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.520
And you know, whether we
tell them in words, you know,

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:16.440
through other forms of art, and
or when we write them down --

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.210
it's important that
we write them down too

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:19.890
because we have a lot
of rich stories.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:24.000
And I've also been encouraged to
see more people writing memoirs.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.520
A lot of times people didn't think
that they had stories to tell

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.750
and that -- or you had
to have accomplished

01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:32.880
so much before you told a memoir.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.300
But we now see a lot
more people doing that.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.970
And encouraging children to write
stories too and write their books.

01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:41.170
So I'm encouraged to
see in school sometimes

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:43.180
where they've been buying
some of the books that some

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:48.040
of the students have and have
programs built around that.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.430
And also at Howard, in the
Department of Media Journalism

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:52.580
and Film, we tell stories there

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.920
in the various different forms
whether they're through journalism,

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.820
through audio, through television
production and also through film.

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:03.440
And Haile Gerima will
be here this afternoon.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:06.740
He's one of our esteemed filmmakers
and please support Sankofa,

01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:10.210
one of our remaining
bookstores in this area.

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:12.510
On that note, I will stop.

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:22.100
[ Applause ]

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:27.430
&gt;&gt; E. Ethelbert Miller: It's always
good now and then to assess a state

01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:30.260
of African American literature.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.600
What does this mean?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:38.040
First, it should mean a close
examination of all genres.

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.620
Second, it might consist of a
study of the work of writers

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:46.070
of significance, as well
as writers of applause.

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:47.740
By applause I mean those writers

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:51.520
who win mainstream
acceptance and awards.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.440 position:56%
Third, the state of African American
literature should also be evaluated

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.550
while taking into consideration
technological economic changes

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:01.760
within our society.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.490
These changes can have
a key influence

01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:09.550 position:56%
in determining how our literature is
produced, distributed and consumed.

01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:11.570
Four, if we could look at the
literature through the eyes

01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:15.480 position:56%
and works of literary critics,
whose work attempts to offer clarity

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:19.020
and understanding to the body of
work created by African Americans

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:22.650
at any specific time in history.

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:25.650
Finally, the state of African
American literature offered mirrors

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:27.700
[phonetic] to social
and political transition

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:31.530
and transformation of
global black culture.

01:06:31.530 --> 01:06:35.100
Let me for just a few minutes
present what is simply a probe

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:38.520
into the state of African
American poetry today.

01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.340 position:56%
Any study of African American poetry
begins with an acknowledgement

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:46.300
that there is always two streams,
one oral and the other written.

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.890
Now and then, they overlap creating
hybrid structures, as well as poets

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:53.940
who have diverse literary
portfolios and bodies of work.

01:06:53.940 --> 01:06:57.070
Spoken word, for example,
is very popular today.

01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:00.960
Its energy incurred by social
movements, changes in social media

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.430
and even urban gentrification
driven by the opening of new cafes.

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.980
Spoken word at time,
competitive in nature,

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:11.580
can be viewed as empowering
a young generation.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:14.730
A generation coming over age
during the occupied movement,

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:18.770 position:56%
the rise of police brutality,
income and equality, power of spring

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:23.380
and the growing [inaudible] of
radical Islam, drones and hashtags.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:29.020
If black lives matter in
2015, so does black poetry.

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.710
Yet, I would underscore that
the most important development

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:33.280
responsible for the changing state

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.600
of African American poetry is
the organization Cave Canem.

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.680
In 2015, we probably have
more African American poets

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.290
than ever before in our history.

01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:45.180
The same way we have
more photograph --

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:47.970
photographers because
of cell phones.

01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:51.800
Maybe the cell phone and iPod
is the reason for so many poets.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.820
Consider how this poem
by jazz poet, Ted Joans,

01:07:54.820 --> 01:08:00.500
takes on a different meaning
because of our technology.

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:10.810
<i>The Truth </i>-- "If you should see a
man walking down a crowded street,

01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:19.170
talking aloud to himself, don't
run in the opposite direction,

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:24.770
but run toward him,
for he is a poet.

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:31.060
You have nothing to fear
from the poet but the truth."

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:35.770 position:56%
There's a good chance someone
walking towards you talking aloud is

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:37.990
talking on a cell phone.

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:40.690 position:56%
The question we should ask ourselves
is whether we should ignore

01:08:40.690 --> 01:08:42.290
this person.

01:08:42.290 --> 01:08:45.580
What are the social
implications if we do?

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:48.850
We could also ask,
where are the poets?

01:08:48.850 --> 01:08:51.370
It's just a matter of time
before someone fascinated

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:53.260
with numbers issues a report

01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:55.360
of how many young people
are doing spoken word

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.440
on a given block or subway car.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.220
Like money ball and baseball,

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:04.150 position:56%
the state of African American poetry
has given voice to the voiceless.

01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:06.840
So many numbers to consider.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.680
If everyone is reciting
poetry, is everyone a poet?

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.610
Today there's an unregulated
freedom of expression,

01:09:14.610 --> 01:09:16.440
which mirrors the internet.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.400
What we are now witnessing might
be the true poetry of the people.

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.630
Where poet and critic, Larry Neal,
once pondered the possibility

01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:27.840
of black poets being as
popular as James Brown,

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.800
today common might be
just common to all of us.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:37.120 position:56%
Meanwhile, what cannot be overlooked
is the impact the organization Cave

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.160
Canem has had.

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.690
This organization founded
by Toi Derricotte

01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:46.570
and Cornelius Eady might
best be compared to NASA.

01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:50.030
Instead of training astronauts
for space, Cave Canem is helping

01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:52.520
to create literary stars.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.910
Started in 1996, Cave Canem's
mission was to be a home

01:09:56.910 --> 01:10:00.220
for the many voices of African
American poetry and it's committed

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:04.450
to cultivating their artistic
and professional growth.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:09.090
Still, how does Cave Canem affect
the state of black literature?

01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:12.330
Never before have we
systematically attempted to educate

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:15.680
and train African American poets.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.420
We have a new generation
of African American poets

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:21.550
who are now teachers
of creative writing.

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:25.850
To some degree, we have started
to workshop the black experience

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:30.900
and place a heavy emphasis back
on the craft of making a poem.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:34.980 position:56%
I think Cave Canem has three tiers
consisting of first, faculty members

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:37.370
and workshop leaders, poets --

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:40.670
poets currently accepting and
participating in the workshops

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:43.370
and a strong politically
active network of graduates

01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:47.910 position:56%
who maintain creative and social
ties despite geographical separation

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.790
and distance.

01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:53.850
Pick up any number of new books
published by African American poets

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:57.270
by well-known publishers and one
will notice quite often a reference

01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:00.860
to Cave Canem in the
author's bio note.

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:03.290
If one visits the Cave
Canem website,

01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:05.820
simply examine selected
milestones which consist

01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:08.830
of the achievements
of Cave Canem faculty.

01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:13.190
Names mentioned are Elizabeth
Alexander, Terrance Hayes,

01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:17.960
Nikky Finney, Tracy Smith
and Natasha Trethewey.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.500
The arms of Cave Canem
is so outreaching

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:26.040
that even E. Ethelbert Miller is
listed as the honorary director.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:28.620
One thing which Cave Canem has
done, which is very important,

01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.630
is a creation of its
legacy conversations.

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:36.190 position:56%
This archive helps to document an
overview of African American poetry.

01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:39.560
In 2004, Elizabeth
Alexander interviewed --

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.290
interviewed Haki Madhubuti.

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:44.790
In 2006, I sat down with Alexander.

01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:46.090
This type of documentation

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:47.700
of African American
poetry has altered --

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.950
undertaken by Dr. Joanne
Gabbin, the founder and director

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:54.270
of Furious Flower at
James Madison University.

01:11:54.270 --> 01:11:57.880 position:56%
Gabbin's Furious Flower Conference
is another event that once you study

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.590
in order to evaluate the state
of African American poetry.

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:04.390
Last year there was a major
gathering of African American poets

01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:07.220
at Madison under the
title "Seeding the Future

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:10.120
of African American Poetry."

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.920
From Furious Flower to Cave
Canem, to [inaudible] Magazine.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.020
The literature edition of
Afro-American poetry needs

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.150
to be critically examined.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:19.690
Too often, for example,
and [inaudible]

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:23.820
that exclude as much
as they include.

01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:25.390
In the future, we should
be suspicious

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:28.660
of [inaudible] collections that
attempt to define the state

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:30.710
of African American poetry.

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:32.740
A good example of this
might be the book,

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:36.330
<i>Angles of Ascent </i>edited
by Charles Rowell.

01:12:36.330 --> 01:12:39.330
If there's one thing I've learned
over the last four decades is

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:42.500
that literary politics
is alive and well.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.530
If we honor who we are, then
we will never be post-racial.

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:49.790
The mirror -- mirror reminds
us of history's horrors.

01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:53.510
We only need to look out the window
to know our struggle continues.

01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:57.830 position:56%
Everywhere we live, not suffocating,
but breathing, our beauty residing

01:12:57.830 --> 01:13:02.940
in our blackness, everlasting
or shall we simply say, eternal.

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:11.580
[ Applause ]

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:14.400
&gt;&gt; Enjoyed the comments
of each of you.

01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.910
So I have a question.

01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:21.100
I work on the campus of the
Historically Black College.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:25.890
And I would like to spearhead
an initiative to get books

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:28.850
in the hands of each
of our students.

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:32.140
And I'm wondering if
you have any suggestions

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.290
on how I can go about doing that.

01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:38.260
I thought about maybe trying
to do a book festival,

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:41.300
but our students can't even
afford their textbooks.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:46.290
A lot of them are not
in the habit of reading.

01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:49.410
So, I don't know if
it's practical to try

01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:50.710
to make books available for sale.

01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:54.430
But I guess I'll just
leave it at that.

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.400
That's the essential question.

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.050
Thank you.

01:13:59.050 --> 01:14:00.350
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti:
The Third World Press,

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:06.300
we have a [inaudible]
program, anybody incarcerated

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:09.880 position:56%
in the country can write us a letter

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.070
and we will send them
free books [inaudible].

01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:16.790
For libraries and especially
[inaudible] talking

01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:20.330
about College University,
if you write us,

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:30.400
we will send you all the books
that have been published,

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.700
to your library [inaudible].

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:40.140
For your students, we would donate
-- how many students do you have?

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:44.270
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] last
spring was about 1500.

01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:47.920
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: Okay, I
can't do that [laughter].

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:58.400
We can send you as a donation, say
50 copies of -- of [inaudible] --

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:03.150
www.thirdworldpressbooks.com.

01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:05.930
&gt;&gt; Yanick Rice-Lamb: I think I --

01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:07.580
I might have some books I
can donate to you as well.

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:11.150
But I think that's one of the keys
is getting people to donate books.

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:14.860
And I know that when I worked
on Althea Gibson's biography,

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:18.200
there was someone who wanted
donate books to a school

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:23.030 position:56%
and they had approached [inaudible]
books when it was around and they --

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:24.610
they ended up donating our book.

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:28.010
And so, then I also went to the
schools to speak to the students

01:15:28.010 --> 01:15:31.280
about reading and about
the book that I worked on.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.760
So that's -- that's one thing
and I know our freshman class,

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.780
they choose a common
text for them to read.

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.190
They read -- a couple years
ago, they read <i>The Warmth</i>

01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:42.740
<i>of Other Suns </i>by Isabel Wilkerson.

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:44.880
And I'm not sure if all the
students purchased that book

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.810
or if they were donated as well.

01:15:46.810 --> 01:15:49.750
And she came later to speak and
they were able to interact with her

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:52.730
and that helped to bring it
home to them a little bit.

01:15:52.730 --> 01:15:55.290
But I think it is important,
the other thing about --

01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:59.290
when we talked about reading to
children, students and young people

01:15:59.290 --> 01:16:03.040
who read for pleasure also
do better in -- in school.

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:06.170
So we have to encourage them to
do it on their own for pleasure,

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:07.790
you know, so [inaudible]
encourage that.

01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:11.930
&gt;&gt; E. Ethelbert Miller: I could
answer this on a number of levels.

01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:14.610
First in terms of --
on my first level,

01:16:14.610 --> 01:16:18.960
I've been over the last few
years, creating what I call

01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:24.690 position:56%
"eBoxes" giving parts of my personal
collection to writers that identify,

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:26.550
who have a lot of potential.

01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:29.480
I say that because I see books
as sort of like a sacred gift,

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:33.040
passing it on, as opposed to
sometimes just putting books

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.740
out in a box and hoping somebody
comes by and picks it up.

01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:37.610 position:56%
What I try to do is customize the --

01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:39.620
the selection from my
own personal collection

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.570 position:56%
to the interest of the writer, okay.

01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:46.150
So, for example, Giovanni Singleton
was a poet out in California.

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:48.460
Knowing that she was a Buddhist,
I gave her a lot of books

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:50.680
that were dealing with
Buddhism and spirituality.

01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.370
So I -- I got books out of my house

01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:54.920
that I know were going
into good hands.

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:57.660
When we deal with glass schools, I
think the first thing that we have

01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:00.100
to be concerned about it
is preservation, okay.

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:03.600
You know, I was at Howard
University for 40 years.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:06.320
Now that I'm not at Howard
University, I can speak openly.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.730
What I would be concerned
about is -- is a preservation.

01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:12.030
And -- and this is a challenge

01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:14.080
to the people outside Howard
University, is that we have

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.050
to make sure that money
is raised, you know,

01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:19.460
to protect the libraries, okay.

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:23.810
I've always looked at historic
glass schools as living organisms

01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:27.170
where you would look at
the library as the heart.

01:17:27.170 --> 01:17:30.090
And I say that, especially to
African Americans because of

01:17:30.090 --> 01:17:33.410
if the library is our heart, just
look at the problems that we have

01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:35.840
with our heart, everything
in terms of heath matters,

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.070
as well as the blues, in
terms of broken heart.

01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:40.020
So we don't take care of our heart.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:41.920
Consequently, we don't
take care of our libraries

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.390
at historic glass schools.

01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:45.590
Many of them are overheated
for some sort of reason I would

01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:49.520
like to examine, you know, why
are many libraries overheated?

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:51.560
Okay. Which means that
some of these books

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.150 position:56%
after awhile are just falling apart.

01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:57.510 position:56%
At the same time on this last note,
we have to look at the changing fact

01:17:57.510 --> 01:18:00.520
of we are living in
terms of the book itself.

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:03.940
Okay? At one time, I was a strong
advocate of personal library,

01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:07.590
but we know now today that people
don't collect the books the same

01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:08.890
way, they download them.

01:18:08.890 --> 01:18:10.940
And we have to look at
it in terms of that way.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.330
But I think looking at,
you know, Charleston,

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:16.870
and looking at the history
about that one institution,

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:18.930
we have to look at books
that need to be passed

01:18:18.930 --> 01:18:20.920
down to throughout
our family, you know?

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.470
As a writer, I'm concerned about
the fact that in my household,

01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:27.820
my kids look at my book collection
and ask, "How much is that?"

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:30.400
Not necessarily in terms of
reading the book and passing

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.720
on the knowledge, but, "Oh,
this book might be expensive

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:35.070
because Ethelbert had
this signed by so and so."

01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:37.950
And so, they see it
as a commodity, okay.

01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:40.580 position:56%
And this has a lot to do with how we
see African American culture today.

01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:43.950
We sell it as a [inaudible],
you know, how important is it?

01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:47.220 position:56%
Going back to like the piano lessons
in August Wilson's play, you know,

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:49.730
you sell it to somebody,
you keep it in the family.

01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:53.280
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti:
[Inaudible] I just want to add

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:56.180
to what Ethelbert stated.

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:02.240
I taught at Howard, Morgan State --

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:11.400
I spent 26 years at
Chicago State University.

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:18.780
I taught at research
ones and so forth.

01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:23.520
To my black universities
and colleges,

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.370
the real problem is leadership.

01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:27.970
These boards are atrocious.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:33.290
I'm not serious [inaudible]
that Tuskegee,

01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:40.060
I was there for three days and, you
know, it's just -- it's horrible.

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:45.060
Now we do not have enough funds
in terms of monies coming in,

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:47.270
but the leadership
for the most part,

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:48.570 position:56%
do not see the library as the heart.

01:19:48.570 --> 01:19:52.420
And if you work in there, you
can't say anything, you know,

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:53.720
whether you're [inaudible] or not.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.020
But the -- the management
of black historic

01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.320
and black college universities
for the most part,

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.620
I would say are the -- are the --

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:58.920
the 100 or so that exist,
maybe 15 are doing well.

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.220
And those 15 that are doing well,

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:01.520
they still have serious
trouble, you know?

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.820
But with faculty members
like yourself,

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.120
there's always hope, you see.

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:07.670
And just see me afterwards, I'll
follow through on what I promised.

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:08.970
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:10.270
&gt;&gt; Sibyl E. Moses:
Before the next question,

01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:12.030
we would like to take
this opportunity

01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:13.740
to build upon what was said,

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:16.600
especially in the area
of preservation.

01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:20.920
As we move into this new age

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:24.560
that we are currently in,
the issue is preserving.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.510
How are we preserving the
writings, the stories of those

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:31.730
of us who create on the web?

01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:34.620
Those of us who, what we call,

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:36.580
create these born digital
collections

01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:40.630
where there are no
print volumes available.

01:20:40.630 --> 01:20:44.070
How do we even know
that they're there?

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:47.870
So, one of the tasks before
us is to begin thinking

01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:52.740
about how can we create a
mechanism to get control?

01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:55.020
And that's not a negative word,

01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:58.460
but control meaning to
be able to discover.

01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:02.600
To be able to discover what is out
there so that we can read and --

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.300
and preserve that information.

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.090
So that -- that is a big issue.

01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:08.130
One of the things that
we're doing at the Library

01:21:08.130 --> 01:21:12.550
of Congress is web archiving,
archiving various websites,

01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:14.750
archiving blogs, etcetera.

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:18.890 position:56%
And this again, is something for the
agenda of our black institutions,

01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:24.140
to begin archiving much of
this digital information.

01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:29.660
I'm turning here because we
cannot carry on this conversation

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:33.200
with black publishers, and
bloggers, and black literature

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:37.070
without mentioning or evoking
the name of Dudley Randall

01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:41.840
and so many others that have
really set the stage for us

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.960
and on whom's the shoulders
we stand.

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:50.170
We cannot leave here, leave this
panel without evoking the name

01:21:50.170 --> 01:21:55.190
of Monroe Nathan Work and when you
mentioned Tuskegee, this is the man

01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:59.600 position:56%
who enabled us to know who the black
writers are all over the world,

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:01.470
not just African American writers,

01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:03.280
but black writers all
over the world.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.560 position:56%
And so, as we have this
conversation, please let us include.

01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.860
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: Yeah.

01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:11.160
Dudley Randall [inaudible].

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:14.040
I'm here because of -- in part
because of Dudley Randall.

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.340
The people that mention me

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:22.150
as a young boy were el-Hajj Malik
el-Shabazz, Malcolm X. Margaret

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:24.500
and Charlie Burroughs, who
founded DuSable Museum,

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:28.040
was the first black person
in the country -- in Chicago.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.280
Dudley Randall, who's
the publisher --

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.520
poet and publisher
of Broadside Press.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:34.820
&gt;&gt; And librarian.

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:36.120
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: And librarian.

01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.080
And he used all his money from,
you know, being a librarian

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:41.050
and he was my first publisher.

01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:46.160
I published my first book myself,
which was <i>Think Black </i>in 1966

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.650
and then 1967, 1968 --

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:52.380
at '68, Dudley Randall
published <i>Black Pride </i>.

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.560
I met Dudley Randall after Malcolm
had been assassinated -- well,

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.090
let me just mention
these other three mentors

01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:57.790
because I can't go without them.

01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:02.860
Hoyt W. Fuller, who was the editor

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.700
of <i>Negro Digest Black
World Magazine </i>,

01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:09.420
which was a major magazine
to document that whole period

01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:13.080
between the late 1960's
and up to 1975.

01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.800
And then, of course,
Barbara Sizemore.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.930 position:56%
Barbara Sizemore was -- Dr. Sizemore
was the first black superintendent

01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:25.060
here in Washington D.C. Of
course, she didn't last too long

01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:27.850
because of her love
of black children.

01:23:27.850 --> 01:23:29.540
Then of course, finally the person

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:34.080
that essentially mentioned me
the longest was Gwendolyn Brooks,

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.480
for 33 years, part of the family.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.780
But Dudley Randall and --

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:40.110
and Gwendolyn Brooks
were very [inaudible].

01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:42.970
In fact, when -- when -- when
Gwendolyn Brooks left Harper

01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:45.470
and Row, she went to
Broadside Press.

01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:47.520
Broadside Press published her
first book of poetry back --

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:51.400
I think it was 1969,
which was <i>Riot </i>.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:54.120
And -- but finally, this is --

01:23:54.120 --> 01:24:00.080
the reason I got into building
independent black institutions is

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:04.440
because of Margaret
Burroughs and Dudley Randall.

01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.600
So I'm at the -- I'm in the army,

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.250
I'm in the United States
Army going crazy, all right,

01:24:09.250 --> 01:24:11.270
reading all this black literature.

01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:14.720
And, you know, nobody to
talk to, you mentioned black,

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.460
you look like you had lost
your damn mind, all right.

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:20.220
And so, I found my way
into Chicago at the --

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:23.740
at that time, it was the
Ebony Museum of Negro History.

01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:26.800 position:56%
Ebony Magazine sued them so they had
to change the name from Ebony and go

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.060
to DuSable Museum of
African American history.

01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:34.610
I walked in that morning in
1962 and Margaret Burrows was

01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:37.040
in the kitchen working
on a linoleum cut.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.670
I didn't know what a linoleum --

01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:41.690
she's a world-class
visual artist, okay.

01:24:41.690 --> 01:24:43.700
I walked up there and I, you know,
I [inaudible] looked natural,

01:24:43.700 --> 01:24:46.040
I was in the army -- say,
"What you want, boy?"

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.090
I said, "I need to talk
to somebody, all right."

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:53.370
And, you know, I'm -- I'm about
20 years old, 19-20 years old.

01:24:53.370 --> 01:24:55.310
"Go upstairs and talk
to my husband."

01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:57.360
I go upstairs, they got
this world class library

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.660
in their home, all right.

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.360
He sitting at the table writing

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.660
and [inaudible] glass
of water down there.

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:03.960
He said -- he said,
"How you doing, son?"

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.260
I say, "Well, I just need
to talk to somebody."

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:06.560
He says, "Sit down.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.860
Do you want something to drink?"

01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:09.480
I said, "I'll take some water."

01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.760
He said, "That's vodka,"
you know [laughter].

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.660
Charlie Burrows had been reared

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:18.340
in the U.S.S.R. The guy spoke
Russian fluently, all right.

01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:20.870
So he was the first
person that introduced me

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:22.520
to [inaudible] literature,
etcetera, etcetera.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:26.280
Anyway, when Malcolm was
assassinated, Dudley Randall came

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.150
to Chicago to talk to Margaret
Burroughs about co-editing a book

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:32.650
on the life and legacy
of Malcolm X, all right.

01:25:32.650 --> 01:25:35.750
And so, I gave my first
poem and he --

01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:39.070
and then I gave my manuscript
to <i>Black Pride </i>, he --

01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:41.600
I said, "Will you please
consider this?"

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.650
He called me back in a
week and said, "Yeah,

01:25:43.650 --> 01:25:45.390
you know, I -- I'll publish this."

01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:48.550
He said, "But would you allow
me to write the introduction?"

01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:51.300
And that was for me, you
know, the biggest thing.

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:55.700
Now, the museum started in their
home, the DuSable Museum started

01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:57.510
in the home of Margaret
Burroughs and Charlie Burroughs

01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:01.360
and Broadside Press
was in his home, okay.

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.080
And so, both the museum and
Broadside Press was really funded

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:08.850
by their monies, the monies that
came out of their pocket, okay.

01:26:08.850 --> 01:26:11.210
And so, when I went to
Detroit to sign a contract,

01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:15.680
which I didn't sign, I just shook
his hand and said, "I got this.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.150
I got this."

01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:18.450
That's it.

01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:19.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:21.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: Beautiful people.

01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:25.300
[ Applause ]

01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:26.960
&gt;&gt; E. Ethelbert Miller: I'll
just mention one other name.

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.690
That would be Naomi Long
Madgett, also from Detroit.

01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:30.990
And she was --

01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:32.290
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: Oh yeah,
Naomi, yeah, Lotus Press.

01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:33.590
&gt;&gt; E. Ethelbert Miller: --
the Lotus Press after --

01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:36.820
after [inaudible] and
The Third World.

01:26:38.340 --> 01:26:40.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: In fact, she was
my second publisher [laughter], I --

01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:42.060
you know what I'm saying.

01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:46.510
Naomi Long Madgett, who is a fine
poet also [inaudible] all poets,

01:26:46.510 --> 01:26:47.810
Ethelbert.

01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:51.970
And, you know, she called me and
said [inaudible] about a book.

01:26:51.970 --> 01:26:54.330
And, you know, so I
said obviously yes.

01:26:54.330 --> 01:26:56.510
And so, she -- she's still alive.

01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:58.850
Dudley is not with us anymore, of
course, Gwendolyn Brooks is not

01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:00.800
with us anymore, nor
Margaret Burroughs.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.650
So Naomi Long Madgett, she's in her
-- can you tell, I don't know --

01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:04.950
&gt;&gt; E. Ethelbert Miller:
Ninety-nine, she's about 99.

01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:06.250
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: -- she's
about [inaudible] 90's.

01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:08.750
But what happened, Ethelbert,

01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:11.000
Broadside Press is
still functioning,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.830
but not in a very high level.

01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:15.930
So Broadside Press and Lotus
Press have combined, okay,

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:21.340
to try to keep both
of the press's going.

01:27:21.340 --> 01:27:22.740
&gt;&gt; Yanick Rice-Lamb: Some of the
people who influenced me are some

01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.590
of the people that
influenced a lot of people.

01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:27.710
Like James Baldwin, I read a
lot of his books growing up.

01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:32.290
And then being from -- I'm from
Akron, Ohio, so Toni Morrison

01:27:32.290 --> 01:27:35.560
because she's close by and she
always made references to things

01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.530
in Ohio, so my sister
and I always got excited

01:27:37.530 --> 01:27:39.980
when we saw those references
in her books.

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:43.870
Rita Dove is also from Akron, Ohio,
went to the same high school I went

01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:46.450
to -- I graduated with
her younger sister.

01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:51.240
And she was -- she's a poet, and
I sat in her class, the Pulitzer.

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:55.520
And then -- then a number
of journalists that I have -

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.940
I have met over the years
and -- and poets, authors,

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.420
all sorts of writers, screenwriters

01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:06.530
that I've met who have
influenced me.

01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:10.630
Her question, she's -- she said,
she was asking about discerning

01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:13.850
between blogs that give you
good information and blogs

01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:16.950
that don't give you good
information in a nutshell.

01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:20.490
And I wanted to point out, Ingrid
Sturgis, she's standing back there.

01:28:20.490 --> 01:28:21.930
She's also from Howard University,

01:28:21.930 --> 01:28:23.580
but she teaches digital
media literacy.

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:26.230
If any of you want to
grab her afterwards,

01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:28.770
but one of the things
we're trying to do is

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:31.970
to help students understand all
the things that are out there

01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:35.050
in the digital world and --
and what's good and what isn't.

01:28:35.050 --> 01:28:37.380
And to -- we all have to
be discerning about that.

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:41.560
Sometimes when we're looking
at information, if someone --

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.810
is their [inaudible], is
their opinion, in a --

01:28:43.810 --> 01:28:46.310
and sometimes it's
incorrect and unfortunately,

01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:49.890
the corrections take a long
time to catch up with the truth.

01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:53.010
One of the things we're
starting also at Howard,

01:28:53.010 --> 01:28:56.350 position:56%
working title right now is HU
Insight, but we may change the name.

01:28:56.350 --> 01:29:01.900
But we are starting kind of a
truth squad or a verification --

01:29:01.900 --> 01:29:05.470
verify information, myths,
stereotypes, false statements

01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:08.950
that are made about us and even
things that have persisted,

01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:10.380
you know, for a long time.

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:12.560
So we could say, you
know, what's true

01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.040
and what isn't true
and do it in real time.

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:17.310
And there's some site like,
called PolitiFact that does it

01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:19.560
for politics, but we want
to do it across the board

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.600 position:56%
because as it affects people of
color because there's so many things

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.620
that are said about us
that are completely false,

01:29:25.620 --> 01:29:27.150
or partially false, or whatever.

01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:31.120
We want to address that, but
I encourage you to call people

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.850
on it when, you know, when you're
reading blogs or reading, you know,

01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:38.160 position:56%
whether it's mainstream media, or
whether it's a one person situation,

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:41.710 position:56%
you know -- call them on it when you
see errors and when you see untruths

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:44.080
that are out there because we
really do need to stop that.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:47.250
Because a lot of times people take
that information as fact and a lot

01:29:47.250 --> 01:29:50.420
of people don't do their homework
or they rip off information

01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:52.980
from someone else and if that
person has false information

01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:55.410
or has made a mistake,
they just keep repeating it

01:29:55.410 --> 01:29:56.710
and perpetuating it.

01:29:56.710 --> 01:30:00.600
And with social media, a lot
of that information goes viral.

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:03.740
And, you know, one of the
things that I'm committed to,

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:07.510
which is one reason why I teach,
is to, you know, encourage

01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:11.900
and train young people to tell
the truth, to do the homework,

01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:13.990
to get out in the community,
to go to places

01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:16.840
that aren't being covered
to tell our stories.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.290
And I'm thankful to Ethelbert
because a lot of times I say,

01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:21.070
"You know Ethelbert Miller,
you should go talk to him."

01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:22.460
And he always, you
know, talks to them

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:24.270
and gives them great information.

01:30:24.270 --> 01:30:27.560
But it's really important
that we do that because we

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:31.060
so often allow stories that they
aren't being told period about us

01:30:31.060 --> 01:30:32.540
and they're told in the wrong way.

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:36.530
But there's a lot of bloggers and
there's a proliferation of bloggers

01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:38.850
and they definitely are
not all created equally,

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:41.900
so you have t kind of, you
know, watch what you're reading

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:45.260
or what you're consuming, so that
you're consuming good information.

01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:47.900
&gt;&gt; E. Ethelbert Miller: Yeah,

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:52.310
I've been actually blogging
every single day since 2004.

01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:57.890
And I look at how I use blogging
to move into other forms of media.

01:30:57.890 --> 01:31:00.140
So if you look at what I
did a couple years ago,

01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:02.930
I created E channel,
which was a blog.

01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:06.550
And I interviewed the
novelist, Charles Johnson,

01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:08.710 position:56%
every single day for an entire year.

01:31:08.710 --> 01:31:12.660
That is not a book that came
out in January, 672 pages.

01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.520
It's one of the most --

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.550
most comprehensive thing about
Charles Johnson and, you know,

01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:20.950 position:56%
this year is the 25th anniversary of
his key book, the <i>Middle Passage </i>.

01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:24.930
But I used to blog in such
a way that was like a tool

01:31:24.930 --> 01:31:26.680
and -- and to help people.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:30.750
If you look at my -- another
thing I'm doing right now,

01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:35.120
the critic Aldon Nielsen --
interviewing him pretty much four

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:37.950
or five times a month trying
to look at the development

01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:39.830
of a literary critic, okay.

01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:45.260
So I'm using the blog as a way
to interact with other, you know,

01:31:45.260 --> 01:31:47.680
media the same way you go
back to Marshall McLuhan.

01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.780
McLuhan always felt that
print was the key [inaudible].

01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:55.250
So my thing is that if I can
control the print, you know, and --

01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:57.750
and have things come out of
that, then that would be a way

01:31:57.750 --> 01:32:00.160
of staying a breast with the
technology where we don't see it

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:02.110
as either or, but connected.

01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:06.140
So when I look at how the E channel
became a book, I realized, okay,

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:08.440 position:56%
these things are not separate, okay.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.910
I can just reach more people, okay.

01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:14.940
But the thing I found out with the
blog when I was doing the E channel

01:32:14.940 --> 01:32:18.090 position:56%
with Charles Johnson, I was happy I
was interacting with Charles Johnson

01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:19.780
because he's a perfectionist.

01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.030
And if -- and the thing about
bloggers, blogs have a tendency

01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:23.880
to be very sloppy and --
and that's the difference

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:25.410
between blogs and journalists.

01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:27.810
Charles just would not
let me post anything

01:32:27.810 --> 01:32:30.560
if there was a period
of comma out of place.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:33.350
And I -- and I had to reformat the
whole thing because he said, "Oh,

01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:35.130
no, you're not going
to put that out there."

01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:36.500
But what I realized is --

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:40.280 position:56%
it was that he was dealing with
this project in such a way, he said,

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:42.220
"Okay, this is extremely important.

01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:44.000
This is literary history
that's being made."

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.320
And every now and then, I would be
joking around and whatever, and --

01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.610
and he said, "Yo, but
this is serious," okay.

01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:51.110
The other thing about the blogging

01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:53.320
and the technology is
how it makes the --

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.830
the black world smaller, okay.

01:32:55.830 --> 01:33:00.220 position:56%
And that is -- I would not have been
able to do this if Charles was not

01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:01.930
in Seattle and I was here.

01:33:01.930 --> 01:33:03.840
And the time thing
helped us to be connected.

01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:07.260
And I say that now in terms of when
we talk about the literary world.

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:10.050
We have to be international.

01:33:10.050 --> 01:33:13.340
We have to be supportive, you
know, whenever there's crisis,

01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.220
we are the survivors, okay.

01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:16.520
That's the key thing in writers.

01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.240
Something happens during
the world [inaudible].

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:26.990
We have to be responsible to that
and we have to use the technology.

01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:29.030
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: Actually,
repeating the question,

01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:36.030
she is concerned about the
reading level of [inaudible].

01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:42.780
And actually we have
a house [inaudible]

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:45.900
in that area [inaudible].

01:33:47.030 --> 01:33:57.510
And if I can [inaudible] ask Dr.
Carol Lee to come forward please.

01:33:57.510 --> 01:34:00.200
Can you come up here to speak?

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:03.650 position:56%
She doesn't want to come [laughter].

01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:07.740
My wife is -- is -- she --
she's really -- she's an --

01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:13.350
she's one of the living
experts in [inaudible].

01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:14.650
A former [inaudible].

01:34:14.650 --> 01:34:19.380 position:56%
But she's very modest and that's why
she married me, so she [inaudible].

01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:22.690
But she would, "Baby, come up
here for a minute [inaudible]?

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:24.510
Everybody encourage
her to come up --

01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:33.440
[ Applause ]

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:36.840
&gt;&gt; The challenge us not
unique to black boys.

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.140
I think they're two things.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:40.230
One is that the challenges
that we have to --

01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:44.120
that we have an education,
we need to understand

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:51.040 position:56%
in an international context and
that is the things that we try to do

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:54.220
to impact education
in the United States.

01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:56.930
No other high achieving
nation in the world does any

01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:59.160
of the things that we do.

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:04.140 position:56%
So, politically and this -- it seems
to me, we need to be advocating.

01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:08.980
We don't have an infrastructure --
so part of what I'm trying to do is

01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:12.810
to say that the challenges that our
children have in school relative

01:35:12.810 --> 01:35:16.080
to reading is part of a bigger
challenge in the country at large.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:18.730
So if you look at national
educate [inaudible] --

01:35:18.730 --> 01:35:22.180
and national assessment
of educational progress,

01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:24.890
which is the only national
assessment that we have.

01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:29.810 position:56%
And you look at the growth over the
years, for example, of 17 year olds,

01:35:29.810 --> 01:35:33.150
there's no growth at
all, for decades, right.

01:35:33.150 --> 01:35:40.710
So, the challenges our kids
face are extreme exacerbations

01:35:40.710 --> 01:35:42.290
of a bigger problem.

01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:49.040
We don't have -- we don't have
strong capacity in our schools

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.080
for supporting most
kids, but particularly

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:54.400
for not supporting black kids.

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:59.490
So I think that while we
struggle in terms of policies,

01:35:59.490 --> 01:36:01.770
certainly being here in D.C.,

01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:05.170
we have to equally
struggle within communities.

01:36:05.170 --> 01:36:07.960
And to have what Haki and I
have talked about for years,

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:11.700
what we call liberated
zones where we say some --

01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:15.060
to some degree, maybe something
like the Harlem Children's Zone,

01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:18.080
where we go neighborhood by
neighborhood and say that,

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:20.260
we are responsible
for the young people,

01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:23.440 position:56%
whether it's 10 square blocks or
what -- we are responsible for them.

01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.330 position:56%
And we're not going to depend solely
on public education to be the place

01:36:28.330 --> 01:36:30.130
to educate our kids [applause].

01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:33.230
And all kinds of communities
do that as well.

01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:35.890
And so, everything they talked
about in terms of, you know,

01:36:35.890 --> 01:36:39.130
working with kids, reading
kid -- well it's not --

01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:40.530
there's no magic to how to read --

01:36:40.530 --> 01:36:43.500
teach kids to read or
teach them to love to read.

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.280
We've all done that ourselves in
our own lives with our own kids.

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.790
It's just that we don't reach out,
we're dependent on other people

01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:54.540
to do this for us, as opposed
to saying, whether it's our own,

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:57.070
you know, extended family,
the kids on the block,

01:36:57.070 --> 01:36:59.930
the kids in our church, that
we're going to make sure

01:36:59.930 --> 01:37:01.740
because we know how to do
it, it's not rocket science.

01:37:01.740 --> 01:37:03.040
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti:
You know [applause],

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:08.930
what she didn't mention
was the professionalization

01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:13.740
of the whole area of
teacher's education.

01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:17.360
When you look at nations like
Finland or look at even Hong Kong,

01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.090 position:56%
that their teachers are paid as
much as doctors, MD's and physicians

01:37:22.090 --> 01:37:24.500
because essentially you cannot
become a teacher unless you're

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.480
from the top tier, all right.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:30.220 position:56%
And so therefore, their whole -- and
in Northern Europe, you find that --

01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:34.850
that education from preschool up to
graduate school is free, all right.

01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:37.230 position:56%
So these young people -- their young
people do not come out of college

01:37:37.230 --> 01:37:40.500
or university with thousands and
thousands of dollars of debt.

01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:44.120
In fact, the student debt in
this country is $1.3 trillion --

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:47.820
$1.3 trillion, that's a shame,
that's a crime, you see.

01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:51.110
And that started with
Ronald Regan in California.

01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:56.550
I don't need to get into
all politics [laughter].

01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:59.260
&gt;&gt; Sibyl E. Moses: Thank you
[applause] E. Ethelbert Miller,

01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:05.490 position:56%
Yanick Rice-Lamb and Haki Madhubuti,
we thank you and embrace you

01:38:05.490 --> 01:38:12.450
for really encouraging us, for
providing such an informative

01:38:12.450 --> 01:38:15.460
and provocative discussion.

01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:20.220
We've had an effort to
change the conversation

01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.670
and to begin defining
what is needed.

01:38:22.670 --> 01:38:29.220 position:56%
And so now we go forth and we create
our stories, create liberation zones

01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:35.520 position:56%
in our communities, develop writer's
workshops and what I focus on,

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:43.940 position:56%
biography workshops and begin to
capture so many more of the stories.

01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:48.380
In closing, I just want to say that
in terms of our black institutions,

01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:51.810
they offer opportunities for
us to begin capturing the lives

01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:55.440
of the people's -- people who
have built those institutions.

01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:58.670
I work with the Prince
Hall Freemasons and so many

01:38:58.670 --> 01:39:03.840
of those organizations throughout
the country, which have roots

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:08.630
in the late 1700's and the true
histories have not been written.

01:39:08.630 --> 01:39:11.360
The lives of those
people involved in --

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:15.290
in really, preserving
our culture and --

01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:18.030
and helping our people
have not been explored.

01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:21.200
So we encourage you to go
out into your communities

01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:24.850
and capture not only the lives
of you and your families,

01:39:24.850 --> 01:39:28.430
but also the lives of others
to help us preserve the word.

01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:30.730
Thank you [applause].

01:39:32.010 --> 01:39:34.480
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: My
name is Marieta Harper.

01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:39.700 position:56%
I'm an area specialist here in the
African and Middle Eastern Division.

01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:45.740
We're going to start with
the second panel called,

01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:48.610
Stakeholders of Black Literacy.

01:39:48.610 --> 01:39:56.720
I'm going to intro -- start
the panel with Betty Entzminger

01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:00.770
and fourth generation
native Washingtonian

01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:03.000
with our National Anthem.

01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:19.170
&gt;&gt; Lift every voice and sing,
till earth and Heaven ring,

01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:28.550
ring with the harmonies of liberty.

01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:30.070
Let our rejoicing rise,
high as the listening skies,

01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:42.460
let it resound loud
as the rolling sea.

01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:49.230
Sing a song full of the hope that
the dark past has brought us,

01:40:49.230 --> 01:41:00.680
sing a song full of the hope
that the present has taught us.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:19.870 position:56%
Facing the rising sun of our new day
begun, let us march on till victory,

01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:35.900 position:56%
let us march on till victory is won.

01:41:35.900 --> 01:42:04.510
It is won, it is won, it's won.

01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:13.610

01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:17.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marieta Harper: Our first speaker

01:42:17.190 --> 01:42:20.970
and panelist will be
Dr. Brenda Greene.

01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:25.360
[ Applause ]

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:27.100
&gt;&gt; Brenda Greene: Thank
you, thank you very much.

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:29.950
I'm really, really
pleased to be here.

01:42:29.950 --> 01:42:34.660
And I first give thanks to God
for continually blessing me

01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:39.450
and my family, for doing his
life's work and for placing me

01:42:39.450 --> 01:42:43.520 position:56%
in this moment, and time, and space.

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.720
It's really a privilege
and an honor to be here.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:50.520 position:56%
This is a legacy and historic event.

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:55.070
And I also want to thank
Maria Fenton for her vision

01:42:55.070 --> 01:43:02.190 position:56%
and her commitment to sponsoring the
Eleanor Holmes Juneteenth Festival.

01:43:02.190 --> 01:43:06.650
As Haki mentioned earlier, this
-- it took really a lot of work,

01:43:06.650 --> 01:43:09.030
a lot of time and a lot of passion.

01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:10.830
So I think you should
give her a hand.

01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:16.050
[ Applause ]

01:43:16.050 --> 01:43:18.110
Okay, I think what better way

01:43:18.110 --> 01:43:23.620
than to celebrate Juneteenth
then by celebrating literacy.

01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.820
And I think this day
and this test --

01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:31.830 position:56%
this program are also testament to
Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton,

01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:37.030
who also put her support
behind this program.

01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:38.440
She's an outstanding leader

01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:41.920
who embodies the whole
spirit of what Juneteenth is.

01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.670
A tireless advocate
for social justice,

01:43:44.670 --> 01:43:48.250
and women's rights, and liberty.

01:43:48.250 --> 01:43:54.670
And I also want to acknowledge my
colleagues in the audience, Eric --

01:43:54.670 --> 01:43:58.320
Eric White and Linda White, who
I've known for many, many years.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.700
It's really good to see you here.

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:03.930
And my colleague from Medgar
Evers College, Richard Jones.

01:44:03.930 --> 01:44:07.150
And of course, the writers
who are here, it's really,

01:44:07.150 --> 01:44:09.000
really a please --
pleasure to be here

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.560
with Haki and with Marieta Golden.

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:18.370
Maria Fenton asked me to speak
on the challenges and triumphs

01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:21.920
of literacy from my perspective
as a parent, a professor,

01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:25.750
an academic literary activist,
and a media professional.

01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:29.780
I smiled when I saw that, I said,
that must be related to the work

01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:33.520
that I do as the director of the
National Black Writers Conference

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:35.690
at Medgar Evers College."

01:44:35.690 --> 01:44:39.150
And I'm also executive director
of the Center for Black Literature

01:44:39.150 --> 01:44:40.960
at Medgar Evers College
and also chair

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:43.860
of the English department
at Medgar Evers College.

01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:47.350
So, I'm the mother of
two outstanding sons

01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:49.480
and a grandmother of four.

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:52.790
So I do have many,
many roles to play.

01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:57.980
And it's really a challenge to try
and reconcile all of those roles

01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.700
through my work at the school
in educating young people

01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:06.550
and teaching writing and
literature to college students,

01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:10.990
and teaching future teachers and
in educating the general public

01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:15.340
about the range and complexity of
the textbooks produced by writers

01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:17.580
from the African diaspora.

01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:20.330
And in supporting writers
through conferences,

01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:25.550
such as the National Black Writers
Conference, symposium, workshops,

01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:30.380
readings, and -- and publications,
it is really a challenge.

01:45:30.380 --> 01:45:34.380
In her anthology, I don't know how
many of you know Pamela Newkirk,

01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:36.970
wrote letters from black America.

01:45:36.970 --> 01:45:40.740
She's an award winning journalist
and editor of a wonderful book,

01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:44.130
also of love letters
called, <i>A Love No Less </i>.

01:45:44.130 --> 01:45:48.430
And most recently, this is a
book you should get, <i>Spectacle,</i>

01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:54.540
<i>The Astonishing Life of Ota Benga</i>
, who was an African man used

01:45:54.540 --> 01:46:02.140
as a human zoo exhibit at the
St. Louis World's Fair in 1904.

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:05.180
That book just came out
and it's an important book

01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:07.180
and it tells an important story.

01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:11.340
And it's part of what we're
doing in telling our stories.

01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:16.850
She writes in <i>Letters From Black
America </i>, despite their importance

01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:20.260
as historical markers
and as literature,

01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:22.940
the letters of African
Americans like so much

01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:29.750
of black history have historically
been undervalued or ignored.

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:33.130
Newkirk, she just decides
to correct this

01:46:33.130 --> 01:46:37.370
by presenting a multidimensional
portrait of African American life

01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:41.940 position:56%
from the 18th through the 21st
Century through illuminating letters

01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:46.860 position:56%
of ordinary and exceptional
African Americans enslaved and free,

01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:48.880
powerless and privileged.

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:52.830
In fact, one of her last letters
is a letter that Alice Walker wrote

01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:55.710 position:56%
to Barack Obama when he was elected.

01:46:55.710 --> 01:47:00.020
She has a letter from Toni
Morrison, when he was --

01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:02.700
when Barack Obama was nominated.

01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:07.820
But letters or the [inaudible]
narrative provide windows

01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:10.130
into our interior lives
and represent one

01:47:10.130 --> 01:47:12.680
of the first forays into literacy.

01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:15.860
Letter writing has
become a lost art form,

01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:21.060
so I decided that I would
celebrate and talk about literacy

01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:25.350
by writing a letter to you about
the triumphs and challenges

01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:26.650
of promoting literacy today.

01:47:26.650 --> 01:47:31.430
And so my beloved friends
and colleagues,

01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:35.370
the reading of literature has
always been very, very dear to me.

01:47:35.370 --> 01:47:39.190
I was also one of those people
who spend hours and hours

01:47:39.190 --> 01:47:46.510
in the library, and also recognized
that there were very few books

01:47:46.510 --> 01:47:49.440
that represented depictions of me.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:53.920
But I was interested in the story
and stories of famous people

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:57.850
and how historical figures
overcame obstacles, and mysteries,

01:47:57.850 --> 01:47:59.750
and friendships, and triumphs.

01:47:59.750 --> 01:48:04.390
I remember one book about a
little girl who faced racism

01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:07.900
and it's interesting that I can't
remember the name of that book,

01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:11.300
since that was the only one
I remember that depicted me.

01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:13.880
For some reason, I
blocked out the title.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.700
But books were my comfort,

01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:20.140
as my other colleagues have
said, my solace, my friends.

01:48:20.140 --> 01:48:23.720
Because they were a way
of reimagining my life.

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:27.980
And when I became a parent,
instilling a love and --

01:48:27.980 --> 01:48:30.690
of reading and writing
was very paramount to me.

01:48:30.690 --> 01:48:34.120
I was determined that my
children would be reading

01:48:34.120 --> 01:48:35.920
and writing before
they entered school.

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:38.440
In fact, I even thought
about homeschooling

01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:42.040
and opening my own school
because like so many people

01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.870
in my generation, I
was very disillusioned

01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:46.170
with the public school system.

01:48:46.170 --> 01:48:50.380
I had worked in a middle
school and elementary school

01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:54.200
and the students were
two years behind

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.040
in their reading at both levels.

01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:01.530 position:56%
And I viewed this as a tragedy and
determined to do something about it.

01:49:01.530 --> 01:49:04.860
So the first thing I did was when
I worked on my Master's Degree,

01:49:04.860 --> 01:49:08.210
I decided to get it in
the teaching of reading.

01:49:08.210 --> 01:49:12.110
And I did my Doctoral Degree
in the teaching of writing,

01:49:12.110 --> 01:49:15.260
so that I could really
become proficient in that.

01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:20.370 position:56%
And one of the things that I've
learned over the years as a educator

01:49:20.370 --> 01:49:25.950
for over four decades, is that
children come to reading processes

01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:29.100
at different stages
and in different ways.

01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.340
Everyone has their own journey.

01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:37.640
And what you have to do is to
surround students with language,

01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:42.780
with read -- opportunities to read
and write to them as we all know.

01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.590
And there was a book
that had an impact on me.

01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:49.650
It was a woman named Glenda
Bissex, who did her dissertation

01:49:49.650 --> 01:49:52.420
on her student's growth
into literacy.

01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.720
It's called <i>Gnys at Wrk </i>.

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:59.570
And she spelled genius
G-N-Y-S, <i>Gnys At Wrk </i>.

01:49:59.570 --> 01:50:08.240
She chronicled her son reading and
writing, and by the time he was

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:13.970
in late primary school he was
writing newsletters for his school.

01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:17.930
And I was concerned
that, as an educator,

01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:23.210
my son should have been reading
early, because I had a master's

01:50:23.210 --> 01:50:26.710
in reading and was doing my
doctoral work in reading.

01:50:26.710 --> 01:50:30.460
But I realized that there are
different ways of reading.

01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:35.240
One other thing, my son is a
hip-hop artist, Talib Kweli.

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:39.830
He began writing before
he was actually reading.

01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:45.240
He actually -- he loved telling
stories and he loved drawing.

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:48.390
So he would draw these books.

01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:51.640
And he -- I would give him
reams of computer paper

01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:53.350
and he would draw these pictures.

01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:58.110
And then, he would put captions
on the bottom of the pictures.

01:50:58.110 --> 01:51:02.090 position:56%
And so, he was writing picture books
before he was actually reading.

01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:05.050
He was doing that reading we
talked about earlier, you know,

01:51:05.050 --> 01:51:07.350
my son can read, but they
had memorized the text.

01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:08.650
We all know that.

01:51:08.650 --> 01:51:10.570
You know, children go
through that, right?

01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:18.380
So he actually also had a
special journey into reading,

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.580
and by the time he was
five years old, was writing

01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:26.800
and then producing shows about
books that he had written.

01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:29.770
Whenever there was a family
gathering he would take his --

01:51:29.770 --> 01:51:34.140
produce this show and get all
of his cousins together and put

01:51:34.140 --> 01:51:40.390 position:56%
on a production based on what he had
written and the characters he had.

01:51:40.390 --> 01:51:45.740
So my love of books and
reading really formed the seeds

01:51:45.740 --> 01:51:51.070
of literary activism, which
always attribute that to my friend

01:51:51.070 --> 01:51:54.260
and colleague, E. Ethelbert
Miller, who calls --

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:56.450
said, "I'm a literary activist."

01:51:56.450 --> 01:51:58.000
I also am a literary activist.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.450
And when I was student teaching,

01:51:59.450 --> 01:52:03.660
I worked in an alternative
school with reluctant readers.

01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:09.440
And one young man who was reading
years below on the school level,

01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:13.240
never writing, I said,
"Well, I'm going to make sure

01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:16.360
and get you -- motivate
you to write."

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.320
And so, he loved music.

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:20.140
He played the guitar.

01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:22.610
So we went to a guitar
store and he got --

01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:24.870
I got him to buy books

01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:27.940
that represented lyrics
of songs he wrote.

01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:31.070
And then, he would come
back and that was his way.

01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:36.350
By the time the program
was over, he was writing.

01:52:36.350 --> 01:52:41.770
In my work as executive director
of the Center for Black Literature,

01:52:41.770 --> 01:52:44.710
we have a program called
Re-Envisioning Our Lives

01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:46.010
Through Literature.

01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.250
We go into the public schools --

01:52:48.250 --> 01:52:51.720
we bring teaching artists into the
public schools, in middle schools

01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:54.500
and high schools, sometimes
elementary schools.

01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:57.150
And we work with students
on creating --

01:52:57.150 --> 01:52:59.980
giving them opportunities
to create stories,

01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:04.700
to create poetry, to create skits.

01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:06.290
They create and anthology.

01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:09.140
In fact, I have one here
that they just finished

01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:11.640
and it's based on "Roll Call."

01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:14.210
When we give them a
book, and we used --

01:53:14.210 --> 01:53:16.330
we've been using "Roll Call"
for the last few years.

01:53:16.330 --> 01:53:18.400
Hakeem Abuhti, [phonetic] mentioned

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:22.550
"Roll Call" that's
published by Third Row Press.

01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:25.870
And so, we give them Roll Call
and they read the stories,

01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:28.680
and then they take those
stories and use it as the basis

01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.540
to create their own
stories and literary text.

01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:37.730
And I just want to read to you one
of the stories, one of the letters

01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:40.530
that came out of that,
just a part of it.

01:53:40.530 --> 01:53:41.830
This is by Yassim [phonetic].

01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:44.560
it's called "The Struggle."

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:48.100
"I stare at the empty black
hole that is my future

01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:50.640
and the bright light
that is my past.

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:54.040
I examine the struggle
that my brother, mother,

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.950
sisters, ancestors have survived.

01:53:56.950 --> 01:54:00.770
What was the purpose, what
did we do to deserve this?

01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:02.290
Red fills my eyes.

01:54:02.290 --> 01:54:06.650 position:56%
I can hear the blood pumping through
my veins as my pulse quickens.

01:54:06.650 --> 01:54:08.480
I can hear the screams
and the yells.

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:11.650
I can feel the wipes and the cotton
thorns as they prick my skin.

01:54:11.650 --> 01:54:13.710
I read the White Only signs.

01:54:13.710 --> 01:54:16.870
And I feel the desperation
as a man runs from the house,

01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:18.450
a girl cries, a woman dies.

01:54:18.450 --> 01:54:19.750
It's over.

01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:21.460
Is this it, was that all?

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:24.260
Is this what my ancestors
have survived,

01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:26.510
have fought against
for me to be here?

01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:29.610
As I witness the brutality
of the past, as time goes on,

01:54:29.610 --> 01:54:31.680
I see my future brighten.

01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:35.560
I shall stand strong, for this
is what my people have struggled

01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:37.890
through, what I may
struggle through.

01:54:37.890 --> 01:54:43.130
But that's okay, I can turn around
and walk towards my bright future."

01:54:43.130 --> 01:54:46.520
And that's an example of
the kind of work that we get

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:49.910
from our young people when
we give them opportunities

01:54:49.910 --> 01:54:52.490
to use their imagination
in the schools

01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:54.220
and give them some
real text to read.

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:57.030
We ask -- we give them the book.

01:54:57.030 --> 01:54:59.510
They're not just reading
little passages;

01:54:59.510 --> 01:55:03.980
we're trying to make reading
very meaningful to them.

01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:08.190
So, that's Re-Envisioning
Our Lives Through Literature.

01:55:08.190 --> 01:55:13.200
One of the things that
Talib says to me is

01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:17.660
that you can't just
give people the words.

01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:19.010
You have to give them a hook.

01:55:19.010 --> 01:55:20.530 position:56%
If you want them to get the message,

01:55:20.530 --> 01:55:23.770
you have to find out
what the hook is.

01:55:23.770 --> 01:55:28.290 position:56%
And I think one of the main
challenges that we face as educators

01:55:28.290 --> 01:55:34.400
and as parents is how do we find
a hook for our young people?

01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:38.520
How do we find creative ways for
them to get hooked into language

01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:39.940
and to writing and reading?

01:55:39.940 --> 01:55:42.130
We have to create those spaces,

01:55:42.130 --> 01:55:46.070
and they have to be
intentional and deliberate.

01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:49.250
And when we look at the impact
of the internet and social media

01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:52.780
and popular culture, the decline
in independent black book stores,

01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:56.920
the merger of publishing companies,
the disappearance of sections

01:55:56.920 --> 01:56:00.670
in bookstores devoted
to black writers,

01:56:00.670 --> 01:56:03.290
we understand what
those challenges are.

01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:06.540
Our students are reading and
writing in different ways,

01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:10.410
and we cannot ignore the
21st century technology.

01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:13.230
Have you witnessed those students,
who, when they read the poem,

01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:15.030
they come up with their iPad?

01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:17.150
They're reading from their iPads.

01:56:17.150 --> 01:56:19.460
Right. You know, they're
not reading from the text.

01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:21.440
So we have to find a
way to draw on that.

01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:24.600
I mean, how often do you
see a young person sitting

01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:27.000
down and reading a book?

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.360 position:56%
And look at what's happened, at
least in Brooklyn, in the libraries.

01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:32.500
The libraries are full with
young people in the afternoon,

01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:35.910
and that's because there's no
other place for them to go.

01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:37.210
They go to the library.

01:56:37.210 --> 01:56:38.570
It becomes a place
where they can hang out.

01:56:38.570 --> 01:56:42.330 position:56%
They're not necessarily reading, but
we can draw on that and capitalize

01:56:42.330 --> 01:56:44.310
on that to create a space

01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:47.420
to get them more involved
in reading and writing.

01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:50.670
Which means we have to
support the libraries more,

01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:52.450
they have to be funded more.

01:56:52.450 --> 01:56:54.420
We have to demand that.

01:56:54.420 --> 01:56:59.310
When we look at reading behaviors,
someone mentioned the third grade.

01:56:59.310 --> 01:57:03.370
The third grade becomes that first
step when you lose the readers,

01:57:03.370 --> 01:57:05.050
and then it's the sixth grade.

01:57:05.050 --> 01:57:08.580
There's a correlation between
students' reading behaviors

01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:12.480
in sixth grade and then
what happens later on?

01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:16.510
So we have to -- we have
some formidable challenges,

01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:18.490
we have to make the
literature produced

01:57:18.490 --> 01:57:21.800
by writers throughout the
African diaspora more available

01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:24.350
in our schools and for
the general public.

01:57:24.350 --> 01:57:26.140
Which means we have to make sure

01:57:26.140 --> 01:57:30.510
that we get librarians
to order those books.

01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:34.330
And in our schools, we have
to make sure that they're part

01:57:34.330 --> 01:57:37.050
of that cannon, which is
one of the things we do

01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:39.490
in our Re-Envision Our
Lives Through Literature.

01:57:39.490 --> 01:57:42.410
A large part of what we have to
do is professional development

01:57:42.410 --> 01:57:45.580
for teachers, so that they're
not just teaching the add-on,

01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:46.880
the one book.

01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:51.900
Like, how do you incorporate books
by people of color, and black books

01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:55.360
in the curriculum, so that it
becomes part of the curriculum?

01:57:55.360 --> 01:58:00.280
We have to find ways of -- we
have to support the black writers

01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:03.860
by buying their books, even
if we have to give them away.

01:58:03.860 --> 01:58:05.350
And I like -- I love what I hear --

01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:09.340
heard this morning about
giving the books away.

01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:13.730
So you may not want it,
so you give it to someone.

01:58:13.730 --> 01:58:18.330
And then, we have to support the
conferences and the festivals,

01:58:18.330 --> 01:58:19.990
Column [phonetic] Book Festival,

01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:23.690
National Black Writers
Conference, this festival tomorrow.

01:58:23.690 --> 01:58:28.430
I hope all of you are going
to come out and see it.

01:58:28.430 --> 01:58:33.500
One of the things I did as I was
looking at what was happening,

01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:37.070
preparing for this panel, I looked
at the "New York Times" book review

01:58:37.070 --> 01:58:40.520
and I realized that
over the last year,

01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:45.390
every week there's one book
reviewed by a writer of color,

01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:46.690
usually African American.

01:58:46.690 --> 01:58:50.050
One book. Which means that
we have to have more people

01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:56.040
who are writing those reviews,
and we have to populate that.

01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:59.190
They find that one
person to do that --

01:58:59.190 --> 01:59:02.350
and, as you know, in the
newspapers and in print,

01:59:02.350 --> 01:59:05.870
book reviews are disappearing.

01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:07.910
Which means we have to
find ways to write them.

01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:14.090 position:56%
And then, perhaps we need to go back
to the bookstores and say we have

01:59:14.090 --> 01:59:17.390
to have a section on
African American writers.

01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:19.970
Because if you're going into the
bookstore and you're looking to see

01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:22.330
who the writers are, if you
don't know who those writers are,

01:59:22.330 --> 01:59:23.820
you're not going to find them.

01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:26.780
You have to go through the entire
book; maybe we have to go back.

01:59:26.780 --> 01:59:30.660
And even I understand some of the
libraries have taken away some

01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:33.850
of the African American
sections, because we are what?

01:59:33.850 --> 01:59:35.150
Post-racial, right?

01:59:35.150 --> 01:59:38.950
We have to say that we're not.

01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:43.730
And we have to support
our bookstores.

01:59:43.730 --> 01:59:48.370
One of the messages that came
out today is, Telling Our Story.

01:59:48.370 --> 01:59:52.450
One -- I remember Valerie
Boyd, who wrote the biography,

01:59:52.450 --> 01:59:56.320
the most recent biography,
of Zora Neale Hurston.

01:59:56.320 --> 02:00:01.110
And she said she wrote that
biography because Robert, I think,

02:00:01.110 --> 02:00:03.470
Robert Hemingway, the
white biographer, had said,

02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:09.090
"It's time for a black woman to
tell Zora Neale Hurston's story."

02:00:09.090 --> 02:00:10.430
We have to tell our story.

02:00:10.430 --> 02:00:13.000
And she said when she
wrote it, she was called.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.270
She felt a calling
to tell that story.

02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:20.970
So in closing, I teach
African American literature

02:00:20.970 --> 02:00:25.380
and the early part, in
the first book we read,

02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:29.640
is "The Interesting Life
of Olaudah Equiano,"

02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:33.180
or "The African," written
by himself.

02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:35.540
And of the things we talk about
is there's been controversy

02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:37.480
as to whether he wrote
this -- his book.

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:41.000 position:56%
But one of the important messages is

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.230
that this book was a form
of liberation for him.

02:00:44.230 --> 02:00:49.240
He eventually bought his freedom,
and he wrote his way into literacy.

02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:52.590
As is Phillis Wheatley,
the first African American

02:00:52.590 --> 02:00:54.730
to publish a book of poetry.

02:00:54.730 --> 02:00:58.430
She used literacy to write
her way into freedom.

02:00:58.430 --> 02:01:04.090
Our young people have stories that
represent liberation narratives,

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:05.400
and there are many examples

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:07.680
of liberation narratives
throughout the cannon

02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.820
of African American literature.

02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:14.370
So our role is to teach these
writers, these historians,

02:01:14.370 --> 02:01:19.090
and educators and find creative
ways for our young people

02:01:19.090 --> 02:01:22.320
to develop their own
liberation narrative.

02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:24.020
So, the end of my letter.

02:01:24.020 --> 02:01:27.140
Yours in solidarity, Brenda.

02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:29.260
[ Applause ]

02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:30.560
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyah Muhammad:
Good afternoon,

02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:32.250
it's such an honor to be here.

02:01:32.250 --> 02:01:35.740
I come to you directly from Asia,

02:01:35.740 --> 02:01:40.670
where I spent two months doing
research in the prisons, in Asia.

02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:46.180
I went to Bangkok, I went to
Cambodia, I was in Thailand,

02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:50.530
Malaysia as well, and Vietnam.

02:01:50.530 --> 02:01:55.620
The king in Asia apparently felt
that incarcerated individuals

02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:59.540
who were mothers were unfit to
live in prison with their children.

02:01:59.540 --> 02:02:01.670
And therefore, he released all

02:02:01.670 --> 02:02:04.580
of the incarcerated
mothers and their children.

02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:08.930
And so, I was brought in to do
policy implications with them.

02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:10.910
And so, I come to you from that.

02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:12.770
It's such an honor to be here.

02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:14.910
Thank you very much for the invite.

02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:17.930
There's so much creativity
here, there's so much power,

02:02:17.930 --> 02:02:19.230
and there's so much strength.

02:02:19.230 --> 02:02:22.990
And I wouldn't want to be
anywhere else right now.

02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:30.610
I want to start by reciting a
poem for you that I performed

02:02:30.610 --> 02:02:36.010 position:56%
for the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka,
during a meeting two months ago,

02:02:36.010 --> 02:02:38.580
when I spoke with him
about the importance

02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:43.700
of creating a family halfway
house, the first in the nation,

02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:46.250 position:56%
in the world, in Newark, New Jersey,

02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:50.580
that would be directly
connected to my research.

02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:53.210
So it was really interesting;
I walked into his office,

02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:57.710
this was the first time we met, and
he says, "Begin wherever you like."

02:02:57.710 --> 02:03:02.330
And this is what I said.

02:03:02.330 --> 02:03:06.020
Ivory tower blues.

02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:13.480
My mind and intellect and critical
thinking skills are at an unrest.

02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:18.990
I mean, my brain is exploding,
erupting like a volcano.

02:03:18.990 --> 02:03:26.360
Hot lava flows from my soul,
burning and paving a new path.

02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:30.560
A new way towards academic success,

02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:34.070
a new collegic [phonetic]
yellow brick road

02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:45.680
that truly leads lost souls home;
the true and only way to the top.

02:03:46.710 --> 02:03:52.420
The ivory tower is my
lighthouse, not my safe haven.

02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:55.890
A place I go to garner
the verbiage needed

02:03:55.890 --> 02:04:01.450
to overturn the miseducation
of modern day research.

02:04:01.450 --> 02:04:07.730
I keep a ladder in my briefcase to
climb down from the tower's balcony

02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:17.460
that overlooks it all; the
good, the bad, and the ugly.

02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:25.540
My PhD is my access, my ability
to walk freely between the hood,

02:04:25.540 --> 02:04:30.750
my roots, and the blinding
tower of untold truths.

02:04:30.750 --> 02:04:36.570 position:56%
This PhD is my over ground railroad,
an unhidden pathway of truth

02:04:36.570 --> 02:04:40.350
and familiar resources that
keep children, parents,

02:04:40.350 --> 02:04:44.970
and families bonded by embracing
the root, the root causes

02:04:44.970 --> 02:04:52.120
of intergenerational curses;
miseducation labeled as technology,

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:56.510
politics as revenue, and
parental incarceration.

02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:59.070
Listen to me, I'm telling
you something.

02:04:59.070 --> 02:05:04.780
Something that nobody, I
mean, no B-O-D-Y wants to see,

02:05:04.780 --> 02:05:09.430
or hear, H-E-A-R and H-E-R-E.

02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:12.680
You, come here.

02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:14.250
Come over here and listen.

02:05:14.250 --> 02:05:20.390
Listen to this message,
because it must be told.

02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:26.150
This message is for those
with eyes who can see.

02:05:26.150 --> 02:05:30.370
Those with ears who can hear.

02:05:30.370 --> 02:05:33.850
Those with hearts who can love.

02:05:33.850 --> 02:05:38.990
And those with light, to brighten
a path that will lead the way.

02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:43.490
Now, move out of my way as I charge
forth with this message of truth.

02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:45.410
Researchers, how dare you?

02:05:45.410 --> 02:05:48.880
Politicians, how dare you not?

02:05:48.880 --> 02:05:53.370
Ten-year track, why would you
professors, how could you?

02:05:53.370 --> 02:05:58.030
Department chairs, deans, and the
APT committees, cut those shackles.

02:05:58.030 --> 02:05:59.870
Peer reviewed articles, journals,

02:05:59.870 --> 02:06:03.830
why don't you incorporate
innovation?

02:06:04.850 --> 02:06:09.540
Innovation that pushes those
research subjects involved

02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:11.820
to a new place.

02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:16.400
Why do articles take
the place of the people?

02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:22.830
How can secondary data
be respected as human?

02:06:22.830 --> 02:06:29.310
Why are we bringing life to
statistics and not to people?

02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:34.140
Research has to stop killing
the people, to save the numbers.

02:06:34.140 --> 02:06:39.650
Research has to stop killing
the people, to save the numbers.

02:06:39.650 --> 02:06:41.530
Percentages and greater likelihoods

02:06:41.530 --> 02:06:43.840
of a negative outcome
cannot be the norm.

02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:46.640
There has to be more to the story.

02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:49.470
I'm not asking for
remorse, rather, reality.

02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:53.520
Nothing is single sided;
everything has another side,

02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:55.000
an additional angel.

02:06:58.310 --> 02:07:02.360
I advocate for the full
view, not just a zoom.

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:06.680
And if you want your dose up close,
move up close and personal and talk

02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:10.690
to those have lived it
and walk at every step.

02:07:10.690 --> 02:07:14.800
Use their narrative to create
and not the other way around.

02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:17.140
I've done it, and it works.

02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:20.970
Fifteen years of riding
buses with children affected

02:07:20.970 --> 02:07:26.190
by parental incarceration has given
me the courage to be the truth,

02:07:26.190 --> 02:07:31.700 position:56%
write truthfully, and create nothing
of lies, deceit, or one-sidedness.

02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:34.930
Conducting interviews in
locked bedrooms of children,

02:07:34.930 --> 02:07:38.140
it gets no more truthful than that.

02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:43.580 position:56%
I can still hear the tears shed and
the whispers of help to this moment.

02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:46.080
I remember every qualitative
interview

02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:48.470
and every quantitative
file assessed.

02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:52.510
I put this experience in
every fiber of my soul.

02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:54.890
I live it, but I am not it.

02:07:54.890 --> 02:07:57.910
I live it, but I am not it.

02:07:57.910 --> 02:08:03.700
I am impassioned by
it, but not lost in it.

02:08:03.700 --> 02:08:06.820
I am simply leading the
way, creating a new path,

02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:09.820
the only path to the
top, the true top.

02:08:09.820 --> 02:08:14.810
I use my research to create
an educational coloring book

02:08:14.810 --> 02:08:19.240
for children of incarcerated
parents, "The Prison Alphabet."

02:08:19.240 --> 02:08:22.610
It was born out of Mr.
Critical Fill-Work Jr,

02:08:22.610 --> 02:08:25.160
married to Mrs. Critical Me.

02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:30.270
It is a publication that
gives back; it is a legacy.

02:08:30.270 --> 02:08:33.960
The legacy, my legs,
that allow me to see.

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:39.280
A literary masterpiece that
addresses illiteracy, lies,

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:43.620
knowledge, and the unknown;
all empirically based.

02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:46.490
It is accessible in
four different languages

02:08:46.490 --> 02:08:48.710
and used in various countries.

02:08:48.710 --> 02:08:52.340
Its knowledge is a legacy
that belongs to the world.

02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:58.900
"The Prison Alphabet" has been used
in Uganda, Dubai, Europe, and Asia.

02:08:58.900 --> 02:09:03.080
The truth is unstoppable,
and it doesn't end here;

02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:07.980
it never ends where it started,
rather travels far beyond.

02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:10.200
Howard University.

02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:16.270
HU, you know, prides
itself of truth and service.

02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:19.860
And that is what my
track record shows.

02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:26.230
The ivory tower blues,
ivory tower blues.

02:09:26.230 --> 02:09:29.850
The ivory tower is blue and cold.

02:09:29.850 --> 02:09:33.590
And it's easy to make it warm.

02:09:33.590 --> 02:09:36.900
Create and make for the community,
serve the people, and allow them

02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:41.250 position:56%
to help you serve, create, and make
for the community, serve the people,

02:09:41.250 --> 02:09:44.140
and allow them to help you serve.

02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:46.950
Climb out of the ivory
tower and walk

02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:49.910
onto the ground amongst
the people as one.

02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:52.050
Find the answers to
the next creation

02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:54.480
and fully support it,
support the truth.

02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:55.850
Support the truth.

02:09:55.850 --> 02:09:58.240 position:56%
Support those who support the truth.

02:09:58.240 --> 02:09:59.540
Support truth.

02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:00.840
I am the truth.

02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:02.230
I support you.

02:10:02.230 --> 02:10:03.530
You support me.

02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:04.830
We support me.

02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:07.280
When? Now.

02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:10.740
Ivory tower dismantled.

02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:17.050
Now we have ivory grounds,
ivory minds, ivory souls,

02:10:17.050 --> 02:10:21.130
ivory everywhere, ivory shared.

02:10:21.130 --> 02:10:23.960
So truthful, so true.

02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:30.210
I have access to the ivory tower
although I don't reside there.

02:10:30.210 --> 02:10:32.970
No more blue ivory tower.

02:10:32.970 --> 02:10:35.510
No more you ivory tower.

[ Singing ]

02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:51.550
Thank you.

02:10:51.550 --> 02:10:57.710
[ Applause ]

02:10:57.710 --> 02:10:59.010
So thank you very much.

02:10:59.010 --> 02:11:04.390
I just wanted to share briefly
that the present alphabet,

02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:08.510
the educational coloring book,
was born out of the spirit

02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:10.390
and the energy of the children.

02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:14.490
I read literature for many years
that identified these children

02:11:14.490 --> 02:11:19.380
as angry, as frustrated, as
non-intellectual, and when I went

02:11:19.380 --> 02:11:23.250
into the homes to interview these
children, they were brilliant,

02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:27.900
they were bright-eyed, they were
respectful, they were remorseful,

02:11:27.900 --> 02:11:31.330
and they were not their parents
although they loved their parents.

02:11:31.330 --> 02:11:35.130
So I knew that at the end of this
journey that I would spend the rest

02:11:35.130 --> 02:11:38.940
of my life allowing the world
to see that true narrative.

02:11:38.940 --> 02:11:40.820
Right now I'm working
on a book called <i>Far</i>

02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:44.340
<i>From the Tree </i>and it looks at
success stories amongst children

02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:47.320
of incarcerated parents, one
of the things you don't hear.

02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:49.170
Right now we use the statistics

02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:52.480
that identifies children have
a greater likelihood of going

02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:54.960
to prison if their
parents are in prison.

02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:56.850
If they knew the parents are not.

02:11:56.850 --> 02:11:59.640
One of the things that we
don't balance that argument

02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.110
with is the reality that
African Americans supersede a lot

02:12:04.110 --> 02:12:06.460
and sometimes it's
the worse situation

02:12:06.460 --> 02:12:08.870
that builds the brightest stars.

02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:11.390
So I have been travelling
all around the nation

02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:16.090 position:56%
and interviewing amazing children at
top Ivy League universities, Yale.

02:12:16.090 --> 02:12:21.690 position:56%
Some individuals who have JDs, who
had parents in prison knew the truth

02:12:21.690 --> 02:12:24.480
about their parents being
in prison, accepted it,

02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:27.840
and were able to move
past it and be an example

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:31.450
for their parents once they
re-entered, to not recidivate.

02:12:31.450 --> 02:12:33.250
Thank you.

02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:42.040
My name is Bomani Armah.

02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:43.860
Before I do anything else,
I'm a hip-hop artist.

02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:45.160
I'm a poet.

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:46.460
I'm an [inaudible], so I
got to make sure the energy

02:12:46.460 --> 02:12:47.760
in the room for [inaudible], right?

02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:49.520
When I count to three, I
need everyone to say peace

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:50.820
and throw up the deuces like this.

02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:52.120
All right, you all ready?

02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:53.420
Here we go.

02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:54.720
One, two, three.

02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:56.020
&gt;&gt; Peace.

02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:57.320
&gt;&gt; Bomani Armah: Not bad.

02:12:57.320 --> 02:12:58.620
All right.

02:12:58.620 --> 02:12:59.920
It's a small room so if you
don't participate I can see

02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:01.220
you [laughter].

02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:02.520
Let's try this again.

02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:03.820
One, two, three.

02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:05.120
&gt;&gt; Peace.

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:06.420
&gt;&gt; Bomani Armah: Thank
you very much.

02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:07.720
I needed that.

02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:09.020
That helped me.

02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:10.320
In fact, a bunch of smiles coming
this way now, so I appreciate that.

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:11.620
Thank you.

02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:12.920
I am blessed to be in this audience
and being a part of this panel.

02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:14.220 position:56%
Once again, my name is Bomani Armah.

02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:15.520
I am not a rapper.

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:16.820
I am a poet with a hip-hop style.

02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:18.120

please check out my website.

02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:20.160
It's www.notarapper.com.

02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:21.460
I have a -- that's not a joke.

02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:22.760
It's literally my website.

02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:24.060
Go check it out.

02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:25.360
I realize some people think
I was joking with that.

02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:27.510
So I have a bunch of aliases.

02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:33.170
I'm a hip-hop artist so I
have a bunch of aliases.

02:13:33.170 --> 02:13:34.470
I'm the Watermelon Man.

02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:35.770
I am Mr. Read-A-Book.

02:13:35.770 --> 02:13:37.070
That's probably the most
relevant to today's panel.

02:13:37.070 --> 02:13:38.370
I am the Hip-Hop LeVar Burton.

02:13:38.370 --> 02:13:41.080
I am the Black Colin Powell.

02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:42.380
I have a bunch of them.

02:13:42.380 --> 02:13:43.780
I'm not going to go
through them all.

02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:50.620
But I take my art and my poetry
and my activism very seriously.

02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:55.830
The first thing I wanted to do.

02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:59.500
We [inaudible] just because
of my energy and the events

02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:03.100
over the last couple of days, I
want to encourage everyone in here,

02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:04.810
I want to encourage the previous
generation, my parents' generation,

02:14:04.810 --> 02:14:06.110
their parents' generation,
that black people,

02:14:06.110 --> 02:14:07.410
young black people,
we are doing good.

02:14:07.410 --> 02:14:08.710
All right?

02:14:08.710 --> 02:14:10.360
We're not doing exactly what we
want to be, but we're doing good.

02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:11.830
We are doing better
than we were [applause].

02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:16.910
Yeah, you all give that
up for young black people.

02:14:16.910 --> 02:14:18.240
Sometimes we get discouraged.

02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:20.200
Sometimes we get discouraged
and we believe, and we think

02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:22.040
and we internalize all the negative
press that we hear about ourselves.

02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:24.830
But the energy that has been
fighting against us for 400 years

02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:30.790
of slavery, 450 years of de facto
slavery, is strong and insidious.

02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:33.210
It keeps coming at us with
different things all the time.

02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:35.430
Nobody was ready for the
crack epidemic of the '80s.

02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:39.570
Nobody was ready for the
economic bubble burst in the '90s.

02:14:39.570 --> 02:14:42.070
Nobody was ready for the
economic class of 2015 -- or 2008.

02:14:42.070 --> 02:14:44.100
So all these things
keep happening to us,

02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:45.840 position:56%
but black people are still fighting,

02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.330
young black people
are still interested

02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:48.880
in the liberation of their people.

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:51.780
Do not get twisted by the
media that you're hearing.

02:14:51.780 --> 02:14:53.080
I work with them directly.

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:54.380
They tell me directly.

02:14:54.380 --> 02:14:55.680
They're very interested
in the struggles

02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:57.490
and don't feel discouraged,
all right?

02:14:57.490 --> 02:14:58.790
You're doing a very good job.

02:14:58.790 --> 02:15:02.060
I'm at the age now where college
kids are half my age so I'm

02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:04.280
in that weird timeframe,
you know what I'm saying,

02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:05.580
where they're trying to explain

02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:08.040
to me how broke J Cole
is, and I'm like, really?

02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:09.340
You know what I'm saying?

02:15:09.340 --> 02:15:14.500
I wanted to come up here to tell
you a little bit about what I do.

02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:19.310
I am a product of the free black
spaces that we have been trying

02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:21.040
to create for the last century.

02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:25.350 position:56%
My mother's side of the family moved
up here to escape South Carolina

02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:28.790
and the oppressiveness of
racism and no job opportunities.

02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:32.620 position:56%
My father moved here from South
Carolina to go to Howard University.

02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:34.040
They met here.

02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:36.390
I'm so into being black.

02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:40.370
It's like one of my favorite
things about myself [laughter].

02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:42.780
It comes from growing
up in this community.

02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:46.040
It comes from being a product of
Marion Barry's Washington D.C.

02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:48.020
It comes from being a
product of P. G. [inaudible].

02:15:48.020 --> 02:15:52.610
My father brought me -- they came
before Columbus when I was 13.

02:15:52.610 --> 02:15:53.910
You know what I'm saying?

02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:56.110
Like that doesn't happen
in like normal households,

02:15:56.110 --> 02:15:57.410
you know what I'm saying?

02:15:57.410 --> 02:15:59.990
I had to have one my [inaudible]
employees make me understand what

02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:01.640
kind of free black space I lived

02:16:01.640 --> 02:16:04.290
in where my father would
buy me that kind of book.

02:16:04.290 --> 02:16:07.100
I'm in the same generation
as Dr. Green.

02:16:07.100 --> 02:16:08.570
In fact, I'm a huge fan of his.

02:16:08.570 --> 02:16:11.070
So this is the result
of that happening.

02:16:11.070 --> 02:16:14.910
So I don't want us to
be discouraged at all.

02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:18.300
What I do for a living
-- I am creative.

02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:21.290
I'm a poet, an M.C., a
producer, and an edutainer --

02:16:21.290 --> 02:16:26.560
a term coined by [inaudible] when
I used education to entertain.

02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:29.760
I am the Director of Poetry
Events for Busboys and Poets

02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:31.780
which is a chain of restaurants
throughout Washington,

02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:33.080
D.C. There're six of them.

02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:35.040
We do 39 open mics a month.

02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:37.360
I direct all six of
them which actually --

02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:40.700
I miss, actually, being in
the crowd and being the host

02:16:40.700 --> 02:16:43.150
so I'm going to go
back to that soon.

02:16:43.150 --> 02:16:46.530
But we take freedom of speech very
seriously here in the literary

02:16:46.530 --> 02:16:48.480
and black community
here in Washington, D.C.

02:16:48.480 --> 02:16:51.560
We currently have the
National Slam Champion Team.

02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:55.610
We currently have the National Teen
Slam Champion Team take writing

02:16:55.610 --> 02:16:57.800
and literacy very seriously
here in Washington,

02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:00.770
D.C. When I'm not doing that, I
have a creative writing program

02:17:00.770 --> 02:17:02.640
that I do mostly through an
organization called Young Audiences

02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:03.940
of Maryland.

02:17:03.940 --> 02:17:08.080 position:56%
But I'm actually doing a workshop on
July 1st at MLK Library with teens.

02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:10.880
If you have teenagers who are into
writing, have them come see me.

02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:14.930
I just, this past week,
ironed out the deals

02:17:14.930 --> 02:17:17.940
to teach my creative writing
workshop to other teachers

02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:19.240
through the Kennedy Center.

02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:25.600
The first workshop will
be March 16th [applause].

02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:26.900
Thank you.

02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:28.200
I'm excited about that.

02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:29.500
The first workshop
will be March 16th,

02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:30.800
and the way my workshop
works is it shows how --

02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:32.100
our kids are into hip-hop.

02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:33.400
It shows how a well-written song
resembles a well-written essay,

02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:34.700
with the chorus being the --

02:17:34.700 --> 02:17:38.200
with the chorus being the
introductory paragraph

02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:41.440
and the verses being the
supporting paragraphs.

02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:44.010
Showing how the writing
process is the same

02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:46.450
across the board no matter what
style of writing you are doing.

02:17:46.450 --> 02:17:50.650
I got my break into
the literary world

02:17:50.650 --> 02:17:53.110
as a 19-year-old working
for Karibu Books.

02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:54.580 position:56%
There's a whole bunch of locals here

02:17:54.580 --> 02:17:58.250
who probably won't
understand what Karibu Books.

02:17:58.250 --> 02:18:01.050
I was responding to the [inaudible]
system [inaudible] press sometimes.

02:18:01.050 --> 02:18:03.430
I was really cool to actually
meet Dr. Myra [Inaudible].

02:18:03.430 --> 02:18:05.530
I was sitting behind --

02:18:05.530 --> 02:18:07.400
a lady turned around and
said, "Oh, you're Bomani."

02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:08.700
I was a kid.

02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:10.000
I'm Bomani.

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.300
She's like, "Oh, my
son's named Bomani."

02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:12.600
I was like, "Cool.

02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:13.900
He must be handsome and
intelligent" [laughter].

02:18:13.900 --> 02:18:15.200
She said, "Yeah."

02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:17.510
Then Dr. [Inaudible] said, "Can my
wife come up to the stage, please."

02:18:17.510 --> 02:18:20.390
She walked up and said
hello to everybody.

02:18:20.390 --> 02:18:21.690
I said, "Whoa."

02:18:21.690 --> 02:18:24.010
My life is like a poem in so many
ways I can't begin to describe it.

02:18:24.010 --> 02:18:25.310
But, anyway, it started from there.

02:18:25.310 --> 02:18:27.380
The first day at Karibu
Books, one of the owners,

02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:29.740
Yao Glover, pulls out the lease.

02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:32.930 position:56%
He doesn't pull out the
instruction manual, the instructions

02:18:32.930 --> 02:18:34.450
for being a good employee.

02:18:34.450 --> 02:18:37.040
He's like, "I understand you're
just passing through here.

02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:39.680
I want you to see what
kind of business I run

02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:41.940
because telling our
people's stories is what I do

02:18:41.940 --> 02:18:43.410
for a living and it
has to continue."

02:18:43.410 --> 02:18:45.670
So the first thing he
did was show me the lease

02:18:45.670 --> 02:18:48.480
so I could see what kind of
money he was paying P.G. Plaza,

02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:52.930
you know what I'm saying, and how
we worked out our best when I get

02:18:52.930 --> 02:18:54.230
to my own level of
trying to understand

02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:55.540
that in education --
I mean, in business.

02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:59.110
So I am very much hands-on.

02:18:59.110 --> 02:19:02.830
One of my very next jobs was
working for Martha's Table.

02:19:02.830 --> 02:19:04.430
I lived above Martha's Table.

02:19:04.430 --> 02:19:05.730
There's an apartment there.

02:19:05.730 --> 02:19:07.030
I don't know if you're
familiar with it.

02:19:07.030 --> 02:19:08.330
It's on 14th and W Street.

02:19:08.330 --> 02:19:09.630
It's basically a soup kitchen.

02:19:09.630 --> 02:19:11.460
I lived above it as an employee.

02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:12.760
One of the most amazing things

02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:16.140
that I saw while living there
was gentrification in action.

02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:18.660
It was something that
I was able to take

02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:20.630
to the prison system
when I talked there.

02:19:20.630 --> 02:19:23.070
Fourteenth and W Street
is notorious.

02:19:23.070 --> 02:19:24.370
What is notorious?

02:19:24.370 --> 02:19:25.670
Eighties and '90s.

02:19:25.670 --> 02:19:26.970
I joke with people all the time.

02:19:26.970 --> 02:19:28.910
If you got caught at 14th
and Clifton, 14th and W,

02:19:28.910 --> 02:19:30.210
you call somebody to come get you.

02:19:30.210 --> 02:19:32.780
They'd tell you to walk a couple
blocks south before they came get

02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:34.080
you, right [laughter]?

02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:36.890
So I'm living above
Martha's Table, 2003 I think,

02:19:36.890 --> 02:19:39.620
before they broke ground for
what is now Busboys and Poets.

02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:43.090
Once again, the corner's notorious.

02:19:43.090 --> 02:19:45.170
You know the signs
of gentrification.

02:19:45.170 --> 02:19:48.420
First you start seeing
homosexual couples

02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:51.520
because they've been ostracized
from the rest of their community

02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:53.890
and so they come to the place
where they can buy stuff.

02:19:53.890 --> 02:19:55.400
Then this is what happens next.

02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:57.320
I saw it right on my corner.

02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:02.150 position:56%
They brought in the National Guard
with [inaudible] and M16s and camped

02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:04.920
out on the corner for a month.

02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:06.680
Right? During that month they shut

02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:09.190
down whatever illegal
operation was going on.

02:20:09.190 --> 02:20:12.550
Then they brought in the
developers and broke ground, right?

02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:14.290
I saw the process happen
out of my window,

02:20:14.290 --> 02:20:20.050 position:56%
and what blew me away the most was
that as notorious as 14th and W was,

02:20:20.050 --> 02:20:23.240
the government, the politicians,
the military, the police,

02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:25.550
could have shut it
down at any moment --

02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:28.100
during the '80s, during the '90s,
when it was dangerous there.

02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:29.650
They could have shut
it down at any moment.

02:20:29.650 --> 02:20:31.620
They waited until they
realized there was a point

02:20:31.620 --> 02:20:33.810
when it was valuable to them,
and then, all of a sudden,

02:20:33.810 --> 02:20:35.690
all the crime stopped
immediately [finger snap].

02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:38.120
Then the next stage
of gentrification,

02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:41.040
when you see whites going
jogging with their dogs at 11 p.m.

02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:53.150
You feel weird about it because
you're like why do they feel safe?

02:20:53.150 --> 02:20:54.470
They shouldn't feel safe.

02:20:54.470 --> 02:20:55.830
They shouldn't feel safe.

02:20:55.830 --> 02:21:00.420
Someone comes -- I'm not the only
one who's been making these things,

02:21:00.420 --> 02:21:01.720
right?

02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:03.020
I've lived this thing and
seen it happening first-hand.

02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:04.320
So when I've walked to these
different prison institutions

02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:05.620
and talked to young people
about writing and about reading,

02:21:05.620 --> 02:21:07.740
the first thing they always say
to me is, "No one understands me.

02:21:07.740 --> 02:21:09.500
No one gets what I'm trying to say.

02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:12.530
No one gets my words, my
feelings, my emotions."

02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:16.210
I'm thinking, ah, literacy and
wring is exactly what we need

02:21:16.210 --> 02:21:20.120
in this situation -- the ability
to tell each other stories.

02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:22.430
So what I'm able to
tell young people back,

02:21:22.430 --> 02:21:23.730
that that's what they're missing.

02:21:23.730 --> 02:21:27.650
Their inability to articulate their
feelings comes from their inability

02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:29.190
to read, from their
inability to write.

02:21:29.190 --> 02:21:31.980
Now I'm automatically able
to spark their interest.

02:21:31.980 --> 02:21:34.900
Most of these young people have
children, have younger brothers

02:21:34.900 --> 02:21:37.840
and sisters, and they want
to be able to use their story

02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:41.060
as a positive message in
order to change the world,

02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:43.570
and so they're able to do
that once they learn how

02:21:43.570 --> 02:21:45.060
to be literate and communicate.

02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:48.050
When I use literate, I don't
completely just mean book literacy.

02:21:48.050 --> 02:21:51.180 position:56%
We definitely need multimedia,
social media literacy at this point.

02:21:51.180 --> 02:21:52.480
It's unavoidable.

02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:55.460
Most young people are getting their
news through Facebook and Twitter

02:21:55.460 --> 02:21:57.160 position:56%
and Instagram, so showing people how

02:21:57.160 --> 02:21:59.390
to navigate these things
is a very important thing.

02:21:59.390 --> 02:22:01.370
We also need musical literacy.

02:22:01.370 --> 02:22:05.800 position:56%
I have people get their
political/philosophical philosophies

02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:07.100
from rappers.

02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:08.400
They're quoting Kendrick Lamar.

02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:09.700
They're quoting J Cole.

02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:12.490
So we need to start breaking
down poetry for them.

02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:15.080
That's been my blessing
through my entire adult life.

02:22:15.080 --> 02:22:21.160
So I'm really into
practical solutions about how

02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:24.230
to affect our young people and
increase their literacy rate

02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:27.540
and to move on to the next
generation even stronger.

02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:29.740
My favorite quote is
from Jonathan B. Clark.

02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:31.760
When I was into tattoos I was
going to get it tattooed on me

02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:35.250 position:56%
but I changed my mind, so it's good.

02:22:35.250 --> 02:22:39.480
That is, "We must start projects
our grandchildren will finish."

02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:40.780
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:44.780
&gt;&gt; Bomani Armah: He said, "There
should be a railroad across Africa.

02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:48.710
But no one man will ever live to
see it happen, so no one does it

02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:50.220
because you have to
trust your children

02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:52.070
and your children's
children to do it."

02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:53.770
That's what we have to
start talking about.

02:22:53.770 --> 02:22:55.180
That's why I'm encouraged.

02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:57.290
That's why the state of our
streets doesn't bother me

02:22:57.290 --> 02:23:00.130
because we're better than we used
to be, and we're moving forward.

02:23:00.130 --> 02:23:02.810
Dick Gregory says all the time,
"Don't let people tell you you need

02:23:02.810 --> 02:23:04.110
to go back to the old days.

02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:06.660
There is no better old
days to go back to."

02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:07.960
We're all moving forward.

02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:10.260
So these are some of the things I
want to start moving forward with.

02:23:10.260 --> 02:23:15.760
First of all, as a community we
need to start adopting our schools.

02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:18.250
They entire building,
the entire block.

02:23:18.250 --> 02:23:20.210
Everyone who lives within
a 10-block radius --

02:23:20.210 --> 02:23:21.950 position:56%
someone said something close to this
-- a 10-block radius of a school.

02:23:21.950 --> 02:23:23.250
They need to think of
that as their school.

02:23:23.250 --> 02:23:24.550
They need to be having
their events there.

02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:25.850
They need to be doing
their birthday parties

02:23:25.850 --> 02:23:27.150
and their bar mitzvahs
at that school.

02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:29.390
They need to be -- we need
to feel free that if we're

02:23:29.390 --> 02:23:31.310
in the 10-block radius of
a school, and we see some

02:23:31.310 --> 02:23:33.300
of those obviously
school-aged, we need to feel

02:23:33.300 --> 02:23:34.600
like we're in our community.

02:23:34.600 --> 02:23:36.550
We can tell them, "Why
aren't you in school?"

02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:40.300
We can ask them do they understand
the importance of their education.

02:23:40.300 --> 02:23:42.030
The same thing with the libraries.

02:23:42.030 --> 02:23:44.720
Now from what I understand about
the libraries - they might not be

02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:48.320
as visible as D.C. Library, but
D.C. Library has treated me well

02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:50.060
and I feel like it treats
the people of D.C. very well.

02:23:50.060 --> 02:23:52.660
There are always opportunities
for the young people

02:23:52.660 --> 02:23:54.450
to come in and learn something.

02:23:54.450 --> 02:23:56.930
Opportunities for young people
to come in and be read to.

02:23:56.930 --> 02:23:58.740
One of the biggest
problems with learning how

02:23:58.740 --> 02:24:00.210
to read is you need to be read to.

02:24:00.210 --> 02:24:02.450
So there a whole bunch
of opportunities for that

02:24:02.450 --> 02:24:03.750
with the D.C. Public Libraries.

02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:05.050
In our black communities, we need

02:24:05.050 --> 02:24:07.670
to make sure all the libraries
are operating like that.

02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:11.170
We need to do -- I've done
this because I don't sleep.

02:24:11.170 --> 02:24:14.740
We need to do a surge the way
Iraq got the surge, right?

02:24:14.740 --> 02:24:17.370
I calculated the [inaudible]
one of the school --

02:24:17.370 --> 02:24:19.470
Johnson Square Elementary
in Baltimore is one

02:24:19.470 --> 02:24:23.280
of the worst educational
schools I've been in.

02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:26.280
What I did was I went and found
out how many professionals live

02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:28.460
within Baltimore City
and Baltimore County,

02:24:28.460 --> 02:24:29.760 position:56%
how many black professionals, right?

02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:32.860
If we get -- I forgot exactly
what the numbers are --

02:24:32.860 --> 02:24:36.820 position:56%
but I calculated what it would take,
how many volunteers it would take

02:24:36.820 --> 02:24:39.510
to put a volunteer adult
in every classroom,

02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:41.430
every week for an entire year.

02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:44.030
What these teachers need are
other adults in the room.

02:24:44.030 --> 02:24:48.110
They don't even necessarily
need other trained educators.

02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:51.670
They need other people who are
willing to be a fellow third-grader

02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:54.270 position:56%
for a day, and when they're teaching
that third-grader their basics

02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:56.220 position:56%
of reading, you can sit at the table

02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:58.100
and give the kid more
input, all right?

02:24:58.100 --> 02:25:01.230
There are definitely enough black
professionals surrounding Baltimore

02:25:01.230 --> 02:25:03.150
that, if each of them took
a vacation week and did it

02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:04.870
for one week, we could
do that and make sure

02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:08.060
that the student/teacher ratio,
the student to adult ratio,

02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:10.680
is no greater than one
to seven or one to six.

02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:12.040
That needs to happen.

02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:13.790
We need to take our own
talent and not even wait

02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:16.390
for the Federal Government
to clear a program.

02:25:16.390 --> 02:25:20.210
It's a long-time dream of mine
but I already put it out there

02:25:20.210 --> 02:25:21.950
because I feel like I'm in a room

02:25:21.950 --> 02:25:23.250
with like-minded people,
so I'm excited.

02:25:23.250 --> 02:25:26.210
We also need to have our
ability to empathize for people

02:25:26.210 --> 02:25:29.040
who can't read, go
beyond the children.

02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:30.340
All right?

02:25:30.340 --> 02:25:32.020
We say, oh, this poor, this
18-year-old can't read.

02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:33.690
Oh, this 12-year-old can't read.

02:25:33.690 --> 02:25:35.440
Oh, this 16-year-old can't read.

02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:37.490
Oh, this 20-year-old is on her own.

02:25:37.490 --> 02:25:38.790
You know what I'm saying?

02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:40.090
It's like you're not
making the connection,

02:25:40.090 --> 02:25:42.530
that that 20-year old
needs to be able to read

02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:45.040 position:56%
so the next eight-year-old can read,
and the next four-year-old can read.

02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:47.160
So I think that it needs
to be extended well beyond

02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:50.750
when they're cute, and we
have to do that as a group.

02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:54.830
One of the things I'm realizing,
and one of the myths that happens

02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:59.040
with young people is that they
think that learning isn't cool.

02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:02.160
It's a myth that we've been
repeating over and over again.

02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:05.430
All kids know learning is important
and they all know it's cool.

02:26:05.430 --> 02:26:08.940
What it is is once you get into
the third grade and you can't read,

02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:12.460
you realize you're never going
to catch up, and so your goals

02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:14.740
in the classroom setting
become different.

02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:16.590
They become getting attention.

02:26:16.590 --> 02:26:18.410
They become being cool.

02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:20.330
They become living your
life at that moment

02:26:20.330 --> 02:26:22.500
because you know you are lost.

02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:25.350
You know that what the teacher just
wrote on the board is not going

02:26:25.350 --> 02:26:28.210
to have any effect on your life
because you cannot comprehend it.

02:26:28.210 --> 02:26:29.520
They understand that they need it.

02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:30.970
What they need is more
understanding.

02:26:30.970 --> 02:26:32.380
They weren't ready
when they got there.

02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:34.830
So we need to have that
empathy go all the way

02:26:34.830 --> 02:26:36.270
to the heart of who they are.

02:26:36.270 --> 02:26:38.330
Let me see.

02:26:38.330 --> 02:26:41.080
I want to share with you guys
some good ideas that I've seen.

02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:44.040
There's a brother -- if you follow
me at notarapper.com or on Twitter,

02:26:44.040 --> 02:26:47.340
there's a brother who has a kit
where you can buy a bookshelf

02:26:47.340 --> 02:26:50.300
and a pack of books that you might
-- somewhere I'm out of time,

02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:54.100
but a pack of books that you
can put in black barbershops,

02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:56.090
and what we're encouraging
black men to do is

02:26:56.090 --> 02:26:58.430
if you see a child
in the barbershop,

02:26:58.430 --> 02:27:01.310 position:56%
someone will pick up a book and read
it to them, to leave the books there

02:27:01.310 --> 02:27:03.680
and just read them at all times.

02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:06.750
Kids who have adults
read to them read better.

02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:10.630
One of the hardest things for me
the last couple of days was looking

02:27:10.630 --> 02:27:14.360
at the whole situation
at Emmanuel Church.

02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:17.860
I personally am working
on a poem, play,

02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:19.870
a whole bunch of things
about Denmark Vesey.

02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:24.430
That was Denmark Vesey's church and
it's been burned down four times.

02:27:24.430 --> 02:27:28.320
The saddest part of what we're
going to have to explain this story

02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:31.100
to young people, is this -- is
they don't understand the story

02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:32.400
of that church, all right?

02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:35.500
We have to make sure that
doesn't happen anymore.

02:27:35.500 --> 02:27:37.410
It's an interesting story.

02:27:37.410 --> 02:27:38.890
It's a gangster story.

02:27:38.890 --> 02:27:40.190
You know what I'm saying?

02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:41.710
There's no way why we shouldn't
be able to tell the story

02:27:41.710 --> 02:27:45.230
of Emmanuel AME Church to a
group of 12-year-olds who are

02:27:45.230 --> 02:27:49.000 position:56%
into like thug rappers and tell them
the story of the AME Church like,

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.370
yo, these people went hard.

02:27:51.370 --> 02:27:52.670
You know what I'm saying?

02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:53.970
They saw a battle.

02:27:53.970 --> 02:27:55.270
They [inaudible].

02:27:55.270 --> 02:27:56.570
That's what young people --
we all remember 13/14 roles.

02:27:56.570 --> 02:27:57.870
They're rebellious, you
know what I'm saying?

02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:59.400
They want -- all these
kids want to fight

02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:01.490
and we're not telling
them who to fight.

02:28:01.490 --> 02:28:02.790
We need to tell them who to fight.

02:28:02.790 --> 02:28:04.600
We need to tell the
story of Emmanuel Church

02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:07.100
and do a much better job
of articulating that.

02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:11.130
I'm going to share with you all the
three creative writing rules I give

02:28:11.130 --> 02:28:12.750
all my students.

02:28:12.750 --> 02:28:16.100 position:56%
First rule is, the only wrong
answer is a blank answer, all right?

02:28:16.100 --> 02:28:18.000
Make sure you tell
young people that.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.370
We are trying to get their opinion.

02:28:19.370 --> 02:28:21.200
We are trying to get
what they think.

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:23.610
You cannot possibly get
that wrong, all right?

02:28:23.610 --> 02:28:25.340
We can make you improve on it,

02:28:25.340 --> 02:28:27.810
but the only wrong
answer is a blank answer.

02:28:27.810 --> 02:28:30.530
Number two, artists
do not make mistakes.

02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:32.060
We make discoveries.

02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:36.550
When I tell this story I talk about
Thomas Edison who quote/unquote,

02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:37.990
"discovered the light bulb".

02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:39.840
Evidently at one time
he electrocuted himself

02:28:39.840 --> 02:28:42.530
and made his hair stand up on end
and all that kind of stuff, right?

02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:44.660
When he finally did it,
he did a press conference

02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:47.440
and the reporters asked him how
did it feel to fail so many times?

02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:49.690
He said, "I did not
fail a thousand times.

02:28:49.690 --> 02:28:52.020
I discovered a thousand
ways that did not work."

02:28:52.020 --> 02:28:53.320
All right?

02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:55.480
We need to make sure these young
people understand they are not

02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:58.160 position:56%
writing down the wrong word, they're
not writing down the wrong phrase,

02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:00.050
they're not writing
down the wrong sentence.

02:29:00.050 --> 02:29:01.730
They are writing down
the words, phrases,

02:29:01.730 --> 02:29:04.350
and sentences that will lead
them to the words, phrases,

02:29:04.350 --> 02:29:05.830 position:56%
and sentences that they want to use.

02:29:05.830 --> 02:29:07.130
They need to talk about it.

02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:08.430
They need to do research.

02:29:08.430 --> 02:29:09.730
But they can always improve.

02:29:09.730 --> 02:29:11.030
The third thing that's involved.

02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:12.330
This will be the third thing.

02:29:12.330 --> 02:29:13.630
Do not edit in your head.

02:29:13.630 --> 02:29:15.240
That's the rule I have
to use myself.

02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:16.700
I'm so bad about that.

02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:20.480
Some of my best ideas were bad
ideas that I wrote on paper

02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:22.040
and I saw them, and
I rearranged them.

02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:26.330 position:56%
When I go over to these classrooms
I will pictures of Eminem's notebook

02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:29.110
which makes absolutely no sense,

02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:31.030
but he comes up with
these incredible rhymes.

02:29:31.030 --> 02:29:33.050
So these are the things we need
to be telling young people.

02:29:33.050 --> 02:29:37.060
To end with, what made me infamous
is eight years ago I did a song

02:29:37.060 --> 02:29:39.000
called "Read a Book."

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.150
It was the subject of an
animated video that was on BET.

02:29:42.150 --> 02:29:45.530
BET basically hired an
animation department

02:29:45.530 --> 02:29:49.780
that started doing all these jokes
about how bad BET programming was

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:51.080
and putting it on the air.

02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:53.030
I was a part of that.

02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:54.460
The song is called "Read a Book."

02:29:54.460 --> 02:29:56.290
It used a whole bunch of profanity.

02:29:56.290 --> 02:30:01.140 position:56%
The idea of the song was to make fun
of the current state of the hip-hop

02:30:01.140 --> 02:30:05.040
when all they do in krump music
was curse and repeat themselves.

02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:07.680
So I made a song like that.

02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:09.880
Most of the educators
were down with me.

02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:11.500
Most of the educators know
what we're dealing with.

02:30:11.500 --> 02:30:15.150
A couple of dignitaries
came against me.

02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:16.610
Jesse Jackson came out against me.

02:30:16.610 --> 02:30:20.180 position:56%
He said whoever wrote this song was
illiterate, uneducated, and unkempt.

02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:24.510
I gave him unkempt but the other
two were like really uncalled for.

02:30:24.510 --> 02:30:28.080
[ Laughter ]

02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:32.120
But the biggest piece that's
missing in transferring literacy

02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:35.770 position:56%
from one generation to the next
generation is the older generation's

02:30:35.770 --> 02:30:39.210
inability to try and relate to the
next generation in their art form,

02:30:39.210 --> 02:30:42.090
in their culture, and the
way that they are illiterate.

02:30:42.090 --> 02:30:44.900
Jesse Jackson's organization
revealed accidentally

02:30:44.900 --> 02:30:48.340
that they don't have
anybody younger than 40.

02:30:48.340 --> 02:30:49.640
You know what I'm saying?

02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:54.830
Because somebody would
have gotten the jokes.

02:30:54.830 --> 02:30:57.440
Someone would understand
who Little John was.

02:30:57.440 --> 02:30:58.850
You know what I'm saying?

02:30:58.850 --> 02:31:03.110
Someone would have been --
understood the reference.

02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:08.800
The reason I am saying
that is we have

02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:10.830
to open our ears to
the young people.

02:31:10.830 --> 02:31:12.590
The young people know
what's going on.

02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:15.050
They want to know who to fight.

02:31:15.050 --> 02:31:20.460 position:56%
They want to know how to fight them.

02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:26.280
They want to know how to
get their skills together.

02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:30.940
So please don't be discouraged.

02:31:30.940 --> 02:31:36.280
There was one more
thing I wanted to say.

02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:37.580
I'm always [laughter].

02:31:37.580 --> 02:31:40.040
I'm always afraid I'm
going to miss one

02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:43.550
of the crucial points
I wanted to make.

02:31:43.550 --> 02:31:48.810
But I advocate for these
people, for young people,

02:31:48.810 --> 02:31:50.510
even when they make mistakes.

02:31:50.510 --> 02:31:51.810
That is my job.

02:31:51.810 --> 02:31:53.110
Even when they aren't following
my instructions correctly,

02:31:53.110 --> 02:31:54.410
even when they argue with
these bad things in the street,

02:31:54.410 --> 02:31:55.710
I'm still advocating for them

02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:57.010
because I understand what they're
working against, and it's my job

02:31:57.010 --> 02:31:58.310
to help them articulate
their story better.

02:31:58.310 --> 02:31:59.610
This is the point I wanted to make.

02:31:59.610 --> 02:32:00.910
Every generation thinks the
next generation is going crazy.

02:32:00.910 --> 02:32:02.210
I saw young people
yelling to get the story,

02:32:02.210 --> 02:32:03.510
because I don't have
any young hip-hops,

02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:04.810
so I'll tell you a better version.

02:32:04.810 --> 02:32:06.110
I've seen clips of Ella Fitzgerald
in the middle of a concert

02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:07.410
in the '60s breaking down,

02:32:07.410 --> 02:32:08.710 position:56%
like I don't know what the heck
these young people are listening to.

02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:10.010
She goes into a James Brown
impersonation, all right,

02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:11.310
because in her mind James
Brown is the kid doing this

02:32:11.310 --> 02:32:12.610
what-in-the-heck-is-that-music?

02:32:12.610 --> 02:32:13.910
You know what I'm saying?

02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:15.210
Every generation thinks the
next generation is crazy.

02:32:15.210 --> 02:32:16.510
As the older generation, we need
to start breaking down that wall.

02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:17.810
I want to believe that's
not an African thing to do,

02:32:17.810 --> 02:32:19.110
that every generation respects the
other generation, and understand

02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:20.410
that they are carrying on the
tradition but also building one.

02:32:20.410 --> 02:32:21.710
So what we have to
stop doing is thinking

02:32:21.710 --> 02:32:23.010
that the young people are crazy.

02:32:23.010 --> 02:32:24.310
The young people are a part of us.

02:32:24.310 --> 02:32:25.610
They're taking what we're doing
and remixing it in their own ways,

02:32:25.610 --> 02:32:26.910
and we have to embrace them
and help them become better

02:32:26.910 --> 02:32:28.210
at articulating their voices.

02:32:28.210 --> 02:32:30.010
Thank you very much.

02:32:30.010 --> 02:32:33.390
[ Applause ]

02:32:33.390 --> 02:32:38.910
&gt;&gt; Rahman Branch: I always hate
following Polson MCs [laughter].

02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:43.900
Hate it. Every time
I speak in a place

02:32:43.900 --> 02:32:47.590
and there's a folder MC
there I always [inaudible].

02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:49.880
They're like the headliner, right?

02:32:49.880 --> 02:32:54.350
I've known Bomani for
years and I never want

02:32:54.350 --> 02:32:56.560
to go behind him [inaudible].

02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:59.010
My name is Rahman Branch.

02:32:59.010 --> 02:33:03.900
I'm a liberator by definition,
and I say that because

02:33:03.900 --> 02:33:08.160
so many things being similar,
my first gift from my uncle

02:33:08.160 --> 02:33:09.800
at 12 was <i>Stolen Legacy </i>,

02:33:09.800 --> 02:33:15.070
which kind of spiraled my
belief system and such.

02:33:15.070 --> 02:33:17.240
But I think I've used
several different things

02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:22.420
over the last many years to
push for black liberation.

02:33:22.420 --> 02:33:26.210
What I've used in the
past has been education.

02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:28.150
I've used politics.

02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:33.290
I've used music, and I think
all those different ways

02:33:33.290 --> 02:33:34.820
to get to the goal.

02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:36.540
But I've started to
find ways to kind

02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:39.040
of incorporate everything together.

02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:41.800
Currently I'm the Executive
Director for the Mayor's Office

02:33:41.800 --> 02:33:44.540
on African American
Affairs here in Washington,

02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:49.830
D.C. But my most exciting job
ever, and my most loved job ever,

02:33:49.830 --> 02:33:51.740
was as a high school principal.

02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:54.370 position:56%
Before I took over that I was a high
school principal of a school here

02:33:54.370 --> 02:33:55.820
in D.C. called Ballou High School.

02:33:55.820 --> 02:33:57.930
Anyone know Ballou a little bit?

02:33:57.930 --> 02:33:59.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

02:33:59.230 --> 02:34:00.530
&gt;&gt; Rahman Branch: A little bit?

02:34:00.530 --> 02:34:01.830
Yeah? It's the best school.

02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:03.130
It's a -- hello.

02:34:03.130 --> 02:34:04.430
It's the M.C. in me.

02:34:04.430 --> 02:34:05.730
Ain't that right?

02:34:05.730 --> 02:34:07.030
A Ballou High School?

02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:08.330
&gt;&gt; Bomani Armah: Yeah.

02:34:08.330 --> 02:34:09.630
[ Laughter ]

02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:10.930
&gt;&gt; Rahman Branch: So
does anybody know

02:34:10.930 --> 02:34:12.230
that Ballou High School
is the best school

02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:13.530
in the city of Washington, D.C.?

02:34:13.530 --> 02:34:15.330
You understand that.

02:34:15.330 --> 02:34:17.810
Got to make some noise [laughter].

02:34:17.810 --> 02:34:19.310
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyah Muhammad:
Make some noise.

02:34:19.310 --> 02:34:20.610
&gt;&gt; Rahman Branch: Geez.

02:34:20.610 --> 02:34:23.080
So I adopted a high school where,
on my first day as I'm walking

02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:25.440
into the hallway, there's
a young man sitting

02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:29.690
on the floor smoking a cigarette
in front of the main office.

02:34:29.690 --> 02:34:33.390
It was a school that was
popular for all the wrong reasons

02:34:33.390 --> 02:34:40.720
and there was a teachable moment
at that point, on my first day,

02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:44.900
seven minutes into the day, and
I encountered an opportunity

02:34:44.900 --> 02:34:50.080
to help someone understand that
they're meant for something better.

02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:57.530 position:56%
So I began to actually step over the
young person to get to the office

02:34:57.530 --> 02:35:01.970
and he makes a noise as
if I'm invading his space

02:35:01.970 --> 02:35:03.650
and he's offended by that.

02:35:03.650 --> 02:35:08.050
The young man kind of makes a noise
and kind of stands up to his feet

02:35:08.050 --> 02:35:11.490
and at that moment, for me
as the adult, I wanted to --

02:35:11.490 --> 02:35:13.770
I had the unchoice to make,

02:35:13.770 --> 02:35:20.010
and the choice was do I let these
young people know that you're crazy

02:35:20.010 --> 02:35:21.630
and I have to now address that?

02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:24.220
Do I take that route
or is there another way

02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:27.500
to have a teachable moment?

02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:29.830
Every young person
will tell you at Ballou

02:35:29.830 --> 02:35:33.740 position:56%
that I've always used the term
"conversation brings about clarity,"

02:35:33.740 --> 02:35:36.850
so the conversation I had
with the young man was

02:35:36.850 --> 02:35:39.600
that what you're doing
is unacceptable.

02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:44.910
I introduced myself as an
adult, not as the principal,

02:35:44.910 --> 02:35:48.460
and that there should be a
different exchange we have.

02:35:48.460 --> 02:35:50.900
The young man thought
that wasn't good enough

02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:56.860
and so then my teachable moment
became -- I'm six foot five,

02:35:56.860 --> 02:36:00.870
320 pounds [laughter],
and I'm not an easy take.

02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:04.610
So we had a different kind of
conversation at that point.

02:36:04.610 --> 02:36:06.700
So there was a teachable moment

02:36:06.700 --> 02:36:09.200
in that [laughter]
moment right there, right?

02:36:09.200 --> 02:36:12.830
It was we can go about this one
way or there's another series

02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:14.370
of things that can occur.

02:36:14.370 --> 02:36:16.990
Needless to say, we got to
a agreeable place [laughter]

02:36:16.990 --> 02:36:19.780
and that young man moved forward.

02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:22.910
One of the things that
I realized when I got

02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:28.720
to the high school was the
amount of despair that existed,

02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:34.290
the lack of belief that existed,
the level of apathy that existed,

02:36:34.290 --> 02:36:37.900
and that's before I met
any of the children.

02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:39.480
That's before I met any
of the young people.

02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:43.370
That's where I met adults in
the neighborhood and adults

02:36:43.370 --> 02:36:49.250
in the school who had lost hope in
what our children could accomplish.

02:36:49.250 --> 02:36:51.040
The conversations that kind

02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:55.200
of ensued always became
about those kids.

02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:58.190
At some point the conversation
had to turn

02:36:58.190 --> 02:37:01.190
into these kids are a
product of what we have

02:37:01.190 --> 02:37:03.850
or haven't done as adults.

02:37:03.850 --> 02:37:06.880
That case was making many of
the decisions that brought them

02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:08.710
to this space physically,
that brought them

02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:10.640
to this space emotionally
and mentally.

02:37:10.640 --> 02:37:14.470
It's what we have or haven't done
as the adults who are responsible

02:37:14.470 --> 02:37:17.700
for the care of and the
teaching of these young people.

02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:20.990
So the conversation that we
began to have, had as a staff,

02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:22.630
began to turn because one

02:37:22.630 --> 02:37:29.030 position:56%
of the things I thought was the most
important lesson we teach the school

02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:30.430
was literacy.

02:37:30.430 --> 02:37:37.480
It came from the reading of the
last valedictorian's speech,

02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:40.650
the valedictorian of the
class before I arrived.

02:37:40.650 --> 02:37:43.240
Seeing the speech of this
student who was the valedictorian

02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:45.570
with a 3.9 grade point average,

02:37:45.570 --> 02:37:50.070
and recognizing fourth-grade
literacy skills within it,

02:37:50.070 --> 02:37:53.530
and the kind of crime
that was committed

02:37:53.530 --> 02:37:57.350
by so many adults to
allow this to happen.

02:37:57.350 --> 02:37:59.820
The crime that had been
committed by so many people

02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:02.650
to say this our brightest star.

02:38:02.650 --> 02:38:06.080
We're going to put this person on
stage for the world to see knowing

02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:08.860
that we haven't done
this child justice.

02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:13.860
There was the necessity
of having the culture

02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:15.270
of conversation at our school.

02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:17.910
Everything was on the
table to talk about.

02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:21.790
We were able to discuss everything,
and that was from decisions

02:38:21.790 --> 02:38:26.090
that I'd made as the principal,
that was decisions that our adults

02:38:26.090 --> 02:38:28.450
in the building had made
that I clearly wanted

02:38:28.450 --> 02:38:29.870
to have a discussion about.

02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:33.300
That came with the conversation
that we had to have with children

02:38:33.300 --> 02:38:36.460
because we all were assumed
we knew what they wanted.

02:38:36.460 --> 02:38:38.780
We all assumed we knew
where they were coming from,

02:38:38.780 --> 02:38:41.950
and we were way off
track to the point

02:38:41.950 --> 02:38:44.840
of what exists in various cultures.

02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:48.780
Our young people were speaking
a language that identified

02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:52.660
with the culture that many adults
had chosen to remove themselves

02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:55.770
from as if they're
not of it or from it.

02:38:55.770 --> 02:39:01.270 position:56%
There was a teacher who told his
science class and, pardon my French,

02:39:01.270 --> 02:39:05.410
but I'm quoting him directly.

02:39:05.410 --> 02:39:08.630
"I'd make more money off you
niggers opening a funeral home

02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:11.320
than I would teaching you."

02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:13.620
Yeah. So we had -- so there's a --

02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:17.910
so in a cultural conversation there
was the necessity of understanding

02:39:17.910 --> 02:39:23.660
that this person had severe,
severe issues mentally to think

02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:26.940
that was all right to say
to a roomful of children.

02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:30.330
We had to then -- so we
had a teachable moment

02:39:30.330 --> 02:39:32.820
with that teacher and myself.

02:39:32.820 --> 02:39:36.360
It entailed a closed and
locked door and [laughter]

02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:41.990
at a conference room table and,
needless to say, he made his exit

02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:43.950
from Ballou soon after that.

02:39:43.950 --> 02:39:49.120
But there was the necessity
of fighting for our children,

02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:51.670
which a lot of us aren't
doing, and in fighting

02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:54.420
for our children there is a
necessity of letting them know.

02:39:54.420 --> 02:39:58.260
That was an amazing poem that I
actually wrote into my device here

02:39:58.260 --> 02:40:00.120
which is that we start
[inaudible] our grandchildren.

02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:01.850
Well then we're finished.

02:40:01.850 --> 02:40:05.650
There's a necessity in making
sure we understand that continuum

02:40:05.650 --> 02:40:10.120
as not just one directional.

02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:13.300
We have an obligation to learn and
understand who our children are

02:40:13.300 --> 02:40:14.730
because then we can
impart information

02:40:14.730 --> 02:40:16.620
to them in a much better sense.

02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:20.430
So as we got to the place where
we had a culture of conversation,

02:40:20.430 --> 02:40:23.180
we made sure that we
had opportunities

02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:25.470
for young people to
express themselves.

02:40:25.470 --> 02:40:30.270
In my other life in music I
represented a group called the

02:40:30.270 --> 02:40:31.570
Unspoken Herd.

02:40:31.570 --> 02:40:35.220
There's a young man named Asheru,
a young man's named Blue Black,

02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:39.050
and we were hip-hop musicians.

02:40:39.050 --> 02:40:42.460
Still are to some degree
but at some point you put

02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:44.590
on a shirt and a tie for songs.

02:40:44.590 --> 02:40:50.020
So what we did was we brought that
group into the school and we had

02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:53.750
to figure out ways to get literacy
across to our young people.

02:40:53.750 --> 02:40:59.680
We found values in our
young people's value system.

02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:03.690 position:56%
We found valuable information in the
news our young people listened to.

02:41:03.690 --> 02:41:05.150 position:56%
The beautiful thing about hip-hop --

02:41:05.150 --> 02:41:07.680
and I am also of the
hip-hop culture --

02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:11.180
and I had to put that out there
first most times that I speak.

02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:13.440
The thing about hip-hop
that's so beautiful is

02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:16.250
that there is a blending
if you will.

02:41:16.250 --> 02:41:19.580
There's a real blurred
line between what is adult

02:41:19.580 --> 02:41:21.900
and what is not adult
as far as music.

02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:25.730
Within hip-hop you can turn on
the radio station and your child

02:41:25.730 --> 02:41:29.700
and you are oftentimes listening
to some of the same music.

02:41:29.700 --> 02:41:32.060
So we found common
places within that.

02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:34.090
By finding those common places --

02:41:34.090 --> 02:41:37.590
the young man asked a
roommate, a remarkable product.

02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:39.280
I think he'll be here shortly.

02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:42.180
He made a remarkable product
called the HELP Project,

02:41:42.180 --> 02:41:45.820
and the HELP Program is
a hip-hop literacy tool.

02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:47.210
He'll do it much better than I can.

02:41:47.210 --> 02:41:51.040
But it ultimately takes
popular hip-hop music

02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:56.620 position:56%
with a socially conscious message
and it binds literacy lessons to it,

02:41:56.620 --> 02:41:59.160
based upon national
reading standards.

02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:00.870
As I looked at the product

02:42:00.870 --> 02:42:03.480
and I thought it would be
a great opportunity for us,

02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:04.930
we brought that into the school

02:42:04.930 --> 02:42:08.150
and we saw young people's
engagement increase.

02:42:08.150 --> 02:42:10.350
Their interest in what
was going on increased.

02:42:10.350 --> 02:42:12.290
Their participation
in class increased

02:42:12.290 --> 02:42:15.790 position:56%
because there were teachable moments
both ways, from both the adult

02:42:15.790 --> 02:42:19.140
and the child around this work
because kids saw themselves

02:42:19.140 --> 02:42:22.670
in the work and they were able
to express a level of knowledge

02:42:22.670 --> 02:42:24.280
about what was being presented.

02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:28.030
They were in-room experts
on the topics.

02:42:28.030 --> 02:42:29.640
A lot of our teachers, one

02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:32.030
of them walking away having
learned a whole heck of a lot,

02:42:32.030 --> 02:42:36.880
one of those things being a
value in who our young people are

02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:38.790
and what they're expressing.

02:42:38.790 --> 02:42:41.040
A really, really exciting thing
happened as a result of that.

02:42:41.040 --> 02:42:45.730
We saw our math and reading scores
that year go up by 18 and 20 points

02:42:45.730 --> 02:42:48.380
which we thought, or
the world thought,

02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:50.770
would never happen at
Ballou High School.

02:42:50.770 --> 02:42:53.720
But it was funny because one
of the young men who had been

02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:58.710
in Asheru's class says to our
class of students, "The cool thing

02:42:58.710 --> 02:43:03.210
about this is now that they know we
can learn, they'll no longer come

02:43:03.210 --> 02:43:05.250
and tell us what we have to do.

02:43:05.250 --> 02:43:07.320
They'll come and ask
us what we want to do."

02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:10.670
That's how empowerment was probably
one of the most beautiful moments

02:43:10.670 --> 02:43:11.970
that we experienced at the school.

02:43:11.970 --> 02:43:15.250
It became the lynchpin for all
the things that we began to do.

02:43:15.250 --> 02:43:18.980
Someone else in this room is
of Ballou experience as well.

02:43:18.980 --> 02:43:21.740
There's been several
opportunities for us

02:43:21.740 --> 02:43:25.130
to make sure young people
have avenues of expression.

02:43:25.130 --> 02:43:27.860
When they have those avenues
of expression they want

02:43:27.860 --> 02:43:30.910
to make sure they come off
correct, that they perform,

02:43:30.910 --> 02:43:33.820
as they communicate, well,
so they're opening this --

02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:37.270
their willingness to literature
and literacy began to skyrocket.

02:43:37.270 --> 02:43:39.230
"I want to say this right
in front of the crowd.

02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:40.680
Can you help me with this speech?

02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:42.300
I want to do this right in front

02:43:42.300 --> 02:43:43.900
of the Chancellor when
we show our PSA's.

02:43:43.900 --> 02:43:45.740
Can you help me write the script?

02:43:45.740 --> 02:43:47.040
I'll [inaudible] better."

02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:50.240
So young people, as they start
to see relevance in the work

02:43:50.240 --> 02:43:54.260 position:56%
that we're providing and opportunity
to express themselves within it,

02:43:54.260 --> 02:43:58.530
their engagement and desire
around academics began to increase

02:43:58.530 --> 02:44:02.660
and it was our cool scoopful of
sugar to help the medicine go down,

02:44:02.660 --> 02:44:05.360
if you will, and it's that
kind of work that I feel --

02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:09.090
it has to continue to happen.

02:44:09.090 --> 02:44:11.470
I see that my time is up.

02:44:11.470 --> 02:44:13.740
But literacy is important.

02:44:13.740 --> 02:44:17.330
Once we understand that young
people have information to give,

02:44:17.330 --> 02:44:18.920
then literacy can go both ways.

02:44:18.920 --> 02:44:20.220
All right?

02:44:20.220 --> 02:44:21.520
Thank you.

02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:22.820
[ Applause ]

02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:24.120
What is my role?

02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:26.330
As the Executive Director of the
Office on African American Affairs,

02:44:26.330 --> 02:44:27.910
what I envision my role to be?

02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:32.080
To continue this conversation,
move this platform forward,

02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:34.810
and also get residents
of the district engaged

02:44:34.810 --> 02:44:37.150
in supporting this effort.

02:44:37.150 --> 02:44:42.300
Okay. So, but the big three for the
Office of African American Affairs

02:44:42.300 --> 02:44:46.380
in direct conversation with
my immediate supervisor,

02:44:46.380 --> 02:44:51.410
Mayor Muriel Bowser, is to
push housing, education,

02:44:51.410 --> 02:44:52.980
and economic opportunity.

02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:55.470
If we want African Americans
to thrive in the city,

02:44:55.470 --> 02:44:59.290
we know that housing is way
out control as far as cost.

02:44:59.290 --> 02:45:02.100
We know that education
is a situation that needs

02:45:02.100 --> 02:45:03.800
to be drastically improved.

02:45:03.800 --> 02:45:06.680
We know that there has to be more
opportunities for African Americans

02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:09.780
to open businesses, to
establish themselves financially

02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:11.080
in the district.

02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:14.870
Specifically around education,
I think that the first thing

02:45:14.870 --> 02:45:20.240
that I would probably say, and this
is a shameless plug, is that events

02:45:20.240 --> 02:45:23.410
like the Juneteenth Book
Festival need to be a part

02:45:23.410 --> 02:45:25.230
of our annual conversation.

02:45:25.230 --> 02:45:28.160
It needs to be part
of annual programming,

02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:30.290
not just from an independent
organization

02:45:30.290 --> 02:45:33.830
but from the city's standpoint,
from the community's standpoint,

02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:37.500
we have to begin to make sure
the world knows that we want this

02:45:37.500 --> 02:45:40.110
and we need to have this
conversation consistently

02:45:40.110 --> 02:45:41.800
and constantly.

02:45:41.800 --> 02:45:44.410
The more we make noise
about its importance,

02:45:44.410 --> 02:45:46.450
the world tends to respond.

02:45:46.450 --> 02:45:49.270
If I've seen anything throughout
the history of the diasporas,

02:45:49.270 --> 02:45:53.670
that when we make something a big
deal, that the universe responds

02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:55.910
to meet our needs, and so I
think that's the first thing

02:45:55.910 --> 02:45:58.730
that the residents should
do is make sure we're vocal.

02:45:58.730 --> 02:46:01.130
It's important to an
event like this.

02:46:01.130 --> 02:46:03.740
Additionally, Bomani
brought up a great point

02:46:03.740 --> 02:46:07.920
about the algorhythm he kind of
discovered in Baltimore, right,

02:46:07.920 --> 02:46:10.390
by professionals and
giving some time

02:46:10.390 --> 02:46:13.020
to your local school in
that 10-block radius.

02:46:13.020 --> 02:46:16.120
The funny thing is, at Ballou we
made -- we had a little struggle --

02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:19.370 position:56%
sure it was with a six-block radius.

02:46:19.370 --> 02:46:21.630
But in every direction we
called that my country,

02:46:21.630 --> 02:46:24.890 position:56%
and we figured it was our
responsibility to make sure everyone

02:46:24.890 --> 02:46:28.530
in the community was aware
of, and felt a comfort

02:46:28.530 --> 02:46:31.090
in engaging the school,
because the days

02:46:31.090 --> 02:46:34.180 position:56%
of the adults are inside the
building, and so we don't have a lot

02:46:34.180 --> 02:46:36.310
of energy to go and poke it loud.

02:46:36.310 --> 02:46:40.930 position:56%
But we did want to make sure we made
an inviting situation for anyone

02:46:40.930 --> 02:46:43.900
who wanted to give to or
support our young people

02:46:43.900 --> 02:46:49.590
because the more hands we have
on deck, the easier the lift is.

02:46:49.590 --> 02:46:52.340
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] you're the
first Director of the Office

02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:55.030
on African American Affairs.

02:46:55.030 --> 02:47:00.640
Do you think this is going to be a
tradition that tries to [inaudible]

02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:03.010
around America or [inaudible]?

02:47:03.010 --> 02:47:06.080
&gt;&gt; Rahman Branch: So in looking it
up, I am the first in D.C., yes.

02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:08.140
In looking it up, I think there --

02:47:08.140 --> 02:47:13.300
I'm the first one in the
country in a major city.

02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:14.600
Yeah. I --

02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:15.900
&gt;&gt; You laid the foundation for
what happens in [inaudible].

02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:17.200
&gt;&gt; Rahman Branch: Ha-ha.

02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:18.500
&gt;&gt; Bomani Armah: Good.

02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:19.800
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyah Muhammad: Yeah.

02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:21.100
&gt;&gt; Bomani Armah: The
Director of African Affairs,

02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:22.400
so he used to be called
the Mayor [laughter].

02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:23.700
&gt;&gt; Rahman Branch: Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:47:23.700 --> 02:47:25.000
So the awkward thing is that --

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:28.320
as we've seen gentrification
occur we do know

02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:31.880 position:56%
that in 1990 there were -- this is a
way tangent so I'll be really brief.

02:47:31.880 --> 02:47:34.750
We know that in 1990,
Washington, D.C. --

02:47:34.750 --> 02:47:38.030
71% of the District of Columbia
residents were African American.

02:47:38.030 --> 02:47:41.440
We know that in 2013
it dropped to 49%.

02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:44.620
So if anyone tells you
that's not alarming,

02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:46.650
then they're completely
buggered out.

02:47:46.650 --> 02:47:49.310
It's not just a D.C. phenomenon.

02:47:49.310 --> 02:47:51.000
It's happening in North
New Jersey where I'm from.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.300
It's happening in Chicago.

02:47:52.300 --> 02:47:53.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyah Muhammad: New York City.

02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:54.900
&gt;&gt; Rahman Branch: It's
happening in New York City.

02:47:54.900 --> 02:47:56.200
It's happen -- I mean,
Brooklyn is not Brooklyn any --

02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:57.500
it's not the planet anymore.

02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:58.800
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyah Muhammad: That's right.

02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:00.100
&gt;&gt; Rahman Branch: It's
something much different.

02:48:00.100 --> 02:48:04.400 position:56%
So there is a need for this template
to be followed in other places.

02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:05.700
Thank you.

02:48:05.700 --> 02:48:07.000
&gt;&gt; Bomani Armah: I got you.

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.090
I think we have to start --

02:48:09.090 --> 02:48:12.910
we have stop guaranteeing
our children things based

02:48:12.910 --> 02:48:16.750
on the United States
economic [inaudible] policy.

02:48:16.750 --> 02:48:18.100
I think we have to stop saying

02:48:18.100 --> 02:48:20.040
that if you get educated
you'll get a job.

02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:21.690
If you do the right
things you'll get a job.

02:48:21.690 --> 02:48:24.960
That if you participate, these
good things will happen for them.

02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:26.380
Well, when you start
telling young people this --

02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:28.700
you need to learn to be literate,
you need to learn to be educated

02:48:28.700 --> 02:48:30.700
so you can relate with
your own people.

02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:33.650
So you and your people can make
it better no matter what goes

02:48:33.650 --> 02:48:34.950
on around you.

02:48:34.950 --> 02:48:36.610
I think that -- you stay
down here and what you see --

02:48:36.610 --> 02:48:39.850
your daughter may tell you son is
that there's some kind of guarantee

02:48:39.850 --> 02:48:42.270
in literacy beyond the
ability to communicate.

02:48:42.270 --> 02:48:45.340
There is no guarantee other
than the ability to communicate.

02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:48.800
But that ability to communicate
can lead to a whole bunch

02:48:48.800 --> 02:48:50.100
of other beautiful things.

02:48:50.100 --> 02:48:55.610
But I do like -- I personally
am wary of telling young people

02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:59.210
to further [inaudible] to enter
the system that we have here,

02:48:59.210 --> 02:49:02.690
that if you pass and you get
the stamp from the state council

02:49:02.690 --> 02:49:05.160
or the county council in education
that you have an education,

02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:06.460
that that guarantees you a future.

02:49:06.460 --> 02:49:10.240
I mean we have enough issue to know
that that's not necessarily true.

02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:15.320
I also think that we are still
begging for a group to see us

02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:18.040
as human, to invite us in, and
they do every once in a while,

02:49:18.040 --> 02:49:21.190
but we need to be okay whether
or not they let us or not.

02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:23.230
I got asked in an interview
the other day how I felt

02:49:23.230 --> 02:49:24.530
about Black Lives Matter.

02:49:24.530 --> 02:49:26.220
I'm sorry.

02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:27.520
Paying a little bit of attention.

02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:30.210
How I felt about Black Lives
Matter, and I am unable

02:49:30.210 --> 02:49:34.110
to repeat it forcefully because
saying black lives matter feels

02:49:34.110 --> 02:49:35.490
like saying water if wet.

02:49:35.490 --> 02:49:39.180
It feels like -- it
shouldn't be news.

02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:40.480
You know what I'm saying?

02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:42.680
If we're still explaining to people
that we are human, we need to --

02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:43.980
like that was my father's fight.

02:49:43.980 --> 02:49:45.280
I'm done with that fight.

02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:48.120
I'm done explaining
to people my humanity.

02:49:48.120 --> 02:49:50.210
I'm trying to learn
how to communicate

02:49:50.210 --> 02:49:53.500
with other African Americans,
other people who relate

02:49:53.500 --> 02:49:56.490
to African Americans and provide
job opportunities amongst us,

02:49:56.490 --> 02:49:57.790
so it doesn't matter if they
see me [inaudible] or not.

02:49:57.790 --> 02:49:59.130
People ask me for -- why'd you
give your sons such funny names

02:49:59.130 --> 02:50:00.510
and not be able to get a job?

02:50:00.510 --> 02:50:01.960
Good. Good.

02:50:01.960 --> 02:50:05.660
All right, folks, if you're working
for a racist who doesn't like you

02:50:05.660 --> 02:50:07.910
because you have some
racial or ethnic connection

02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:10.950
that you feel strong about, but
you've saved yourself some time

02:50:10.950 --> 02:50:13.530
by having that name and them
[inaudible] over your application.

02:50:13.530 --> 02:50:15.340
My sons learn [inaudible]
other Africans

02:50:15.340 --> 02:50:16.640
and African Americans
looking for jobs.

02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:20.400
So I would encourage your child to
read so he can better communicate

02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.200 position:56%
with his community, with his people,
and that we will find a way whether

02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:26.500
or not they hire him or not.

02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:29.580
Here's the other one, and this
is what I tell all young people.

02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:30.880
Tell your story.

02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:32.820
So that they -- and
this especially coming

02:50:32.820 --> 02:50:35.440
from the hip-hop angle
working with young people.

02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:37.470
It tells young people that
their story's interesting.

02:50:37.470 --> 02:50:40.380
So I will go into a classroom,
I will go into a prison,

02:50:40.380 --> 02:50:42.640
I'll go somewhere and be
like, yo, so what's going on?

02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:43.940
Where you from?

02:50:43.940 --> 02:50:45.440
What are your aspirations?

02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:48.350 position:56%
I may be [inaudible], I want to be
a lawyer, I want to be a track star,

02:50:48.350 --> 02:50:50.530
I want to be an engineer,
I want to be a biologist.

02:50:50.530 --> 02:50:51.830
I'm going to be this,
that, and the other.

02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:53.130
Okay. You want to learn how to rap.

02:50:53.130 --> 02:50:54.990
We'll put on the beat
immediately [rapping].

02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:56.290
Like they automatically --

02:50:56.290 --> 02:51:01.210
because they'd been told that
is black art for masculinity.

02:51:01.210 --> 02:51:02.510
They go to that.

02:51:02.510 --> 02:51:03.810
Like, no, we just spoke.

02:51:03.810 --> 02:51:05.110
Your mom's a doctor [laughter].

02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:08.830 position:56%
We just talked, like that's not you.

02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:11.370
Like I really want
to know your story.

02:51:11.370 --> 02:51:14.430
What's going on in your life?

02:51:14.430 --> 02:51:16.210
At one point it changed
a little bit.

02:51:16.210 --> 02:51:19.640
At one point -- the reason
we come [inaudible] is

02:51:19.640 --> 02:51:21.640
like in the [inaudible]
top 10 artists,

02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:23.210
seven out of 10 are
always a gangster

02:51:23.210 --> 02:51:25.570
or very closely gangster related.

02:51:25.570 --> 02:51:27.040
I would go into the
worst neighborhoods.

02:51:27.040 --> 02:51:28.340
I'd go to Trinidad.

02:51:28.340 --> 02:51:29.640
I'd be like I'll show
them this stat.

02:51:29.640 --> 02:51:31.870 position:56%
I'll show them the seven [inaudible]
recognize who are gangsters.

02:51:31.870 --> 02:51:33.230
Sometimes eight or nine.

02:51:33.230 --> 02:51:35.800
I'm like, so they say
eight out or nine people

02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:38.280
in the black community
are gang/drug related.

02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:39.760
I'll say, "Do you live in Trinidad?

02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:42.710
Are eight out of every 10 people
you know are drug related?"

02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:44.130
They're like, "Yeah."

02:51:44.130 --> 02:51:45.540
I'm like, "No, think about it.

02:51:45.540 --> 02:51:47.060
Eight out of 10?

02:51:47.060 --> 02:51:48.550
Like that's the mailman.

02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:50.200
That's a Sunday school teacher.

02:51:50.200 --> 02:51:52.850
Like there's a whole life
happening outside of this."

02:51:52.850 --> 02:51:56.090
So my four [inaudible] the first
is, please tell your story.

02:51:56.090 --> 02:51:59.270
Don't feel the need to say what
you think black people are supposed

02:51:59.270 --> 02:52:00.570
to be doing.

02:52:00.570 --> 02:52:03.770
One of my favorite
black -- oh, who is it?

02:52:03.770 --> 02:52:07.400
[Inaudible] was getting a lot of
flak for not writing black poetry.

02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:09.000 position:56%
He wasn't writing about black stuff.

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.370
He said, "I'm black.

02:52:11.370 --> 02:52:12.670
I wrote a poem.

02:52:12.670 --> 02:52:13.970
It's black poetry [laughter]."

02:52:13.970 --> 02:52:15.270
That's what we got to
tell our young people.

02:52:15.270 --> 02:52:16.570
They need to tell their story.

02:52:16.570 --> 02:52:17.870
Thank you.

02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:19.170
&gt;&gt; I just want to add to that.

02:52:19.170 --> 02:52:22.110
I would say also find
out what your passion is

02:52:22.110 --> 02:52:24.760
because I think that's
what's motivating the people.

02:52:24.760 --> 02:52:26.620
What if it that you like?

02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:28.170
What are you passionate about?

02:52:28.170 --> 02:52:29.670
Make that your life's work.

02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:33.460
It's not -- don't be
concerned about finding a job.

02:52:33.460 --> 02:52:35.710
Be concerned about finding
what your passion is,

02:52:35.710 --> 02:52:37.930
and then you won't even
realize you're working.

02:52:37.930 --> 02:52:39.230
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyah Muhammad: Mm-hmm.

02:52:39.230 --> 02:52:40.530
&gt;&gt; Bomani Armah: Amen.

02:52:40.530 --> 02:52:42.730
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Marita Golden,
writer, literary activist,

02:52:42.730 --> 02:52:45.350 position:56%
and head of the Zora Hurston/Richard
Wright Foundation [applause],

02:52:45.350 --> 02:52:50.210
and I just was just so amazed
by this wonderful panel,

02:52:50.210 --> 02:52:53.240
and the brother mentioned -- you
said Komunyakaa, and I have to,

02:52:53.240 --> 02:52:55.130
now that I have a captive audience,

02:52:55.130 --> 02:52:57.680
let you know that this
is the 25th anniversary

02:52:57.680 --> 02:52:59.030
of the Hurston/Wright Foundation,

02:52:59.030 --> 02:53:03.540
and for 25 years we've been
creating community safe spaces

02:53:03.540 --> 02:53:05.750
for black writers, teens, adults,

02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:08.210
and the international
community of black writers.

02:53:08.210 --> 02:53:12.350
October 23rd will be 25th
anniversary celebration

02:53:12.350 --> 02:53:15.010
and annual Legacy Award.

02:53:15.010 --> 02:53:18.060
This year we will be
honoring Edwidge Danticat

02:53:18.060 --> 02:53:20.080
with our North Star Award.

02:53:20.080 --> 02:53:22.610
Yusef Komunyakaa and Nikki
Finis have been asked

02:53:22.610 --> 02:53:27.400
to compose original poems that they
will read in honor of Zora Hurston

02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:31.020
and Richard Wright, and
the law and order lady,

02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:32.470
Effie Pinker Merkison
[assumed spelling] is going

02:53:32.470 --> 02:53:34.850
to be our Mistress of Ceremony.

02:53:34.850 --> 02:53:38.970
We have a wonderful -- we
have 18 black writers from all

02:53:38.970 --> 02:53:42.330
over the world who had been
nominated for the Legacy Award,

02:53:42.330 --> 02:53:45.590
and who will be in attendance,
including Charles Blow,

02:53:45.590 --> 02:53:49.070
the <i>New York Times </i>columnist,
Chris Avanni [assumed spelling],

02:53:49.070 --> 02:53:51.390
and so it's going to
be a wonderful event.

02:53:51.390 --> 02:53:55.770
Go to www.hurstonwright.org.,
join our mailing list.

02:53:55.770 --> 02:53:58.510
I'll see you there.

02:53:58.510 --> 02:54:00.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; We have the great honor of having

02:54:00.810 --> 02:54:05.140
with us Congresswoman
Eleanor Holmes Norton,

02:54:05.140 --> 02:54:07.510
and the Congresswoman is now --

02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:11.680
[ Applause ]

02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:14.560
-- I'm really -- we're
really delighted,

02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:18.320
honored, and -- I don't know.

02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:19.620
I'm losing my words.

02:54:19.620 --> 02:54:23.780
But, anyway, we're
delighted to have you.

02:54:23.780 --> 02:54:29.350
Congresswoman Norton is now in
her 13th term as a Congresswoman

02:54:29.350 --> 02:54:31.430
for the District of Columbia.

02:54:31.430 --> 02:54:32.730
She's the ranking member

02:54:32.730 --> 02:54:36.270
of the House Sub-Committee
on Highways and Transit.

02:54:36.270 --> 02:54:39.230
She serves on two committees,
the Committee on Oversight

02:54:39.230 --> 02:54:41.360
and Government Reform
and the Committee

02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:44.080
on Transportation Infrastructure.

02:54:44.080 --> 02:54:47.470 position:56%
Before her Congressional Service,
President Jimmy Carter appointed her

02:54:47.470 --> 02:54:51.790
to serve as the first woman to
chair the U.S. Equal Employment

02:54:51.790 --> 02:54:53.660
Opportunity Commission.

02:54:53.660 --> 02:54:57.860
She came to Congress as a national
figure who had been a civil rights

02:54:57.860 --> 02:55:02.470 position:56%
and feminist leader, a tenured
Professor of Law, and a board member

02:55:02.470 --> 02:55:05.550
at three Fortune 500 companies.

02:55:05.550 --> 02:55:08.130
Congresswoman Norton
has been named one

02:55:08.130 --> 02:55:12.240
of the 100 Most Important
American Women in one survey,

02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:16.430
and one of the most powerful
women in Washington in another.

02:55:16.430 --> 02:55:19.540
The Congresswoman's work for
full Congressional voting

02:55:19.540 --> 02:55:22.500
and presentation and for
full democracy for the people

02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:26.980
of the District of Columbia
continues her lifelong struggle

02:55:26.980 --> 02:55:31.140
for universal human
and civil rights.

02:55:31.140 --> 02:55:34.050
Her accomplishments
have been enormous

02:55:34.050 --> 02:55:40.020 position:56%
and I will just skip a number of
them just -- and point out to a few.

02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:45.390
The most significant of her
economic development projects

02:55:45.390 --> 02:55:50.820
that she's had was to bring
to D.C. the U.S. Department

02:55:50.820 --> 02:55:54.290
of Homeland Security
Headquarters Compound,

02:55:54.290 --> 02:55:58.410 position:56%
which is the largest Federal
construction project in the country.

02:55:58.410 --> 02:56:00.850
She has also been successful
in bringing

02:56:00.850 --> 02:56:04.300 position:56%
to the District the new
headquarters for the U.S. Department

02:56:04.300 --> 02:56:08.700
of Transportation and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms,

02:56:08.700 --> 02:56:12.530
along with an additional Metro
Station at New York University --

02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:17.150
New York Avenue, sorry, which
has resulted in the development

02:56:17.150 --> 02:56:18.490
of the [inaudible] neighborhood.

02:56:18.490 --> 02:56:22.200
The Congressman who taught law

02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:25.920
for a time before being elected
is a tenured Professor of Law

02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:30.210
at Georgetown University, teaching
an upper-class seminar there

02:56:30.210 --> 02:56:31.510
every year.

02:56:31.510 --> 02:56:34.470
After receiving her Bachelor's
Degree from Antioch College

02:56:34.470 --> 02:56:38.890 position:56%
in Ohio she simultaneously earned
her Law Degree and a Master's Degree

02:56:38.890 --> 02:56:41.760
in American Studies
from Yale University.

02:56:41.760 --> 02:56:45.500
Yale Law School has awarded
her the Citation of Merit

02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:48.840
for Outstanding Alumni, and
Yale Graduate School of Arts

02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:52.010
and Sciences has awarded
her the Wilbur Cross Medal

02:56:52.010 --> 02:56:58.120
for Outstanding Alumni, the highest
awards confirmed by each on alumni.

02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:01.910
She's the recipient of more
than 50 honorary degrees,

02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:03.700
and I'm just cutting it very short

02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:05.510
so that we can hear
from the Congresswoman.

02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:10.140
[ Applause ]

02:57:10.140 --> 02:57:13.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:17.320
It is a very special honor
to say a few words to you

02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:23.110
at what is your first
Juneteenth Book Festival.

02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:30.270
I appreciate this English speakers
who have spoken and will speak.

02:57:30.270 --> 02:57:37.610 position:56%
I particularly appreciate your theme
that relates Juneteenth to literacy,

02:57:37.610 --> 02:57:44.980
to literature, to American artists.

02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:50.320
Juneteenth, of course, is
not nationally celebrated

02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:56.200 position:56%
because it is not well enough known.

02:57:56.200 --> 02:58:00.840
That's why I appreciate that
here in the nation's Library

02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:04.200
of Congress you are
having this symposium,

02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:09.300
this two-day book festival,
which will draw attention

02:58:09.300 --> 02:58:16.800
to this very important, yes, event
in our nation's history, and,

02:58:16.800 --> 02:58:22.940
of course, I note that we're in the
150th anniversary of the Civil War.

02:58:22.940 --> 02:58:32.260
You have found a really
seminal way to link our past

02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:39.790
with our future because, if you
just think a moment about it,

02:58:39.790 --> 02:58:47.920
literacy is as much a key to the
future of our young people today

02:58:47.920 --> 02:58:54.590
as the slaves regarded it as
central to their own freedom.

02:58:54.590 --> 02:59:00.380
What was a free man or woman?

02:59:00.380 --> 02:59:04.460
Well, a free man or woman didn't
go around saying free man or woman.

02:59:04.460 --> 02:59:13.260
But a free man or woman had
somehow overcome the resistance

02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:16.260
of the master to literacy.

02:59:16.260 --> 02:59:24.700
A free man or woman
could read and write.

02:59:24.700 --> 02:59:30.150
How rare in a country and at a time

02:59:30.150 --> 02:59:35.890
when it was understood the most
dangerous thing you could do

02:59:35.890 --> 02:59:40.610
for a black man or a black woman
is to teach them to read and write.

02:59:40.610 --> 02:59:45.660
Keep him ignorant and you
will keep him enslaved.

02:59:45.660 --> 02:59:49.570
That was a cardinal principle.

02:59:49.570 --> 02:59:57.870
You know, in a real sense it works
better today than it worked then

02:59:57.870 --> 03:00:05.760
because as illiterate as they
were they yearned for freedom,

03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:10.350
and the first things they wanted to
do was first find their relatives

03:00:10.350 --> 03:00:13.990
who had been sold off into
slavery God knows where,

03:00:13.990 --> 03:00:20.040
and then they wanted to learn,
to do what was forbidden.

03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:26.150
There must be freedom in it if
they said we couldn't do it --

03:00:26.150 --> 03:00:27.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

03:00:27.450 --> 03:00:31.990
&gt;&gt; -- so we got to learn to read
and we've got to learn to write.

03:00:31.990 --> 03:00:33.680
&gt;&gt; Yes.

03:00:33.680 --> 03:00:38.450
&gt;&gt; What a yearning there was
at a time when learning to read

03:00:38.450 --> 03:00:42.910
and write certainly
didn't guarantee you a job.

03:00:42.910 --> 03:00:46.810
You could read and write
as much as you wanted to

03:00:46.810 --> 03:00:53.030 position:56%
and you will still be scrubbing
floors if you could get a job at all

03:00:53.030 --> 03:00:55.140
as a free man or a free woman.

03:00:55.140 --> 03:01:01.200
Yet, if you wanted to feel free --

03:01:01.200 --> 03:01:06.540
you knew your mind was free when
you could put that mind on a piece

03:01:06.540 --> 03:01:11.360
of paper or on a book,
see what it said,

03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:15.000
let alone write it for yourself.

03:01:18.570 --> 03:01:27.550
Somehow or the other we have got
to be able to convey that sense

03:01:27.550 --> 03:01:30.610
that the slaves understood
inherently of what it meant

03:01:30.610 --> 03:01:36.430
to be free to our children
and our young people.

03:01:36.430 --> 03:01:45.000
The most tragic deficiency a child
can have is the inability to read.

03:01:48.990 --> 03:01:58.000
Even if somehow she can't speak,
if she can read she's on her way.

03:02:01.760 --> 03:02:08.560
So for us and for the
African American community,

03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:15.000
reading is as much a priority
today as it was 150 years ago.

03:02:21.210 --> 03:02:25.760
In a real sense if it
was seen as the key

03:02:25.760 --> 03:02:35.450
to freedom then it is obviously
essential to freedom today.

03:02:35.450 --> 03:02:40.870
When reading and writing is
not enough, when appreciation

03:02:40.870 --> 03:02:42.550
for literature, for culture,

03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:46.970
for the world in which
you live is now required.

03:02:46.970 --> 03:02:54.110
But you can't do that if
you can't read and write.

03:02:54.110 --> 03:02:59.770
So how to inspire our young
people, how to use our history.

03:02:59.770 --> 03:03:02.250
That is worth.

03:03:02.250 --> 03:03:08.860
Laid out for us to inspire our
own young people to learn to read

03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:13.830
and write in the very same
way that their forbearers did.

03:03:15.300 --> 03:03:22.250
In this city we are especially
inspired by Juneteenth

03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:33.860 position:56%
because in this city the slaves were
liberated nine months before the

03:03:33.860 --> 03:03:36.450
<i>Emancipation Proclamation </i>.

03:03:36.450 --> 03:03:42.520
We were the first to be liberated.

03:03:42.520 --> 03:03:50.440
So on April 16th in the District
of Columbia that liberation is

03:03:50.440 --> 03:03:53.470
so important that it is a holiday
in the District of Columbia.

03:03:53.470 --> 03:03:56.640
Don't even go to work [laughter].

03:03:56.640 --> 03:03:58.680
That's how important it is.

03:03:58.680 --> 03:04:01.820
So there's a big parade downtown.

03:04:01.820 --> 03:04:03.950
That's our wig day when
everybody else is working.

03:04:03.950 --> 03:04:06.920
Well, we're walking in
the District of Columbia

03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:11.850 position:56%
because we understand how
important being free and free first.

03:04:11.850 --> 03:04:14.150
Oh, my goodness.

03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:21.370
My own great-grandfather, Richard
Holmes, was in the District

03:04:21.370 --> 03:04:26.320
of Columbia on that day that
the slaves in the District

03:04:26.320 --> 03:04:29.410
of Columbia became
the first to be freed.

03:04:29.410 --> 03:04:34.440
He was not a free man.

03:04:34.440 --> 03:04:37.610
He was a runaway slave.

03:04:37.610 --> 03:04:41.460
He walked away from a slave
plantation in Virginia

03:04:41.460 --> 03:04:44.180
and made his way to Washington.

03:04:44.180 --> 03:04:47.890
Now I don't tell any stories
on miss about Richard Holmes.

03:04:47.890 --> 03:04:54.420
He didn't gather himself together
a group of slaves and said,

03:04:54.420 --> 03:04:59.210
let's sneak away from the
master and look at the hour

03:04:59.210 --> 03:05:02.700
and then hear my call
and let's be gone.

03:05:04.300 --> 03:05:08.030
Richard Holmes looked around.

03:05:08.030 --> 03:05:14.010
When he saw nobody was looking,
he left that plantation,

03:05:14.010 --> 03:05:17.520
and for three generations
in the District of Columbia,

03:05:17.520 --> 03:05:21.370
if your name was Holmes, you
learned to read and write.

03:05:21.370 --> 03:05:25.560
You went to the public schools
of the District of Columbia

03:05:25.560 --> 03:05:27.040
and you learned to read and write

03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:28.680
because you remembered
Richard Holmes

03:05:28.680 --> 03:05:31.120
who did not know how
to read or write.

03:05:31.120 --> 03:05:32.950
But his son knew how
to read or write,

03:05:32.950 --> 03:05:39.640
and his son knew how
to read or write.

03:05:39.640 --> 03:05:43.360
So, when I understood
that here in our own --

03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:50.020
in the nation's Library of Congress
we were commemorating Juneteenth I

03:05:50.020 --> 03:05:54.780
then understood that the
process of national education

03:05:54.780 --> 03:05:59.570
of our people of every
race has begun.

03:05:59.570 --> 03:06:03.070
They will be grateful to
have another occasion,

03:06:03.070 --> 03:06:09.520
particularly during this 150th
year of the end of the Civil War,

03:06:09.520 --> 03:06:15.400
another occasion to celebrate
the liberation of slaves.

03:06:15.400 --> 03:06:21.930
But you will go far and wide before
you find any people than the people

03:06:21.930 --> 03:06:26.400
of the District of Columbia
who are more grateful

03:06:26.400 --> 03:06:32.240
to what you're doing today as the
first to be liberated and who,

03:06:32.240 --> 03:06:36.610
as a people will not
entirely be liberated here

03:06:36.610 --> 03:06:42.210
in the nation's capital until
we become the 51st state

03:06:42.210 --> 03:06:44.110
of the United States of America.

03:06:44.110 --> 03:06:45.870
Thank you for what
you're doing today.

03:06:45.870 --> 03:06:48.320
[ Applause ]

03:06:48.320 --> 03:06:50.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Congresswoman.

03:06:50.120 --> 03:06:55.110
We're really moved by
your words, by your story,

03:06:55.110 --> 03:06:58.790
by the story of your
family, and we hope very much

03:06:58.790 --> 03:07:02.210
to continue the tradition
that we started today.

03:07:02.210 --> 03:07:07.980
Now we will continue
with our third panel.

03:07:07.980 --> 03:07:11.680
Eve Ferguson will moderate
the panel.

03:07:11.680 --> 03:07:18.440
She is a Reference Librarian for
East Africa and also a journalist,

03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:21.440
also a graduate of
Howard University,

03:07:21.440 --> 03:07:27.910
and one of our very own scholars
on Africa and on African Americans.

03:07:27.910 --> 03:07:29.710
So Eve Ferguson.

03:07:29.710 --> 03:07:35.070
[ Applause ]

03:07:35.070 --> 03:07:37.300
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Thank you
very much and good afternoon.

03:07:37.300 --> 03:07:43.830
I'm glad that you all stuck around
for the best, the last panel.

03:07:43.830 --> 03:07:47.990
I really feel spoiled
because I picked this one.

03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:52.010
So we are going to hear some
really wonderful presentation.

03:07:52.010 --> 03:07:53.880
I just want to say
a couple of things,

03:07:53.880 --> 03:07:57.330
and that is that I was a
school teacher for 16 years.

03:07:57.330 --> 03:07:59.510
The thing that --

03:07:59.510 --> 03:08:03.040
[ Applause ]

03:08:03.040 --> 03:08:08.620
The thing that made me the saddest
was when I had to teach children

03:08:08.620 --> 03:08:12.710
who were reading on
a third-grade level,

03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:16.420 position:56%
and they were in junior high school.

03:08:16.420 --> 03:08:17.720
That really bothered me.

03:08:17.720 --> 03:08:19.020
That was in Florida.

03:08:19.020 --> 03:08:24.470 position:56%
But then I came to D.C. and I taught
remedial reading to UDC students,

03:08:24.470 --> 03:08:28.640
and I'm saying, how are these
students getting into college

03:08:28.640 --> 03:08:31.870
and they don't know how to read,
and they didn't know how to read.

03:08:31.870 --> 03:08:35.560
So we tried using Toni Morrison but
that was a little bit too complex,

03:08:35.560 --> 03:08:37.690
so we had to bump it
down to the <i>House</i>

03:08:37.690 --> 03:08:39.640
<i>on Mango Street </i>and
anybody who's been a teacher

03:08:39.640 --> 03:08:41.610
in here knows the <i>House
on Mango Street </i>.

03:08:41.610 --> 03:08:47.060
It's a middle school reading level,
and that's what we had to go from,

03:08:47.060 --> 03:08:52.580
so we have a long way
to go for literacy.

03:08:52.580 --> 03:08:56.750 position:56%
But I applauded those students
because they went to college anyway,

03:08:56.750 --> 03:08:59.080
even though they couldn't
understand what was going on.

03:08:59.080 --> 03:09:00.930 position:56%
They used to come and tell me, Miss,

03:09:00.930 --> 03:09:06.820
this is like 13th grade,
and it was in many ways.

03:09:06.820 --> 03:09:11.380
But they had the ambition to
try to overcome their obstacles

03:09:11.380 --> 03:09:15.840 position:56%
and I really had to be
appreciative of that although I knew

03:09:15.840 --> 03:09:19.230
that those kids came from
houses where people didn't read.

03:09:19.230 --> 03:09:21.990
I started reading at three.

03:09:21.990 --> 03:09:25.950 position:56%
That's really early but I have a
sister who's about three years older

03:09:25.950 --> 03:09:28.770
than me and another one
who's five years old than me,

03:09:28.770 --> 03:09:33.180
and my middle sister used to
whisper in my ear the words

03:09:33.180 --> 03:09:35.800 position:56%
to the book as I'm turning the page.

03:09:35.800 --> 03:09:38.080
She said one day she
wasn't whispering

03:09:38.080 --> 03:09:39.850
but I was saying the words.

03:09:39.850 --> 03:09:41.740
So did I memorize it?

03:09:41.740 --> 03:09:43.040
Was I reading?

03:09:43.040 --> 03:09:47.460
So they kind of did an experiment
and they gave me another book

03:09:47.460 --> 03:09:49.440 position:56%
that she hadn't whispered the words.

03:09:49.440 --> 03:09:50.940
But I did know how to read.

03:09:50.940 --> 03:09:55.500
So ever since then it's like
reading has been important.

03:09:55.500 --> 03:09:58.990
You cannot read if you can't write,

03:09:58.990 --> 03:10:01.900
and you can't write
if you can't read.

03:10:01.900 --> 03:10:03.200
So the two go together.

03:10:03.200 --> 03:10:07.630
I just want to say to
anybody who has a college-age

03:10:07.630 --> 03:10:11.400
or high school child, please don't
let them do all their research

03:10:11.400 --> 03:10:14.070
on the Internet.

03:10:14.070 --> 03:10:19.120 position:56%
They end up using wrong
information and creating what I used

03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:23.810
to call the Scotch Tape Special
-- cut and paste from everything.

03:10:23.810 --> 03:10:29.060 position:56%
That does nothing for their learning
experience so read books with them,

03:10:29.060 --> 03:10:33.120
newspapers, have them around the
house or something like that.

03:10:33.120 --> 03:10:38.880
So, to go on, I have this great
panel back here, and I'm not going

03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:40.760
to take a lot of time
because we're running behind,

03:10:40.760 --> 03:10:43.170
and I want them to have their say.

03:10:43.170 --> 03:10:49.380 position:56%
But our first panelist was one of
my instructors at Howard University.

03:10:49.380 --> 03:10:54.130
I dropped his class [laughter],
which he's never forgiven me for.

03:10:54.130 --> 03:10:59.870
But we went on further to work
together and when I was a senior

03:10:59.870 --> 03:11:04.470
at Howard I wrote the
first article on his work

03:11:04.470 --> 03:11:06.150
for the <i>Washington Post </i>.

03:11:06.150 --> 03:11:10.370
So we've always kept
in touch since then.

03:11:10.370 --> 03:11:14.990
He has constantly told me,
"You have to tell your story.

03:11:14.990 --> 03:11:16.290
You have to tell your story."

03:11:16.290 --> 03:11:18.750
I haven't told it yet, but I will.

03:11:18.750 --> 03:11:22.790
So we have the distinguished
Professor Haile Gerima

03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:25.510
from the Film Department
at Howard University.

03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:30.100
[ Applause ]

03:11:30.100 --> 03:11:31.650
He's a celebrity in his own right.

03:11:31.650 --> 03:11:34.250
I don't even have to talk about
his movies <i>Sankofa, Teza,</i>

03:11:34.250 --> 03:11:38.110
<i>Bush Mama, Harvest 3000 </i>, right?

03:11:38.110 --> 03:11:39.410
<i>Harvest 3000 </i>?

03:11:39.410 --> 03:11:42.140
Yeah. That was actually the
film that I did the story on.

03:11:42.140 --> 03:11:44.100
So we are glad to have Haile here.

03:11:44.100 --> 03:11:47.260
Been trying to get him in
the Library for a long time.

03:11:47.260 --> 03:11:53.430
Next to Haile we have Hafiz
Shabazz who I met yesterday

03:11:53.430 --> 03:11:56.220
and I find him completely
intriguing.

03:11:56.220 --> 03:11:58.910
He is a Professor at Dartmouth.

03:11:58.910 --> 03:12:01.000
He teaches a course
which is called --

03:12:04.460 --> 03:12:06.150
-- let me make sure I get it right.

03:12:06.150 --> 03:12:09.570
I don't want to get it wrong.

03:12:09.570 --> 03:12:12.110
Oral Tradition Musicianship?

03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:13.410
Is that right?

03:12:13.410 --> 03:12:18.620
Yes. Oral Tradition
Musicianship at Dartmouth.

03:12:18.620 --> 03:12:21.000
So I really want to
hear what that is.

03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:23.710
But he's also Adjunct
Assistant Professor and Director

03:12:23.710 --> 03:12:26.860
of World Music Percussion Ensemble.

03:12:26.860 --> 03:12:32.220
He's the producer of more
than 85 major concerts.

03:12:32.220 --> 03:12:36.010
I was absolutely floored
talking to him yesterday,

03:12:36.010 --> 03:12:37.410
and I'm sure that what he has

03:12:37.410 --> 03:12:40.860
to say today will also give
you all something to take away

03:12:40.860 --> 03:12:43.560
from here and think further about.

03:12:43.560 --> 03:12:47.850
Next to Hafiz Shabazz
is Beverly East.

03:12:47.850 --> 03:12:50.720
She is a leading authority
in handwriting,

03:12:50.720 --> 03:12:53.210
international forensic
document examiner.

03:12:53.210 --> 03:12:54.510
I want to know what that is.

03:12:54.510 --> 03:12:56.020
I'm not sure what it is.

03:12:56.020 --> 03:12:58.110
She's author of <i>Bat Mitzvah Girl,</i>

03:12:58.110 --> 03:13:01.400
<i>Memories of a Jamaican Child</i>
which I hope she'll discuss

03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:04.280
because that's been -- I
know a number of book clubs

03:13:04.280 --> 03:13:08.530
like the Caribbean Professionals
took up that book as one

03:13:08.530 --> 03:13:10.280
of their books to read
in the Book Club.

03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:12.910
I haven't read it yet, but I will.

03:13:12.910 --> 03:13:18.730
Last but not least is
Gabriel Asheru Benn.

03:13:18.730 --> 03:13:24.470 position:56%
Now what I have to say about his is
he must have a reputation everywhere

03:13:24.470 --> 03:13:27.910
because in the last three days
I've gone to three public events

03:13:27.910 --> 03:13:31.270
and at every public event
they have mentioned his name.

03:13:31.270 --> 03:13:36.050
Monday at Busboys and Poets,
Wednesday at Eatonville,

03:13:36.050 --> 03:13:40.390
and the third one I don't
remember but it was somewhere.

03:13:40.390 --> 03:13:45.530
So he is listed as an
educator, youth activist,

03:13:45.530 --> 03:13:47.540
international hip-hop artist,

03:13:47.540 --> 03:13:52.620
co-founder of Educational Lyrics
whose cornerstone program is HELP.

03:13:52.620 --> 03:13:54.170
We heard a little bit
about that earlier,

03:13:54.170 --> 03:13:57.760
the Hip-Hop Educational
Literacy Program.

03:13:57.760 --> 03:14:04.100
Now I'm just so curious to know
about him as an artist and now

03:14:04.100 --> 03:14:07.170 position:56%
that his name is all over the place,
next time it pops up I'll make sure

03:14:07.170 --> 03:14:09.520
to hear what he has to say.

03:14:09.520 --> 03:14:14.270
Then I just wanted to
leave you all with a poem

03:14:14.270 --> 03:14:19.720
that is really my favorite poem by
Langston Hughes because I think --

03:14:19.720 --> 03:14:23.480 position:56%
I always thought Langston Hughes
was a children's poet because he was

03:14:23.480 --> 03:14:25.830
so present in our house as well

03:14:25.830 --> 03:14:27.600
as he wrote short poets
that you could memorize.

03:14:27.600 --> 03:14:30.990
So I didn't realize
until I was much older

03:14:30.990 --> 03:14:32.800
that he wasn't a children's poet.

03:14:32.800 --> 03:14:36.030
But I'm glad that my
parents exposed me to him.

03:14:36.030 --> 03:14:38.900
But one of my favorite
poems by him is "Dreams,"

03:14:38.900 --> 03:14:41.260
and everybody probably knows it.

03:14:41.260 --> 03:14:43.140
I have it on my phone
because I'd had a tendency

03:14:43.140 --> 03:14:44.920
to change the words around.

03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:48.160
But he said, "Hold fast to dreams

03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:53.980
for if dreams die life is a
broken-winged bird that cannot fly.

03:14:53.980 --> 03:15:00.260
Hold fast to dreams for when
dreams go life is a barren field,

03:15:00.260 --> 03:15:02.400
frozen with snow."

03:15:02.400 --> 03:15:06.930
These panelists will talk about
how they made their dream reality,

03:15:06.930 --> 03:15:10.620
and I hope it will be inspiration
for everybody to hold fast

03:15:10.620 --> 03:15:15.580
to your dream, tell your
story, and pass on the torch.

03:15:15.580 --> 03:15:17.510
Thank you very much.

03:15:17.510 --> 03:15:21.360
[ Applause ]

03:15:21.360 --> 03:15:24.670
&gt;&gt; Haile Gerima: First I
just want to thank you,

03:15:24.670 --> 03:15:27.600
my [inaudible] and my supporters.

03:15:27.600 --> 03:15:32.230
Miss Ferguson, I don't
want to say her first name,

03:15:32.230 --> 03:15:37.320
but I'm very grateful to all
the nice words you had to say.

03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:40.890
But I am very nervous and
I feel I'm like I was sent

03:15:40.890 --> 03:15:45.830
to Siberia [laughter], and I have
to first paraphrase my presence

03:15:45.830 --> 03:15:49.080
of how I got myself
into this situation.

03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:53.670 position:56%
A sister who I would consider -- I
told my wife, "This sister is crazy.

03:15:53.670 --> 03:15:56.870
She wants to do this thing.

03:15:56.870 --> 03:16:00.130
I know she's not going to
put it and I'll say yes

03:16:00.130 --> 03:16:01.790
because it's not going to happen."

03:16:01.790 --> 03:16:03.090
That's how I got in trouble.

03:16:03.090 --> 03:16:09.900
This is Miss Marie Fenton here
sitting next to my sister.

03:16:09.900 --> 03:16:14.640
So I will tell you that I never
wanted to set foot in this place.

03:16:14.640 --> 03:16:15.940
I don't know why.

03:16:15.940 --> 03:16:19.040
But you got me trapped
and I have to admit

03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:23.740 position:56%
that you are a very powerful person.

03:16:23.740 --> 03:16:30.100
I just hope you were a
counsel outside the institution

03:16:30.100 --> 03:16:35.080
where I met you because we don't
want to lose the people's story

03:16:35.080 --> 03:16:36.590
that doesn't get to make it here

03:16:36.590 --> 03:16:39.510
with all these Jefferson
leftover books.

03:16:39.510 --> 03:16:42.260
[ Laughter ]

03:16:42.260 --> 03:16:46.510
But I want to speak about
the stories because I felt

03:16:46.510 --> 03:16:49.120
at this short time the only
thing I could do is speak

03:16:49.120 --> 03:16:52.570
about the battle to tell the story.

03:16:52.570 --> 03:16:54.700
It's only bourgeoisie
people who want

03:16:54.700 --> 03:16:58.320
to make it look like
it's entertainment.

03:16:58.320 --> 03:17:02.390 position:56%
But every battle in
contradiction is built on stories --

03:17:02.390 --> 03:17:04.880
whose story are we telling?

03:17:04.880 --> 03:17:09.210
The official story where that
negative run of the official story?

03:17:09.210 --> 03:17:12.160
There's the unofficial story.

03:17:12.160 --> 03:17:14.800
Now, for me, I don't think --

03:17:14.800 --> 03:17:18.060
the human beings that
went into the caves

03:17:18.060 --> 03:17:24.330
to write their story
anticipated war,

03:17:24.330 --> 03:17:28.410
conquering, enslaving, et cetera.

03:17:28.410 --> 03:17:34.840
They were just saying this is who
I am, this is who I belong to,

03:17:34.840 --> 03:17:38.140
and this is where I came from.

03:17:38.140 --> 03:17:43.050 position:56%
All human beings do this without any
instructions because it's very human

03:17:43.050 --> 03:17:47.680
that changes us or distinguishes
us from the animal kingdom.

03:17:47.680 --> 03:17:50.280
We pass our story.

03:17:50.280 --> 03:17:55.080
But it's not also anticipated that
we will enter this digital period

03:17:55.080 --> 03:17:59.730
where stories cross-dress thinking
they are our stories when, in fact,

03:17:59.730 --> 03:18:04.720
they are really the official
stories that possess our tongues

03:18:04.720 --> 03:18:07.910
and our minds to tell
the official story

03:18:07.910 --> 03:18:12.520
and make us pretend we are
telling the unofficial story.

03:18:12.520 --> 03:18:14.990
That's the time we live in.

03:18:14.990 --> 03:18:16.630
I have my students.

03:18:16.630 --> 03:18:20.400
I tell them, "Empower your story."

03:18:20.400 --> 03:18:24.350
They think story is what they
see on television and film,

03:18:24.350 --> 03:18:28.020 position:56%
and their grandmother or grandfather
don't figure out in this idea

03:18:28.020 --> 03:18:33.530 position:56%
of storytelling because once
[inaudible] is made, it's impossible

03:18:33.530 --> 03:18:36.490
for black people to
empower their story

03:18:36.490 --> 03:18:38.730
from the time they came in contact.

03:18:38.730 --> 03:18:40.870
This is not just every contact.

03:18:40.870 --> 03:18:46.060
It is the colonial contact
ushered, the middle passage.

03:18:46.060 --> 03:18:52.090
Now in storytelling a lot of
people talk about <i>Sankofa </i>,

03:18:52.090 --> 03:18:53.720
and they don't know
where it comes from.

03:18:53.720 --> 03:18:59.280 position:56%
They don't know how to trace me from
Ethiopia to Chicago to California,

03:18:59.280 --> 03:19:04.960
and the most agonizing
journey I took to know

03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:09.240
who these black people
are in America.

03:19:09.240 --> 03:19:13.550
I'm still trying to figure out
there's black people in America

03:19:13.550 --> 03:19:18.060
because they're a symbol of a
complicated journey of a people.

03:19:18.060 --> 03:19:20.780
I will not underestimate
by saying I know.

03:19:20.780 --> 03:19:22.080
I'm learning.

03:19:22.080 --> 03:19:24.470
I'm in the university of
black people in America

03:19:24.470 --> 03:19:27.040
because it does have
a direct relationship

03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:29.620
to my personal life in Africa.

03:19:29.620 --> 03:19:31.820
Not many people know that.

03:19:31.820 --> 03:19:35.010
So the battle in America
is one that --

03:19:35.010 --> 03:19:39.900
for example, when I wanted to do
<i>Sankofa </i>white people wanted me

03:19:39.900 --> 03:19:44.880
to tell the story in the
official story-telling

03:19:44.880 --> 03:19:49.400
of their empowered position.

03:19:49.400 --> 03:19:53.270
Black people did not have the
power to begin to infiltrate

03:19:53.270 --> 03:19:56.820
into my consciousness to
influence me any other way.

03:19:56.820 --> 03:20:00.400
I knew who they were.

03:20:00.400 --> 03:20:03.080
I knew my brother Haki.

03:20:03.080 --> 03:20:04.380
I knew Baraka.

03:20:04.380 --> 03:20:09.490
In fact, I was really going to
tribute my [inaudible] to Baraka

03:20:09.490 --> 03:20:13.160
because I used to do the <i>Dutchman</i>
at the Goodman School of Drama just

03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:16.570
to liberate myself and try to
get in touch with black people.

03:20:16.570 --> 03:20:20.190
He usually said drama, that scares
the hell out of white people,

03:20:20.190 --> 03:20:23.550
and a lot of black people who
feel excluded in the acting world

03:20:23.550 --> 03:20:27.410
of the Goodman School of Drama
just -- there's no parts for them.

03:20:27.410 --> 03:20:28.810
<i>Hamlet </i>comes.

03:20:28.810 --> 03:20:30.120
No parts for them.

03:20:30.120 --> 03:20:31.420
<i>Macbeth </i>comes.

03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:32.720
No parts for them.

03:20:32.720 --> 03:20:34.020
<i>Othello </i>comes.

03:20:34.020 --> 03:20:36.740
They still have a white guy
picked to playing Othello.

03:20:36.740 --> 03:20:38.040
No parts for them.

03:20:38.040 --> 03:20:39.340
So what do they do?

03:20:39.340 --> 03:20:42.270
They do the <i>Dutchman </i>in
the revenge, just to revenge

03:20:42.270 --> 03:20:44.300
in that house at the
Goodman School of Drama.

03:20:44.300 --> 03:20:47.760
I took that all the way to
UCLA because I wanted to kind

03:20:47.760 --> 03:20:51.910
of why people -- no, I am
not a grateful foreigner

03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:53.940
because I have liberated myself

03:20:53.940 --> 03:20:59.750
from that grateful
position thanks to racism.

03:20:59.750 --> 03:21:01.950
So stories is a battleground.

03:21:01.950 --> 03:21:07.040
A simple illustration is in
the Palestinian struggle.

03:21:07.040 --> 03:21:09.410
It's a struggle of stories.

03:21:09.410 --> 03:21:12.630
Whose story is what?

03:21:12.630 --> 03:21:14.430
The same thing in America.

03:21:14.430 --> 03:21:19.560
When it comes to race issue,
slavery is a contention.

03:21:19.560 --> 03:21:24.880
Slavery is a story not to
be told by black people.

03:21:24.880 --> 03:21:29.090
The monuments and poetry and books
to be written officially have

03:21:29.090 --> 03:21:32.150 position:56%
to be commissioned by white artists.

03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:35.130
But what are they taking when
they take a black film away

03:21:35.130 --> 03:21:39.960
from a black filmmaker
dealing on slavery issue,

03:21:39.960 --> 03:21:43.720
they are denying the black
artist to exorcise the demon

03:21:43.720 --> 03:21:49.480
and toxic ingestion of
a thing called slavery.

03:21:49.480 --> 03:21:53.360
White people in their [inaudible]
of position snatch the story

03:21:53.360 --> 03:21:56.480
from a black person
and make films that --

03:21:56.480 --> 03:21:58.270
I don't have to enumerate
them for you,

03:21:58.270 --> 03:22:01.040
but <i>Amistad </i>would be a
good enough story for you.

03:22:01.040 --> 03:22:02.340
I don't know.

03:22:02.340 --> 03:22:03.640
Black filmmaker in school --

03:22:03.640 --> 03:22:06.870
we never fantasized to someday
do a film on [inaudible]

03:22:06.870 --> 03:22:10.090
because it spoke something
different to us.

03:22:10.090 --> 03:22:13.960
Yet, not only are they
denying the black filmmaker --

03:22:13.960 --> 03:22:18.330
they're denying the black
community to make that leap

03:22:18.330 --> 03:22:23.960 position:56%
because when an artist, when a black
artist makes a monument he exorcises

03:22:23.960 --> 03:22:27.150 position:56%
this evil toxic into arriving there.

03:22:27.150 --> 03:22:32.480
In so doing, he or she takes
the community by that act.

03:22:32.480 --> 03:22:35.140
That is a very privileged
position only given

03:22:35.140 --> 03:22:36.890
to white people in America.

03:22:36.890 --> 03:22:41.860
Face it. Every story black
people want to do is scrutinized

03:22:41.860 --> 03:22:48.730
and realigned by white dictatorship
I would call it of storytelling.

03:22:48.730 --> 03:22:51.880
They used to have this game called
"What's Your Point of Entry?"

03:22:51.880 --> 03:22:56.370
Point of entry means do you
have a Brad Pitt in your story?

03:22:56.370 --> 03:23:01.240 position:56%
Point of entry does not mean what
Aristotle's idea of storytelling is.

03:23:01.240 --> 03:23:05.650
No. It's the empowerment of white
people over black consciousness

03:23:05.650 --> 03:23:11.870
or to divert and obstruct the
right to imagine the future

03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:16.710
from the present circumstances
he or she finds herself.

03:23:16.710 --> 03:23:19.390
So it's very important
that you should know --

03:23:19.390 --> 03:23:22.350
I think we will arrive
someday somewhere

03:23:22.350 --> 03:23:26.180
where stories would exorcise
the evil toxic of all

03:23:26.180 --> 03:23:28.210
that is passed to all of us.

03:23:28.210 --> 03:23:29.510
In this case, racism.

03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:35.100
The most divisive toxic
on Earth is racism.

03:23:35.100 --> 03:23:37.070
We know it; we see it here.

03:23:37.070 --> 03:23:39.120
I don't have to mention to you.

03:23:39.120 --> 03:23:43.920
But what helps you to exorcise
the toxic divisive nature

03:23:43.920 --> 03:23:47.660
of racism is not allowed
to be exorcised

03:23:47.660 --> 03:23:52.200
because of the dictatorship
of white supremacy in America.

03:23:52.200 --> 03:23:53.820
When I speak about this
-- I don't have time --

03:23:53.820 --> 03:23:57.130
but I'm also talking about
the vocabulary and tradition

03:23:57.130 --> 03:23:59.680
and convention of storytelling.

03:23:59.680 --> 03:24:03.230
I'm talking about the
mindset, the thought process.

03:24:03.230 --> 03:24:07.020
White America would want
the whole world to think,

03:24:07.020 --> 03:24:09.850
to go into the thought
process, the thinking source

03:24:09.850 --> 03:24:13.360
where you imagine story
is obstructive.

03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:16.630
When a black kid goes to say, "I
want to write a story," and when he

03:24:16.630 --> 03:24:21.080
or she bends and takes the
pencil, this subliminal power

03:24:21.080 --> 03:24:27.540 position:56%
of white supremacy enters the brain,
deflecting you from what you are

03:24:27.540 --> 03:24:29.960
about to exorcise, the
points that you're trying

03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:31.860
to get out of your system.

03:24:31.860 --> 03:24:33.160
It's not allowed.

03:24:33.160 --> 03:24:34.460
I'm sorry.

03:24:34.460 --> 03:24:38.540
Even in the <i>Sankofa </i>it's
an imperfect gesture,

03:24:38.540 --> 03:24:40.090
imperfect gesture.

03:24:40.090 --> 03:24:43.500
Why? Because there
is not black finance.

03:24:43.500 --> 03:24:45.460
There is not black power.

03:24:45.460 --> 03:24:48.130
There is no black economic power.

03:24:48.130 --> 03:24:51.130
Distribution, exhibition,
completely controlled.

03:24:51.130 --> 03:24:53.500
Even when we had it out and we were

03:24:53.500 --> 03:24:56.580
in the Berlin Film
Festival competing

03:24:56.580 --> 03:25:02.220
with every big budget film
including <i>Malcolm X </i>by Hollywood,

03:25:02.220 --> 03:25:07.850
the white American press boycotted
us throughout and throughout.

03:25:07.850 --> 03:25:10.120
That's why black people in
America -- I went and saw --

03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:12.070
in Washington I said to
them, "You know what?

03:25:12.070 --> 03:25:13.370
I made the film.

03:25:13.370 --> 03:25:15.340
I exorcised it."

03:25:15.340 --> 03:25:17.160
I know I owe people with my way.

03:25:17.160 --> 03:25:18.520
We're going to pay for it.

03:25:18.520 --> 03:25:21.430
But if you don't show
this film it's on you.

03:25:21.430 --> 03:25:23.970
I have made it and I'm
going back to Howard,

03:25:23.970 --> 03:25:27.140
my other plantation,
earn my money, and pay.

03:25:27.140 --> 03:25:29.860
But I'm not going to fight
to distribute this film.

03:25:29.860 --> 03:25:31.210
Black people took it on there.

03:25:31.210 --> 03:25:34.130
Made it a world phenomenon.

03:25:34.130 --> 03:25:35.430
It's not repeated again.

03:25:35.430 --> 03:25:44.590
The whole Sankofa family from here
to Ohio, San Francisco, Chicago --

03:25:44.590 --> 03:25:47.020
when Haki opened it had Hyde Park.

03:25:47.020 --> 03:25:52.000
Nobody had ever penetrated
the system in our terms,

03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:55.220
without letting them own it.

03:25:55.220 --> 03:25:56.520
I'll tell you, my life

03:25:56.520 --> 03:26:00.100
as a filmmaker would have
changed had I given my film

03:26:00.100 --> 03:26:03.410
to white control from the outset.

03:26:03.410 --> 03:26:06.840 position:56%
But I knew that was a kiss of death.

03:26:06.840 --> 03:26:09.870
I knew it was the end of me
as a person, as an individual.

03:26:09.870 --> 03:26:12.300
So I just go on and
bogart the time here.

03:26:12.300 --> 03:26:16.480
But I'm saying when we talk about
story, we're talking about war.

03:26:16.480 --> 03:26:17.910
We're talking about war.

03:26:17.910 --> 03:26:22.650
You talk about proclamation without
[inaudible] who actually unleashed

03:26:22.650 --> 03:26:25.680
without [inaudible]
who actually unleashed

03:26:25.680 --> 03:26:30.380
until the white power structures
say if I'm never going to be free,

03:26:30.380 --> 03:26:32.130
you're not going to
have a good life.

03:26:32.130 --> 03:26:35.470
Gabriel Prosser confronted
the founding fathers

03:26:35.470 --> 03:26:37.710
and stories are not
going to be told.

03:26:37.710 --> 03:26:40.910
In fact, the MacArthur Foundation,
when I applied, came and asked me,

03:26:40.910 --> 03:26:44.100
"You're talking about a slave
confronting the founding fathers?"

03:26:44.100 --> 03:26:47.350
Yes, Gabriel Prosser,
1802, they were on there

03:26:47.350 --> 03:26:49.630
and they were running the country.

03:26:49.630 --> 03:26:51.190
There were Vice Presidents.

03:26:51.190 --> 03:26:52.790
They were all the founding fathers.

03:26:52.790 --> 03:26:56.370
He said, "This Revolution
is for you, not mine."

03:26:56.370 --> 03:26:57.670
Whose story?

03:26:57.670 --> 03:27:00.720
That story's never told
because there are not gutsy,

03:27:00.720 --> 03:27:04.600
black capitalists who understand

03:27:04.600 --> 03:27:09.130
that their capitalism could also
transform when they allow people

03:27:09.130 --> 03:27:13.840
to transform stories
that need to be told.

03:27:13.840 --> 03:27:15.640
Thank you.

03:27:15.640 --> 03:27:23.450
[ Applause ]

03:27:23.450 --> 03:27:24.940
&gt;&gt; Hafiz Shabazz: Good afternoon.

03:27:24.940 --> 03:27:26.300
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

03:27:26.300 --> 03:27:28.310
&gt;&gt; Hafiz Shabazz: My
name is Hafiz Shabazz.

03:27:28.310 --> 03:27:32.260
My father gave me the
name Terrell Johnson.

03:27:32.260 --> 03:27:40.240
However, I chose to change my name
because I want to know who I am,

03:27:40.240 --> 03:27:45.110
and by doing that I learned a
great deal about the Shabazz,

03:27:45.110 --> 03:27:51.430
the lost tribe, those
who don't have a home,

03:27:51.430 --> 03:27:55.040
those who do not have a
place to call their own.

03:27:55.040 --> 03:28:01.510
So, therefore, I began to search
and find out where I came from.

03:28:01.510 --> 03:28:06.190
I searched to some extent
in vain, but I went a lot

03:28:06.190 --> 03:28:10.000
of places, and so I'm multitude.

03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:11.300
I'm a number of people.

03:28:11.300 --> 03:28:16.590
I'm mixed of everything that
you could possibly imagine

03:28:16.590 --> 03:28:19.640
because I am the original man.

03:28:21.750 --> 03:28:28.210
Now one of the things that led me
to this journey that they asked me

03:28:28.210 --> 03:28:31.380
to find out who I am, was my drum.

03:28:31.380 --> 03:28:38.740
By the time I was seven years old
I wanted to drum because inside

03:28:38.740 --> 03:28:43.770
of me I was a violent person.

03:28:43.770 --> 03:28:46.600
I wanted to tear stuff up.

03:28:46.600 --> 03:28:48.390
I wanted to hurt something.

03:28:48.390 --> 03:28:49.740
Not necessarily people

03:28:49.740 --> 03:28:52.470
but everything I touched
I would tear up.

03:28:52.470 --> 03:28:58.380
So my father, he said, "Son,
I'm going to give you a drum."

03:28:58.380 --> 03:29:04.210
He says, "You can hit that
and it won't hit you back."

03:29:04.210 --> 03:29:05.990
That was a good thing.

03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:09.360
However, studying the drum
I wanted to be the best,

03:29:09.360 --> 03:29:12.180
so I studied the masters.

03:29:12.180 --> 03:29:13.480
I went to Ghana.

03:29:13.480 --> 03:29:14.780
I went to [inaudible].

03:29:14.780 --> 03:29:16.080
I went to Brazil.

03:29:16.080 --> 03:29:17.380
I went to Cuba.

03:29:17.380 --> 03:29:20.140
I went to Haiti.

03:29:20.140 --> 03:29:26.420
All of these places to
study with master drummers.

03:29:26.420 --> 03:29:30.770
So I have all of that
information and as a result

03:29:30.770 --> 03:29:34.890
of studying drumming I
learned much more about music

03:29:34.890 --> 03:29:38.540
and I also learned a great deal
about each one of those cultures.

03:29:38.540 --> 03:29:43.700
I refer to those cultures in
my study as Haitian studies

03:29:43.700 --> 03:29:49.530 position:56%
because I studied the Haitian people
and how difficult their lives was

03:29:49.530 --> 03:29:53.870
and how hard their lives
was, and how everyone

03:29:53.870 --> 03:30:01.140
on the planet hated the Haitians,
even after this last earthquake.

03:30:01.140 --> 03:30:05.420
They were just devastated.

03:30:05.420 --> 03:30:13.910
The Red Cross, okay, the Red Cross
actually decepted these people.

03:30:13.910 --> 03:30:17.460
They took money, did not
build homes for them.

03:30:17.460 --> 03:30:20.230
They're not curing their
illnesses and whatnot,

03:30:20.230 --> 03:30:21.820
and they spent the
money on themselves.

03:30:21.820 --> 03:30:23.120
The Haitians.

03:30:23.120 --> 03:30:30.360
So I studied the Haitians and I
went to Haiti not because of that,

03:30:30.360 --> 03:30:34.570
because that was -- I went to
Haiti a very long time ago.

03:30:34.570 --> 03:30:39.850
As a matter of fact, it was
1971 when Papa Doc divided --

03:30:39.850 --> 03:30:42.400
was the President or Prime
Minister or whatever.

03:30:42.400 --> 03:30:48.950
So I went there because
I wanted to study voodoo.

03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:52.200
As I say the word voodoo, folks
shudder because they always say,

03:30:52.200 --> 03:30:56.230
well, you stick pins and
all those kind of things.

03:30:56.230 --> 03:30:57.980
Well, I said I wanted to
see this sticking of pins.

03:30:57.980 --> 03:30:59.280
I wanted to see all
those various things.

03:30:59.280 --> 03:31:05.630
But I did go to a ceremony
which was for Baron Samedi,

03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:12.240
and Baron Samedi was the god of the
cemetery, and there was a festival

03:31:12.240 --> 03:31:16.770
for Baron Samedi where a
person stayed in a coffin,

03:31:16.770 --> 03:31:20.640
slept in the coffin for seven days.

03:31:20.640 --> 03:31:30.800
At the end of those seven
days there was a ceremony

03:31:30.800 --> 03:31:34.580
and at the ceremony there was food.

03:31:34.580 --> 03:31:39.970
There was food, there was a lot
of drummers, a lot of dancing,

03:31:39.970 --> 03:31:41.510
and I saw within the dancing,

03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:43.130
people were getting possessed
by their spirits, okay?

03:31:43.130 --> 03:31:44.430 position:56%
That just shows the power of belief.

03:31:44.430 --> 03:31:49.480
They believed so powerfully
and so devoutly

03:31:49.480 --> 03:31:53.010
that their god could
actually heal them,

03:31:53.010 --> 03:31:58.090
could actually give them
the strength to live long

03:31:58.090 --> 03:32:01.000
and to make their lives meaningful.

03:32:01.000 --> 03:32:06.020
However, there was this
Houngan who was the priest.

03:32:06.020 --> 03:32:07.410
A little small man.

03:32:07.410 --> 03:32:11.100
Couldn't have weighed
no more than 100 pounds.

03:32:11.100 --> 03:32:13.130
There was a bull in
the hunt for them.

03:32:13.130 --> 03:32:17.890
Hunt [inaudible] a place where the
[inaudible] ceremonies take place.

03:32:17.890 --> 03:32:22.270
So the bull was tied to the
peristyle, and there was a pole

03:32:22.270 --> 03:32:24.090
that held up the roof and whatnot.

03:32:24.090 --> 03:32:25.390
He was tied to it.

03:32:25.390 --> 03:32:26.690 position:56%
A bull. I'm going to say that again.

03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:28.030
A bull. This little man.

03:32:28.030 --> 03:32:32.050
So the bull wanted
to go out and leave.

03:32:32.050 --> 03:32:33.880
He wanted to leave.

03:32:33.880 --> 03:32:35.710
He was pulling the pole
and pulling and pulling.

03:32:35.710 --> 03:32:38.080
So this little man sat
down behind the bull,

03:32:38.080 --> 03:32:45.370
held both of the bull's hind
legs, and steadied the bull.

03:32:45.370 --> 03:32:47.830
The bull could not move.

03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:49.130
A hundred pound man.

03:32:49.130 --> 03:32:50.430
I mean it.

03:32:50.430 --> 03:32:52.180
So he was exceptionally strong

03:32:52.180 --> 03:32:57.710
because he believed this is
what he was supposed to do.

03:32:57.710 --> 03:33:03.850
So I learned about the voodoo
drumming to the point whereas

03:33:03.850 --> 03:33:08.200
if you believe, I can play
my drum and possess you.

03:33:08.200 --> 03:33:09.970
You will then transform.

03:33:09.970 --> 03:33:15.480
Neurologically you transform.

03:33:15.480 --> 03:33:20.310
So you could be actually
I'd say to the point

03:33:20.310 --> 03:33:24.710
where pain could not
invade your body.

03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:26.150
You could be painless.

03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:32.820
You could feel wonderful just
from listening to this drum.

03:33:32.820 --> 03:33:34.940
I went to Cuba.

03:33:34.940 --> 03:33:36.760
The exact same thing.

03:33:36.760 --> 03:33:41.200
Belief. People were getting
possessed by their gods

03:33:41.200 --> 03:33:44.530
and goddesses, the Orishas.

03:33:44.530 --> 03:33:46.730
They could transform.

03:33:46.730 --> 03:33:49.820
They could speak in what we
call speak in tongues, right?

03:33:49.820 --> 03:33:53.890
They could heal you.

03:33:53.890 --> 03:33:55.490
So I learned that through drums.

03:33:55.490 --> 03:33:57.630
I went to Brazil.

03:33:57.630 --> 03:34:03.260
The exact same thing.

03:34:03.260 --> 03:34:05.420
I went to [inaudible].

03:34:05.420 --> 03:34:07.370
The same thing.

03:34:07.370 --> 03:34:09.710
I went to Ghana.

03:34:09.710 --> 03:34:12.790
The exact same thing.

03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:15.520
So we, if we choose to
believe that we're powerful,

03:34:15.520 --> 03:34:22.790 position:56%
then we could do whatever it is that
we choose to do and be successful.

03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:26.390
All we have to do is believe.

03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:33.960
That was from drumming,
learning about the cultures,

03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:36.110
quote/unquote cases, studies.

03:34:36.110 --> 03:34:40.260
I am now an ethnomusicologist.

03:34:40.260 --> 03:34:42.080
I went to school and
learned what to say and how

03:34:42.080 --> 03:34:43.540
to say it, what to study.

03:34:43.540 --> 03:34:45.760
I went to school to learn.

03:34:45.760 --> 03:34:51.530 position:56%
But I did that naturally because I
love my culture and I love drumming,

03:34:51.530 --> 03:34:54.660
and I love hitting stuff.

03:34:54.660 --> 03:34:57.650
I still drum.

03:34:57.650 --> 03:35:00.040
I'm 68 years old and
I play every day.

03:35:00.040 --> 03:35:01.340
When I leave here I'm
going to go play.

03:35:01.340 --> 03:35:02.640
&gt;&gt; You don't want to stop.

03:35:02.640 --> 03:35:06.280
&gt;&gt; Hafiz Shabazz: Well,
this is not the point.

03:35:06.280 --> 03:35:08.690
It is not the point.

03:35:08.690 --> 03:35:10.840
I wanted to tell you the truth.

03:35:10.840 --> 03:35:15.210
But nonetheless, that is
what actually healed my soul.

03:35:15.210 --> 03:35:20.560
I cannot get away from [inaudible].

03:35:20.560 --> 03:35:25.520
There was a school in Philadelphia,

03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:28.810
an independent school
called [inaudible].

03:35:28.810 --> 03:35:30.110
They were, I think, a school

03:35:30.110 --> 03:35:33.060
of humanitarianism,
for humanitarianism.

03:35:33.060 --> 03:35:40.220
It was to teach people to love one
another, to love your black brother

03:35:40.220 --> 03:35:46.170
and sister, not to kill your
black brother and sister,

03:35:46.170 --> 03:35:51.150
not to hate your black brother
and sister, but to love them,

03:35:51.150 --> 03:35:52.450
and [inaudible] is

03:35:52.450 --> 03:35:55.410
in your [inaudible] language,
it means house of love.

03:35:56.660 --> 03:36:01.310
I studied there and played there
and I became the master drummer

03:36:01.310 --> 03:36:02.630
of the dance ensemble

03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:04.910
for [inaudible] African
American Dance Ensemble.

03:36:04.910 --> 03:36:08.350
I was the master drummer.

03:36:08.350 --> 03:36:12.450
All of those cultures that I
studied, I taught young brothers

03:36:12.450 --> 03:36:15.960
and sisters, seven years
old, five years old,

03:36:15.960 --> 03:36:19.970
12 years old, even adults.

03:36:19.970 --> 03:36:23.450
Now I teach at Dartmouth College.

03:36:24.510 --> 03:36:28.810
Been there 30 years.

03:36:28.810 --> 03:36:34.230
I teach three terms a year,
in every term, every term.

03:36:34.230 --> 03:36:38.570
I have a waiting list
of 200 students.

03:36:38.570 --> 03:36:40.230
A waiting list.

03:36:40.230 --> 03:36:47.710
I only allow 25 into my
class because it's special.

03:36:47.710 --> 03:36:49.800
That's how I live my life.

03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:56.880
It's how I support myself, and
that's what I continue to do.

03:36:56.880 --> 03:36:59.510
So that's my story.

03:37:17.590 --> 03:37:21.280
progressive, wonderful,
handsome men.

03:37:21.280 --> 03:37:23.910
You don't know how it feels
to be up here [laughter].

03:37:25.160 --> 03:37:34.480
I'm very pro the black man
because I had this wonderful father

03:37:35.520 --> 03:37:43.040
who gave me so much love that when
I hear women or anybody talking

03:37:43.040 --> 03:37:46.570
about my black man,
it hurts my heart

03:37:46.570 --> 03:37:49.860
because of the man that raised me.

03:37:49.860 --> 03:37:51.550
Because of the way
the man raised me,

03:37:51.550 --> 03:37:55.730
my father raised me to
be proud of who I am.

03:37:55.730 --> 03:37:58.850
Don't let this British
accent fool you [laughter].

03:37:58.850 --> 03:38:06.480 position:56%
I am a Jamaican woman who happens
to live in other parts of the world.

03:38:06.480 --> 03:38:11.930
But the diaspora that I come
from, I walk with pride.

03:38:11.930 --> 03:38:19.510
So my story is that I had your
typical nine to five job in London.

03:38:19.510 --> 03:38:25.560
I was a manager for a large retail
company, the only black woman

03:38:25.560 --> 03:38:29.230
in the entire company in
a management position --

03:38:29.230 --> 03:38:32.250
45,000 people in that company.

03:38:32.250 --> 03:38:36.610
I'm the only black
manager in the company.

03:38:36.610 --> 03:38:45.790
One day I am told that a customer
complained that it was unhygienic

03:38:45.790 --> 03:38:47.980 position:56%
for me to be standing near the food.

03:38:47.980 --> 03:38:49.280
I'm not touching the food.

03:38:49.280 --> 03:38:51.170
I'm not supervising the foot.

03:38:51.170 --> 03:38:52.470
I'm not selling the food.

03:38:52.470 --> 03:38:56.760
I'm just in that division
of the company.

03:38:56.760 --> 03:39:02.240
I was told to move to the
bra section, the manager.

03:39:02.240 --> 03:39:06.650
So I moved to the bra section
and that night I got home,

03:39:06.650 --> 03:39:14.060
I packed up my -- and came back
to London, and didn't resign

03:39:14.060 --> 03:39:16.470
like you're supposed
to -- give notice.

03:39:16.470 --> 03:39:17.830
I just quit.

03:39:17.830 --> 03:39:21.100
I just quit.

03:39:21.100 --> 03:39:24.370
My family was worried because
you need that reference

03:39:24.370 --> 03:39:29.540
from your last job to get another
job, and I didn't have a reference,

03:39:29.540 --> 03:39:31.460
and I wasn't going
back to say sorry,

03:39:31.460 --> 03:39:34.840
and I wasn't having a bad
day that day that I quit.

03:39:34.840 --> 03:39:37.310
I just had it.

03:39:37.310 --> 03:39:41.350
So I decided -- the kind of
personality I have I need to set

03:39:41.350 --> 03:39:43.280
up my own company, do my own stuff.

03:39:43.280 --> 03:39:45.220
So that's what I've done.

03:39:45.220 --> 03:39:52.660
I am a handwriting examiner,
a forensic document examiner.

03:39:52.660 --> 03:39:55.680
So what the hell is that?

03:39:55.680 --> 03:39:56.980
I don't read palms.

03:39:56.980 --> 03:39:59.100
Let's just get what I
don't do [laughter].

03:39:59.100 --> 03:40:00.810
I don't read palms.

03:40:00.810 --> 03:40:04.100
I can't tell you the future.

03:40:04.100 --> 03:40:07.580
What I do is I look at handwriting,

03:40:07.580 --> 03:40:11.550
identify the authenticity
for forged signature.

03:40:11.550 --> 03:40:15.860
Do you know how many
people forge documents?

03:40:15.860 --> 03:40:20.880
I didn't think this business
would survive the way it has.

03:40:20.880 --> 03:40:22.670
So I do two aspects.

03:40:22.670 --> 03:40:23.970
I look at profiling.

03:40:23.970 --> 03:40:26.600
I look at handwriting
and your personality,

03:40:26.600 --> 03:40:29.360
and I look at handwriting
for authenticity.

03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:32.920
So it's two different fields,
but I'm qualified in both.

03:40:32.920 --> 03:40:34.730
I just so happen to
be the only woman

03:40:34.730 --> 03:40:40.300
in the world who's
Jamaican qualified in both.

03:40:40.300 --> 03:40:43.520
So for a long time no
one took me seriously,

03:40:43.520 --> 03:40:46.200
not even my mother
who really loves me.

03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:47.770
So she would tell people.

03:40:47.770 --> 03:40:49.170
She's married to a lawyer.

03:40:49.170 --> 03:40:53.590
She would never say what I did,

03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:56.580
like I was a hooker or
something [laughter].

03:40:56.580 --> 03:40:58.250
She's married to a lawyer.

03:40:58.250 --> 03:41:03.540
So for years that was
my claim to fame.

03:41:03.540 --> 03:41:06.180
So I decided -- well,
a friend suggested,

03:41:06.180 --> 03:41:09.270
"Why don't you write a
book about handwriting?"

03:41:09.270 --> 03:41:11.380
So I says, "Yeah, but it
would have to be academic

03:41:11.380 --> 03:41:13.500
and who would want to read it?"

03:41:13.500 --> 03:41:17.210
Then this can only
happen in America.

03:41:17.210 --> 03:41:22.530
I was asked to talk about the
JonBenet Ramsey ransom note back

03:41:22.530 --> 03:41:24.460
in the time.

03:41:24.460 --> 03:41:25.880
I did not have the letter.

03:41:25.880 --> 03:41:27.980
Hadn't seen the letter.

03:41:27.980 --> 03:41:31.060
Just knew the basic
story like all of us.

03:41:31.060 --> 03:41:37.320
But I was asked 26 times to go
to 26 different events to talk

03:41:37.320 --> 03:41:39.650
about a letter that I had not seen.

03:41:39.650 --> 03:41:42.260
I would tell them I had
not seen the letter.

03:41:42.260 --> 03:41:43.560
Come, come, come.

03:41:43.560 --> 03:41:46.170
So I did. Twenty-six
speaking engagements, for pay,

03:41:46.170 --> 03:41:50.490 position:56%
across the United States, to talk
about a document that I hadn't seen.

03:41:50.490 --> 03:41:53.030
Only in America.

03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:56.530
So then I get there
and then I'm not white

03:41:56.530 --> 03:41:57.930
because they hear me on the phone.

03:41:57.930 --> 03:41:59.230
They think, oh, she's white.

03:41:59.230 --> 03:42:00.940
I get that I'm not white.

03:42:00.940 --> 03:42:02.400
Then it's a whole another palaver.

03:42:02.400 --> 03:42:09.220
One man said to me, "Oh, you're not
at all how I imagined you to be."

03:42:09.220 --> 03:42:13.080
I says, "Maybe a little
taller, yes [laughter]?"

03:42:13.080 --> 03:42:21.770
So on this trip of going on -- I
call it the JonBenet Ramsey tour.

03:42:21.770 --> 03:42:23.410
Poor baby.

03:42:23.410 --> 03:42:29.320
What was the most question
I was asked?

03:42:29.320 --> 03:42:31.210
"I met this man in Barbados.

03:42:31.210 --> 03:42:34.710
What can you tell me
about his handwriting?"

03:42:34.710 --> 03:42:39.000
No one wanted to talk to me
about the murder of this child.

03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:41.630
First of all, I was offended
that someone would be --

03:42:41.630 --> 03:42:46.940
I'm here to talk about the death
of a child and you're coming to me

03:42:46.940 --> 03:42:51.000
to talk about some man
you met in Barbados.

03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:57.730
So after about 15 cities I'm
hearing the same question.

03:42:57.730 --> 03:43:03.430
I'm thinking this might be the
book that I'm supposed to write.

03:43:03.430 --> 03:43:09.770
So that is how <i>Finding Mr.
Writ </i>, W-R-I-T, came about,

03:43:09.770 --> 03:43:13.600
which is handwriting, how
to look at handwriting

03:43:13.600 --> 03:43:15.990
and identify personality traits.

03:43:15.990 --> 03:43:17.900
So this was my first book.

03:43:17.900 --> 03:43:21.480
I got a major book
deal with Random House.

03:43:21.480 --> 03:43:23.540
Major, major book deal
with Random House.

03:43:23.540 --> 03:43:25.860
I couldn't even believe it.

03:43:25.860 --> 03:43:28.440
Because my mother always said,
isn't she married to a lawyer?

03:43:28.440 --> 03:43:34.710
So I asked the lawyer I was married
to to read the 15-page contract

03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:37.280
to make sure I was
getting a good deal.

03:43:37.280 --> 03:43:43.240
So I did. I got a two-book deal
with Random House -- unheard of.

03:43:43.240 --> 03:43:46.340
So I'm really an author now.

03:43:46.340 --> 03:43:48.170
I've always wanted to be an author.

03:43:48.170 --> 03:43:50.530
But when you're a little
girl you keep it to yourself

03:43:50.530 --> 03:43:53.870
because you don't want
to speak it aloud

03:43:53.870 --> 03:43:55.510
because you don't want
to sound silly.

03:43:55.510 --> 03:43:56.810
Back then.

03:43:56.810 --> 03:43:59.050
I'm an old woman, so back then.

03:43:59.050 --> 03:44:03.240
So I had read Fanon
and James Baldwin

03:44:03.240 --> 03:44:07.870
and so how could I be an author
because the people I was reading,

03:44:07.870 --> 03:44:13.130
they were so phenomenal, so how
could I be one of these people?

03:44:13.130 --> 03:44:16.180
So then when I'd written
this book and then I was

03:44:16.180 --> 03:44:20.360
on <i>Good Morning America </i>with
Diane Sawyer and we sold 6000 books

03:44:20.360 --> 03:44:25.430
in eight minutes, I was like, whoo,
I really am an author [laughter].

03:44:25.430 --> 03:44:28.940
So I had to go back into my
head because there was a story

03:44:28.940 --> 03:44:33.330
in my heart that had been in
my heart from when I was 18.

03:44:33.330 --> 03:44:37.750
What had happened is my father
had lost 14 members of his family

03:44:37.750 --> 03:44:41.240
in one night in a train accident.

03:44:41.240 --> 03:44:46.260
Two-hundred-and-fifty people
had died, 14 from my family,

03:44:46.260 --> 03:44:49.810
with the same name as me.

03:44:49.810 --> 03:44:57.150
That night my father locked it
away, had not spoken about it.

03:44:57.150 --> 03:45:00.880
So I started to go to
Jamaica to research that book.

03:45:00.880 --> 03:45:05.440
But because I grew up in England
I didn't really know enough

03:45:05.440 --> 03:45:07.510
and I wanted to give
the story justice.

03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:11.360
So I moved to Jamaica
to write that story

03:45:11.360 --> 03:45:13.110
because after -- I'm an author now.

03:45:13.110 --> 03:45:14.950
I can do this.

03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:17.780
So I go to Jamaica, spend
two years in Jamaica,

03:45:17.780 --> 03:45:22.310
and I write <i>Reaper of Souls </i>.

03:45:22.310 --> 03:45:25.780
the story that was
untold in Jamaica.

03:45:25.780 --> 03:45:29.380
I didn't realize how many
people were still walking

03:45:29.380 --> 03:45:36.840
around from this terrible night
unresolved, emotions unresolved.

03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:40.920
This book is now in the
hands of a director.

03:45:40.920 --> 03:45:42.220
I'm sorry.

03:45:42.220 --> 03:45:45.340
I would have come to
you first [laughter].

03:45:45.340 --> 03:45:46.640
With a movie director.

03:45:46.640 --> 03:45:48.350
This book is with them.

03:45:48.350 --> 03:45:53.600
But the thing with this book
was I was told by Random House

03:45:53.600 --> 03:45:57.100
that it wasn't Jamaican enough.

03:45:57.100 --> 03:46:02.180
So I was like, oh, thank you
very much, me gone [laughter].

03:46:02.180 --> 03:46:08.040
So I didn't try to -- I don't know
what it is to be Jamaican enough.

03:46:08.040 --> 03:46:09.340
I'm not a raster.

03:46:09.340 --> 03:46:10.640
I don't smoke weed.

03:46:10.640 --> 03:46:12.210
I listen to more than reggae.

03:46:12.210 --> 03:46:14.790 position:56%
So is that all it is to be Jamaican?

03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:17.510
I do have more than one job though.

03:46:17.510 --> 03:46:22.730
[ Laughter ]

03:46:22.730 --> 03:46:27.850
So I kissed Random House goodbye,
went to an independent publisher

03:46:27.850 --> 03:46:32.240
in Jamaica, and had the
book published in Jamaica.

03:46:32.240 --> 03:46:36.030
Then I fell out with them
because if you don't do it my way,

03:46:36.030 --> 03:46:38.250
none of it works, so.

03:46:38.250 --> 03:46:42.010
It was mainly inexperience,
the small press in Jamaica.

03:46:42.010 --> 03:46:44.460
So then my final -- well,
I shouldn't say my final.

03:46:44.460 --> 03:46:47.480
My third book, because I'm
working on a fourth book.

03:46:47.480 --> 03:46:51.600
Because I lived in London and
no disrespect to any woman

03:46:51.600 --> 03:46:56.410
in this audience, but I
cannot define my childhood

03:46:56.410 --> 03:46:58.640
through somebody else's childhood.

03:46:58.640 --> 03:47:04.960
There are so many young girls who
have been molested as a child,

03:47:04.960 --> 03:47:09.180
and beaten, and gone to bed hungry,
and all these things, that we --

03:47:09.180 --> 03:47:12.080
you know <i>Precious</i>
is a typical example

03:47:12.080 --> 03:47:15.620
of how young black
girls are defined.

03:47:15.620 --> 03:47:19.400
I am not one of them and
I'm not ashamed to hide

03:47:19.400 --> 03:47:20.700
that I'm not one of them.

03:47:20.700 --> 03:47:22.310
I had a father that loved me.

03:47:22.310 --> 03:47:27.300
Would come home from work 3:30
in the afternoon to be home

03:47:27.300 --> 03:47:30.690
so when I got home from school
I wasn't a latchkey kid,

03:47:30.690 --> 03:47:34.550
and would stay home with me,
cook dinner, and stay with me

03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:36.920
until my mother came home.

03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:38.420
I could never get into
trouble you know.

03:47:38.420 --> 03:47:43.140 position:56%
There was -- the leash was so tight.

03:47:43.140 --> 03:47:48.990
So I wrote this book as my
young life, <i>Bat Mitzvah Girl </i>,

03:47:48.990 --> 03:47:52.340
and the reason why it's called
<i>Bat Mitzvah Girl </i>because I had my

03:47:52.340 --> 03:47:58.420
mother and I had four Jewish
women across the street

03:47:58.420 --> 03:48:01.980
from my house who had no children.

03:48:01.980 --> 03:48:03.280
So I became their girl.

03:48:03.280 --> 03:48:08.390
So it's these four sisters, my
life with them, and my life back

03:48:08.390 --> 03:48:12.040
and forth from London to Jamaica
because I went to Jamaica to live

03:48:12.040 --> 03:48:14.650
with my grandmother for
a while, and I'm so happy

03:48:14.650 --> 03:48:18.080
for that two years
that I had with her.

03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:25.420 position:56%
So I wrote this and actually for the
first time self-published, which,

03:48:25.420 --> 03:48:28.420 position:56%
for everybody in the room that wants
to do a book for the first time,

03:48:28.420 --> 03:48:31.640
it's really not as easy
as they tell you it is.

03:48:31.640 --> 03:48:35.170
Because I had a database from
the Random House and a template

03:48:35.170 --> 03:48:37.980
of the marketing, it's
done very well.

03:48:37.980 --> 03:48:44.240
But I always feel as a first-time
author you try and get a publisher

03:48:44.240 --> 03:48:50.560
to help you because it's not
as easy as people try and do.

03:48:50.560 --> 03:48:55.070
So, I thank you very
much for listening to me,

03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:57.180
and I knew I [inaudible] talk
for five minutes so I'm sure

03:48:57.180 --> 03:48:59.190
that five minutes is way, way up.

03:48:59.190 --> 03:49:00.990
Thank you very much.

03:49:00.990 --> 03:49:06.710
[ Applause ]

03:49:06.710 --> 03:49:08.010
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: Good afternoon.

03:49:08.010 --> 03:49:09.310
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

03:49:09.310 --> 03:49:12.110
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: My name
is Gabriel Asheru Benn.

03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:13.570
I am an educator.

03:49:13.570 --> 03:49:18.860
I've been an educator here in
D.C. for 18 years as a teacher

03:49:18.860 --> 03:49:21.940
and as an administrator
for an after-school program

03:49:21.940 --> 03:49:24.160 position:56%
and a summer program, and et cetera.

03:49:24.160 --> 03:49:27.300
I'm also an artist,
a hip-hop artist.

03:49:27.300 --> 03:49:31.390
I go by the name Asheru
so I guess in the effort

03:49:31.390 --> 03:49:35.730
of telling my own story
in self-discovery.

03:49:35.730 --> 03:49:42.920
Asheru is a name that I
gave myself at 17 years old

03:49:42.920 --> 03:49:48.410
when I was in college, my quest.

03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:52.200
Yeah, my story is ever evolving.

03:49:52.200 --> 03:50:00.090
I feel like I'm just kind of moving
through my story as it's being told

03:50:00.090 --> 03:50:02.060
or kind of creating it as I go.

03:50:02.060 --> 03:50:06.220
But because I have these two
backgrounds of being an artist

03:50:06.220 --> 03:50:12.330
and an educator, I've kind of
spent my whole life finding a way

03:50:12.330 --> 03:50:13.630
to bridge the two.

03:50:13.630 --> 03:50:21.230
Early-on, I put on my first
independent project in '97.

03:50:21.230 --> 03:50:22.530
It was a vinyl.

03:50:22.530 --> 03:50:24.430
It was a vinyl and tape.

03:50:24.430 --> 03:50:31.940 position:56%
I was very proud of that, to be able
to put something out with my name

03:50:31.940 --> 03:50:33.240
on it, something that I wrote,

03:50:33.240 --> 03:50:37.640
something that I created,
and I still am.

03:50:37.640 --> 03:50:41.030
I continue to be proud everytime
I release something new.

03:50:41.030 --> 03:50:45.940
But I also was in [inaudible]
at that time on my first year

03:50:45.940 --> 03:50:51.340
as an educator, as a teacher,
and I never -- I went to school.

03:50:51.340 --> 03:50:52.780
I studied Anthropology.

03:50:52.780 --> 03:50:56.120
My dream was to work
in the Smithsonian.

03:50:56.120 --> 03:50:58.470
I want to take down that --

03:50:58.470 --> 03:51:04.900
just be a global traveler and
study different cultures and write

03:51:04.900 --> 03:51:08.260
and just -- kind of like
what Anthony Bourdain does --

03:51:08.260 --> 03:51:10.860
food, everything.

03:51:10.860 --> 03:51:14.680
Just experience the whole
thing and report back up.

03:51:14.680 --> 03:51:16.600
So that was kind of my thing.

03:51:16.600 --> 03:51:20.300
When I got back home from school,
the job that I thought I would get,

03:51:20.300 --> 03:51:24.240
because I had interned and done
some stuff with the Smithsonian,

03:51:24.240 --> 03:51:26.470
when I got back, the
job wasn't there.

03:51:26.470 --> 03:51:33.950
So I took this menial job
sitting in a cubicle, and one day,

03:51:33.950 --> 03:51:37.310
hating my job, I looked
in the classified ads,

03:51:37.310 --> 03:51:38.610
and I saw an ad for a teacher.

03:51:38.610 --> 03:51:39.910
It said, "Teacher Wanted."

03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:45.320
It just said, "Teacher Wanted"
and a phone number [laughter].

03:51:45.320 --> 03:51:47.750
I know. I called it.

03:51:47.750 --> 03:51:49.050
A guy answered the phone.

03:51:49.050 --> 03:51:50.740
He was the principal of the school.

03:51:50.740 --> 03:51:52.350
He had called it [inaudible]
Elementary.

03:51:52.350 --> 03:51:56.560
It closed down in '06, but he
answered the phone and he said --

03:51:56.560 --> 03:51:59.530
I said, "Yes, I'm calling
about the ad."

03:51:59.530 --> 03:52:00.830
He said, "You want to teach?"

03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:02.320
I said, "Yes."

03:52:02.320 --> 03:52:04.070
He said, "When can
you get over here?"

03:52:04.070 --> 03:52:06.220
I said, "Right now."

03:52:06.220 --> 03:52:09.810
I got in a cab and I rode to
Union Station to Southeast.

03:52:09.810 --> 03:52:11.300
Walked right up in the school.

03:52:11.300 --> 03:52:14.550
I introduced myself and he asked
me if I had ever taught before.

03:52:14.550 --> 03:52:18.750
I told me no, but I really -- I
think it was something that I --

03:52:18.750 --> 03:52:20.990
all of my mentors were
teachers coming up.

03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:23.200
I felt like it was
something that I'd like to

03:52:23.200 --> 03:52:24.650
at least experience, to try.

03:52:24.650 --> 03:52:28.460
I guess he was very desperate
for a teacher because --

03:52:28.460 --> 03:52:32.030
this was a Wednesday, and he
said, "Can you come on Monday?"

03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:33.330
I said yes.

03:52:33.330 --> 03:52:35.680
He said, "You got to turn
in two weeks or whatever?"

03:52:35.680 --> 03:52:38.490
I said, "No, let me
worry about that.

03:52:38.490 --> 03:52:40.400
I'll be here Monday."

03:52:40.400 --> 03:52:43.420
I went back to work, I quit,
I went home, I got ready.

03:52:43.420 --> 03:52:46.490
I started that Monday.

03:52:46.490 --> 03:52:48.150
I learned everything on the curve.

03:52:48.150 --> 03:52:50.590
The students taught me everything.

03:52:50.590 --> 03:52:54.260
The students in -- I had a couple
of older teachers who were kind

03:52:54.260 --> 03:52:58.230
of mentoring me through my first
year, and I really realized

03:52:58.230 --> 03:53:02.860
that not only did I enjoy it,
but then I saw a real need

03:53:02.860 --> 03:53:07.630
and a real service
that had to be done.

03:53:07.630 --> 03:53:12.930
So I just, from that point on,
committed myself to doing it.

03:53:12.930 --> 03:53:16.460
Now, while I'm doing this and
learning more about myself

03:53:16.460 --> 03:53:19.900
and being -- and what it
means to be a teacher,

03:53:19.900 --> 03:53:22.280
I'm still working on
this music stuff.

03:53:22.280 --> 03:53:25.150 position:56%
I had family that said, look,
you're going to have to give one up.

03:53:25.150 --> 03:53:26.470
You'll never be able to do both.

03:53:26.470 --> 03:53:29.480
You got to -- eventually
you're going to have to choose.

03:53:29.480 --> 03:53:33.300
Everytime I came to that point
where I felt like I had to choose,

03:53:33.300 --> 03:53:37.830
I had come to that fork in the
road, and I just -- I can't choose.

03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:39.130
I'll go straight.

03:53:39.130 --> 03:53:45.210 position:56%
So my whole life from there has been
a merging of these two passions.

03:53:45.210 --> 03:53:46.510
So, to fast-forward.

03:53:46.510 --> 03:53:49.980
A few years after that I
started working a private school

03:53:49.980 --> 03:53:51.280
with EDLE students.

03:53:51.280 --> 03:53:54.360
If you're not familiar, that
means emotionally disturbed

03:53:54.360 --> 03:53:55.660
or disabled students.

03:53:55.660 --> 03:54:00.790
I was encountering students, like
you said, students who were 13, 14,

03:54:00.790 --> 03:54:03.620
15 years old, but reading
on a second

03:54:03.620 --> 03:54:04.990
and third grade reading level.

03:54:04.990 --> 03:54:07.010
I'm sitting there like
how am I supposed

03:54:07.010 --> 03:54:12.950
to teach the student this
stuff that you want me to teach

03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:18.050
and is graded age appropriate,
when they're reading

03:54:18.050 --> 03:54:19.680
on such a low reader level?

03:54:19.680 --> 03:54:23.650
It was something that I struggled
with for a while, and yet I just --

03:54:23.650 --> 03:54:26.180
I thought about it and I said,
well, hip-hop taught me everything.

03:54:26.180 --> 03:54:29.460
When I was growing up people like
Mike Kemp, [inaudible] MC Light,

03:54:29.460 --> 03:54:33.900
Native Tongue, these groups were
like -- they were my teachers.

03:54:33.900 --> 03:54:35.680
I learned about drag nationalism.

03:54:35.680 --> 03:54:37.260
I learned about manhood.

03:54:37.260 --> 03:54:38.660
I learned about America.

03:54:38.660 --> 03:54:39.970
I learned about history.

03:54:39.970 --> 03:54:42.860
I learned about ancient
Egypt, Black Panther Movement.

03:54:42.860 --> 03:54:45.510 position:56%
I learned all of it through hip-hop.

03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:50.320
So I said, well, maybe I can
just take some of these lyrics

03:54:50.320 --> 03:54:54.560
and make textbooks, make
activities where they could --

03:54:54.560 --> 03:54:58.870
they already know these lyrics so
why don't we use this as our text,

03:54:58.870 --> 03:55:01.600
and then I could kind of
finagle the rest from there.

03:55:01.600 --> 03:55:05.340
So that's how I created the Hip-Hop
Educational Literacy Program.

03:55:05.340 --> 03:55:09.360
We made 13 titles, we travelled all
over the country, and we started

03:55:09.360 --> 03:55:12.200
to learn that teachers
were gravitating to it more

03:55:12.200 --> 03:55:14.320
than the students because
teachers were saying,

03:55:14.320 --> 03:55:16.370
"Look, I have this issue, too.

03:55:16.370 --> 03:55:18.840
What can I do for these
kids that I have?"

03:55:18.840 --> 03:55:22.130
It turned into a professional
development model.

03:55:22.130 --> 03:55:23.430
We started talking to teachers

03:55:23.430 --> 03:55:27.380
about culturally responsive
education using these hip-hop

03:55:27.380 --> 03:55:31.070
materials and other things.

03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:37.780
So that kind of spun into me
really stepping into being,

03:55:37.780 --> 03:55:39.910
I guess, a hip-hop educator.

03:55:39.910 --> 03:55:44.910
It was not meaning that I'm
coming in to teach you how to rap.

03:55:44.910 --> 03:55:48.270
More that I'm teaching you how
to look at the world critically

03:55:48.270 --> 03:55:52.630
through the lens of hip-hop culture
and the culture that I identified

03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:55.560
with as me being a hip-hop person.

03:55:55.560 --> 03:56:00.290
So that kind of started my quest.

03:56:00.290 --> 03:56:02.050
I still carry that
banner to this day.

03:56:02.050 --> 03:56:06.760 position:56%
Currently I'm doing a lot of work
with culturally responsive teaching.

03:56:06.760 --> 03:56:14.530
I just quit DCPS in August of last
year from just fatigue I guess

03:56:14.530 --> 03:56:18.040
and students getting killed.

03:56:18.040 --> 03:56:23.730
I went to my last funeral and I
just decided in August I was done,

03:56:23.730 --> 03:56:29.670 position:56%
and I left in -- I'm going to tell
you a quick story because I could go

03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:33.260
on forever, but I can kind of
sum it all up in this story.

03:56:33.260 --> 03:56:35.730
So I quit in August.

03:56:35.730 --> 03:56:38.790
In October -- I mean I'm
sorry -- in September I --

03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:40.700
now let me not just say I quit.

03:56:40.700 --> 03:56:44.290
I quit knowing, okay, I have
a little bit of savings.

03:56:44.290 --> 03:56:45.590
I have a wife, three children.

03:56:45.590 --> 03:56:48.820
I didn't just recklessly walk
away, but I knew, okay --

03:56:48.820 --> 03:56:52.330
let me start stopping for right now
because come August I don't want

03:56:52.330 --> 03:56:53.630
to stop in the school year.

03:56:53.630 --> 03:56:59.270
I want to find my new thing,
whatever it is I'm going to do.

03:56:59.270 --> 03:57:01.570
So I had a little bit of savings,

03:57:01.570 --> 03:57:05.140
what have you, except
-- August I quit.

03:57:05.140 --> 03:57:07.150
September I'm still
working, figuring things out.

03:57:07.150 --> 03:57:09.250
Not at school but working on
my own and doing my own thing.

03:57:09.250 --> 03:57:10.550
October comes around.

03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:11.850
Same thing.

03:57:11.850 --> 03:57:14.930
I'm lecturing, I'm doing some
little shows here and there.

03:57:14.930 --> 03:57:17.610
I got an ambassadorship
with the State Department --

03:57:17.610 --> 03:57:21.270
I'm actually a Global
Hip-Hop Cultural Ambassador --

03:57:21.270 --> 03:57:24.010
who sent me to Bangladesh
for the month of November.

03:57:24.010 --> 03:57:25.310
So I said okay.

03:57:25.310 --> 03:57:29.020
So I'm good until November, and
then when I come back in November,

03:57:29.020 --> 03:57:31.980
I mean from this trip, I don't
really know what I'm going

03:57:31.980 --> 03:57:34.430
to do and to figure it out.

03:57:34.430 --> 03:57:39.720
So I go out to Bangladesh
and I'm almost --

03:57:39.720 --> 03:57:42.130
not poor, but I'm getting there.

03:57:42.130 --> 03:57:44.040
I'm rapidly approaching.

03:57:44.040 --> 03:57:48.770
I'm over there, I'm overseas, and
I'm enjoying the whole time there.

03:57:48.770 --> 03:57:54.150
Our job was to kind of use hip-hop
as a form of cultural diplomacy.

03:57:54.150 --> 03:57:57.210
So leading these workshops
for students and learning

03:57:57.210 --> 03:58:01.480
about their culture and really
facilitating the process

03:58:01.480 --> 03:58:06.040
for these youth to tell
their story through hip-hop.

03:58:06.040 --> 03:58:08.490
Some of you may or may
not know but when I do --

03:58:08.490 --> 03:58:11.940
when you go overseas and you
meet young people who are

03:58:11.940 --> 03:58:14.500
in hip-hop culture, they're
heavily, heavily influenced

03:58:14.500 --> 03:58:17.290
by American black hip-hop culture.

03:58:17.290 --> 03:58:21.020
Yes, most of them -- what's
your first memory of hip-hop?

03:58:21.020 --> 03:58:25.270 position:56%
Most of them will tell you Chuck D.
Public Enemy is my first inspiration

03:58:25.270 --> 03:58:26.570
of hip-hop.

03:58:26.570 --> 03:58:28.100
It's not that now, but
that was their first.

03:58:28.100 --> 03:58:33.670
So it was a big deal for
people to empower themselves

03:58:33.670 --> 03:58:35.780
through hip-hop, to
tell their stories.

03:58:35.780 --> 03:58:37.910
Then once they stopped
speaking in English

03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:39.640
and speaking their mother tongue

03:58:39.640 --> 03:58:43.040
and tell you the story,
it's a whole new level.

03:58:43.040 --> 03:58:47.140
So being over there and
going through this transition

03:58:47.140 --> 03:58:50.080
and seeing these youth that are
starting to step into that realm

03:58:50.080 --> 03:58:53.150
of speaking in their
mother tongue and speaking

03:58:53.150 --> 03:58:55.570
to tell their story,
I was very inspired.

03:58:55.570 --> 03:58:58.320
I met these artists called
[inaudible] musicians

03:58:58.320 --> 03:59:01.120
who dedicated their
life to reading poetry

03:59:01.120 --> 03:59:04.440
by this poet named [inaudible]
and some other poets.

03:59:04.440 --> 03:59:08.630 position:56%
But they dedicate their life to this
poetry, this poetry so to speak.

03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:14.760
I collaborated with one of the
artists, and he was singing a song,

03:59:14.760 --> 03:59:16.440
and the song gave me chills.

03:59:16.440 --> 03:59:18.220
To hear this man singing
it just gave me chills.

03:59:18.220 --> 03:59:19.960
I didn't know a word
of what he was saying

03:59:19.960 --> 03:59:23.290
but it was a moving, moving song.

03:59:23.290 --> 03:59:26.450
So I asked one of the
people who were with us.

03:59:26.450 --> 03:59:29.900
I said, "What is he
singing about in this song?"

03:59:29.900 --> 03:59:34.630
He was like, "He's singing about
this bird called the chatak bird,

03:59:34.630 --> 03:59:37.550
and the bird floats
on water like a duck,

03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:41.870
but he never drinks the
water under his feet.

03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:46.440
He only drinks water that rain --
he drinks the rain what comes down.

03:59:46.440 --> 03:59:48.580
It's almost like this
bird is dedicated.

03:59:48.580 --> 03:59:53.820
He's patient and he's dedicated
to what the Creator gives him.

03:59:53.820 --> 03:59:57.610
He doesn't want to drink the water
that he's swimming in everyday."

03:59:57.610 --> 03:59:59.210
I was like, wow, that's amazing.

03:59:59.210 --> 04:00:02.150
So the whole arc of the
song I guess is what happens

04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:03.450
when it doesn't rain?

04:00:03.450 --> 04:00:05.710
Oh, wow. All right,
I'll make it very quick.

04:00:05.710 --> 04:00:08.050
So the story is what
happens when it doesn't rain?

04:00:08.050 --> 04:00:09.930
What does this bird do?

04:00:09.930 --> 04:00:11.230
He leaves it hanging.

04:00:11.230 --> 04:00:12.530
You never really get the answer.

04:00:12.530 --> 04:00:16.000
It's left for you to imagine
what does this bird do?

04:00:16.000 --> 04:00:20.980
So I come home and I'm back
from this amazing trip.

04:00:20.980 --> 04:00:27.040
I look in my account and I'm
like, wow, I'm really stuck.

04:00:27.040 --> 04:00:31.340
At this point I'm like,
well, I got to do something.

04:00:31.340 --> 04:00:33.580
So I'm doing these little
odd things, and I said, well,

04:00:33.580 --> 04:00:36.280
maybe I can apply for
unemployment just as something.

04:00:36.280 --> 04:00:38.890
They were like, well, no, you
can't apply for unemployment.

04:00:38.890 --> 04:00:40.190
You quit your job.

04:00:40.190 --> 04:00:41.490
You weren't fired.

04:00:41.490 --> 04:00:43.600
You don't -- you can't just
quit and get unemployment.

04:00:43.600 --> 04:00:46.180
So I'm like, wow, I
can't get unemployment.

04:00:46.180 --> 04:00:47.520
I'm thinking about
these other things,

04:00:47.520 --> 04:00:49.230
and then I thought about that bird.

04:00:49.230 --> 04:00:50.530
I was like you know what?

04:00:50.530 --> 04:00:54.940
I'm not going to drink
from that water.

04:00:54.940 --> 04:00:59.580
I'm just going to let the
rain fall and I'll be fine.

04:00:59.580 --> 04:01:03.110
So November comes, December
comes, and I'm like whoo,

04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:06.110
now I'm really being tested.

04:01:06.110 --> 04:01:08.500
January -- because I actually
-- the end of December,

04:01:08.500 --> 04:01:10.240
my birthday is December 29th,

04:01:10.240 --> 04:01:13.630
so right around my birthday I
get a phone call from this sister

04:01:13.630 --> 04:01:16.790
who I had hired maybe
eight years prior to work

04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:20.120
on this educational literacy thing
that I was telling you about.

04:01:20.120 --> 04:01:21.430
She calls me, and she's like

04:01:21.430 --> 04:01:24.870
"I've been looking for
you for two months."

04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:26.410
She said, "I got this job.

04:01:26.410 --> 04:01:28.180
I'm in Chicago right now.

04:01:28.180 --> 04:01:29.480
I'm working with <i>Discovery </i>,

04:01:29.480 --> 04:01:32.280
and I think this job
would be perfect for you.

04:01:32.280 --> 04:01:34.470
The only thing is you
got to come to Chicago."

04:01:34.470 --> 04:01:36.210
I was like, "Okay [inaudible].

04:01:36.210 --> 04:01:38.660
Tell me when it's bad."

04:01:38.660 --> 04:01:40.110
She's like, "No, that's it.

04:01:40.110 --> 04:01:43.520
You just got to come to Chicago."

04:01:43.520 --> 04:01:46.340
So I landed and took this
job from a woman who had --

04:01:46.340 --> 04:01:48.240
who was my employee years ago.

04:01:48.240 --> 04:01:51.240
She turned around and hired
me, and now when I do --

04:01:51.240 --> 04:01:54.350
after I left in August, I said I
wouldn't come back to this kind

04:01:54.350 --> 04:01:58.070
of thing, now I've been kind
of deployed to the South Side

04:01:58.070 --> 04:02:02.730
of Chicago, and I do the same
work on the South Side of Chicago.

04:02:02.730 --> 04:02:05.140
I do it four days a week,
and I come back home.

04:02:05.140 --> 04:02:08.610
So I commute back and forth, but
I'm working in the same community.

04:02:08.610 --> 04:02:12.820
This is a sign for me that no
matter how much I try to walk away,

04:02:12.820 --> 04:02:14.780
it's never going to happen.

04:02:14.780 --> 04:02:17.460
I'm always going to be
pulled back, and that's fine.

04:02:17.460 --> 04:02:19.910
I'm perfectly fine with that.

the topics that I speak about,
the things that I talk about,

04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:31.080
are all in that same vein of
being in service to my people,

04:02:31.080 --> 04:02:34.700

can never be torn from it.

04:07:37.410 --> 04:07:40.580
My grandchildren are in
Finland where Fins have one

04:07:40.580 --> 04:07:45.650 position:56%
of the highest educated populations
in the world from the [inaudible] --

04:07:45.650 --> 04:07:46.950
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: Correct.

04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:50.070
&gt;&gt; They all have a high
percentage of suicides.

04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:55.030
So, tell me how this can apply
in other parts of the world.

04:07:55.030 --> 04:08:00.230
My son has an interest in
children and hip-hop and --

04:08:00.230 --> 04:08:03.360
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: Well, I
mean I've been to Finland.

04:08:03.360 --> 04:08:09.470
I've travelled to -- I've been
to 24 countries doing this work.

04:08:09.470 --> 04:08:17.690
But what I've always found is
that hip-hop specifically is kind

04:08:17.690 --> 04:08:22.690 position:56%
of that voice for people who feel
voiceless, for people who don't feel

04:08:22.690 --> 04:08:24.910
like they're being
heard loud enough.

04:08:24.910 --> 04:08:28.410
They take to that culture and
that music because it's kind

04:08:28.410 --> 04:08:32.300
of the underdog culture,
underdog kind of music.

04:08:32.300 --> 04:08:36.270
But I use it as a platform
for youth to tell their story.

04:08:36.270 --> 04:08:40.000 position:56%
So, for example, in Bangladesh we're
working with youth whose parents,

04:08:40.000 --> 04:08:43.590
whose families are telling them
this is a fruitless endeavor.

04:08:43.590 --> 04:08:44.890
Don't do it.

04:08:44.890 --> 04:08:46.190
I want you to go to school.

04:08:46.190 --> 04:08:48.240
This is -- culturally
it won't help us.

04:08:48.240 --> 04:08:51.920
They have all of these pressures
around them telling them not

04:08:51.920 --> 04:08:54.180
to engage in, to hip-hop.

04:08:54.180 --> 04:08:57.500
What they're trying to say
is, this is saving my life.

04:08:57.500 --> 04:09:01.250
I wouldn't be here if
it weren't for this.

04:09:01.250 --> 04:09:03.500
I wouldn't have the opportunities.

04:09:03.500 --> 04:09:04.990
I wouldn't have the support system.

04:09:04.990 --> 04:09:07.280
I wouldn't have the worldview

04:09:07.280 --> 04:09:10.260
that I currently have
if it weren't for this.

04:09:10.260 --> 04:09:13.950
If I lose this I will have
nothing is what they were trying

04:09:13.950 --> 04:09:19.580
to tell their parents, because they
didn't feel empowered to do that.

04:09:19.580 --> 04:09:23.140
Our job -- well, I took it upon
myself just for the ones who were

04:09:23.140 --> 04:09:26.070
with me, was to give them
that platform to write

04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:29.690
and to tell their story, and
to say it to their parent

04:09:29.690 --> 04:09:32.990
or elder who's around them.

04:09:32.990 --> 04:09:35.480
Ironically enough, at the end

04:09:35.480 --> 04:09:39.130
of the workshops we
did a culminating show

04:09:39.130 --> 04:09:41.060
in the National Theater.

04:09:41.060 --> 04:09:42.900
It was standing room only.

04:09:42.900 --> 04:09:44.810
All of their families came out,

04:09:44.810 --> 04:09:48.160
and a lot of the families
afterward were coming up to --

04:09:48.160 --> 04:09:50.180
I would observe them
speaking to their youths.

04:09:50.180 --> 04:09:52.470
Some of them came up to me
or some of the other people

04:09:52.470 --> 04:09:55.920
who were facilitators, and
they were like, "Thank you.

04:09:55.920 --> 04:09:58.380
I needed to -- it gave
me a different way

04:09:58.380 --> 04:10:01.580
of looking at my child."

04:10:01.580 --> 04:10:04.350
To be honest, I kind
of sympathize with it

04:10:04.350 --> 04:10:09.560
because my father didn't support
me making music for a long time.

04:10:09.560 --> 04:10:18.350
It wasn't until my dad was in
Japan and I called him and I said,

04:10:18.350 --> 04:10:24.520
"I'm doing a show in
Japan next week."

04:10:24.520 --> 04:10:31.910
My father saw me perform for the
first time in another country.

04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:36.930
But it was the first time
he had ever seen me perform.

04:10:36.930 --> 04:10:40.890
I think, for him, it was like,
"Wow, well this is different

04:10:40.890 --> 04:10:42.190
than I thought it was [laughter]."

04:10:42.190 --> 04:10:45.620
You know what I mean?

04:10:45.620 --> 04:10:49.740
But it was how you do it.

04:10:49.740 --> 04:10:53.790
I've been trying to
tell you forever.

04:10:53.790 --> 04:10:56.170
So here it is.

04:10:56.170 --> 04:10:57.960
Other kids say that.

04:10:57.960 --> 04:10:59.940
It was empowerful.

04:10:59.940 --> 04:11:04.010
It was as impactful.

04:11:04.010 --> 04:11:11.180
I'm not from Bangladesh, but we
could still relate on that thing.

04:11:11.180 --> 04:11:15.840
In Finland, whether it's in
Senegal, South Africa, wherever,

04:11:15.840 --> 04:11:21.750
we all have a common story, and
that common story is what we share

04:11:21.750 --> 04:11:23.660
through the culture.

04:11:23.660 --> 04:11:27.230
Whether you're Finnish or
Dutch or what have you,

04:11:27.230 --> 04:11:32.480
there are certain things that we
all have in common, and the key is

04:11:32.480 --> 04:11:36.340
to find where do we intersect?

04:11:36.340 --> 04:11:39.110
Where's that thing
that we both can share,

04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:41.630
that we can talk about,
and relate to?

04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:46.560
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyah Muhammad: For me,
I think we always have to know

04:11:46.560 --> 04:11:50.420
that everything black people create
as a healing process, whether --

04:11:50.420 --> 04:11:57.340
what you have to be very concerned
is about the Africans in America

04:11:57.340 --> 04:12:00.880
who did not debate their freedom,

04:12:00.880 --> 04:12:05.470 position:56%
did not give anybody the
jurisdiction, including [inaudible],

04:12:05.470 --> 04:12:08.020
because everybody says
your master was nice

04:12:08.020 --> 04:12:11.380
but I ain't a slaves is
the discussion there.

04:12:11.380 --> 04:12:13.030
So, to me, there were Africans

04:12:13.030 --> 04:12:17.830
who would never accept
the very idea of slaves.

04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:22.520
Even now, [inaudible]
would say slave.

04:12:22.520 --> 04:12:26.790
Slave means genetically slave.

04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:32.990
But enslavement is the grammar most
progressive Afrocentric people put

04:12:32.990 --> 04:12:39.330 position:56%
out to correct this idea of my
slave father doesn't even sit right.

04:12:39.330 --> 04:12:46.860
So black people have to know
in America it is unfortunate.

04:12:46.860 --> 04:12:54.890
I don't want to be -- they have
to be as greedy as white people

04:12:54.890 --> 04:12:57.090
when it comes to producing,

04:12:57.090 --> 04:13:01.300
archiving their intellectual
property, because in those days,

04:13:01.300 --> 04:13:03.080
the imagination of a people.

04:13:03.080 --> 04:13:07.200
The kind of world they want to see.

04:13:07.200 --> 04:13:11.820
So, for me, whatever you label it,

04:13:11.820 --> 04:13:16.300
it could get lost in
the American shuffle.

04:13:16.300 --> 04:13:19.000
For me, don't ever forget Menendez.

04:13:19.000 --> 04:13:22.050
Study Fort Mose, John Horst.

04:13:22.050 --> 04:13:25.090
They're black people.

04:13:25.090 --> 04:13:35.050
I'm going to go to Mexico to
interview their descendents

04:13:35.050 --> 04:13:41.260
from Florida within
the whole black African

04:13:41.260 --> 04:13:44.450
and Native American,
Seminole, [inaudible].

04:13:44.450 --> 04:13:51.320
Those people never needed the
sanctioning of American historians.

04:13:51.320 --> 04:13:56.280
They continued for 100 years.

04:13:56.280 --> 04:14:02.340
They continued to commemorate
their historical journey.

04:14:02.340 --> 04:14:05.450
What is very important
is whether it's --

04:14:05.450 --> 04:14:10.210
underground railroad is
very, very important.

04:14:10.210 --> 04:14:17.610
But you have to know that
there is another movement

04:14:17.610 --> 04:14:24.940
that did not include white
people, and all gutsy people,

04:14:24.940 --> 04:14:27.720
white or black, have
to endorse those people

04:14:27.720 --> 04:14:33.590
for their qualitative
contribution to change America.

04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:38.380
They were very violent,
as violent slavery was.

04:14:38.380 --> 04:14:42.230
It's hard to sometimes to choose
for people who are trying to say,

04:14:42.230 --> 04:14:44.810
look at the past and instead
as a uniter but as a divider,

04:14:44.810 --> 04:14:48.390
it's very hard for them to look.

04:14:48.390 --> 04:14:52.630
I am very impressed for me and
my African friends when I go

04:14:52.630 --> 04:14:56.640
to a panel discussion in
Africa, in South Africa.

04:14:56.640 --> 04:15:00.560
I tell them, yeah, [inaudible]
in the United States of America.

04:15:00.560 --> 04:15:07.260
This was from Virginia all the way
to Florida, Mississippi, Alabama.

04:15:07.260 --> 04:15:11.120
Their history is critical because
-- a little kid says, if he says,

04:15:11.120 --> 04:15:14.710
"Abraham Lincoln liberated
me," that is not liberation.

04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:18.160
That is mortgaging, eternal
enslavement, because you're saying

04:15:18.160 --> 04:15:24.020
to me, "Somebody had
a lock to my freedom."

04:15:24.020 --> 04:15:28.720
In that whole drawing,
the very drawing --

04:15:28.720 --> 04:15:30.300
that image, visually,
that "Free me."

04:15:30.300 --> 04:15:34.570
It is a burden to blacks;
it's a burden to white kids,

04:15:34.570 --> 04:15:38.120
to reallocate the idea of
freedom to another human being.

04:15:38.120 --> 04:15:40.420
That debate has to die in America.

04:15:40.420 --> 04:15:42.430
That debate of saying,
"I freed you,"

04:15:42.430 --> 04:15:46.120
for every ignorant white person to
go around accusing black people,

04:15:46.120 --> 04:15:48.610
well, you don't seem
to be responsible

04:15:48.610 --> 04:15:50.150
to enjoy the freedom I gave you."

04:15:50.150 --> 04:15:53.450
That's every violence
against blacks.

04:15:53.450 --> 04:15:55.250
Free black people says that.

04:15:55.250 --> 04:15:57.420
So I'm saying change the narrative.

04:15:57.420 --> 04:16:01.420
Everything good black people
invent could also be poisonous.

04:16:01.420 --> 04:16:04.040
My brother's amazing.

04:16:04.040 --> 04:16:07.050
But I'll tell you, some of the
[inaudible] that is enriching Sony

04:16:07.050 --> 04:16:09.290
and et cetera and et
cetera is not trickling

04:16:09.290 --> 04:16:11.890
down to black economic
transformation.

04:16:11.890 --> 04:16:15.720 position:56%
Black people now cannot economically
produce their own anything.

04:16:15.720 --> 04:16:17.200
That's the [inaudible]
we're inheriting now.

04:16:17.200 --> 04:16:18.500
&gt;&gt; Hafiz Shabazz: True.

04:16:18.500 --> 04:16:19.800
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyah Muhammad:
It's very difficult.

04:16:19.800 --> 04:16:21.100
Book publishing --
Haci, [inaudible] Press,

04:16:21.100 --> 04:16:22.400
Black Classics, three black people.

04:16:22.400 --> 04:16:23.700
Even then, they don't
even have the money

04:16:23.700 --> 04:16:25.000
to really show you how many
black people are writing.

04:16:25.000 --> 04:16:26.300
In this kind of situation you
can't be flimsy at the expense

04:16:26.300 --> 04:16:27.600
of black people, especially to me.

04:16:27.600 --> 04:16:28.900
I'm a foreigner.

04:16:28.900 --> 04:16:30.200
I'm here as a guest to black
people as far as I'm concerned

04:16:30.200 --> 04:16:31.500
because they embraced me when
racism tried to mess with my mind.

04:16:31.500 --> 04:16:32.800
They embraced me.

04:16:32.800 --> 04:16:34.100 position:56%
They called me brother when I didn't
even know the meaning of brother.

04:16:34.100 --> 04:16:35.400
Therefore, I can't
compromise black people.

04:16:35.400 --> 04:16:36.700
I will not make a movie if I
have to compromise black people,

04:16:36.700 --> 04:16:38.000
and every deal that would come to
me is to compromise black people

04:16:38.000 --> 04:16:39.300
by saying, "Do another
<i>Driving Miss Daisy </i>.

04:16:39.300 --> 04:16:40.600
&gt;&gt; Haile Gerima: Miss Daisy.

04:16:40.600 --> 04:16:41.900
&gt;&gt; Bahiyyah Muhammad: Do
another <i>Barbershop 22 </i>.

04:16:41.900 --> 04:16:43.200
Do them. No.

04:16:43.200 --> 04:16:44.500
I will not buy that.

04:16:44.500 --> 04:16:45.800
To me, every black person who
does, it's their business.

04:16:45.800 --> 04:16:47.100
But I will not be in that position.

04:16:47.100 --> 04:16:48.400
So, for me, this is
fantastic and positive first.

04:16:48.400 --> 04:16:49.700
But where do you take it?

04:16:49.700 --> 04:16:51.000
Do not lose, do not
take everything black --

04:16:51.000 --> 04:16:52.300
don't go take it and take the tooth
out just because it's a piece of --

04:16:52.300 --> 04:16:53.600
or it creates a career for people.

04:16:53.600 --> 04:16:54.900 position:56%
As far as I'm concerned no living
black person, including black people

04:16:54.900 --> 04:16:56.200
in America, have no right

04:16:56.200 --> 04:16:57.500
to compromise the history
of black people.

04:16:57.500 --> 04:16:58.800
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: Thank you.

04:16:58.800 --> 04:17:00.100
[ Applause ]

04:17:00.100 --> 04:17:01.400
I think it is a big
issue doing that.

04:17:01.400 --> 04:17:05.660
But the -- I have hit
robots myself as a teacher.

04:17:05.660 --> 04:17:09.280
When you have black history and
Black History Month comes around

04:17:09.280 --> 04:17:13.420
and you have students who say off
the top, "I don't want to talk

04:17:13.420 --> 04:17:16.370
about Martin Luther
King and Rosa Parks

04:17:16.370 --> 04:17:20.950
and George Washington Carver
and the peanut issue."

04:17:20.950 --> 04:17:22.250
They say that.

04:17:22.250 --> 04:17:24.440
I hear that every year.

04:17:24.440 --> 04:17:26.070
I hear students --
somebody complains,

04:17:26.070 --> 04:17:28.030
somebody says that -- and it is.

04:17:28.030 --> 04:17:32.490 position:56%
It's on us to show a broader aspect.

04:17:32.490 --> 04:17:39.260
What I tend to do is not -- I mean,
I can't -- you can't skip the past.

04:17:39.260 --> 04:17:41.200
You have to talk about the past.

04:17:41.200 --> 04:17:44.580
But what I tend to do is try
to show it in the context.

04:17:44.580 --> 04:17:46.160
Context is everything.

04:17:46.160 --> 04:17:49.340
So even like what the brother
was saying about hip-hop artists.

04:17:49.340 --> 04:17:52.640
I take the same position
he does where I don't work

04:17:52.640 --> 04:17:54.760
to compromise the integrity
of my people

04:17:54.760 --> 04:17:56.630
in my heart, so I don't do that.

04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:58.570
Now, will that make me pay?

04:17:58.570 --> 04:17:59.870
Probably not.

04:17:59.870 --> 04:18:01.690
I can't sustain a living off of it

04:18:01.690 --> 04:18:04.330
but that doesn't mean
don't make the art.

04:18:04.330 --> 04:18:06.840
So I still do that,
but I guess the --

04:18:06.840 --> 04:18:09.980
to answer your question more
directly, it has to be put

04:18:09.980 --> 04:18:14.270
in a context of present and future.

04:18:14.270 --> 04:18:15.950
It can't just be past.

04:18:15.950 --> 04:18:20.840
It's the past, and how do we take
the past when it's happening,

04:18:20.840 --> 04:18:24.690
and what does that mean in
the context of white male?

04:18:24.690 --> 04:18:26.810
Then how do we take the
past and what does that mean

04:18:26.810 --> 04:18:29.080
in the context of what could be?

04:18:29.080 --> 04:18:31.740
But not -- what we tend
to do is we just focus

04:18:31.740 --> 04:18:34.300 position:56%
on the past and say, "Never forget."

04:18:34.300 --> 04:18:38.610
But the application in the
synthesis of what we learn

04:18:38.610 --> 04:18:44.780 position:56%
from about the past is what is going
to give the students the context

04:18:44.780 --> 04:18:46.900
for why we are asking
them to learn this

04:18:46.900 --> 04:18:50.870
and why we deem it important
even if they don't initially.

04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:52.480
Because once you put
it into context,

04:18:52.480 --> 04:18:55.410
then they can see why
it's so important.

04:18:55.410 --> 04:19:00.260
So like for example, this whole --
this started happening with Trayvon

04:19:00.260 --> 04:19:03.930
and Mike Brown, all of these
youth that are getting killed.

04:19:03.930 --> 04:19:09.480 position:56%
I'm talking about it in a elementary
school on the South Side of Chicago.

04:19:09.480 --> 04:19:10.780
It's right around the corner

04:19:10.780 --> 04:19:14.960
from a street called
Emmett Till Road, right?

04:19:14.960 --> 04:19:20.660
So we're talking about Mike Brown
and Trayvon on Emmett Till Road.

04:19:20.660 --> 04:19:25.770
When I ask, "Do you know who
Emmett Till is," some of them knew,

04:19:25.770 --> 04:19:27.210
some heard about the name.

04:19:27.210 --> 04:19:30.020
They didn't really know
the story and why --

04:19:30.020 --> 04:19:34.700
in context that is so pertinent to
right now, and so you have to --

04:19:34.700 --> 04:19:36.790
like I say, if you're
going to do it --

04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:39.650
first of all, it can't
just be in February.

04:19:39.650 --> 04:19:40.950
That's number one.

04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:45.600
Number two, you have to put it in a
context where you can see what's --

04:19:45.600 --> 04:19:48.330
how it relates to right now,
how it's going to happen.

04:19:48.330 --> 04:19:51.740 position:56%
I mean how it relates to the
future, and then also using the film

04:19:51.740 --> 04:19:53.280
and all the other arts

04:19:53.280 --> 04:19:56.040
because that's what builds
these images in our psyche.

04:19:56.040 --> 04:19:57.670
If you're going to
change our psyche,

04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:59.960
you have to use the
media that's created

04:19:59.960 --> 04:20:02.040
to do that, and we don't use it.

04:20:02.040 --> 04:20:07.010 position:56%
It's being made, but we're not using
it strategically to change that.

04:20:07.010 --> 04:20:11.130
So that's a lot of the work that
I'm looking forward to doing

04:20:11.130 --> 04:20:14.270
in the future and partnering with
people who do, because the media

04:20:14.270 --> 04:20:17.850
of literacy is a big part of
this literacy conversation.

04:20:17.850 --> 04:20:23.110
How do we contextualize this
media and use it to our benefit?

04:20:23.110 --> 04:20:25.790
That's a longer story, but, yeah.

04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:29.410
&gt;&gt; Beverly East: I am not in
the education system, per se.

04:20:29.410 --> 04:20:33.700
I would not have the
patience to teach.

04:20:33.700 --> 04:20:35.510
My personality does not allow it.

04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:38.470
Somebody would be dead and
it wouldn't be me [laughter].

04:20:38.470 --> 04:20:41.860
I think a lot of our
history has to come

04:20:41.860 --> 04:20:44.340
from our home, from the parents.

04:20:44.340 --> 04:20:49.280
I know everybody's busy, but I
think it comes from the home.

04:20:49.280 --> 04:20:53.620
Your self image comes from
your home or somebody.

04:20:53.620 --> 04:20:55.520
It doesn't necessarily
have to be your mother.

04:20:55.520 --> 04:20:56.820
It can be your grandmother.

04:20:56.820 --> 04:21:00.760
It can be somebody.

04:21:00.760 --> 04:21:03.880
Then black history's every day.

04:21:03.880 --> 04:21:05.320
Every day something is created.

04:21:05.320 --> 04:21:10.920
I was just asked am I going
to write about my father.

04:21:10.920 --> 04:21:12.680
My father is in this book.

04:21:12.680 --> 04:21:16.310
My father's story is
in the other book.

04:21:16.310 --> 04:21:20.300
His people died and the
Jamaican government --

04:21:20.300 --> 04:21:24.660
at the time we were not
an independent island.

04:21:24.660 --> 04:21:29.400
We were under village rules so
it was all hushed up and covered.

04:21:29.400 --> 04:21:32.720
So when I went to Jamaica
to write that story,

04:21:32.720 --> 04:21:36.510
everybody thought I was some kind
of spy or what has she come to do?

04:21:36.510 --> 04:21:38.890
What she really come to do?

04:21:38.890 --> 04:21:44.510
So I think especially --

04:21:44.510 --> 04:21:47.320
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

04:21:47.320 --> 04:21:48.650
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Press
the button on the bottom.

04:21:48.650 --> 04:21:49.950
&gt;&gt; Beverly East: Just press this?

04:21:49.950 --> 04:21:51.450
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: The
button on the bottom.

04:21:51.450 --> 04:21:52.750
&gt;&gt; Beverly East: On the bottom.

04:21:52.750 --> 04:21:54.050
Okay.

04:21:54.050 --> 04:21:55.350
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: It's on the side.

04:21:55.350 --> 04:21:56.650
&gt;&gt; Beverly East: On the side.

04:21:56.650 --> 04:22:01.760
I just think individually we have
to make it our duty to speak,

04:22:01.760 --> 04:22:03.810
speak up when we see something.

04:22:03.810 --> 04:22:11.620
I have a son who's 23, and when he
was a teenager I used to watch --

04:22:11.620 --> 04:22:15.220 position:56%
I can't remember the name of it now.

04:22:15.220 --> 04:22:16.800
Nine-o-two something.

04:22:16.800 --> 04:22:18.100
&gt;&gt; <i>Nine-o-two-one-o </i>.

04:22:18.100 --> 04:22:19.400
&gt;&gt; Beverly East: Yeah.

04:22:19.400 --> 04:22:20.700
Thank you.

04:22:20.700 --> 04:22:23.860 position:56%
I used to watch that 10/15 minutes a
day so I knew what he was listening

04:22:23.860 --> 04:22:27.430
to and what he was
-- what he enjoyed.

04:22:27.430 --> 04:22:29.950
So one day I'm in the car and I
said to him about Little Wayne,

04:22:29.950 --> 04:22:33.310
and he says, "Mom,
mom, stop, stop, stop."

04:22:33.310 --> 04:22:35.720
But at least I knew
who Little Wayne was.

04:22:35.720 --> 04:22:39.410
But he was -- but I felt the
only way I could reach him

04:22:39.410 --> 04:22:44.860
when he was 12 was through
rap music, and so my mother,

04:22:44.860 --> 04:22:48.800
who is 80-something years old,
she started to listen to Jay Z

04:22:48.800 --> 04:22:50.780
and everybody, so when
her grandson came

04:22:50.780 --> 04:22:53.980
to London she knew what
he was listening to.

04:22:53.980 --> 04:22:58.760
So I think it's an
individual road for all of us.

04:22:58.760 --> 04:23:04.470
When I see young black men on
the street I speak to them.

04:23:04.470 --> 04:23:06.930
If they've got earphones on,
what are you listening to?

04:23:06.930 --> 04:23:08.800 position:56%
They look at me like well, huh, huh?

04:23:08.800 --> 04:23:11.380
I tell them to pull their pants up.

04:23:11.380 --> 04:23:12.680
Pull your pants up.

04:23:12.680 --> 04:23:14.950
Pull up your self-esteem.

04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:18.290
It helps. It helps.

04:23:18.290 --> 04:23:19.590
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: Especially
from a woman.

04:23:19.590 --> 04:23:20.890
&gt;&gt; Beverly East: Yeah.

04:23:20.890 --> 04:23:23.480
My son would always say, "Mom,
don't, don't, don't do --

04:23:23.480 --> 04:23:27.490
don't tell me what I can't do."

04:23:27.490 --> 04:23:28.790
So --

04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:31.470
&gt;&gt; Hafiz Shabazz: I just want to
dovetail what Beverly is saying,

04:23:31.470 --> 04:23:34.780
is that all of us, when
you speak about history,

04:23:34.780 --> 04:23:39.840
we should journal our daily
lives, everything we do every day.

04:23:39.840 --> 04:23:41.390
We should write it in a journal.

04:23:41.390 --> 04:23:43.520
I don't need that.

04:23:43.520 --> 04:23:46.650
Write it in a journal, day by day.

04:23:46.650 --> 04:23:51.020
Then you actually record
a living history.

04:23:51.020 --> 04:23:53.970
So when your children and other
people want to know what's going

04:23:53.970 --> 04:23:58.470
on in the lives of
today, you have a journal.

04:23:58.470 --> 04:23:59.940
Actually write it down.

04:23:59.940 --> 04:24:01.240
That's what I tell my students.

04:24:01.240 --> 04:24:03.500
Each day write it in
your -- a journal.

04:24:03.500 --> 04:24:06.320
Then it's going to turn into
a book where you can sell it,

04:24:06.320 --> 04:24:10.800
but that's not important
because no one is going

04:24:10.800 --> 04:24:14.420
to actually tell our lives.

04:24:14.420 --> 04:24:15.720
&gt;&gt; Beverly East: I [inaudible].

04:24:15.720 --> 04:24:17.020
&gt;&gt; Hafiz Shabazz: No
one is going to do that.

04:24:17.020 --> 04:24:19.640
So you have to do it yourself.

04:24:19.640 --> 04:24:20.940
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Okay, we're going

04:24:20.940 --> 04:24:24.590
to let Dr. Madhubuti
have the last word.

04:24:24.590 --> 04:24:27.090
We started with him,
so we'll end with him,

04:24:27.090 --> 04:24:31.440
and that means we've
come 360 degrees.

04:24:31.440 --> 04:24:36.980
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: Haile Gerima
and I are of the same generation.

04:24:36.980 --> 04:24:41.860
So we come at this really in
a liberated way, all right,

04:24:41.860 --> 04:24:45.990
that we're not asking
permission for doing that stuff.

04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:49.130
That what he does in his film
and what I do in my books --

04:24:49.130 --> 04:24:52.070
the way he does this thing
[inaudible] create an institutional

04:24:52.070 --> 04:24:58.640
structure in D.C., and what we do
is try to fill [inaudible] school.

04:24:58.640 --> 04:25:01.820
We need to liberate a zone.

04:25:01.820 --> 04:25:08.600 position:56%
We need these zones so we can come
and talk and share and not hold back

04:25:08.600 --> 04:25:12.100
and tell the truth because
we do have traitors among us,

04:25:12.100 --> 04:25:15.890
and then we have to be
very clear about that.

04:25:15.890 --> 04:25:20.680
So we have been stopped by people
who going into secret meetings

04:25:20.680 --> 04:25:25.940
after they leave us, and,
therefore, we cannot move.

04:25:25.940 --> 04:25:29.410
What I think that we need to
really begin to understand

04:25:29.410 --> 04:25:34.310 position:56%
that we do not have in our community
that we need -- we need wealth.

04:25:34.310 --> 04:25:36.020
We need wealth.

04:25:36.020 --> 04:25:41.340
I mean, even this meeting required
some money to get [inaudible].

04:25:41.340 --> 04:25:43.030
Where did it come from?

04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:45.240
It came from us, [inaudible].

04:25:45.240 --> 04:25:47.900
We need wealth ourselves.

04:25:47.900 --> 04:25:52.090
Well, we can't even get past it in
this kind of economy because most

04:25:52.090 --> 04:25:53.390
of us do not [inaudible].

04:25:53.390 --> 04:25:56.230
Thanks so much.

04:25:56.230 --> 04:25:58.620
But like this young
man is [inaudible].

04:25:58.620 --> 04:26:00.770
&gt;&gt; I'm not blood.

04:26:00.770 --> 04:26:02.260
&gt;&gt; You're not?

04:26:02.260 --> 04:26:04.010
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: He
ain't but [inaudible].

04:26:04.010 --> 04:26:05.310
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: That's my brother.

04:26:05.310 --> 04:26:06.610
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: That's his.

04:26:06.610 --> 04:26:07.910
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: That's my mayor.

04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:09.210
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: That's a
national program right there.

04:26:09.210 --> 04:26:10.570
That's an international program.

04:26:10.570 --> 04:26:12.910
I'm so glad you [inaudible].

04:26:12.910 --> 04:26:15.380
We are international people.

04:26:15.380 --> 04:26:16.680
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: Yes.

04:26:16.680 --> 04:26:17.980
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: All right?

04:26:17.980 --> 04:26:21.260
We're not just right
here in Washington,

04:26:21.260 --> 04:26:26.630
D.C. or the South Side of Chicago.

04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:30.680
We travel all around the world.

04:26:30.680 --> 04:26:36.290
But the point is this
is our home base, right?

04:26:36.290 --> 04:26:39.000
He's not a foreigner.

04:26:39.000 --> 04:26:40.950
He's my brother.

04:26:40.950 --> 04:26:42.250
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Benn: That's right.

04:26:42.250 --> 04:26:43.550
&gt;&gt; Haki Madhubuti: You
don't ask permission.

04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:44.850
You hear that?

04:26:44.850 --> 04:26:47.130
So the key point now -- always

04:26:47.130 --> 04:26:54.070
when we leave here today is
what will we do tomorrow?

04:26:54.070 --> 04:27:00.110
How do we, each of
us, involve ourselves

04:27:00.110 --> 04:27:02.520
in creating these liberated
[inaudible]?

04:27:02.520 --> 04:27:03.820
All right?

04:27:03.820 --> 04:27:05.120
So we can't move in [inaudible].

04:27:05.120 --> 04:27:07.240
And, finally, this
is very important.

04:27:07.240 --> 04:27:08.540
We're going to pay for it.

04:27:08.540 --> 04:27:09.840
We have to pay for it.

04:27:09.840 --> 04:27:11.140
If you think you're going to
create anything that's going

04:27:13.740 --> 04:27:15.040
All right?

04:27:15.040 --> 04:27:16.340
That means that you come out of
your pocket, you pay dues just

04:27:16.340 --> 04:27:17.640
like you pay that 10%
at your church.

04:27:17.640 --> 04:27:18.940
Then this is a liberated
zone church, right?

04:27:18.940 --> 04:27:20.240
When [inaudible] says give me
$200 so I can get a new jet,

04:27:20.240 --> 04:27:21.540
I said I'll give you $200 for
a new jet if you just get away

so much to our knowledge,
to our enthusiasm,

04:27:55.120 --> 04:28:01.860
to our division here,
and to the Library.

04:28:01.860 --> 04:28:06.320
I want particularly to
thank Dr. Maria Fenton.

04:28:06.320 --> 04:28:08.820

that started this,

04:28:12.160 --> 04:28:15.320

the work that she has done.

They're always doing
the work together.

I want to thank the
Library, and by the way,

04:29:18.280 --> 04:29:20.690
we were not involved in money.

04:29:20.690 --> 04:29:26.220
Believe it or not, there was no
money that put this together.

04:29:26.220 --> 04:29:31.610 position:56%
It was just the goodwill of everyone
working very hard and wanting
