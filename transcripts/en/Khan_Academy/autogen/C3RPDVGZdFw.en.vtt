00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.984
 Here we have a rectangle, 

00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:03.711
 which is 5/9 from the meter 

00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:05.438
 and is 7/8 meters wide. 

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.597
 How is his face? 

00:00:06.597 --> 00:00:07.571
 I recommend that you stop the video 

00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:09.340
 and think about it. 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.436
 One way to think about it 

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:12.368
 is to say our face 

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:16.061
 will be equal to the width of the height. 

00:00:16.061 --> 00:00:18.235
 We will simply multiply these two sizes. 

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:21.708
 The width is 7/8 meters. 

00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:25.568
 This will be equal to 7/8 meters, 

00:00:25.568 --> 00:00:29.267
 multiplied by height, 

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:32.680
 which is 5/9 from the meter. 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.178
 5/9 from the meter. 

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:36.621
 How will this be equal? 

00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.835
 It will be a meter 

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:43.630
 per meter, which gives us a square meter, means a square meter. 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.911
 We can record it like that. 

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.287
 Then we will have 

00:00:47.287 --> 00:00:50.497
 7, it will be in another color, 

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:55.497
 I will have 7 by 5 in the numerator, 

00:00:55.578 --> 00:00:59.702
 which gives us 35, and in the denominator 

00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:04.702
 we will have 8 at 9, 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.710
 which makes 72. 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.503
 And we're ready. 

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:09.494
 This is the face of this rectangle. 

00:01:09.494 --> 00:01:13.497
 35/72 per square meter. 

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:15.102
 What I want to do is think more deeply 

00:01:15.102 --> 00:01:16.910
 why this is true. 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.044
 Or else to think about it. 

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:20.770
 To do so, 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.770
 will divide this area 

00:01:26.337 --> 00:01:28.612
 of the same rectangles. 

00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:32.980
 We see that on the horizontal we have 7, 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.479
 in the horizontal direction we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.674
 6, 7 or you can say that each row has 7 

00:01:37.674 --> 00:01:39.137
 such rectangles. 

00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:42.367
 In each column we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:43.810
 such rectangles. 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.512
 You see we have 5 1, 2, 3, 

00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:48.605
 4, 5, 6, 7. 

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:51.470
 We have 5 7 of these rectangles. 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 So we have 35 rectangles. 

00:01:58.925 --> 00:02:00.996
 I'll record this, 35 rectangles. 

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:04.354
 What is the face of each of these rectangles? 

00:02:04.354 --> 00:02:07.707
 The width is 7/8 meters, 

00:02:07.707 --> 00:02:10.165
 and is divided into 7 equal parts 

00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:14.614
 in the horizontal direction, this means that each one 

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:18.515
 is exactly 1 / 8th of a meter wide. 

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:21.645
 By the same logic, 

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:23.371
 if the total is 5/9, 

00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:26.033
 and the height of each is 1/5, 

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:29.873
 because we have 5 rectangles in a column, 

00:02:29.873 --> 00:02:32.107
 then the height of everyone will be 

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:34.179
 1/9 of the meter. 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:39.077
 What is the face of this part here? 

00:02:39.077 --> 00:02:40.661
 This will be equal to 1/9 of the meter 

00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.814
 1/8 meter. 

00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:46.879
 The face here will be 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.836
 1/9 of the meter 1/8 meter, 

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:54.396
 which is equal to 1 by 1 equal to 1, 

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:57.443
 9 by 8 is 72 and a meter by meter 

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.088
 is a square meter. 

00:02:59.088 --> 00:03:01.079
 Then face each of these 35 rectangles 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.092
 is 1/72 of the square meter. 

00:03:03.092 --> 00:03:05.753
 If I take 35, then the common face of all of them 

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:08.637
 will be 35 in the area of ​​each. 

00:03:08.637 --> 00:03:11.706
 35 by 1/72 of the square meter. 

00:03:11.706 --> 00:03:13.066
 How will this be equal? 

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.667
 That's exactly what we got here. 

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:19.182
 35 per 1/72 of the square meter will be 

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:24.182
 35/72 of the square meter. 

00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:31.474
 And this 35 is the same as what I got in yellow. 

00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:33.302
 Here it is. 

00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:35.293
 You can multiply by 5/9 

00:03:35.293 --> 00:03:37.792
 7/8 to get this. 

00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:39.947
 But I hope that when you think about the person 

00:03:39.947 --> 00:03:41.511
 of each of these rectangles, 

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:43.095
 you can find a clearer explanation 

00:03:43.095 --> 00:03:45.478
 where this number comes from.
