[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:10.143
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.557
SYDNEY PADUA: Thank you.

00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:14.640
You all have comics there.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.534
So I actually don't have to
talk, which would be great.

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:18.700
You'll have to bear with me.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.600
I still get nervous occasionally
in talks, especially when I'm

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.820
speaking to computery people.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.372
Because I'm not a--

00:00:25.372 --> 00:00:26.830
I'm not a computery
people at all--

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.880
computer person at
all, which is what

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.740
makes it strange to be
talking on technical subjects

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.520
at Google for a few times.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.010
So this is me normally.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.830
I'm an animator, cartoonist.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.880
My day job is this
sort of thing--

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.580
visual effects, which
I do do on computers,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.410
but very reluctantly.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.310
I started on "Iron Giant"
hand-drawn on paper

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.430
like a medieval peasant.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.290
Nowadays, of course,
we do everything

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.220
on these big machines,
which I actually

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.444
used to resent quite a
bit, which is strange.

00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:12.860
It's a bit strange
that I wound up

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.302
doing this comic about
these two crazy kids.

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:16.760
If you don't know
who they are, you

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.730
might have briefly passed
by them in Computers 101--

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.940
Charles Babbage, Ada Lovelace.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.440
I first met them in 2009 when
a friend of mine, Sue Charman,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.980
started "Ada Lovelace Day,"
which you might have heard of--

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.380
sort of online festival
of women in computing.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.200
And we were in a pub.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.040
And she said, Syd, you should--
you're a woman in tech.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.470
You should do a comic.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.670
You should do a post
for Ada Lovelace Day.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.410
So I said, I don't even
know who Ada Lovelace is.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.650
And I'm also not really in tech.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.740
So I just quickly Wikipedia-ed
her like anybody would do.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.460
And it was just such
an extraordinary story.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.970
And to me, it struck
me as very comic booky.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.700
So I just sat down in an
evening and dashed off

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.880
the following comic,
which this is cleaned up

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.250
from its initial appearance.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.210
And this was just to introduce
Ada Lovelace and Charles

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.790
Babbage to people who might
not know who they are.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.610
So Lord Byron, famous
poet and batcase,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.030
was married to
Annabella Milbanke,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.010
amateur mathematician.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.740
They split when Ada
was about a year old.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.900
Ada never met her father.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.350
He fled the country in a cloud
of scandal, never came back.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.970
And Ada's mother
was very concerned

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.240
that she would inherit her
father's "wild blood," what

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.840
people called this
poetical tendency.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.830
So Ada's mother's
solution to this

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.940
was to train her in
mathematics, logic, and science.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.140
So she had a very unusual
education for a girl.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.860
Charles Babbage, a
Lucasian Professor

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.434
of Mathematics-- a
position held by Newton,

00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:08.850
currently held by
Stephen Hawking.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.760
So you can tell he's
a pretty clever guy.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.130
In his own age, he
was extremely famous

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.790
for these mysterious
calculating machines

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.290
that he was burning through
government money designing.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.226
The most famous is
the difference engine,

00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:26.850
mostly because the
name is really cool.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.220
And it also has a book, "The
Difference Engine" written

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.430
about what if he had built it.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.690
They met in 1833.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.540
And Ada immediately fell madly
in love with this machine.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.940
The fragment of the
difference engine

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.556
you can still see in
the science museum.

00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:49.555
It's a wonderful object.

00:03:49.555 --> 00:03:51.964
It's about this
big, made of brass.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.380
That's the only
part that was ever

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.780
built of any of these machines.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.460
But the one that she--

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.740
what she was really
intrigued with was the--

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.385
oh, sorry, this gag.

00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:09.175
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.730
This gag, I think, might
have spelled my doom.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.209
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.894
So after she met
Babbage, she immediately

00:04:19.894 --> 00:04:21.769
asked him for the
blueprints for this device.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.530
She was very, very
keen on machinery.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.420
She'd always been a fan of
taking apart little machines

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.810
and clocks, doing factory
tours, that sort of thing.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.490
So she was very, very
keen on this device.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.580
But the one she was really
into was the analytical engine,

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.200
which was Babbage's
next piece of vaporware,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.140
which was a machine like
the difference engine.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.060
So the difference engine
was a machine for addition,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.640
to print logarithmic tables.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.500
It was basically
a gigantic adder

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.290
that could print in order to
print these books of tables

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.600
that would be used by actuaries
or navigators or whoever.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.110
Pretty much the same year he
met Ada, in the early 1830s,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.880
Babbage came up with an idea
for a much more complex machine.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.156
The analytical engine would be--

00:05:16.156 --> 00:05:17.950
would, first of
all, have a memory.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.475
So it could store the results.

00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:21.850
And then, it could feed the
results back into the machine

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.650
and use them.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.620
And the whole thing was
programmed with punch cards.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.800
And a little later in the talk,
I'll show you how it worked.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.860
In pretty much
every possible way,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.620
except for being made of
brass and driven by steam,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.130
it was a computer.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.860
Babbage worked on very,
very elaborate designs--

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.460
thousands of pages of
notebooks on this machine.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.140
Unfortunately,
because he had already

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.230
failed to build a considerably
less complicated machine,

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.180
he wasn't able to
secure any more funding

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.450
for his analytical engine.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.140
But he worked on
it for many years.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.770
For Ada, it was this machine
that she was very deeply

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.510
fascinated with.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.480
She knew Babbage
for about a decade

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.520
before writing this paper
that she's so famous for.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.420
And being a woman, of
course, her position

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.800
had to be on the
side looking in.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.320
But her big chance
came in '42 when

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.540
there was a publication in a
French paper from an Italian

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.600
who had transcribed a speech of
Babbage's in Turin, in Italy.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.480
This was the only really public
presentation Babbage had ever

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.190
done on the analytical engine.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.210
He was not secretive about it,
but he wasn't really pushing it

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.580
that much.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.860
So Ada took this paper and
translated it into English,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.610
because translation was an
acceptable position for a woman

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.710
in science at that time.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.710
However, because she
was so into this machine

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.020
and because she had many
ideas of her own about it,

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.900
she began adding footnotes.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.480
And when the paper
came out in '43--

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.730
I should say this is
from the original comic.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.740
So this is actually
the wrong date.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.430
In '43, her notes
were published.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.740
And the footnotes were
about three times as long

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.250
as the original paper
that she was transcribing.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.710
And in those footnotes,
there's all sorts

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.310
of really interesting things.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.750
The first description
of a loop, for example;

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.600
some wonderful programs, I
guess you would call them

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.625
in a way; and her thoughts
on the engine, which

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:43.500
we'll get into later.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.840
This is the program,
Bernoulli numbers.

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.660
It's more of what you'd
call a state table.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:54.200
It's just describing
the setup of the machine

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.380
in each particular iteration
of what it's doing.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.440
Unfortunately, of
course, Ada Lovelace

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.500
died very young at 36 years old.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.110
And Babbage never did
finish any of his machines.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:17.020
So this is me coming to the
end of the story in Wikipedia

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.560
and thinking, well, I can't
end the comic like that.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.654
That's rah, rah, rah.

00:08:22.654 --> 00:08:23.820
That's a really dumb ending.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.200
So I added the following panel.

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.530
And I think I was vaguely
aware of steampunk as a thing.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.569
I hadn't read "The
Difference Engine,"

00:08:33.569 --> 00:08:35.860
this famous book where they
actually build the machine.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.230
But I had heard of it.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.876
So I just added this to give a
nice punch line to the comic.

00:08:41.876 --> 00:08:43.500
I think I was thinking
of the Avengers.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.326
If you see them, they actually--

00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:51.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.690
Eh?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.000
I also added the following,
because something

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.340
to bear in mind is I do
hate computers very much.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.770
So there were two
big misconceptions

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.780
about this panel.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.154
The first misconception
is that it turned up all

00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:09.570
over the internet
a couple of days

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.790
after I put up this little
comic strip, all of which

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.644
you've seen at this stage.

00:09:14.644 --> 00:09:16.560
It turned up, I think,
in "Wired" and a couple

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.432
of other places
saying, this person

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:20.140
is going to do a comic
about Ada Lovelace

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.654
and Charles Babbage
fighting crime, which

00:09:23.654 --> 00:09:24.820
I had no intention of doing.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.740
This was a joke.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.839
The other misconception is
that they're superheroes.

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:31.380
They are not.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.250
They're clearly super
villains, because they invented

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.310
this horrible
thing, the computer,

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.100
which was the misery of my
life pretty much every day.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.630
So the gag here
is Ada, of course,

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:45.240
was raised to
destroy all poetry.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.510
And Charles Babbage,
famous as he

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.972
was for inventing these
calculating machines,

00:09:50.972 --> 00:09:53.430
was much more famous at the
end of his life for his crusade

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.790
against street
music, which made him

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:58.400
infamous in late
Victorian England.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.690
Let's see if we can
find more about that.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:02.950
Anyway, I'm very suggestible.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.950
And I was putting off
working on something else.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:09.440
So I started this
comic, "2D Goggles."

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.660
And it was very,
very, very informal.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.200
It was really just a
way of blowing off steam

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.330
at the end of the
day, and to draw

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.960
as well, because in animation,
of course, we don't draw.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.270
We manipulate
objects in 3D space.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:24.140
So I missed drawing.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.407
And I was like, eh, if
I draw a little comic.

00:10:26.407 --> 00:10:27.740
In this comic, they fight crime.

00:10:30.287 --> 00:10:32.870
They fight crime badly because
otherwise it wouldn't be funny.

00:10:35.948 --> 00:10:40.922
I think the thing
that eventually,

00:10:40.922 --> 00:10:42.380
through a strange
series of events,

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:46.257
resulted me in being
here is Google Books.

00:10:46.257 --> 00:10:48.590
And I'm really not just saying
this because I originally

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:53.600
designed this talk for
Google Books in California.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.910
Google Books is what
transformed this

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.170
from a little squib of a comic
into something that I think

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.630
was genuinely interesting.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.490
The comic began when Google
Books was at very early stages.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:12.500
And it was dumping the
19th century searchable

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.260
online in a way that had
never happened before.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.160
And that meant any
random clown, such as me,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.650
could just type
"Babbage", "Lovelace,"

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.180
into these search terms and turn
up just sheer amounts of stuff.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.342
This is very typical.

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:30.800
I think the first thing that
I was really surprised to find

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.650
was that Babbage and Lovelace
were very, very famous

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.300
people in their period.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.750
Lovelace was a celebrity child.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.820
And Babbage was actually a
big time celebrity himself

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.890
as this intellectual who had
invented this amazing thing

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.300
that nobody could understand.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.210
So this is from
the "Deseret News"

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.210
in Utah, just a piece
of anecdotes about them,

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.655
which is very commonly
the way this shows up.

00:11:57.655 --> 00:12:00.155
I like this one, "Babbage the
logarithmetical Frankenstein."

00:12:00.155 --> 00:12:02.344
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.975
Lovelace shows up considerably
less than Babbage.

00:12:09.909 --> 00:12:12.200
"Lady Lovelace, he was amused
by my saying that Babbage

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.550
and not Byron should
have been her father."

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.380
She was apparently
a bit of a bore.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.199
That's one of the things we can
get out of people's anecdotes

00:12:18.199 --> 00:12:20.240
about her is that she was
a bit of a drag talking

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.551
about mathematics at dinner
parties, which I advise you not

00:12:23.551 --> 00:12:24.050
to do.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.840
So you get a ton of stuff
on Babbage all the time,

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.640
not so much about Lovelace
because she's much more--

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:36.840
being female, of course,
she's a less public figure.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:42.710
But it was enough
to start adding

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:44.000
these little bits to the blog.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.450
So this is the way that
the blog developed.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.250
This would be the
end of the comic.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.200
Here's Ada Lovelace
being chased by monkeys

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.870
as, of course, you are.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.900
And then they'd be followed
by all these footnotes, which

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:03.870
would be whatever stuff I had
found online just browsing

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.200
around--

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.270
training methods
of organ grinder's

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.834
monkeys, the
Bridgewater Treatise,

00:13:09.834 --> 00:13:11.500
which was this thing
that Babbage wrote.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:21.290
So through that combination of
improvising online and reading,

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:24.140
I guess, eyewitness accounts
of them in the period,

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.420
I was constructing
these characters.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.710
And they're very consciously
comic book characters.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:32.840
They're not intended as
a reproduction of them

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.950
as historical people.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:38.160
But they're, I guess, a riff
or an improvisation on them.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.610
Lovelace, and here's Baggage.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.100
Baggage is always very
easy to draw because he

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.900
wrote tons of stuff, actually.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.810
Even though, weirdly, the only
thing he didn't write about

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:49.520
was the analytical engine.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.960
He wrote about taxation.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.580
And he wrote about copyright.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.350
And he wrote this
massive autobiography

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.180
that's super
entertaining-- very, very

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.550
funny, entertaining guy.

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.080
So his personality
is super clear.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.550
I was really pleased to
find this in "Punch."

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.680
So this is him in 1852.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.660
He's really angry that his--

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.660
they didn't put the engine,
the difference engine

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.730
bit in the Great Exhibition.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.790
So he was only
honorably mentioned.

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.130
So he's pretty mad.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.510
But I think he comes out.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.680
This is-- so just to--

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.310
it said I talk about my process
of creative transformations.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.601
So I guess that's what I'll do.

00:14:30.601 --> 00:14:33.590
So this is the "New
York Mirror," 1833.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.640
This is the same
year she met Baggage.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.510
I don't-- if you can read
it, it says, "Oh, fie.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:41.600
It is said that Ada Byron, sole
daughter of the noble Bard,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.440
is the most coarse and vulgar
woman in England," which

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.827
is one of those things
that is very intriguing.

00:14:47.827 --> 00:14:48.410
And it's true.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.390
In her letters, she
does swear, which

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.285
is very unusual for
a Victorian woman.

00:14:54.285 --> 00:14:55.910
This is something else I found.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.434
This is from-- this is actually
from Babbage's pamphlet

00:14:59.434 --> 00:15:01.100
on the Great Exhibition,
which is mostly

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.190
about why isn't my engine
in the Great Exhibition,

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.776
where he is describing
what it can do.

00:15:05.776 --> 00:15:07.400
And one of the things
that he describes

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.090
is the world's
first error pop-up.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.590
If you put the
wrong logarithm in,

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.905
it will put a plate that would
snap up and say, "wrong."

00:15:15.905 --> 00:15:18.006
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.680
In his autobiography, he
adds the continually ringing

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.870
loud bell, which would
be fantastic, I'm sure,

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.540
if you were the guy in
charge of the machine.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:31.940
So with this, I came
up with Ada Lovelace

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.480
is debugging one of her
programs here in the engine.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.190
Babbage is showing the engine
to Queen Victoria, of course.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.470
So the comic, generally
speaking, if you read the book,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.240
it's mostly me making
fun of computers

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.770
and just using these hapless
people as my tools for this.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.810
But I was able to find as
well some really magical stuff

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.390
in Google Books-- and
I guess important,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.990
unimportant, but really
important stuff as well.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.670
This is a letter
that would certainly

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.940
have been lost to
scholarship if it

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.500
hadn't been for Google Books.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.540
Because it only
appears, as far as I

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.430
know, in a very obscure journal
called "The Southern Review,"

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.420
Maryland, 1864.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.130
And they're just
printing letters home

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.800
from people and
just random stuff.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:35.890
And there's a guy who
met Babbage in there.

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:41.410
And we have here, "Babbage spoke
highly of a mathematical powers

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.780
and a peculiar capability
higher, he said,

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.450
than that of anyone
he knew to prepare."

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.241
I believe it was the
descriptions connected

00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:49.169
with his calculating machine.

00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:51.460
He says, "I fear I'm not
expressing myself rightly here

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.168
as to the precise
nature of the subject."

00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:59.540
I think the descriptions is
the state tables, the programs,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.040
which is--

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.814
it's pretty magical to
find something like that.

00:17:03.814 --> 00:17:04.480
It's quite long.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.555
He really goes into
the relationship.

00:17:07.555 --> 00:17:09.589
This is a couple of
years after Ada had died.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.230
So that kind of thing--

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:22.140
I guess the intersection
between scholarship

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.800
and primary sources, and
then just improvisation

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.360
and imagination-- that's what
the comic was basically about.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.250
So these two
characters, I think,

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.040
became pretty clear to me.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.710
When I had to sit
down to write a book--

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:40.460
I didn't have to sit
down to write a book.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.800
But they told me to write
a book, so I wrote a book.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.980
There was a third character that
I had to come to grips with.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.540
And that was the
analytical engine.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:53.271
The analytical engine-- and in
the comic appears like this.

00:17:53.271 --> 00:17:57.900
This is George Eliot getting
her novel spell checked.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.880
She gets lost and almost eaten.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.810
But in the comic, the machine--

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.072
like the way it's
actually described

00:18:06.072 --> 00:18:08.280
by contemporary people, and
even by Babbage, and even

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.290
by Lovelace-- you just
get this impression

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:15.207
of this enormous bunch
of cogs doing something.

00:18:15.207 --> 00:18:16.290
And it's very complicated.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.130
And you can't understand it.

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.640
But because I had so
much primary stuff

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.590
about Babbage and Lovelace,
I felt I had to have--

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.450
now here's the real
analytical engine.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.710
So I sat down to
do a visualization.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.300
And I was very upset to find
that no one had done one

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.631
that I could rip off.

00:18:38.631 --> 00:18:41.350
All I had was the Babbage plan.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.600
So this is plan 25.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.960
This is a pretty famous image.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:49.560
You might have seen it in
computer history books.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:54.537
But actually, it's a lot more
ambiguous than it might seem.

00:18:54.537 --> 00:18:56.370
These are the cards,
the famous punch cards.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:57.626
But how are the attached?

00:18:57.626 --> 00:18:58.500
And where do they go?

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:58.980
Are they up?

00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.688
Or are they down?

00:18:59.688 --> 00:19:02.400
Are they to scale?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.320
Babbage left not a
lot of elevations,

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.720
which makes it hard to
understand the machine.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.120
So I had to sit down
with these plans.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.092
And I have to say, I also
used the scholarly work

00:19:14.092 --> 00:19:15.800
of Allen Bromley, the
late Allen Bromley,

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.490
who really went
through and explained

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.610
the mathematics of the
machine with extreme detail.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.510
So between the Bromley
papers and the diagrams,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.520
I was able to do
some elevations.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.180
Come on.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:30.680
There we go.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:37.290
That's to scale.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.840
It's a really big machine--

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.600
to get a sense of the
reality of this thing.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.350
And using that, I
was able to produce

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.980
this, which was the first
visualization, to my knowledge,

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.900
of the machine.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:57.310
It should be fairly
accurate-ish.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:59.440
I have a feeling it couldn't
have been freestanding

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.470
like this just because of the
sheer weight of the thing.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.200
I think it would probably have
to be in one of those warehouse

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:10.540
buildings, basically embedded
into the structure of a pretty

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.870
heavy, hefty building.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:18.100
But I'll go over
how this machine

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.690
works, because that's my purpose
for being here, I suppose.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:33.120
So this is the store, which
is the memory, basically.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.640
It's a lot easier to describe
this machine in Maya, actually.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.900
So I'm gonna switch over.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.357
Babbage himself said that one of
the reasons he didn't describe

00:20:45.357 --> 00:20:46.940
his machine very
much was because it's

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.420
very difficult to
explain how it works

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.820
without being able to show it.

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.050
And boy, is he ever right.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:58.430
Because I find it impossible
to explain without--

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.340
and I found it actually
impossible to understand

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.720
without basically building
it and animating it.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.450
But that wound up being a
really, really good tool.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.490
So this is just a slice of it.

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:17.380
To see how the whole
thing looks, turn on--

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.100
here's my naming
convention, whole thing.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:22.060
OK, there we go.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.440
So come on.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.130
As you can-- you can see
why I'm only using a slice.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.320
My laptop is pretty
strong but it's really

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.611
struggling with the--

00:21:33.611 --> 00:21:34.110
come on.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.370
There we go.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.061
Eeee.

00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:38.560
Eeee.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.480
There we go.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:39.980
OK.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:40.620
There we go.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.500
So what you're
looking at here is

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.460
a machine for manipulating
very large numbers.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.439
That's what Babbage
designed it for.

00:21:51.439 --> 00:21:52.980
And every single
piece of the machine

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.700
is to add, subtract,
multiply, divide large numbers

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:59.820
as quickly as possible.

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.670
The machine was not designed
to produce a single result.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.780
It was designed to run through
iterations of a formula

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:08.940
to print out into books.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.070
So basically, what
you would have is

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:16.120
we need x formula
for life insurance.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.160
What are the premiums if
you're such and such an age?

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.780
And it would just run down and
print for each successive age

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.534
what the statistics are.

00:22:26.534 --> 00:22:28.450
That's the sort of thing
this machine was for.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.090
Each of these
columns is a number.

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.900
Babbage specified 50 digits
for his ideal machine.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.110
So these are 50 gears.

00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:45.140
And the way you store a number
is you just turn each gear.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.360
So if you want to put 351,
you go three, five, one places

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.320
on each gear.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.120
And you just go down.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.620
Even I can understand that part.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:59.080
So it's pretty straightforward.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.740
As to how much storage he had,
everyone wants more memory.

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:07.030
I think Babbage said
ideally 1,000 places.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.640
You can see, if I pop
back to the design,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.860
he puts the memory
running off the page.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.980
So I'm sure he would
have ideally added

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.640
more and more memory to that.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.730
And the memory just goes
off into the distance.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.400
So if I turn that off--

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.710
so each layer, all that
height is only because it's

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:32.700
such big numbers that it's for.

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.430
So the mass of the
machinery is just

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.890
replicating the decimal places.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.530
So this is just a very super,
super, super simplified

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.550
demo with one--

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:49.810
[INAUDIBLE] quality
here-- with one decimal

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:53.922
place just to go through
this amazing machine.

00:23:53.922 --> 00:23:55.630
Because it's an absolute
thing of beauty.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:58.810
And when you consider this was
designed in the 1830s and '40s

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:05.270
by a guy with literally a
feather and some candles,

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.930
it's pretty amazing because
this was all held in his head.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.240
It took three types of
card to run the machine--

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.870
number card, variable card--
this is the addressing system,

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:20.790
basically--

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:25.200
and the operations card,
which has the program itself.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:29.490
Fortunately, very recently,
I had some lovely pictures

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:34.110
sent to me by Bruce Sterling,
actually, who's in Turin

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:38.190
and found some of the
stuff that Babbage left

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:40.230
when he gave his talk there.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.720
This is the number card
sample that he left.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.239
So this is pi written
on the number card.

00:24:46.239 --> 00:24:48.030
And you can see the
way the card is written

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.310
is that the important
places-- so three

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:53.130
has three unpunched holes.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:58.390
Here's an operations card.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.100
Come back to that in a sec.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.410
But if you look at the--

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.130
if you go back to
the number card,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.340
the whole machine was
built off of the principle

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.260
of the Jacquard loom.

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.290
If you ever see one of those,
all that happens with the loom

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.930
is that you have--

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:18.245
go to the number
cards over here.

00:25:18.245 --> 00:25:21.270
So you'd have an array.

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:25.260
On a number card, you'd
have 10 little levers

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.390
for 50 decimal places.

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:29.000
It's like 500 little levers.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.930
This is actually not 500.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.610
I didn't go that crazy with it.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:37.800
But it would have been an
extremely complicated machine.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:42.540
And the way it
works is the spindle

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.830
pushes the card forward.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.500
If there is a hole, it just goes
through the lever and nothing

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.280
happens.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.830
If there's not a
hole, then the lever

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:55.560
pushes forward and
basically engages some part

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:58.410
of the machine to the power.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.554
Underneath the machine are
cams continually turning,

00:26:02.554 --> 00:26:04.470
driven, presumably, by
the steam engine that's

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.900
puffing away in the corner.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.650
And the lever will just hook
up something to the cam.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.539
And it will go either up
and down or round and round.

00:26:13.539 --> 00:26:15.580
That's basically the two
things that cams can do.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.413
But if you put them
together in clever ways,

00:26:17.413 --> 00:26:21.262
you can do some
pretty good stuff.

00:26:21.262 --> 00:26:22.470
So that's how the cards work.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:29.030
The way the machine works is
the first thing that happens

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:32.109
is the variable card, which I
always call them address cards

00:26:32.109 --> 00:26:33.650
just because it's
a lot clearer to me

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.260
to think of this as
the addressing system.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.470
And this would have
a hole, I presume,

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:41.600
for each position in the memory.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:45.110
So you would eventually
have a ginormous card,

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:49.220
unless you came up with
some more clever system.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.130
And that just depresses
a lever, which

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.530
hooks up its corresponding
section in the memory

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.054
to a little pinion.

00:26:57.054 --> 00:26:57.970
Then the number card--

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.010
red means it's driving.

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:04.340
Green means it's being driven.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.050
It's just a bit clearer
to understand that way.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:13.280
So then the number card
will read just by turning--

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.040
all it does is just
say turn three places.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.160
Turn however many places there
are no holes in this section.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.840
So that turns three
places, so three.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.420
The rack goes three places,
pinion goes three places,

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:27.450
gear goes three places.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:30.540
It's now reading three.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.560
Disengage.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.200
So then it reads
in another number.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.760
Variable card
selects the address.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.570
Number card reads
out a number into it.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.890
These cards are run
completely separately.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:46.640
So when you are
setting up the program,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.107
you're wrangling three
completely separate cards.

00:27:49.107 --> 00:27:50.690
And you really better
hope that you've

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.940
got them in the right order.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.440
Otherwise, you'll
get those pop-ups.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:03.540
Now, the operations
card is, to me,

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:07.338
where the real beauty
of the machine is.

00:28:07.338 --> 00:28:10.270
Let's go pop over to the
operations card here.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:10.840
Hmm.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.930
There we go.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.020
You can see here, this is
Babbage's own handwriting.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.720
He has all the functions-- add,
subtract, multiply, divide.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:23.220
This is demonstrating
a division.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.980
It's always got these two
holes-- add rotation, subtract

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:26.809
rotation.

00:28:26.809 --> 00:28:28.350
That means the
machine could instruct

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.580
itself to go back or
forward, depending

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.510
on the state of the machine.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.670
And I'll explain how
that works in a sec.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.870
So how could you go through
such a complex procedure

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:48.190
with a single hole?

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:52.860
Because addition alone
took several dozen steps

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.400
of many, many different
bits of machinery, the way

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.680
he did that is with the
barrels, which is funny

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.400
because he actually took
these from the barrel organs

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.339
that he hated so much.

00:29:04.339 --> 00:29:05.880
But he must have
loved that mechanism

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.780
because he stuck these
barrels all over the place.

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.560
And the way that he uses them
is that the operations card will

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.140
say, add, let's say.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.670
Push forward, and
then the barrels

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:22.280
will rotate to a
wedge of instructions.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.230
So all that the
add position does

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:32.120
is say, go to the add
set of instructions.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.050
And once that's
set up, the numbers

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:40.165
are then ordered from
the variable card.

00:29:40.165 --> 00:29:41.810
The variable card hooks up.

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:42.810
It's got its own barrel.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:44.657
Any of the cards
are using barrels

00:29:44.657 --> 00:29:46.740
because they need to run
through a bunch of stuff.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.860
And that reads off
their designated address

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:57.984
into the ingress axis,
which then reads it off

00:29:57.984 --> 00:29:59.150
into these wonderful wheels.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.120
I love these things.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.350
He got rid of these
in the later designs

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.820
for the machine, which is sad.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.240
Because I love the
clarity of this giant data

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.570
transfer thing in the middle.

00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:16.940
So this would send the
number to this section.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.032
Each of these sections
in the middle--

00:30:19.032 --> 00:30:22.500
pop back to look at the--

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.250
so each of these sections
is specialized gearing.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:30.950
And it's largely
adding stuff, but just

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:32.850
special types of addition.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.096
And it just says, OK, go
to the adding section.

00:30:37.096 --> 00:30:41.916
So it feeds the one number
in, picks up another number,

00:30:41.916 --> 00:30:44.580
feeds that one in.

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:49.360
And then the barrels just go
through their little routine.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.120
This, obviously, is a cartoon.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.640
These are really, really
complicated bits of gear.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.420
But I just put this together
for my own illustration.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.020
So they run through
their instruction set.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:05.570
There's the result.
The variable cards

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:09.230
select the address that they
want the result to read out to.

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:13.012
So that's fed into the
egress access, or output

00:31:13.012 --> 00:31:13.970
I guess we call it now.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:22.387
Variable cards
pick up, give where

00:31:22.387 --> 00:31:23.470
they want that to read to.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.780
And that reads off.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:26.760
And done.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.280
Ada had a very--

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.530
although she's known generally
as the first programmer,

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.950
that's not actually, first of
all, true, or second of all,

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.180
that critical.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.460
Obviously, Babbage wrote
programs for the machine

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.960
when he was designing it.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.850
They're much simpler
than that Bernoulli

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:45.130
one, which he and
Ada collaborated on,

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.800
which is in the paper.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.860
But Babbage also
had assistants that

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.530
might have written some
simple programs for it.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.030
So she wasn't the first.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:32:00.280
And she wasn't there at his
elbow writing programs for him.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.680
In any case, she
herself complained a lot

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.420
about those state tables.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.330
When she wrote the paper, she
was like, this is a huge pain

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:09.040
and it's really
annoying and fiddly.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.100
And this is an [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.860
What Ada's actual main
interest in the machine

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:21.580
was in connecting it with
the ideas of this guy, who

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.840
was her mathematics tutor,
who's Augustus De Morgan.

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.910
If you've heard of De Morgan's
laws, this is that De Morgan.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:34.780
De Morgan basically took Ada
through his University College

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.070
London course, which
he had just started.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.940
Obviously, as a woman,
she couldn't go.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.180
But he took her through
it by correspondence.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:46.014
He was a family friend,
not someone they paid

00:32:46.014 --> 00:32:46.930
or anything like that.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:50.650
They hung out, I
guess you could say.

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:55.000
And at the same time that
Lovelace was hanging out

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.710
with Babbage, she
was also hanging out

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.920
with De Morgan at the time
that De Morgan was developing

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.960
a mathematical system of logic.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.770
This is 10 years before Boole.

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:09.220
You can see what De Morgan's
logic looks like here.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.870
He's trying to find
a way to turn it

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:14.070
into mathematical formulas.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:16.735
And for Lovelace,
she looked at this--

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:25.110
I think for Lovelace, being
in proximity with these two

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:27.300
ideas in ferment--

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.930
Babbage's machine for
manipulating numbers

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:34.300
and De Morgan's concept
of logic as mathematics,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.880
which was very, very, very new.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.710
I mean, De Morgan was
really pretty much

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:41.820
one of the first people who
was doing this sort of thing.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:42.945
This kind of led her--

00:33:42.945 --> 00:33:44.910
I'll pop past that.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.070
This led to probably
her most famous passage

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.500
in the paper, which is
to link the two together

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.490
and say this is not necessarily
an arithmetic machine.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:56.370
This can be a logic machine.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:58.380
She says, "Holds
a position wholly

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.060
its own, enabling mechanism
to combine together

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.200
general symbols--"
she's Victorian,

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.830
so it takes a long time to
get through a sentence--

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.469
"in successions of unlimited
variety and extent,

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:13.260
a uniting link is established
between the operations

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.315
of matter and the
abstract mental processes

00:34:15.315 --> 00:34:18.840
of the most abstract branch
of mathematical science.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.639
A new vast and
powerful language is

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.500
developed for the
future use of analysis."

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:26.820
She comes back to this
idea again and again

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.960
in the paper that,
for example, she says,

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.489
if you took musical composition
and could find a way

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:39.330
to develop it as a
series of instructions,

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.480
the machine could be
taught to compose music--

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.800
scientific music, she says.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.690
It could be time to
compose scientific music

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:49.500
of unlimited variety and extent.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.600
So for me looking at this--

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.602
sorry, this is my Ada
Lovelace programming engine.

00:34:56.602 --> 00:34:58.560
I'm always struck by how
hard it must have been

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.684
to keep the cards together.

00:34:59.684 --> 00:35:04.890
So I've designed for her
a machine to do that.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:10.350
For me, too, it was only
when I built this thing

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:13.530
that I understood what a
spectacular leap this was.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.380
There's nothing in this
machine that would even

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.910
suggest such a thing to me.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.270
To me, and certainly
to Babbage, this

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.950
is a machine for arithmetic--

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:25.080
fast arithmetic in
very large numbers.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.940
And Babbage's
obsession with speed

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.590
is, I guess, a
classic hardware guy,

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:32.160
from what I understand
it, in that most

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.725
of the work that he put into
it was to make it faster.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.000
But Lovelace saw the connection
with logic with this little bit

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.020
here.

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.110
And that's the add rotation,
subtract rotation instruction

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.627
on those cards.

00:35:48.627 --> 00:35:50.460
Babbage developed for
that this little thing

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.800
called the conditional arm.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.310
And that would drop down
when the machine hit,

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:58.180
say, a certain result or
a certain level of result,

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:00.480
that it would then instruct
the machine to stop,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.900
for example, or branch--

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:07.000
to go to a different
set of instructions.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.300
Where's the animation to that?

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.570
There we go.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.760
So while the barrels
are going away,

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:20.840
you can see if there is a
peg and the arm is in place,

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:25.150
then it instructs the machine
to do something different.

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:26.800
And this is a logic.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.940
This is an if/and logic system.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.640
And it's this tiny
piece here, I think,

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.360
that Ada saw the
possibilities of.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.190
If you stripped
away all the gears--

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.430
which 90% of the machine
is just numbers--

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:44.950
if you take that all away
and you just look at this,

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:47.680
and you start thinking
what you can do with that,

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.930
it's pretty
beautiful, even to me,

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.830
who hates computers,
just to remind you.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:56.860
So that's the barrels
and the engine

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.639
and Ada Lovelace
and Charles Babbage

00:36:58.639 --> 00:36:59.680
and logic and everything.

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.170
So I think that's my talk.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:02.670
Thank you.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:05.720
[APPLAUSE]
