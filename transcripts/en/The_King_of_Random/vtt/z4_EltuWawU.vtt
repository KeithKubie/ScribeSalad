00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.200
-Our volcano God is angry there must be a sacrifice

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.500
-yes a sacrifice

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.500
-No please I dont want to die (akward girly voice)

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.420
-Sacrifice.......

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.000
-No...Noo....No. Ahhhhh......(again a akward girly voice)

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.500
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.500
Today we are going to be  trying out another comment request

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.900
The idea for this video comes from Hans wurst

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.900
Who says he wants to see us put some candy gummy bear into

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.680
Some molten salt, so we've got a crucible. We've got some salt

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.079
We've got our furnace in we've have some gummy bears and some gummy worms

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.500
So we're gonna see what happens if we drop these into hot molten liquid salt alright. We've got our salt

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.959
Let's pour it into the crucible to get it melting

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
(Awesome music plays in background)

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.300
We have this baking glass which is designed for fairly high temperatures

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.800
And it would be nice if we could have our molten salt in it so we can really see what's going on through the side of the container

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.700
However this container is designed to withstand being put in the oven, but that's not the same as pouring

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.920
2,000 degree molten salt onto it

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.959
Now as a first test we are going to see if we can pour our salt into this glass container

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.430
And it's been in the oven heating up so it's about 550 degrees right now

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.080
But I still suspect that when I pour this in it's just gonna shatter there goes

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.810
Just a little bit of time

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.690
Yep, that's about what I thought would happen

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(Awesome replay)

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.599
Well now we need to refill our salt supply and get melting again

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.299
Exciting when you light it like that

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.399
All right, we've got our molten hot salt now, let's see what happens if we introduce a gummy bear into it here goes

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.869
Well it burns quickly, I'm just going to drop it in oh

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.360
It caught on fire

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.640
It wasn't even in the salt. It just being that near it caught onfire

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.140
hmm smells

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.410
delightful

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.410
hint of burnt marshmallow maybe

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.449
Beautiful, let's try a worm see what happens

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.379
It's interesting that as it is burning up it also cools down the surface salt right near it and

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.410
Does cause it to solidify a little bit in places? It is burning just smells like burning sugar?

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.299
Gross....

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.079
Oh it had like a an outer crust and a burnt oh and the burned up inside. Just fell back in

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.940
Dee-lightful

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.049
Flaming ball of burning

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.549
Salty sugar down here. It's still hot enough that it's boiling away. That's our blob of like five gummy bears

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.890
It's not giving up without a fight

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.369
And our salt has now turned to this weird slush

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.659
Not Completely liquid

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.779
Not completely solid take our salt crucible put it back in the furnace and let this melt back down

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.290
Three two one

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:19.999
That is a lot of thick smoke yellowy. Gross looking smoke gross

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.139
It's like the worst looking thing I've ever seen that is so...

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.860
gross

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.909
You want to use my tongs it's gonna ruin my tongs. I need like

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.710
Something more disposable than tongs a small stick perfect

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.919
So now the salt has cooled down to the point where it's solidified, but the gummy bears and gummy worms of course are just

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.589
liquefied from the heat this is

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.848
Super disgusting that's just burning and turning black in

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.209
Truly vile and they never get this painful

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.930
Just smells like burned sugar really for the most part

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.769
It's got my worst tongs, they're already ruined

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
(Plays with the disgusting gummy slime)

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.159
Yeah, this is just something that's straight out of a horror film

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.580
That does look pretty

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.520
Fantastically gross, I don't know how well we're gonna be able to clean this pan out. I'm gonna do this

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:40.299
Ackhg...

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:47.489
As this cools down. It is still kind of a gummy texture. It hasn't solidified into something solid, and maybe that's just because it's still warm

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.259
It's not hot just warm and it's still pretty squishy. Just pure

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:53.829
melted

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:55.829
Resolidified salt chunks, though

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:02.968
There you have it that is what happens if you combine gummy bears and gummi worms with molten salt

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.999
It's a ooey-gooey burned disgusting mess

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:11.098
But it is interesting to see how these things react the sugar did light on fire in the salt

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:15.898
That was kind of cool to see we would get sort of a black burnt crust and then there would still be a little bit

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:19.439
Of unburned gummy bear or gummy worm down inside it, but there you have it

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.178
