00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.835
- [Voiceover] What I
hope to do in this video

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.017
is get some practice simplifying some

00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:06.989
fairly hairy exponential expressions.

00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:08.812
So let's get started.

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:10.890
Let's say that I have the expression

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.999
10 times nine to the

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.108
t over two plus two power,

00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:23.370
times five to the three t.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.405
And what I wanna do is simplify
this as much as possible,

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:29.522
and preferably get it in the form of

00:00:29.522 --> 00:00:33.223
A times B to the t.

00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:35.158
And like always, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:00:35.158 --> 00:00:37.591
and see if you can do this on your own

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.947
using exponent properties, your knowledge,

00:00:39.947 --> 00:00:42.687
your deep knowledge of
exponent properties.

00:00:42.687 --> 00:00:44.916
All right, so let's work
through this together,

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:47.609
and it's really just about
breaking the pieces up.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.175
So 10, I'll just leave that as 10 for now,

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:52.508
there doesn't seem to be much to do there.

00:00:52.508 --> 00:00:54.191
But there's all sorts
of interesting things

00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:55.387
going on here.

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:58.928
So nine to the t over two, plus two,

00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:02.364
so this right over here,
I could break this up,

00:01:02.364 --> 00:01:04.651
using the fact that, and I'll just

00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:06.600
write the properties over here.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.932
If I have nine to the a plus b power,

00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:13.207
this is the same thing as nine to the a,

00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:16.214
times nine to the b power.

00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:19.695
And over here I have
nine to the t over two,

00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:22.132
plus two, so I could rewrite this as

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:25.708
nine to the t over two power,

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:29.086
times nine squared.

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.588
All right, now let's move over to

00:01:32.588 --> 00:01:35.490
five to the three t.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.143
Well, if I have a to the bc,

00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:43.492
so you could view this as
five to the three times t,

00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:46.093
this is the same thing as a to the b,

00:01:46.093 --> 00:01:48.995
and then that to the c power.

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:50.957
So I could write this
as, this is going to be

00:01:50.957 --> 00:01:53.534
the same thing as five to the third,

00:01:53.534 --> 00:01:56.413
and then that to the t power.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:58.038
And the whole reason I did that is well

00:01:58.038 --> 00:01:59.048
this is just going to be a number,

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:00.488
then I'm going to have
some number to the t power.

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:02.310
I want to get as many things just raised

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.936
to the t power as possible,

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:06.269
just to see if I can simplify this thing.

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:10.088
So this character right
over here is going to be 81.

00:02:10.088 --> 00:02:11.737
Nine squared is 81.

00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:14.256
Five to the third power, 25 times five,

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:17.054
that's 125.

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:19.550
So we're making good progress and so

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.953
the only thing we really have
to simplify at this point

00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:24.774
is nine to the t over two.

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:26.654
And actually let me do that over here.

00:02:26.654 --> 00:02:30.056
Nine to the t over two.

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:32.691
Well that's the same thing as

00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:35.675
nine to the one half times t.

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:37.567
And by this property right over here,

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:40.190
that's the same thing as nine to the one,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.114
nine to the one half...

00:02:47.442 --> 00:02:49.381
And then that to the t power.

00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:51.528
So what's nine to the one half?

00:02:51.528 --> 00:02:53.130
Well that's three, so this is going to be

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.232
equal to three to the t power.

00:02:55.232 --> 00:02:57.743
So this right over here is three

00:02:57.743 --> 00:03:01.068
to the t power.

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:02.766
So now this is getting interesting.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.814
So I have the 10 out front,

00:03:06.992 --> 00:03:09.952
times three to the t,

00:03:12.495 --> 00:03:14.491
Actually let me write the 81 first.

00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:18.798
10 times 81 times three to the t,

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:20.296
so all I did is I just

00:03:20.296 --> 00:03:22.245
swapped the order that I'm multiplying.

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:25.617
Times 125 to the t.

00:03:25.617 --> 00:03:29.353
Times 125 to the t power.

00:03:29.353 --> 00:03:32.975
Now, the 10 times 81, I
can just multiply that out.

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:35.030
That's going to be 810.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.890
And then what's three to the t

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.270
times 125 to the t?

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.998
Well this is another exponent
property at play here.

00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:45.353
Because if I have a
times b to the t power,

00:03:45.353 --> 00:03:48.673
that's a to the t times be to the t.

00:03:48.673 --> 00:03:49.811
Or another way to think about it,

00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:52.109
if I have a to the t times b to the t,

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.698
that's the same thing as
a times b to the t power.

00:03:54.698 --> 00:03:57.136
And so over here I have three to the t

00:03:57.136 --> 00:04:00.096
times 125 to the t, so it's
going to be the same thing

00:04:00.096 --> 00:04:03.857
as three times 125 to the t power.

00:04:03.857 --> 00:04:07.479
So this part of it right over here,

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.803
I could rewrite it as

00:04:09.803 --> 00:04:13.639
three times 125,

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:16.720
and I'm gonna raise that
whole thing to the t power.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.219
So I'm in the home stretch.

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:20.680
This is going to be 810,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.287
times three times 125 is 375.

00:04:26.218 --> 00:04:29.165
Times 375,

00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:32.850
to the t power.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.060
And that's about as
simplified as we can get,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.357
and we did indeed write it in the form

00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:38.681
that we hope to write it in.

00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:40.585
That a times be to the t.

00:04:40.585 --> 00:04:43.081
Where if we actually match
this form right over here,

00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:45.344
this right over here would be our A,

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:50.137
and then our B would be the 375.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.719
So anyway, I know it looked
a little bit daunting

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.774
when you first saw it, but
if you just keep saying

00:04:54.774 --> 00:04:56.562
okay let's just keep
applying some exponent

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:58.396
properties here, let's see if I can get

00:04:58.396 --> 00:05:00.300
multiple things to the t power,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.854
and keep breaking it down
using these properties,

00:05:02.854 --> 00:05:04.735
you see that in not too many steps

00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:07.252
you get to something
that's a lot less hairy.
