[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.270
SPEAKER 1: We are thrilled
to welcome Noam Chomsky here

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.470
today.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.990
Mr. Chomsky has taught at
the Massachusetts Institute

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.500
of Technology for
the past 50 years,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.690
where he is Institute Professor
Emeritus in the Department

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.910
of Linguistics and Philosophy.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.870
His work is widely credited with
having revolutionized the field

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.090
of modern linguistics.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.480
He's the author of numerous best
selling political works which

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.200
have been translated into
scores of languages worldwide.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.830
And we are thrilled to welcome
him today to Google Cambridge.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.110
Thank you.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.167
Thank you so much for
taking the time to be here.

00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:44.750
I'm just going to
jump right into this

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.180
since we have just limited time.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.760
My name's Husson.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.970
I'm a software engineer here.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.280
And I have nothing to
do with linguistics.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.060
NOAM CHOMSKY: OK.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.309
SPEAKER 1: Or politics.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.100
NOAM CHOMSKY: Good.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.210
SPEAKER 1: Or anything relevant.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.300
NOAM CHOMSKY: Perfect.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.030
We're a perfect team.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.030
SPEAKER 1: But I have so
many questions for you.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.700
I wanted to ask you
about your academic focus

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.380
having been linguistics.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.230
You obviously know a whole
lot about a whole lot

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.920
of other things.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.060
And I wonder what makes
something interesting to you.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.090
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well,
several factors.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.160
First of all, it has to be
an intellectual challenge.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.080
Secondly, it has to be
of some significance,

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.590
and there are many different
dimensions of significance.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.470
So for example, things that
have an impact on human life

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.010
and in fact survival are
of course, significant,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.360
even if they don't pose much
of an intellectual challenge.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.910
On the other hand,
things that pose

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.990
a very serious intellectual
challenge like how

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.260
is it possible that human beings
can do what you and I are now

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.800
doing, which is beyond the
capacity of any other organism,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.660
that poses a very significant
intellectual challenge,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.640
it's human significance
when you really look

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.680
into the details of the debate.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.090
So there's different
dimensions, different factors.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.265
That's essentially the same
as what a four-year-old finds

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:12.765
interesting.

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:15.650
You want to understand
only about the world,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.264
you want to do
something important.

00:02:17.264 --> 00:02:18.680
SPEAKER 1: I think
that many of us

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.740
lose their four-year-old
curiosity over the years.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.560
What has what has kept
you curious in that way?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.010
You've obviously branched out
so much throughout your life

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.780
from your focus on linguistics.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.830
You've branched out
quite a lot from there.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.110
Is it is it simply
this is something

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.460
interesting for
understanding humanity,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.634
or is there
something else in it?

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:42.800
NOAM CHOMSKY: Not that it
matters much, but in fact,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.790
it's the other way around.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.000
I was very much engaged in
political life, social issues,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.530
long before I ever
heard of linguistics.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.350
SPEAKER 1: So tell
us about that.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.100
You took part in a lot
of political activism

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.070
earlier on over the
course of your life.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.020
How did you get
started with that?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.740
What was the drive for that?

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.520
And what drew you to it?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.250
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, I grew
up in the 1930s, which was

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.920
quite an interesting period.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.220
In some ways, a little bit
like today, and in other ways

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.810
quite different.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.430
Objectively, it was
much harsher than today.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.400
So conditions during the
depression here in the United

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.730
States were much worse
than they are today.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.570
Subjectively, it was a much
more optimistic period.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:41.640
Today, it's kind of striking
to see the anger, hopelessness.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.420
I get a dozen
letters every night

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.380
from mostly young people saying
the world's awful, what can

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.010
I do.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.610
It's hopeless.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.220
Then it was pretty different.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.170
Not over the whole country.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.040
If you were an agricultural
worker fleeing the Dust Bowl,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.070
it was pretty awful.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.830
But in the circles that
were my own milieu, which

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.750
was mostly first generation
immigrants, working

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.690
class, at the time
mostly unemployed,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.970
part of the very lively,
activist, militant, working

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.480
class culture of the time,
it was pretty hopeful.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.650
There was a sense somehow
we can get out of all this

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.080
through solidarity,
through working together.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.500
There was an educated community
and people who had never gone--

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.560
couple of years of
elementary school

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.540
discussing the latest varieties
of Freudian psychoanalysis,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.040
the last concert of the Budapest
string quartet and so on.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.790
There was worker education
that took place, a lot of it

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.350
through the unions.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.870
It was just a--

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.350
there was a sense of
hopefulness, expectation,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.700
solidarity, we can do things.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.010
There was a moderately
sympathetic administration,

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.600
very unlike today.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.310
And it was possible to have
some achievements, which

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.010
didn't end the depression,
but softened the edges,

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.300
and made it look as if we
can create a better future.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.340
So objectively much worse,
but subjectively, much better.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.960
And then of course,
in the background

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.000
was what was happening in
Europe, the spread of fascism,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.970
which was very frightening.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.926
I'm old enough to remember
listening on the radio

00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:43.150
to the Nuremberg rallies,
Hitler's speeches.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.880
I didn't understand
the words, but there

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.110
was no mistaking what it meant.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.385
And of course.

00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:52.150
after the first--
it's kind of ironic,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.930
I guess, but my
wife and I happened

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:03.000
to be in Barcelona at the time
of the November 8 election.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.920
And the attitude in Europe
was the roof is falling in,

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.160
it was this is the
end of the world.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.150
And it happens that the
first article that I wrote,

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.890
that I remember at least, was
about the fall of Barcelona.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.170
So I can easily date
it February 1939.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.130
I hope the article
has disappeared.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.860
I'm sure it's not
very memorable.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:33.660
I was the editor or the
fourth grade newspaper.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.880
And probably the only reader,
except maybe my mother.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.730
But the article, I
remember, was essentially

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.070
about the rise of fascism,
Austria, Czechoslovakia,

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.540
Toledo, Barcelona.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.160
It looked inexorable.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.990
This monstrous shadow
spreading all over the world.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.250
And this is long
before the Holocaust.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.650
So that's the background.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:02.670
On the other hand,
there was what was

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.700
happening more within reach.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.570
By the time I was
about 12 years old,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.720
we lived in Philadelphia,
100 miles from New York.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.850
When I was 11 or 12, my parents
would let me go to New York

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.350
by myself on the train,
stay with relatives,

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.874
hang around anarchist
bookstores and Union Square.

00:07:26.874 --> 00:07:29.040
SPEAKER 1: I wonder how
many parents in the audience

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.331
are thinking about sending
their 12-year-old on a train

00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:32.430
from Philly to New York.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.530
NOAM CHOMSKY: It was a
much more peaceful time.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:35.920
It's pretty dramatic.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.970
I mean, in those days,
you could, in New York,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.130
you can walk along the river,
Riverside Drive or Central

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.650
Park, at night
without any concern.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.310
A lot of things changed
after the Second World War.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:54.560
I don't know exactly why.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.340
But the cities became much
more dangerous, hostile places.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.030
There was plenty of conflict.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.700
If you were Irish, you didn't go
into the Italian neighborhoods

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.010
and that sort of thing.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.390
But you weren't
going to get killed.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.240
You might get chased.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.180
I spent a lot of my
childhood running away

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.330
from Irish Catholic kids
because they were too scary.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.530
But you weren't going to get
shot, or knifed, or anything

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.580
like that.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.392
That all changed for some reason
after the second World War.

00:08:27.392 --> 00:08:28.350
I don't understand why.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.100
All over the world,
incidentally.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.450
Here, strikingly.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.220
SPEAKER 1: So you talk
about this general sentiment

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.110
of people being,
the public being

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.924
very hopeful, and around--

00:08:39.924 --> 00:08:41.340
NOAM CHOMSKY: Parts
of the public.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.839
SPEAKER 1: At least parts of it.

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:44.630
NOAM CHOMSKY: Not the
people John Steinbeck

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.330
was writing about.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.288
SPEAKER 1: And you talk
about an administration

00:08:47.288 --> 00:08:50.070
at that time that was maybe
more sympathetic than the one

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.220
that we have now.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.740
Leaving aside the administration
part of that for the moment,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.060
do you feel that that
hope has evaporated?

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.700
Do you feel that we have
been able to reharness

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.680
that in times of need?

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.677
You talk about it as though this
is very much in the past tense.

00:09:07.677 --> 00:09:08.510
Is that intentional?

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:10.260
NOAM CHOMSKY: I think
it's still there.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:18.300
In fact, take a look at the last
election, November election.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.630
There were two
striking aspects of it.

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.160
One of them, not very startling.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.540
Namely, in the
Republican primary,

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.580
a person who was hated
by the establishment,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.550
but who happens to be a
billionaire won the nomination.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.410
OK, kind of a surprise,
but not startling

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.122
that a billionaire con man
should win the nomination.

00:09:45.122 --> 00:09:47.580
What happened on the Democratic
side is much more dramatic.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.280
Somebody arose who was unknown.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.230
Nobody ever heard him.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:10:01.200
He had no support from any
of the sources of wealth

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:08.410
and power, no corporate support,
no funding from the wealthy.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.820
He even used the scare
word, socialist, which

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.640
means mildly social democratic.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.700
In fact, his policies wouldn't
surprise Eisenhower very much.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.677
That's a sign of the
sharp shift to the right

00:10:20.677 --> 00:10:22.260
in the whole spectrum.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.080
But from the point of view
of the existing spectrum,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.300
he seemed way on the outside.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.910
He would have won the
Democratic Party nomination

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.580
if it hadn't been
for the machinations

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.940
of the Obama-Clinton
party managers.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.400
That's a break
from over 100 years

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.600
of American political history.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.860
I mean American elections
are pretty much bought.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.840
You can literally pretty
well predict electability

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.370
just on the basis of simple
variables like campaign

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.390
spending.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.920
It's remarkable.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.060
Not just president.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.340
There's a recent
interesting study

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.150
by Tom Ferguson, who's
done the main work on this,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.000
over at the U-Mass political
science department.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.360
He and some colleagues
came out last year

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.320
with a study of
congressional elections

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.980
from about 1980 up
till the present.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.240
Simply asking what's the
relation between campaign

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.650
funding and electability,
which of course, means policy.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:27.450
It's practically
a straight line.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.990
You just don't get results like
that in the social sciences.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.490
It's startling.

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:35.520
And the same is true of
the presidential elections.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.025
And it's been known
for a long time.

00:11:38.025 --> 00:11:40.850
You go back to the 1890s.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.880
There was a very famous
campaign manager, Mark Hannah,

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.940
who was the star of
campaign management.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.400
He was asked once what does
it take to win an election.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.560
And he said it takes two things.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.060
The first one is money.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.780
I've forgotten what
the second one is.

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.800
That was 1895, way
before Citizens United

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.810
or any of this stuff.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.980
Here comes Sanders
and he just broke

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.657
the pattern of over 100 years.

00:12:12.657 --> 00:12:13.365
It's astonishing.

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:17.640
And what's more,
thanks to Fox News,

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.210
we know that he's the most
popular political figure

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.660
in the country, a poll that
they ran, by a huge margin.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.840
And among young
people, enormous.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.230
Well, what does that mean?

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.500
It means there's
real signs of hope.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:39.105
It's out of the these two
non-establishment figures that

00:12:39.105 --> 00:12:41.040
won the public--

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.410
of course, the
establishment assures itself

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.120
that it controls the political
system and the decisions.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:56.640
So Trump could rail against
Wall Street and Goldman Sachs

00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.780
on the campaign trail, but
take a look at his cabinet.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.410
So they make sure they
basically run the show,

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.700
but they're losing
the population.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.830
And the same is
happening in Europe.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.240
The French election
was a good example.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.080
Two candidates from outside
the two political parties,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.070
although the thrust
of policy will

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.310
remain not all that different.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.980
But that's a sign of
potential changes.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.800
If we can ever go back
to having functioning--

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.460
go back to partially
create functioning

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.881
democratic societies, that
could be quite different.

00:13:32.881 --> 00:13:34.380
SPEAKER 1: So
stepping back a moment

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.900
to the political
activism in your life.

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.580
What do you remember
out of your career,

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.460
let's say, in
political activism,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.370
as being some of the
these are the moments that

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.650
were defining for me.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.900
NOAM CHOMSKY: What
was defining for me

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.150
was things like--
for those of you

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:57.960
who know New York City, in
those days Union Square used

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.782
to be a kind of a center of
radical offices, Freie Arbeiter

00:14:03.782 --> 00:14:09.510
Stimme, for example, the
Yiddish anarchist movement had

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.270
its offices there, and others.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.460
And if you went down Fourth
Avenue, which is now all

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:21.550
gentrified, there were small
bookstores with a lot of them

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.580
run by European emigres.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:27.000
And a number of the ones that
I kind of gravitated towards

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.060
were refugees from
Spain, people who

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:35.546
fled from after the crushing
of the anarchist revolution

00:14:35.546 --> 00:14:37.340
in 1937.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.550
And I picked up all kind of
pamphlets and understanding.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.880
I learned a lot of things,
which are just barely getting

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.590
into the news now.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.720
For example, you
can read books now

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.880
which point out, somewhat
misleadingly, that

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:57.060
in the 1930s, theoretically
the United States,

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.530
the Roosevelt
administration, was following

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.600
a policy of neutrality, they
don't support either side,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.090
the fascists or the republic.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.210
In fact, they were
supporting the fascists.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:14.295
I learned it in 1939
from reading pamphlets

00:15:14.295 --> 00:15:17.130
and left wing
literature, and others,

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:23.580
which exposed the fact that
the Texaco Oil Company, which

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.580
was run by an outright
Nazi, didn't even hide it,

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:33.360
had contracts with the
Republic to supply oil.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.600
In the middle of the
conflict, he shifted.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.736
He started supplying oil to
the fascist forces, Franco.

00:15:41.736 --> 00:15:42.860
There were questions asked.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.750
The State Department denied it.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.650
It turned out to be true.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.040
It was reported in
the left wing press.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.660
And oil was the one thing that
the Germans and the Italians,

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.227
the fascist countries, couldn't
supply to Franco's forces.

00:15:57.227 --> 00:15:58.060
They didn't have it.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.640
So they needed it.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.160
And Roosevelt and
the State Department

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.530
pretended they didn't see it.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.390
Only the small left
wing press saw it.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.360
It was later kind of conceded.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.830
It's now kind of pretty much,
in scholarship at least,

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.370
it's sort of acknowledged
a few years later.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.310
But I knew that in
1939, just from hanging

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.380
around the left wing offices.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.220
And you could see
what was going on.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.200
The administration, Roosevelt,
was very bitter and angry when

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.120
they found a an
American businessman who

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.760
had sold a couple of
pistols to the Republic,

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.760
you know violating
the neutrality act,

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.460
big condemnation.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:48.020
And meanwhile, the
major oil company

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.720
was breaking its contracts
with the Republic

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.080
and shifting them
to the fascists.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.370
That's an educational
experience.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:02.490
I also learned things
about the war in Spain.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:06.140
It wasn't just the Republicans
versus the fascists.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.250
There was a popular revolution
in 1936, a libertarian

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.319
revolution, which was
pretty successful.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:14.660
And it was crushed.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.900
It was crushed by
the joint efforts

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.130
of the fascists, the communists,
and the liberal democracies.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:23.670
They had a lot of differences.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:25.760
But there was one
thing they agreed on.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.369
You can't have a free society.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.300
You can't have a
libertarian society.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.300
So they cooperated on that.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.270
Actually the attack was
led by the communists, who

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.760
were the party of
the police force,

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:41.540
and the petty bourgeoisie,
and very opposed

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:47.700
to any form of socialist
or left activism.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:51.320
And those are things you
learn if you pay attention.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:57.645
And it was reinforced by other
parts of my family environment.

00:17:57.645 --> 00:18:02.690
At the time in New York, it was
a very lively political scene.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:08.600
Every variety of left wing
politics you can imagine

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.341
was debated hotly.

00:18:12.341 --> 00:18:17.270
In fact, a friend of mine,
who's a philosopher at Columbia,

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.990
told me recently
that he and his wife

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.950
got a place up in the Catskills
to hang out in the summer.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.890
Turns out these retirement
communities there,

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.830
he said the people in the
retirement communities

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:35.700
are still debating which
brand of Trotskyism was right.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.800
The same arguments they
were having in the 1930s.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.730
It's worth remembering that
working class education was

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.820
a very serious phenomenon then.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:47.960
It goes way back.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.755
I mean, you go back to the
late 19th century here,

00:18:51.755 --> 00:19:00.050
the early Industrial Revolution,
if an Irish blacksmith could

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:03.710
get enough money, he
hired a boy to read

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.600
to him while he's working.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.240
And reading meant what
we now call classics,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.110
modern contemporary literature.

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:15.170
There were young
women from the farms,

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.410
called factory girls,
who were compelled

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.380
to get into the textile
factories in eastern New

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:21.890
England.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.220
And they had their
own publications.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:25.850
You read them.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:30.770
They bitterly condemned the
fact that the industrial system

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.110
was depriving them
of their culture,

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.040
of their dignity,
their independence.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.530
You are selling yourself,
not what you produce.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.980
It's quite different.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.130
And part of it was an
attack on the culture.

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.330
Same in England.

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.670
There's a massive study,
an interesting study

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.260
by a guy named Jonathan
Rose of the reading habits

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.040
of the English working class.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.270
And it turns out
his own conclusion

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.400
is that we're better educated
than the aristocrats.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.040
And they may not
have gone to school.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.070
They certainly
didn't go to Oxford,

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:09.140
but the working class,
the rising working class,

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.310
had its own institutions of
education and culture, which

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.410
was significant.

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:21.170
A lot of that has been
destroyed in all kinds of ways.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.780
Google doesn't help.

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.190
But that's another story.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.250
SPEAKER 1: Happy to do our part.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.170
So I asked you about
political activism,

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.930
and you talk about
learning a lot.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.480
What part of that is--

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:41.045
what part of activism did you
take part in that was defining?

00:20:41.045 --> 00:20:44.120
NOAM CHOMSKY: I was 12 years
old, not a lot of activism.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.740
But actually, the
kind of activism

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.780
I was involved in
mostly in those years

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:53.086
was within what was--

00:20:53.086 --> 00:20:55.250
it's now called anti-Zionist.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.690
At that time, it was Zionist.

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.160
My parents and my
immediate milieu

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.830
were deeply embedded
in the whole revival

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.530
of Hebrew revival
of Jewish culture,

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.990
connections to
Palestine, and so on.

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:10.910
I kind of grew up with that.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.850
And my own actual,
most of the activism

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.250
was internal to that system.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.250
It was what is now
called anti-Zionist.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.730
It was strongly opposed to
a Jewish state in support

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:27.740
of Arab-Jewish working class
cooperation in Palestine

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.530
with all kinds of
ideas about how

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:34.995
to create a society based on
the cooperatives and so on.

00:21:34.995 --> 00:21:38.120
That kind of died in 1948.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.025
But at the time, it was alive,
something you could be part of.

00:21:43.025 --> 00:21:44.900
And it extended to other things.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.650
Like there wasn't much
in the way of activism,

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:55.610
but when the British
conquered Greece in 1944

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.220
and carried out
brutal repression

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.940
of the anti-fascist
forces in Greece,

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.570
there were a couple of
us who tried to protest,

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.870
whatever it meant when
you're 15 years old.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.615
SPEAKER 1: You got very
physically involved.

00:22:11.615 --> 00:22:13.490
NOAM CHOMSKY: There
wasn't much you could do.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.630
It was right in the
middle of the war.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.950
And there was a
lot of patriotism,

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.870
dedication to the war effort.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.630
Bringing up these things--

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:27.290
by the time the war started,
the political ferment

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:32.550
declined because of
commitment to the war effort.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.187
It was just-- it
overwhelmed everything else.

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.020
It was still around.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.840
Like I was in high
school in the early '40s,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.330
and it happened that
the high school I was in

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.080
was right next to a
prisoner of war camp

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.410
where mostly German
prisoners, and in those days,

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:50.970
security meant a wire fence.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.920
So no big deal.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.240
And a lot of the
students were kind

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.750
of ridiculing, and mocking, and
screaming at the German POWs.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:06.050
And a couple of us were strongly
opposed to that, and tried to--

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.920
tried to get them to
understand that they--

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.720
that there could be sort of--

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.690
like I said, it's not
violent the way it is today.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.940
It's the kind of thing that
young boys do, you know.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.560
It was boys of course,
it was segregated.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.710
And we tried, a couple of,
maybe two or three of us,

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.830
to try to change the
mood of the students

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.640
to understand that these guys
on the other side of the fence

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.640
are not criminals.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.015
SPEAKER 1: So
that's fascinating.

00:23:34.015 --> 00:23:36.680
What do you mean by we
tried to change the mood?

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.440
Was that discourse?

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.646
NOAM CHOMSKY: To talk
to people, education.

00:23:41.646 --> 00:23:43.520
SPEAKER 1: And these
are high school students

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:48.200
having intellectual discourse
about a prisoner of war camp

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.700
right next door to
the high school.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.180
NOAM CHOMSKY: It's probably
easier for high school students

00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:53.221
than the Harvard faculty.

00:23:56.567 --> 00:23:57.650
SPEAKER 1: I imagine that.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.080
You'll forgive me for being
a product of my own time,

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.660
where I just can't even
imagine a high school

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.430
next to a prison of war camp.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.070
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, and
separated by a wire fence.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:09.380
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.860
You became a little bit more
perhaps politically active

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.270
later on in your life then.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.490
NOAM CHOMSKY:
Publicly articulate,

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:21.620
but the political
activism never changed.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.210
It declined in the 50's.

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:27.530
The 50's were a pretty
quiescent period.

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.410
Political activism
was pretty individual.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:32.630
There was not a lot going on.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.240
It was-- there were
things in the background,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.050
but it was a pretty
quiet, conformist period.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.614
SPEAKER 1: But then, the '60's.

00:24:40.614 --> 00:24:42.530
NOAM CHOMSKY: Early
'60's, everything changed.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.780
SPEAKER 1: Everything changed.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.580
And you became then very active.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.160
NOAM CHOMSKY: Publicly active.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.710
It wasn't that much
of a change for me,

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.612
personally, just a
different sphere.

00:24:54.612 --> 00:24:55.320
SPEAKER 1: I see.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.240
So what drove you to become
more publicly active?

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.820
NOAM CHOMSKY: John F. Kennedy.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:11.300
Though it's still kind of like
off the agenda in 1961 and '62,

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.800
that Kennedy very sharply
escalated the Vietnam War.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.210
It was already pretty awful.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:22.750
The maybe 60 or 70,000
South Vietnamese

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.390
had already been
killed by the regime

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:31.130
that the US had imposed in
the 1950's, but it was kind of

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.230
under the radar, like
you were seeing--

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.320
you can find out about it,
but you weren't seen much.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.890
By '61 and '62, the repression
of the South Vietnamese regime

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:46.400
we'd installed in violation
of the Geneva Accords

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:54.760
had become so harsh that a
popular rebellion sprang up.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.005
The north actually opposed it.

00:25:58.005 --> 00:25:59.550
They wanted to
build the country,

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.990
not get involved in a
conflict with the US.

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:05.420
But the National
Liberation Front,

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:13.300
what propaganda calls the Viet
Cong, were beginning to cause--

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:18.080
beginning to develop and become
active in the late '50's.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:21.200
And that the regime
couldn't contain them.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.050
So there was a crisis.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.500
Kennedy decided to
escalate the war.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.810
The US Air Force began to
bomb South Vietnamese targets

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.870
under South Vietnamese markings.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.210
Like the planes had South
Vietnamese markings,

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:40.140
but nobody's fooled.

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:45.030
I learned about it
myself in a small item,

00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:48.350
maybe 10 lines in a back
page of the New York Times,

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.040
which just happened
to mention casually

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:56.300
that the US Air Force is bombing
South Vietnamese targets.

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.200
They authorized Napalm, they
started chemical warfare,

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.670
serious chemical warfare to try
to destroy crops and livestock,

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.170
to starve out the population.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:12.470
They began programs
to drive people

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.370
into what amounted to
concentration camps.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.120
They were called
strategic hamlets

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.890
where peasants were driven
off the land, driven

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.310
into these places,
into urban slums.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:28.070
And the official rhetoric
was to protect them

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.660
from the guerrillas, which in
fact, the government knew very

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.410
well that they were supporting.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:39.110
It wasn't widely reported,
but if you looked carefully.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:43.710
And from my own experience back
in the late '30's, early '40's,

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:46.220
I knew that you really
had to look carefully,

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.770
you know, take a look
at the headlines.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:53.010
Put together what's lying behind
them, like the Texaco story.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.590
And it was pretty clear that
there was a sharp escalation

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.280
of the war going on.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.970
So I did try to become active.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:08.270
Being active at that time
meant giving a talk to couple

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:13.460
of people in somebody's living
room, or maybe in a church

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.870
where there were
four people, you

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:21.140
know the minister, who
was mildly sympathetic,

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.160
some drunk who walked in from
the street, another guy who

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.934
wanted to kill you, and
maybe one person who was--

00:28:27.934 --> 00:28:30.225
SPEAKER 1: Sounds like a
great way to start a movement.

00:28:30.225 --> 00:28:32.058
NOAM CHOMSKY: Yeah,
that's what it was like.

00:28:32.058 --> 00:28:34.610
But later it changed,
but it took years.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:35.720
I mean, it wasn't until--

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.380
right here in
Boston, those of you

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.950
are old enough may
remember, but in Boston,

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:48.950
which is a pretty liberal city,
the first public demonstration

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:53.872
against the war was
in October 1965.

00:28:53.872 --> 00:28:58.720
Internationally, an
international day of protest

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.860
was called.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:03.050
So we decided we'll
take part in it,

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:07.240
and there was a march from
Harvard Square to the Boston

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.620
Common.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.920
Supposed to be a
demonstration there.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.340
I was supposed to be
one of the speakers.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:18.400
It was violently broken up
by counter-demonstrators,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.250
a lot of them students.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.080
There were a lot
of state police,

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.090
which is the only reason
we didn't get killed.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.381
Nobody could hear the speakers.

00:29:26.381 --> 00:29:27.730
It was impossible.

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.680
Take a look the Boston
Globe the next day.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.880
It praised the
counter-demonstrators,

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.160
denounced the
demonstrators for daring

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:44.650
to question our great country,
and what it's doing, and so on.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:49.960
March 1966 was the next
international day of protest,

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.930
and we realized we couldn't
have a public demonstration.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:56.140
So we had a meeting at the
Arlington Street Church.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.230
The church was attacked.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:03.480
Again, tomatoes,
cans, and so on.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.310
At that time, there were
already a couple 100,000

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.370
American troops rampaging
in South Vietnam.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:11.590
It took a long time,
and the country

00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.940
was practically destroyed.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:19.860
But at that time, Bernard
Fall, who was actually a hawk,

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:26.770
but was a highly respected
and serious military historian

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.220
and Vietnam specialist,
and by the US government,

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.040
he was the one
non-government specialist

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:36.010
who was respected, rightly.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.530
He was a hawk, but he cared
about the Vietnamese people.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:45.040
And he was writing at the time,
'66, '67, that he wasn't sure

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.800
that Vietnam could survive as
a cultural and historic entity

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:55.390
under the most savage attack
that any region that size

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.040
had ever suffered.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.380
At that point, you're
just barely beginning

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.110
to get some visible protest.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.800
It's changed a lot.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.773
The country's become much
more civilized since then.

00:31:06.773 --> 00:31:10.870
By now, the opposition to
aggression and violence

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:12.790
is far more widespread.

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:15.940
Governments just can't do--

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.580
like say the
invasion of Iraq, is

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:22.510
the first time in the entire
history of imperialism

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:28.990
that there was massive protest
before the invasion actually

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.930
took place.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:35.770
And it was pretty horrible what
happened and not to go into it,

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.080
but the Bush
administration could never

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.200
contemplate what the
Kennedy administration just

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.830
did without any second thought.

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.530
The public has just
changed too much.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:49.450
SPEAKER 1: So over
your extensive career

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:52.600
in being an activist in
many different veins,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.570
obviously you learned
a lot along the way.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.880
And it's useful to share
information with the world

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:58.910
as you do--

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.790
NOAM CHOMSKY: I'll
give you one example,

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:02.060
which is kind of interesting.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:05.380
Maybe 30 years from now
it will enter awareness.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:11.530
But take the Texaco Oil Company
and the Spanish Civil War.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:18.370
That was repeated under
the Clinton administration.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.800
Virtually the same thing.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:26.350
Under the Clinton,
there was in Haiti,

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:28.520
for the first time
in its history,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.830
there was a free
election in 1990.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:42.230
And it was won by a
priest, Aristide, who

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.930
nobody paid any attention to.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.840
He was supported
by the people who

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.860
were considered not
worth looking at,

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:54.010
the urban slums, rural areas,
a lot of grassroots activism.

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.950
And to everyone's surprise,
he won the election.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.485
They expected the US candidate
would win, Marc Bazin,

00:33:00.485 --> 00:33:02.800
the World Bank guy.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:08.510
But Aristide won the
election and he instituted--

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.650
the main question was when will
the military coup take place.

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:15.140
It turned about
seven months later.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.810
It's quite interesting
what happened.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:19.210
But the military
coup took place.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:23.980
A vicious brutal terror began.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:29.715
The US actually tacitly
supported it in many ways.

00:33:29.715 --> 00:33:34.990
In 1994, the Clinton
administration

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.820
decided, OK, enough
terror had taken place

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.480
so that the population subdued.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.710
We can now allow the
president to return.

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:48.610
The eve-- there was a
marine landing in 1994.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.020
Everyone paying attention to it.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.760
It was quite public.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.780
At the time, I happened to be--

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.830
there was a guy at
MIT who was working

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:02.900
on a project of experimenting
to allow people to have access

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.990
to the AP wires, which
is pretty interesting.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.330
Because what you get
when you look at the AP

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:13.250
wires is just raw news,
stuff pouring out constantly.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:16.850
The AP wires feature
a story every day,

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:21.230
keeps repeating, to editors,
here's the big story.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:26.699
The day before the
marine invasion of Haiti,

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:30.949
the big story was the
Treasury Department

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:36.590
concedes the Texaco Oil
Company has been providing oil

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:40.520
to the military junta while
the CIA and the Clinton

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.120
administration were denying
that any oil was going to them.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.520
Well, I was going to
write an article about it.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.110
But the article
that I would write

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.292
would come out two months
later, so I figure it's not

00:34:51.292 --> 00:34:52.540
even worth mentioning this.

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.330
It'll be public news.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.266
It's still not been reported.

00:34:58.266 --> 00:35:00.140
Those are the things
that happen in the world

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.530
if you pay attention.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:02.988
SPEAKER 1: So you've
obviously been

00:35:02.988 --> 00:35:06.920
very successful on reporting
on these types of things

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.880
and raising awareness.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.330
And that has been one
avenue for your activism.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:15.290
I wonder, is this
intrinsic to who you are?

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:17.030
Or how you approach knowledge?

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:20.430
Why aren't there more Noam
Chomsky's in the world?

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.780
NOAM CHOMSKY: I think
there are plenty of them.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:27.020
For example, why is Bernie
Sanders the most popular figure

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.810
in the United States, political
figure in the United States

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:30.935
by a huge margin?

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:39.110
Where are those people who pick
him as the most popular person?

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:42.504
I mean, they may not be well
known, but they're there.

00:35:42.504 --> 00:35:44.420
SPEAKER 1: I should think
that as a percentage

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.360
of the rest of the
people out there

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.150
who are active in the
same way, very few of them

00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.076
are as educated as you
have made yourself.

00:35:53.076 --> 00:35:54.665
NOAM CHOMSKY:
You'd be surprised.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.260
I mean, people may not know
things about the whole world,

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.470
but they know things about
their lives and the situation

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:04.651
that they're in.

00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:05.525
Take a look at polls.

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.830
An issue that's right in the
main headlines, health care.

00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.350
What do people think
about health care?

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:22.580
Well, it turns out
that over a long period

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:25.570
most of the population has
supported a national health

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:30.260
care system, the kind
that other countries have.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:32.690
Which is pretty remarkable,
because nobody publicly

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:34.110
advocates it.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:39.280
When Obama put through
the Affordable Care Act,

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:43.340
at the time,
initially, there was

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:45.740
what was called a
public option, which

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:50.060
means you could choose
to have essentially

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:53.450
Medicare, national health care.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.070
Almost two thirds
of the population

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.900
favored it, even
though there was

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.420
no public articulated
support for it.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.950
It was dropped, of
course, without comment.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.855
You go back a little farther,
say to the Reagan years,

00:37:05.855 --> 00:37:11.000
it turned out that about
70% of the population

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.750
thought that guaranteed
health care should

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:19.570
be in the Constitution,
because it's an obvious right.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:24.290
And about 40% thought it
already was in the Constitution.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:27.300
The Constitution is just
some holy writ, which

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.090
has everything good in it.

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:32.000
So it must have had
guaranteed health care,

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.740
because it's so obvious.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.390
That's the public.

00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:38.300
Of course, it's not the elites.

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.680
It's not the media.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.100
It's not the elite discourse.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.300
In fact, whenever the
possibility is mentioned,

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:51.410
it's called politically
impossible or lacking

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.170
political support,
which is accurate

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:57.350
if by political support
you mean the pharmaceutical

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:00.050
corporations, and the
insurance companies, and so on.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.780
Yeah, they don't support it.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.840
And the way our democracy
works, that's political support.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.920
But the public is there.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.745
And is it educated?

00:38:09.745 --> 00:38:12.610
I mean, where do people
get these ideas from?

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.060
Take say the Vietnam War.

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:18.620
That's a very, very
interesting, revealing situation

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.870
at the end of the Vietnam War.

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.960
When the Vietnam
War ended in 1975,

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:28.550
every famous person had to
make a statement about it.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.940
There's a ton of material
about looking back

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.310
at the Vietnam War, what
did it mean, and so on.

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:36.530
And there was a spectrum.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:37.544
I've written about it.

00:38:37.544 --> 00:38:38.210
Went through it.

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:39.660
There's a spectrum.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:45.710
At one end it said it was a
noble cause, if we'd fought

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.380
harder, we could have won.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.540
We have to honor the effort.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.760
Obama agrees with this.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.170
That's the hawkish end.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:39:00.450
Then you go over to what's
called the left, you know,

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.250
the critical end.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.040
And people, like
say, Anthony Lewis,

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.610
who was one of the most
harshest critics of the war,

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:10.980
way out on the left,
he wrote an article

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:13.740
in which he said the
war, and I'm quoting,

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:18.840
"The war began with blundering
efforts to do good."

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.190
Notice that that's an axiom.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.910
You don't have to give
evidence for that.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:27.240
If we did it, it was
efforts to do good

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.770
by definition, on the left,
what's called the left.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.950
Blundering, because
it didn't work.

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:37.320
So it began with blundering
efforts to do good.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:43.210
But by 1969, it had become
clear that it was a disaster.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.500
We couldn't bring
democracy to Vietnam

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.600
at a cost acceptable
to ourselves.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.364
That's the critical end, OK?

00:39:53.364 --> 00:39:54.780
You don't have to
give an argument

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.550
to say we're trying
to bring democracy.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:57.880
That's also an axiom.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.930
That's kind of a principle
you don't question,

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:03.234
it's 2 plus 2 equals 4.

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.650
Well, at the very
same time, there

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:07.515
were polls taken
among the public.

00:40:07.515 --> 00:40:09.740
And what did they find?

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.930
They found that around
70% of the public

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:15.630
said the war was
not a mistake, it

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:19.070
was fundamentally
and morally wrong.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.540
And that went on as
long as the polls were

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.670
taken until the early '80s.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:29.250
Now the people, who
were running the polls,

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:34.300
liberal, academic,
political scientists,

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.070
he did comment on these results.

00:40:37.070 --> 00:40:41.040
And he said, well, what it means
is that people were opposed

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.186
to American soldiers dying.

00:40:43.186 --> 00:40:46.650
OK, maybe that's what it meant.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.080
Maybe it meant they thought
it was fundamentally

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.360
wrong and immoral as they said.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:54.340
But that concept is just
kind of inconceivable.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:58.190
But that's the public.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:00.870
Were they educated?

00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:03.610
I'd say that we're more
educated than the elites who

00:41:03.610 --> 00:41:05.606
were writing, the
educated elites who

00:41:05.606 --> 00:41:08.200
were writing the articles.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:11.070
SPEAKER 1: So switching
gears for a moment, it's

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:16.020
easy to find a lot of material
on you speaking either online,

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:19.770
or articles that you've
written about egregious wrongs

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:22.080
in the world, and the
historical background

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.410
for these types of things.

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.570
You have a lot of
context for that.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:32.460
I wonder how do you stay
sane knowing how much room

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.510
for improvement there is?

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.300
Where's the levity in your life?

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.010
And can you tell us a joke?

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:44.060
NOAM CHOMSKY: I can tell
you a joke, Mark Hannah.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:53.370
SPEAKER 1: I've looked for quite
some time for a video of you

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.780
telling a joke.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:57.954
It just doesn't seem to exist.

00:41:57.954 --> 00:42:00.120
NOAM CHOMSKY: That's the
people who make the videos,

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.680
it's their problem.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.860
SPEAKER 1: I was also curious
about you're obviously

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.560
very effective at
assimilating information.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:13.170
And digesting that in
a comprehensive way.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:17.490
I wonder about the tools,
technology, and routines

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:19.950
that help make your
day productive.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:23.030
How do you work?

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.740
NOAM CHOMSKY: It's
pretty straightforward.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:32.070
How did 19th century
working class people

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.710
gain an education that
was superior to that

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.780
of the aristocrats in England?

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.330
Did they use the internet?

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:42.115
They read.

00:42:42.115 --> 00:42:44.370
You look at what's
going on around you,

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.890
you talk to the people,
you have interactions,

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:49.590
you read, you
learn about things.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.420
It's not quantum physics.

00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:53.640
It was understood
that all this is

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.110
pretty much on the
surface in these domains.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:57.570
It's just a matter of--

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.050
it's a little easier now.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:01.860
It used to be the
case that if you want

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:07.310
to look into the background.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:09.690
And you wanted to see
what was the press saying

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:13.460
about some topic in the 1970s.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.480
You had to go to the library,
look up the microfilm.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.030
A bit of a nuisance.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.410
Now you can get it
on the internet.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:27.300
Thanks to what we call
the free market, which

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:33.110
means the taxpayer putting
huge amounts of subsidies

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:38.080
into developing the high tech
system of the next generation,

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.920
which is handed over to private
corporations for marketing

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.130
and profit.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:44.460
So that's the internet,
and computers,

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:46.180
and so on and so forth.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.260
So now, it's a lot easier
than going to the library

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.900
and looking up the microfilms.

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:54.140
But not that different.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.440
I mean, the change from
no libraries to libraries

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:03.190
was a much bigger change than
from libraries to the internet.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:10.800
In fact, similarly, the change
from sailing ships to telegraph

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.360
was a much bigger change than
speeding up the communication

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:21.030
by a couple of milliseconds
with some new technique.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:25.390
So it's a little easier now,
but not fundamentally different.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:29.185
SPEAKER 1: So the next question
came in from Rakesh [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:29.185 --> 00:44:30.810
I apologize about
pronunciation there--

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.010
from India.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.380
In an interview on
2012, you mentioned

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:38.160
that artificial intelligence
is going in the wrong direction

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.130
by putting more emphasis
on statistical techniques

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:42.820
to mine data.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.610
Where do you think
it's heading now?

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:46.620
And what steps should
we take to make

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.540
it more meaningful to society?

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:51.570
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, I
don't know exactly what

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:52.750
that quote is from.

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:57.180
But artificial
intelligence, what's

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:01.230
called artificial
intelligence, which is just

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:05.070
part of cognitive science, it
can, like any part of science,

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:08.000
can go in to
different directions.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.310
It can direct itself towards
some engineering application,

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.800
which may or may not be useful.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.050
Or it can go into trying
to understand something

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:20.560
about the world.

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:22.650
Those are the choices.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:26.570
So take, say, the work that
happens to interest me most,

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.500
[INAUDIBLE] language.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.270
One thrust is
trying to understand

00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.490
how it is that we
can, for example, do

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.260
what we're now doing.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:38.730
What lies behind that?

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.770
What are the mental operations?

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.120
Or what are the principles?

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.940
How's it acquired, and so on?

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.560
OK, that's one domain.

00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:50.910
Another domain is how
can we get something

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:56.580
that's useful to give a
kind of a rough translation

00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:03.300
of an article in French into
English, the Google Translator.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.050
That's OK, I mean,
I use it, fine.

00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:11.910
But it's a brute force
engineering achievement.

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:15.880
It doesn't tell you anything
about how the world is working.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.532
It just says here's something
useful, like a bulldozer.

00:46:18.532 --> 00:46:20.240
I don't have anything
against bulldozers.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.630
I think they're great.

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:24.590
A lot easier than
digging with a shovel.

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:29.010
But it's not
intellectually, it's

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.290
not an intellectually
interesting achievement.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.395
It's useful.

00:46:33.395 --> 00:46:36.930
SPEAKER 1: Have you
driven a bulldozer?

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:40.390
I mean, I haven't, but
I dream to someday.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:42.460
NOAM CHOMSKY: I'd be scared.

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.370
But I have a shovel.

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:46.800
SPEAKER 1: OK, we have
a base context then,

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.390
and a shared
experience with that.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:49.930
That's good.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:52.900
So, yeah, I think that this
is an interesting thing

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.900
that you've talked
about in the past.

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:57.830
The interview, by the way, was
in 2012, with "The Atlantic."

00:46:57.830 --> 00:46:59.780
I'd love to unpack
that a little bit.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.800
Where would you like to see--

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.980
how would you like to
see AI research tackle

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.620
these types of deeper
understanding problems?

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:12.420
NOAM CHOMSKY: Whenever you
learn something in the sciences,

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.260
what immediately
happens is you discover

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:19.110
there's a mass of new
things, which I never noticed

00:47:19.110 --> 00:47:21.860
before that I don't understand.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.890
Scientific research is kind
of like mountain climbing.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:29.160
You think that that peak
over there is the top,

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.700
but when you get there,
you find, wait a minute,

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:35.220
turns out there's other peaks
that you didn't notice before.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:39.170
Well, that's where
scientific research has gone.

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:46.850
I mean, take what interests
me, human cognitive capacity,

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:50.330
which is an astonishing fact
that humans are absolutely

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:56.210
unique in the organic world in
an enormous number of respects.

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:01.040
Humans are not that old
in evolutionary terms,

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.290
about 200,000 years.

00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:07.520
So something happened
around 200,000 years ago,

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:13.330
plus or minus, which created
an entirely new organism, which

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:15.980
has what we call
higher intelligence,

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.010
which it is now
using incidentally

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.810
to create something
that would be

00:48:20.810 --> 00:48:23.160
headlines in every newspaper.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:29.120
We're using human intelligence
to create a perfect storm.

00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:32.840
Since the Second World
War, human intelligence

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:40.170
has created means of
suicide, self destruction.

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.110
The first is nuclear weapons.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.460
The Second World War ended
with the nuclear age.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.630
It was obvious
right at the time,

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:49.370
I can tell you of
personal experiences,

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:52.840
that we had now, human
intelligence had now

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:56.260
devised the means to
destroy everything.

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.830
That's the nuclear age.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.960
We've barely survived it.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.700
It wasn't known
then, but it's now

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:06.380
known that at the same time,
end of the Second World War,

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:09.560
we had entered a new
geological epoch, what's

00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:14.510
called the Anthropocene, where
human activities are having

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:18.830
a severely destructive
impact in the environment.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:22.022
Geologists have kind of
debated its inception.

00:49:22.022 --> 00:49:23.605
But they have now
more or less agreed,

00:49:23.605 --> 00:49:25.730
and world geological
organizations

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.090
have agreed on end of
the Second World War.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:34.070
So here, we created
two huge sledgehammers

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:38.270
which are able to destroy us.

00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:43.040
In the 1970's human
intelligence took the next step.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.910
Let's destroy the means
to protect ourselves.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:50.150
That's pretty much what
happened as the new,

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:55.400
as the period of what was called
regimented capitalism shifted

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.500
to the Neoliberal era.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:01.100
The Neoliberal era of
the last generation

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:06.140
is dedicated in principle
to destroying the only means

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:08.520
to defend ourselves
from destruction.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.040
It's not called that.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.280
What it's called is
shifting decision

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:18.740
making from public institutions,
which at least in principle

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:23.570
are under public influence,
to private institutions, which

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:27.170
are immune from public
control in principle.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.900
That's called shifting
to the market.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:31.760
It's under the
rhetoric of freedom.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.970
But it just means servitude.

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:36.380
It means servitude
to unaccountable

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:38.630
private institutions.

00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:43.220
The rhetoric, those of you who
remember Margaret Thatcher,

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:47.480
"There is no society,
just individuals."

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.610
An ideal, not a description.

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:51.920
But she may not have
known it, but she

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.450
was paraphrasing Karl
Marx, who at the period

00:50:56.450 --> 00:51:01.520
of the severe French repression
said the French repression is

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:06.860
turning society into
a sack of potatoes,

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:11.350
amorphous class of individuals,
who can't work together,

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:13.460
who are separated and atomized.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:16.100
That's the ideal
of Neoliberalism.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.280
Let's turn society into
a sack of potatoes.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.440
Let's eliminate the
institutions that might--

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:26.840
in which engage,
in that the people

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.410
might get together to try
to deal constructively

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:31.480
with their problems.

00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:35.780
Let's transfer it into the
hands of unaccountable private

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:39.980
institutions, which are
devoted in principle to profit

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:43.010
maximization and
power maximization.

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:46.130
Of course, that means
undermining democracy.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.800
That's what's happened.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:50.650
That's why we see
what's called--

00:51:50.650 --> 00:51:54.390
it's a bad term, it's called
the populist uprising.

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.230
Nothing populist about it.

00:51:56.230 --> 00:52:02.300
It means an anger, fear,
hatred, discontent, contempt

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:05.420
for institutions, the
collapse of institutions,

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:11.100
a direct consequence of the
Neoliberal economic policies,

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.300
which have also led to
stagnation or decline

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.980
for the majority.

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:19.460
Real wages have actually
declined since 1979

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.730
when the program began.

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:24.310
All of this is together,
and put it together,

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.920
what you have is
human intelligence

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:32.420
has created two means
of destroying ourself,

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:36.280
and it has also been
actively engaged

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.770
in trying to eliminate
the only protection we

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:40.120
have against them.

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:42.490
So it's a kind of perfect storm.

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:44.650
That's what humans have done.

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:46.160
How did this happen?

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.710
How did we get this way?

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.560
How did we develop
creative capacities

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:56.680
of a unique kind which have led
to extraordinary achievements?

00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:00.800
OK, these are things we have to
try to understand, all of them.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:03.520
And do something about,
not just understand.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.010
SPEAKER 1: Another question
from Oleg [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:10.750
from Australia, asks how do
you think Google can and should

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:12.980
handle the fake news problem.

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:14.440
We have a big hammer.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.550
We're looking for nails.

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:19.630
NOAM CHOMSKY: Well by
not contributing to it.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:23.860
So for example, the
internet is actually

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:26.830
slowing down in some respects.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:29.110
And one of the reasons
it's slowing down

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:34.540
is because if you
pick up, you say

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:39.550
access, "The New York
Times," the first thing that

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:45.310
gets loaded is a ton of ads,
which slow everything down.

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.830
All of this is going
on all the time.

00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:53.860
It's contributing to the
narrowness of coverage,

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:55.870
and even to the
kind of coverage,

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:58.870
because it's influenced
by, of course, the choice,

00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.780
the funding, the
institutions, of course,

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:05.560
it's influenced by its
funders, mostly advertisers.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.530
So all of that's happening.

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:11.320
And it's not what
people call fake news.

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:15.490
But it's a distortion
of the world in ways

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:17.630
that shouldn't be happening.

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:20.680
So the actual news, I
think, should be what

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:22.690
we've just been talking about.

00:54:22.690 --> 00:54:24.520
Like why are we--

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.430
why for the last
generation have we

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:32.260
constructed socioeconomic
policies and political policies

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:37.070
which are developing a perfect
storm which could destroy us.

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:39.610
SPEAKER 1: So if we
can devise a way for--

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.520
I mean obviously advertising
monetization is the way

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.490
and a lot of publications exist.

00:54:45.490 --> 00:54:48.220
And perhaps without it,
many of those publications

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:51.490
would be without the funding
required to continue.

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:52.780
NOAM CHOMSKY: That's not true.

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:56.020
The period of the freest, most
lively press in the United

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.260
States was probably
in the 19th century,

00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:04.230
when you had a proliferation
of all kinds of newspapers,

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:07.430
ethnic, working class.

00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:09.490
I mentioned the factory girls.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:11.170
There were others.

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:13.450
What happened in the
late 19th century

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:17.560
is in England and
the United States,

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:22.460
which also saw a similar shift
towards capital concentration

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:25.150
and advertiser
reliance, and that

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:33.400
has very sharply narrowed and
changed the nature of media.

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:39.460
So say in England, as
late as the 1960's,

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:42.760
the most popular
widely read newspaper

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:47.650
was "The Daily Herald," which
was kind of social-democratic.

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:51.010
The tabloids in England,
which are now monstrous,

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:54.490
were labor based newspapers
and pretty interesting.

00:55:54.490 --> 00:55:57.850
They succumbed to
the consequences

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:01.750
of capital concentration,
and advertiser reliance,

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:03.850
and became quite different.

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:06.370
Similar here.

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:07.930
When I was a kid
growing up, there

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:11.500
were several newspapers
delivered, local newspapers,

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.330
delivered every day.

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:16.520
They were not-- there
was a certain variety.

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.290
Now in Boston, now
there isn't even one.

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:25.860
"The Boston Globe" used to
be a pretty decent newspaper,

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.270
problems, but a
lot of bureaus all

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:30.940
over the world, good reporters.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.415
Take a look at it now.

00:56:33.415 --> 00:56:35.740
It basically doesn't exist.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:37.660
It has some local news.

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.480
And the rest, it picks
up "The New York Times,"

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.630
"Washington Post," the AP.

00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:46.450
That's happened all
over the country.

00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:49.300
It has a lot of
reasons behind it.

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.570
But the large part of
it-- it's been going on

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:53.560
for over a century.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.960
It's just continuing.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.470
The large part is the effect
of capital concentration

00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:59.920
and advertiser reliance.

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:04.012
Which affects the content of
the media reporting as well.

00:57:04.012 --> 00:57:06.220
SPEAKER 1: In that case,
we'll cancel our advertising

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:06.934
programs.

00:57:06.934 --> 00:57:09.100
NOAM CHOMSKY: See, advertising
is a very interesting

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.600
phenomenon.

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.060
Any of you that have
taken an economics course

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:18.040
know that the
beauty, the marvels

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:21.810
of the market that we're
supposed to admire and worship

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:27.770
is because the market is based
on informed consumers making

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:29.090
rational choices.

00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:32.180
And you prove all sorts of
theorems about how wonderful

00:57:32.180 --> 00:57:34.150
it is.

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:37.310
Turn on your television set.

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:40.670
Do you see efforts
by corporations

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:46.790
to create informed consumers
making rational choices?

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:50.260
Is that what you see when
you see an ad for cars?

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:52.760
I mean, if we had a
market system, what

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:58.100
you would see is when General
Motors is advertising a car,

00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:03.350
what you would see is a list of
the characteristics of the car,

00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:06.170
along with a report
by "Consumers Report"

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:08.900
saying what's wrong
with it and so on.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.060
That would create
informed consumers that

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.560
could make rational choices.

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.360
But you don't see that.

00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:17.040
What you see is an
effort to delude,

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.970
you know, a movie star,
a football player,

00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:23.690
a car shooting up
into the stratosphere,

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:25.760
wherever it may be.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:30.380
Huge amounts of capital
are expended every year

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:34.100
to try to undermine
markets, undermine markets

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:39.110
by creating uninformed consumers
making irrational choices,

00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:43.340
and driving them to
consumerism, which atomizes

00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:45.560
rather than serious things.

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:49.250
That's what ought to be
taught in economics courses.

00:58:49.250 --> 00:58:54.280
Massive efforts by the business
community to undermine markets.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.820
It's not deep.

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.750
We all know it, you know.

00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:00.400
We just somehow
don't think about it.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:03.020
And just as we don't
think about the fact

00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:07.820
that the marvels
of free enterprise,

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.800
like computers, the
internet, and so on,

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.700
were created by the taxpayer
at public expense in places

00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:17.080
like MIT, right
across the street.

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.190
SPEAKER 1: So I wish
we could go on forever.

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:22.192
I'm riveted, but unfortunately,
we're out of time.

00:59:22.192 --> 00:59:23.400
Thank you so much for coming.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.080
But one thing I
will say, though,

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.860
is that it's not every day
that a non-Googler gets

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:31.280
to sit in a room full of
people who work in at Google,

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.250
and are software engineers,
and are advertising experts,

00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:36.710
and are market experts
in different fields.

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:41.024
Do you have anything that
you'd like to ask us?

00:59:41.024 --> 00:59:43.190
NOAM CHOMSKY: Why not do
some of the serious things?

00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.040
SPEAKER 1: Something
that we'll [INAUDIBLE].
