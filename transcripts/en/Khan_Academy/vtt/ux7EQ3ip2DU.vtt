00:00:00.313 --> 00:00:02.330
- [Voiceover] When you have
a multivariable function,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.964
something that takes in
multiple different input values

00:00:04.964 --> 00:00:07.098
and let's say it's just
outputting a single number,

00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:08.284
a very common thing you wanna do

00:00:08.284 --> 00:00:11.871
with an animal like this is Maximize it.

00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:13.941
Maximize it, and what this means

00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:15.615
is you're looking for the input points,

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.317
the values of x and y and
all of its other inputs,

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:22.666
such that the output, f, is as
great as it possibly can be.

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:24.725
Now this actually comes up
all the time in practice

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:25.671
'cause usually when you're dealing

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:28.226
with a multivariable function,
it's not just for fun

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:29.949
and for dealing with abstract symbols,

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.370
it's 'cause it actually
represents something,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.590
so maybe it represents
profits of a company,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.664
maybe this is a function
where you're considering

00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:37.737
all the choices you can make,

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:39.368
like the wages you give your employees

00:00:39.368 --> 00:00:41.036
or the prices of your goods,

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:43.420
or the amount of debt that
you raise for capital,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.470
all sorts of choices that you might make,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.362
and you wanna know what
values should you give

00:00:47.362 --> 00:00:50.202
to those choices such
that you maximize profits,

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.272
you maximize the thing,
and if you have a function

00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:53.917
that models these relationships,

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:56.058
there are techniques, which
I'm about to teach you,

00:00:56.058 --> 00:00:57.777
that you can use to maximize this.

00:00:57.777 --> 00:00:59.031
Another very common setting,

00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.462
more and more important these days,

00:01:00.462 --> 00:01:03.127
is that of machine learning
and artificial intelligence,

00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:05.332
where often what you do
is you assign something

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.915
called a cost function to a task,

00:01:07.915 --> 00:01:09.408
so maybe you're trying to teach a computer

00:01:09.408 --> 00:01:13.533
how to understand audio or
how to read handwritten text.

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.262
What you do, is you find a function

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.773
that basically tells it how wrong it is

00:01:17.773 --> 00:01:20.247
when it makes a guess,
and if you do a good job

00:01:20.247 --> 00:01:22.997
designing that function, you
just need to tell the computer

00:01:22.997 --> 00:01:25.769
to Minimize, so that's kind
of the flip side, right?

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:27.003
Instead of finding the maximum,

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.869
to minimize a certain function,

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.783
and if it minimizes this cost function,

00:01:31.783 --> 00:01:34.057
that means that it's
doing a really good job

00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:35.775
at whatever task you've assigned it,

00:01:35.775 --> 00:01:38.524
so a lot of the art and
science of machine learning

00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:41.125
and artificial intelligence
comes down to, well,

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:42.682
one finding this cost function

00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:45.293
and actually describing difficult tasks

00:01:45.293 --> 00:01:47.978
in terms of a function, but
then applying the techniques

00:01:47.978 --> 00:01:49.102
that I'm about to teach you

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:50.976
to have the computer minimize that,

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:51.980
and a lot of time and research

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.529
has gone into figuring out
ways to basically apply

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:57.489
these techniques, but really
quickly and efficiently.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:59.647
So, first of all, on a conceptual level,

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:00.923
let's just think about what it means

00:02:00.923 --> 00:02:04.228
to be finding the maximum
of a multivariable function.

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:06.535
So I have here the graph
of a two-variable function.

00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:08.747
It's something that has
a two-variable input

00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:10.645
that we're thinking of as the xy-plane,

00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:13.294
and then its output is
the height of this graph,

00:02:13.294 --> 00:02:14.995
and if you're looking to maximize it,

00:02:14.995 --> 00:02:17.703
basically, what you're
finding is this peak,

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:20.486
kind of the tallest
mountain in the entire area,

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:21.938
and you're looking for the input value,

00:02:21.938 --> 00:02:25.685
the point on the xy-plane
directly below that peak,

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:27.471
'cause that tells you
the values of the inputs

00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:30.006
that you should put in to
maximize your function,

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:32.049
so how do you go about finding that?

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.804
Well, this is perhaps the core observation

00:02:34.804 --> 00:02:37.436
in well, calculus, not just
multivariable calculus.

00:02:37.436 --> 00:02:39.361
This is similar in the
single variable world,

00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:41.055
and there are similarities
in other settings,

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:42.744
but the core observation

00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:45.463
is that if you take a
tangent plane at that peak,

00:02:45.463 --> 00:02:48.588
so let's just draw in a
tangent plane at that peak,

00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:50.524
it's gonna be completely flat,

00:02:50.524 --> 00:02:52.633
but let's say you did this
at a different point, right?

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.036
'Cause if you tried to
find the tangent plane,

00:02:54.036 --> 00:02:57.312
not at that point, but you
kind of moved it about a bit

00:02:57.312 --> 00:02:59.796
to somewhere that's not quite a maximum,

00:02:59.796 --> 00:03:02.666
if the tangent plane has
any kind of slope to it,

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:04.169
what that's telling
you is that if you take

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.765
very small directions,

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:08.264
kind of in the direction
of that upward slope,

00:03:08.264 --> 00:03:10.247
you can increase the
value of your function,

00:03:10.247 --> 00:03:12.330
so if there's any slope
to the tangent plane,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.761
you know that you can walk in
some direction to increase it,

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:17.480
but if there's no slope
to it, if it's flat,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.231
then that's a sign that no
matter which direction you walk,

00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:22.353
you're not gonna be significantly
increasing the value

00:03:22.353 --> 00:03:23.734
of your function.

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:26.647
So what does this mean
in terms of formulas?

00:03:26.647 --> 00:03:28.228
Well, if you kind of think back

00:03:28.228 --> 00:03:29.736
to how we compute tangent planes

00:03:29.736 --> 00:03:31.001
and if you're not very
comfortable with that,

00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:32.928
now would be a good time
to take another look

00:03:32.928 --> 00:03:35.195
at those videos about tangent planes,

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:37.695
the slope of the plane in each direction,

00:03:37.695 --> 00:03:40.057
so this would be the
slope in the x direction,

00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:41.936
and then if you look at it
from another perspective,

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:43.852
this would be the slope
in the y direction,

00:03:43.852 --> 00:03:46.264
each one of those has
to be zero, and that,

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:48.037
in terms of partial derivatives,

00:03:48.037 --> 00:03:50.700
means the partial
derivative of your function,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.156
at whatever point you're
dealing with, right?

00:03:52.156 --> 00:03:55.591
So I'll call it x not, y not, as the point

00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.170
where you're inputting
this, has to be zero,

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.273
and then similarly, the partial derivative

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:03.261
with respect to the other
variable, with respect to y,

00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:06.178
at that same point, has to be zero,

00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:09.668
and both of these have to be true

00:04:09.668 --> 00:04:11.065
because let's just take
a look, I don't know,

00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:13.511
let's slide it over a little bit here,

00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:15.761
this tangent plane, if
you look at the slope,

00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:18.147
you imagine walking in the y direction,

00:04:18.147 --> 00:04:19.772
you're not increasing your value at all.

00:04:19.772 --> 00:04:22.600
The slope in the y direction
would actually be zero,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.342
so that would mean the partial derivative

00:04:24.342 --> 00:04:27.482
with respect to y would be
zero, but with respect to x,

00:04:27.482 --> 00:04:30.087
when you're moving in
the x direction here,

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:31.631
the slope is clearly negative,

00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:34.291
because as you take positive
steps in the x direction,

00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:37.390
the height of your tangent
plane is decreasing,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.224
which corresponds to if you
take tiny steps on your graph,

00:04:40.224 --> 00:04:43.069
then the height will decrease
in a manner proportional

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.482
to the size of those tiny steps.

00:04:45.482 --> 00:04:47.623
So what this gives you
here is gonna be a system

00:04:47.623 --> 00:04:50.636
of equations where you're
solving for the value of x not

00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:53.539
and y not that satisfies
both of these equations,

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:54.372
and in future videos,

00:04:54.372 --> 00:04:56.655
I'll go through specific examples of this.

00:04:56.655 --> 00:04:59.935
For now, I just wanna give a
good conceptual understanding,

00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:01.211
but one very important thing to notice

00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:04.118
is that just because this
condition is satisfied,

00:05:04.118 --> 00:05:05.911
meaning your tangent plane is flat,

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:08.612
just because that's satisfied,
doesn't necessarily mean

00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:10.108
that you've found the maximum.

00:05:10.108 --> 00:05:12.959
That's just one requirement
that it has to satisfy,

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.114
but for one thing, if you
found the tangent plane

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:18.472
at other little peaks, like
this guy here or this guy here,

00:05:18.472 --> 00:05:20.432
or all of the little bumps that go up,

00:05:20.432 --> 00:05:23.238
those tangent planes would also be flat,

00:05:23.238 --> 00:05:24.870
and those little bumps
actually have a name

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.921
because this comes up a lot.

00:05:26.921 --> 00:05:30.959
They're called local Minima,
or local Maxima, sorry,

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:34.126
so those guys are called local Maxima.

00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:37.975
Maxima is just the plural of Maximum,

00:05:37.975 --> 00:05:41.144
and local means that it's
relative to a single point,

00:05:41.144 --> 00:05:43.830
so it's basically, if you
walk in any direction,

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.157
when you're on that little
peak, you'll go downhill,

00:05:46.157 --> 00:05:48.423
so relative to the neighbors
of that little point,

00:05:48.423 --> 00:05:51.672
it is a maximum, but relative
to the entire function,

00:05:51.672 --> 00:05:55.404
these guys are the shorter
mountains next to Mount Everest,

00:05:55.404 --> 00:05:57.008
but there's also another circumstance

00:05:57.008 --> 00:06:00.034
where you might find a flat tangent plane,

00:06:00.034 --> 00:06:01.497
and that's at the Minima points, right?

00:06:01.497 --> 00:06:04.013
If you have the global
Minimum, the absolute smallest,

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:06.971
or also just the local
Minima, these inverted peaks,

00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:09.116
you'll also find flat tangent planes.

00:06:09.116 --> 00:06:10.272
So what that means, first of all,

00:06:10.272 --> 00:06:12.013
is that when you're minimizing a function,

00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:13.878
you also have to look
for this requirement,

00:06:13.878 --> 00:06:16.269
where all the partial
derivatives are zero,

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:18.103
but it mainly just means
that your job isn't done

00:06:18.103 --> 00:06:18.936
once you've done this.

00:06:18.936 --> 00:06:20.678
You have to do more tests to check

00:06:20.678 --> 00:06:22.483
whether or not what you
found is a local Maximum

00:06:22.483 --> 00:06:24.922
or a local Minimum, or a global Maximum,

00:06:24.922 --> 00:06:26.051
and these requirements, by the way,

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:28.931
often you'll see them written
in a more succinct form,

00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:30.778
where instead of saying
all the partial derivatives

00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:33.712
have to be zero, which
is what you need to find,

00:06:33.712 --> 00:06:34.929
they'll write it in a different form

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:38.693
where you say that the
gradient of your function, f,

00:06:38.693 --> 00:06:39.961
which, of course, is just the vector

00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:42.249
that contains all those
partial derivatives.

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.388
Its first component is
the partial derivative

00:06:44.388 --> 00:06:45.988
with respect to the first variable,

00:06:45.988 --> 00:06:48.286
its second component is
the partial derivative

00:06:48.286 --> 00:06:49.878
with respect to the second variable,

00:06:49.878 --> 00:06:52.190
and if there's more variables,
you would keep going,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.611
you'd say that this whole thing

00:06:53.611 --> 00:06:56.660
has to equal the zero vector,
the vector that has nothing

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.454
but zeroes as its components,

00:06:59.454 --> 00:07:02.117
and it's kind of a
common, abusive notation.

00:07:02.117 --> 00:07:05.177
People will just call
that zero vector, zero,

00:07:05.177 --> 00:07:07.765
and maybe they'll emphasize
it by making it bold,

00:07:07.765 --> 00:07:09.244
because the number zero is not a vector

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:11.342
and often making things bold emphasizes

00:07:11.342 --> 00:07:13.309
that you want to be referring to a vector,

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:14.642
but this gives a very succinct way

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.214
of describing the requirement.

00:07:16.214 --> 00:07:18.345
You're just looking for where
the gradient of your function

00:07:18.345 --> 00:07:20.172
is equal to the zero vector, and that way,

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.747
you can just write it on
one line, but in practice,

00:07:22.747 --> 00:07:24.406
every time that you're expanding that out,

00:07:24.406 --> 00:07:25.801
what that means is you find

00:07:25.801 --> 00:07:27.372
all of the different partial derivatives,

00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:30.111
so this is really just a matter
of notational convenience

00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:32.655
and using less space on a blackboard,

00:07:32.655 --> 00:07:34.900
but whenever you see this,
that the gradient equals zero,

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.250
what you should be thinking of

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.283
is the idea that the tangent plane,

00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:40.457
the tangent plane is completely flat,

00:07:40.457 --> 00:07:41.997
and as I just said, that's not enough

00:07:41.997 --> 00:07:44.257
because you might also
be finding local Maxima

00:07:44.257 --> 00:07:47.147
or Minima points, but in
multivariable calculus,

00:07:47.147 --> 00:07:49.297
there's also another possibility,

00:07:49.297 --> 00:07:51.791
a place where the tangent plane is flat,

00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:54.532
but what you're looking at
is neither a local Maximum

00:07:54.532 --> 00:07:56.971
nor a local Minimum, and this is the idea

00:07:56.971 --> 00:08:00.422
of a saddle point, which is
new to multivariable calculus,

00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:02.597
and that's what I'll be talking
about in the next video,

00:08:02.597 --> 00:08:03.830
so I will see you then.
