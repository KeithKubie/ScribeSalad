00:00:00.904 --> 00:00:02.622
- [Voiceover] Hi. My name is Jen,

00:00:02.622 --> 00:00:04.619
and I help create the SAT.

00:00:04.619 --> 00:00:07.940
The new SAT is made up
of two main sections:

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.260
Math, and evidence based
reading and writing.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.634
And the evidence based
reading and writing section

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.637
is made up of two tests.

00:00:15.637 --> 00:00:18.725
The Reading Test, and the
Writing and Language Test.

00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:20.931
In this video, I'm going to
tell you about the Writing

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:22.228
and Language Test.

00:00:22.228 --> 00:00:25.525
I'll go over what this section
tests, and how it's laid out.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.799
Then, I'll tell you about
how the section is scored.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:32.816
First, let's go over what
the section aims to assess.

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:36.156
The SAT Writing and Language
Test is designed to assess

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.756
how well you can revise and edit texts,

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:40.242
which we'll call passages,

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:43.470
about a range of academic
and career related topics.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.480
The questions associated with the passages

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.149
will put you in the role of
someone revising and editing

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.491
the work of an unspecified writer.

00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.184
Questions will ask you to
improve the development,

00:00:53.184 --> 00:00:56.435
organization, and use of
language in the passages.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.919
And to make sure that the
passages follow conventions

00:00:58.919 --> 00:01:02.866
of standard written English
grammar, usage, and punctuation.

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.537
The types of questions you'll be answering

00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:07.160
have been carefully designed
to help you demonstrate

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.924
the literacy skills that are
keys to success in college

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:11.328
and careers.

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:15.594
Now let's go over what
you can expect to see

00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:17.860
on the Writing and Language Test.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.669
You will see four passages with
eleven questions associated

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:22.410
with each passage.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.917
You will have 35 minutes
to read the passages,

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:27.152
and to complete the questions.

00:01:27.152 --> 00:01:30.783
There will be one passage each
on a career related topic,

00:01:30.783 --> 00:01:32.339
history/social studies,

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:33.267
humanities,

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:34.591
and science.

00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:37.540
These for passages will
vary in their text mode.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.676
At least one will be argumentative,

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:42.694
at least one will be
informative/explanatory,

00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:45.536
and one will be nonfiction narrative.

00:01:45.536 --> 00:01:48.268
You should also expect to see
a range of text complexity,

00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:50.991
from ninth grade on up to
the first year in college,

00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:53.452
or post-secondary training.

00:01:53.452 --> 00:01:56.587
Some passages, and sometimes
some questions, on the writing

00:01:56.587 --> 00:01:59.861
and language test, include
one or more tables, graphs,

00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:03.088
or charts, that relate to
the topic of the passage.

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:06.194
For example, a graph may
provide additional support

00:02:06.194 --> 00:02:08.057
for a point made in a passage.

00:02:08.057 --> 00:02:10.983
Questions may ask you to use
information from the graphic

00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:13.403
to correct a factual error in the passage,

00:02:13.403 --> 00:02:16.190
or to replace the
passage's vague description

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.330
with a more precise one
using specific numbers.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.654
You'll never have to make
corrections to the graphic itself.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:26.432
All of this passage variety
allows you the chance to show

00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:28.871
how you can apply your
revising and editing skills

00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:32.261
across a wide range of
topics and purposes.

00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:35.733
OK. Now let's talk about what
the Writing and Language Test

00:02:35.733 --> 00:02:37.799
looks like, and how it works.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.702
When you open a test booklet,
you will see the passages

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:43.534
on the left, with the title in bold,

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:45.903
and the questions on the right.

00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:48.503
The questions will appear next
to the part of the passage

00:02:48.503 --> 00:02:50.871
to which they are anchored.

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.494
Sometimes, a passage may
extend to more than one page,

00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:56.374
so don't assume the passage is over

00:02:56.374 --> 00:02:59.037
until you see the bold
title of a new passage.

00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:02.270
The boxed question numbers in the passage

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.708
will also help you determine
the place in the passage

00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:06.774
that the question is targeting.

00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:09.584
Keep in mind that many of the
questions rely on the context

00:03:09.584 --> 00:03:11.859
of the passage, so you may have to read

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.303
more than the sentence that
corresponds to the question,

00:03:14.303 --> 00:03:15.877
to choose the best answer.

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:19.319
Sometimes, you will see the box number

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.501
and nothing else in the sentence.

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:24.914
In this case, the question
will tell you what to do,

00:03:24.914 --> 00:03:28.040
such as: consider adding
a sentence at that point.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.686
Other times, you will see underlined text

00:03:30.686 --> 00:03:32.637
after the box number.

00:03:32.637 --> 00:03:34.843
For these questions,
you'll have to consider

00:03:34.843 --> 00:03:37.067
which of four answer
options results in the most

00:03:37.067 --> 00:03:39.283
rhetorically effective
expression in the context

00:03:39.283 --> 00:03:40.560
of the passage.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.463
Or, which of the four options
results in an expression

00:03:43.463 --> 00:03:45.854
that is consistent with the
conventions of standard written

00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:49.046
English sentence structure,
usage, or punctuation.

00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:53.417
You may see other types of
passage annotation as well.

00:03:53.417 --> 00:03:55.808
If the paragraphs of a
passage, or the sentences

00:03:55.808 --> 00:03:58.386
in a paragraph are numbered,
one or more questions

00:03:58.386 --> 00:04:00.522
will refer to those numbers.

00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:02.728
Those questions may ask you, for example,

00:04:02.728 --> 00:04:05.193
to consider where a particular
sentence or paragraph

00:04:05.193 --> 00:04:07.391
should be placed.

00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:10.995
Now, let's talk a little more
about how the questions look.

00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:13.213
Some questions that ask
about an underlined portion

00:04:13.213 --> 00:04:17.508
of the passage, offer directions
or ask an actual question,

00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:18.878
and other don't.

00:04:18.878 --> 00:04:21.618
When there are no additional
directions or questions,

00:04:21.618 --> 00:04:23.499
assume that you have to choose the option

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.215
that's most effective or correct.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:29.071
If a question includes a no change option,

00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:31.788
it will always be the first answer choice.

00:04:31.788 --> 00:04:33.855
Choose that one if you
think the original version

00:04:33.855 --> 00:04:36.479
presented in the passage,
is the best choice.

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.824
Otherwise, pick one of
the three alternatives

00:04:38.824 --> 00:04:40.258
offered in the question.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.839
All of the questions on the
Writing and Language Test

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:46.440
are multiple choice, and
are based on the context of

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.088
the passages.

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:50.433
So you won't be tested on isolated skills,

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:53.638
or asked to memorize
specific grammar rules.

00:04:53.638 --> 00:04:55.263
The questions are designed to ask about

00:04:55.263 --> 00:04:57.585
the kinds of revisions and
edits real writers make

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:59.187
to a piece of writing.

00:04:59.187 --> 00:05:01.625
They're sorted into two main categories.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:04.834
Expression of ideas, and
standard English conventions.

00:05:06.192 --> 00:05:09.227
Questions that fall into the
expression of ideas category,

00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:12.524
focus on the rhetorical elements
of the piece of writing.

00:05:12.524 --> 00:05:15.171
In other words, the
questions ask you to improve

00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:17.145
the development of the topic,

00:05:17.145 --> 00:05:19.699
the organization of information and ideas,

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.917
and the effectiveness of language use.

00:05:23.299 --> 00:05:25.712
Questions that fall into the
standard English conventions

00:05:25.712 --> 00:05:28.846
category, focus on
correcting grammar, usage,

00:05:28.846 --> 00:05:31.277
and mechanics problems in the passages.

00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:34.365
In other words, these questions
may ask you to recognize

00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:36.873
and correct errors in sentence structure,

00:05:36.873 --> 00:05:40.532
such as run-ons, or rhetorically
inappropriate fragments,

00:05:40.532 --> 00:05:44.423
usage, such as lack of
subject-verb agreement,

00:05:44.423 --> 00:05:48.556
and punctuation, such as
punctuating parenthetical element.

00:05:49.352 --> 00:05:50.438
If you want to know more about

00:05:50.438 --> 00:05:52.671
the Writing and Language Test questions,

00:05:52.671 --> 00:05:55.249
you'll be able to see
videos here on Khan Academy,

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:57.532
that go into depth on each question type.

00:05:59.163 --> 00:06:02.028
Finally, let's go over how
this section of the SAT

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.087
is scored.

00:06:03.677 --> 00:06:06.018
The Writing and Language
Test is scored on a scale of

00:06:06.018 --> 00:06:07.806
10 to 40.

00:06:07.806 --> 00:06:10.522
And that, along with your
score on the reading test,

00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:12.217
will contribute to your evidence based

00:06:12.217 --> 00:06:14.632
reading and writing score,
which is scored on a scale

00:06:14.632 --> 00:06:17.104
of 200 to 800.

00:06:17.104 --> 00:06:18.920
When you get your SAT scores,

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.498
you'll also see some subscores.

00:06:21.498 --> 00:06:22.421
Two of these subscores

00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:25.115
are unique to the Writing
and Language Test.

00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:27.344
They are: expression of ideas,

00:06:27.344 --> 00:06:29.735
and standard English conventions.

00:06:29.735 --> 00:06:31.825
You'll get a score of one to 15

00:06:31.825 --> 00:06:34.704
in each of these subscore areas.

00:06:34.704 --> 00:06:36.701
Some questions of the
Writing and Language Test

00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:39.835
will contribute to a words
in context subscore, which,

00:06:39.835 --> 00:06:42.552
along with some questions
from the reading test,

00:06:42.552 --> 00:06:44.618
will ask you to make
decisions about word choice,

00:06:44.618 --> 00:06:46.416
based on the context of the passage

00:06:46.416 --> 00:06:47.997
in which the words appear.

00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:51.220
Other questions from the
Writing and Language Test

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.696
will contribute to command
of evidence subscore,

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:55.623
which, again, along with some questions

00:06:55.623 --> 00:06:58.341
from the reading test,
will ask you to interpret,

00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:01.213
synthesize, and use evidence
found in a wide range

00:07:01.213 --> 00:07:04.813
of sources, including graphics
and a variety of texts.

00:07:05.655 --> 00:07:09.602
Both of these subscores will
be on a scale of one to 15.

00:07:09.602 --> 00:07:12.713
You'll also see some cross-test scores.

00:07:12.713 --> 00:07:15.941
Those will be recorded
on scale of 10 to 40,

00:07:15.941 --> 00:07:18.588
and will be based on selective
questions in the Reading,

00:07:18.588 --> 00:07:21.351
Writing and Language, and Math Tests.

00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:23.771
They'll reflect the application
of reading, writing,

00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:25.466
language and math skills

00:07:25.466 --> 00:07:27.927
in history and social studies contexts,

00:07:27.927 --> 00:07:30.040
and science contexts.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.316
Together, all of these scores
help to build a better,

00:07:32.316 --> 00:07:35.506
more detailed picture of your
college and career readiness.

00:07:36.992 --> 00:07:38.786
So, that was the introduction

00:07:38.786 --> 00:07:41.015
to the Writing and Language Test.

00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:43.917
Now, I hope you'll try
working through a few passages

00:07:43.917 --> 00:07:46.930
and practice questions, to
get familiar with the SAT.
