00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.450
For any real number
x, let brackets

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.380
around x denote the
largest integer less than

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.200
or equal to x, often known as
the greatest integer function.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.730
Let f be a real valued
function defined

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.600
on the interval
negative 10 to 10,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.580
including the
boundaries by f of x

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.610
is equal to x minus the greatest
integer of x, if the greatest

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.340
integer of x is odd, and 1
plus the greatest integer

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.500
of x minus x, if the greatest
integer of x is even.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.700
Then the value of pi
squared over 10 times

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.530
a definite integral
from negative 10 to 10

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.860
of f of x cosine of pi of
x dx is-- so before even

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.340
try to attempt to
evaluate this integral,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.060
let's see if we can at least
visualize this function,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.110
f of x, right over here.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.160
So let's do our best
to visualize it.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.910
So let me draw my x-axis.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.980
And let me draw my y-axis.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.000
So let me draw my y-axis.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.500
And then let's think about what
this function will look like.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.840
So this is x is equal to
0, this is x is equal to 0,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.700
this is x is equal to 1, x is
equal to 2, x is equal to 3.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.170
We could go down to
negative 1, negative 2.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.370
We could just keep
going, if we like.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.160
Hopefully we'll see
some type of pattern,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.790
because it seems to
change from odd to even.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:30.864
So between 0 and 1, what is
the greatest integer of x?

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:32.280
So let me just
write it over here.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.790
So between 0 and 1,
until you get to 1--

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.740
so maybe I should do this--
from including 0 until 1,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.470
the greatest integer
of x is equal to 0.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.830
If I'm at 0.5, the greatest
integer below 0.5 is 0.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:00.120
As I go from 1 to 2,
this brackets around x

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.717
is equal to 1.

00:02:00.717 --> 00:02:01.800
It's the greatest integer.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.910
If I'm at 1.5, the
greatest integer is 1.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.600
If I'm at 1.9, the
greatest integer is 1.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.410
And then if I go to above
from between 2 and 3,

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.750
then the greatest
integer is going to be 2.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.504
If I'm at 2.5, greatest
integer is going to be 2.

00:02:20.504 --> 00:02:22.170
So with that, let's
try to at least draw

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.270
this function over
these intervals.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.620
So between 0 and 1, the
greatest integer is 0.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.300
0 we can consider to be even.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.660
0 is even, especially
if we're alternating.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.230
1 is odd, 2 is even, 3 is odd.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.410
So 0 is even.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.440
So we would look at this
circumstance right over here,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.820
if x is even.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.210
And then over this time frame
or over this part of the x-axis,

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.190
the greatest integer
of x is just 0.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.890
So the equation or the
line or the function

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.440
is just going to be 1
minus x over this interval,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.180
because the greatest
integer is 0.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.670
So 1 minus x will
look like this.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.410
If this is 1, 1 minus x
just goes down like that.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.640
That's what it looks
like from 0 to 1.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.530
Now let's think about what
happens as we go from 1 to 2.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.450
As we go from 1 to 2, not
including 2 but including 1,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.700
all the way up to
2, not including it,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.960
the greatest integer is 1.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.640
The greatest integer is odd.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.130
So we use this case.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.060
And over here, we're going
to have x minus the greatest

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.990
integer of x over this interval.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.110
The greatest integer of x is 1.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.010
So it's going to be
the graph of x minus 1.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.440
So x minus 1 at 1
is going to be 0.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.770
And at 2, it's
going to be 1 again.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.990
So it's going to be this.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.180
It's going to look
just like that.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.660
So this right here is x minus 1.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.806
And then this over here,
essentially was 1 minus x.

00:03:51.806 --> 00:03:52.930
And we could keep doing it.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.370
As we go from 2 to 3, the
greatest integer of x is 2.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.860
We would look at this case.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.620
So we're going to have 1 plus 2.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.100
So we're going to
have 3 here minus x.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.800
So when we start
over here when x

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.150
is 2 or a little bit above that,
we're going to have 3 minus 2.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.170
We're going go to 1.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.580
It's going to be right at 1.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.470
And then as x is equal
to 3, 3 minus 3 is 0.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.709
It's going to oscillate
back down like this.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.630
I think we have an
appreciation for what

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.830
this graph is
going to look like.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.249
It's going to keep going
up and down like this,

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.790
with a slope of negative 1, then
positive 1, then negative 1,

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:29.850
then positive 1.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.340
It's just going to keep doing
that over and over again.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.340
You can keep trying it
out with other intervals,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.613
but it's pretty clear
that this is the pattern.

00:04:37.613 --> 00:04:41.100
Now, what we want to do is
evaluate the integral from 10

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.270
to negative 10 of this function
times cosine of pi of x.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.400
So let's think about
cosine of pi of x

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.230
and think about whether
that also is periodic.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.950
And of course, it is.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.690
And then if we can
simplify this integral

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.620
so we don't have to evaluate
it over this entire period

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.270
over here, maybe we can simplify
it into a simpler integral.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.760
So cosine of pi x,
cosine of 0 is 1.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.070
Don't want you to
get that wrong.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.470
Cosine pi 0 is cosine of 0.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.640
So that's 1.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.890
Cosine of pi is negative 1.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.390
So when x is equal to 1,
this becomes cosine of pi.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.240
So then the value of the
function is negative 1.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.540
It'll be over here.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.750
And then cosine of 2 pi, 2
times pi, is then 1 again.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.590
So it'll look like this.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.430
This is at 1/2.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.513
When you put it over here,
it'll become pi over 2.

00:05:38.513 --> 00:05:40.730
Cosine of pi over 2 is 0.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.910
So it'll look like this.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.490
Let me draw it as
neatly as possible.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.640
So it will look like this.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.830
Cosine, and then
it'll keep doing that,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.860
and then it'll go like this.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.570
So it is also periodic.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.320
So if we wanted to figure out
the integral of the product

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.520
of these two periodic
functions from all the way

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.930
from negative 10 to 10,
can we simplify that?

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.392
And it looks like
it would just be,

00:06:10.392 --> 00:06:12.100
because we have this
interval, let's look

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.560
at this interval over here.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.370
Let's look at just from 0 to 1.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.830
So just from 0 to 1, we're
going to take this function

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.430
and take the product
of this cosine

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.430
times essentially
1 minus x, and then

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.040
find the area under that
curve, whatever it might be.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.790
Then when we go
from 1 to 2, when

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.390
we take the product
of this and x minus 1,

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.830
it's actually going to be the
same area, because these two,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.380
going from 0 to 1 and
going from 1 to 2,

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.710
it's completely symmetric.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.000
You can flip it over
this line of symmetry,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.020
and both functions are
completely symmetric.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.770
So you're going to
have the same area when

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.630
you take their product.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.850
So what we see is,
over every interval,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.159
when you go from 2 to 3,
first of all, the integral

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:06.700
from 2 to 3 is
clearly the same thing

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.500
as the integral from 0 to 1.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.520
Both functions look
identical over that interval.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.630
But it will also be the
same as going from 1 to 2,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.440
because it's
completely symmetric.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.530
When you take the
products of the function,

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.645
that function will be completely
symmetric around this axis.

00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:24.020
So the integral
from here to here

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.070
will be the same as the
integral from there to there.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.300
So with that said, we can
rewrite this thing over here.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.510
So what we want to evaluate,
pi squared over 10 times

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:43.260
the integral from negative 10
to 10 of f of x cosine of pi x,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.130
using the logic we
just talked about.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.020
This is going to be
the same thing as being

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:57.010
equal to pi squared over 10
times the integral from 0 to 1,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.060
but 20 times that,
because we have

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.060
20 integers between
negative 10 and 10.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.580
We have 20 intervals
of length 1.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:10.596
So times 20 times the
integral from 0 to 1

00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:16.860
of f of x cosine of pi x dx.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.612
I forgot to write
the dx over there.

00:08:18.612 --> 00:08:20.070
I want to make sure
you understand,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.290
because this is really the
hard part of the problem,

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.560
just realizing that the integral
over this interval is just 1/20

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.606
of the whole thing, because over
every interval, from 0 to 1,

00:08:28.606 --> 00:08:30.730
the integral is going to
evaluate to the same thing

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.188
as going from 1 to 2, which
will be the same thing as going

00:08:33.188 --> 00:08:35.897
from 2 to 3, or going from
negative 2 to negative 1.

00:08:35.897 --> 00:08:37.480
So instead of doing
the whole interval

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.896
from negative 10
to 10, we're just

00:08:38.896 --> 00:08:42.210
doing 20 times the
interval from 0 to 1.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.070
From negative 10 to 10, there's
a difference of 20 here.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.370
So we're multiplying by 20.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.850
And this simplifies
it a good bit.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.810
First of all, this part
over here simplifies to 20

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.270
divided by 10 is 2.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.610
So it's 2 pi squared.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.400
So it becomes 2 pi
squared-- that's just

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.250
this part over here-- times
the integral from 0 to 1.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.340
Now, from 0 to 1,
what is f of x?

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.890
Well, we just figured out,
from 0 to 1, f of x is just 1

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:08.720
minus x.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.190
f of x is just 1 minus x
from 0 to 1 times cosine

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.040
of pi x, cosine of pi x dx.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.360
And now we just have to evaluate
this integral right over here.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.830
So let's do that.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.050
So 1 minus x times
cosine of pi x

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:32.500
is the same thing as cosine of
pi x minus x cosine of pi x.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:38.842
Now, this right here,
well, let's just

00:09:38.842 --> 00:09:40.300
focus on taking
the antiderivative.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.280
This is pretty easy.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.946
But let's try to do
this one, because it

00:09:42.946 --> 00:09:44.920
seems a little bit
more complicated.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:52.670
So let's take the antiderivative
of x cosine of pi x dx.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.620
And what should jump
in your mind is,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.829
well, this isn't that simple.

00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:57.786
But if I were able to
take the derivative of x,

00:09:57.786 --> 00:09:58.620
that would simplify.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.745
It's very easy to take the
antiderivative of cosine

00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:03.380
of pi x without making
it more complicated.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.970
So maybe integration by parts.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.720
And remember,
integration by parts

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.300
tells us that the integral--
I'll write it up here--

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:20.097
the integral of udv is equal to
uv minus the integral of vdu.

00:10:20.097 --> 00:10:21.180
And we'll apply that here.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.530
But I've done many, many videos
where I prove this and show

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.050
examples of exactly
what that means.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.262
But let's apply it
right over here.

00:10:29.262 --> 00:10:30.720
And in general,
we're going to take

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.590
the derivative of
whatever the u thing is.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.060
So we want u to be
something that's

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:36.000
simpler when I take
the derivative.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.434
And then we're going to take
the antiderivative of dv.

00:10:38.434 --> 00:10:40.850
So we want something that does
not become more complicated

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.655
when I take the antiderivative.

00:10:42.655 --> 00:10:44.030
So the thing that
becomes simpler

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.730
when I take this
derivative is x.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:49.380
So if I set u is
equal to x, then

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.110
clearly du is equal to just dx.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.890
Or you say du dx is equal to 1.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.180
So du is equal to dx.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.500
And then dv is going
to be the rest of this.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.060
This whole thing over
here is going to be dv.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:12.660
dv is equal to cosine pi x dx.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.210
And so v would just
be the antiderivative

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:21.990
of this with respect to x.
v is going to be equal to 1

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.550
over pi sine of pi x.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.930
If I took the derivative here,
derivative of the inside,

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.000
you get a pi, times 1
over pi, cancels out.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.460
Derivative of sine of pi
x becomes cosine of pi x.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.710
So that's our u,
that's our v. This

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:44.050
is going to be equal to u times
v. So it's equal to x, this x

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.030
times this.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:56.670
So x over pi sine of pi x
minus the integral of v,

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:03.140
which is 1 over pi
sine of pi x du.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.890
du is just dx.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.400
And this is pretty
straightforward.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.150
The antiderivative of sine of
pi x is 1 over pi or negative 1

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.746
over pi cosine of pi x.

00:12:13.746 --> 00:12:15.120
And you could take
the derivative

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.690
if you don't believe me.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:17.882
You could do u substitution.

00:12:17.882 --> 00:12:20.090
But hopefully you can start
to do these in your head,

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:22.040
especially if you're going to
take the IIT joint entrance

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.500
exam.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.875
So this whole
expression is going

00:12:23.875 --> 00:12:25.360
to be, this part
over here is going

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:33.150
to be x over pi sine of pi x.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.170
And then this over here
is going to be-- well,

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.080
you have the antiderivative
of sine of pi

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.150
x is negative 1 over
pi cosine of pi x.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.450
The negatives cancel out.

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:48.230
So you have plus, and then
the 1 over pi times 1 over pi,

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:53.287
1 over pi squared
cosine of pi x.

00:12:53.287 --> 00:12:54.870
That's the antiderivative
right there.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:55.661
And you can verify.

00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:58.410
Derivative of cosine
of pi x is going

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.185
to be negative pi sine of x.

00:13:01.185 --> 00:13:02.580
One pi will cancel out here.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.100
You get a negative sign, and
then you have sine of pi x.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.600
So this is the
antiderivative of that.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.580
And so if we want
the antiderivative

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.770
of this whole thing
right over here,

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.630
this is what we
care about from 0

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.820
to 1 dx, the
antiderivative of cosine pi

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.280
x-- pretty straightforward.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.238
We've actually already
done it right over here.

00:13:23.238 --> 00:13:29.030
It is 1 over pi sine of pi x.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.250
That's this first term.

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.460
And the antiderivative
of x cosine pi x

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.650
is this thing over here.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.150
But we're subtracting it.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.320
So we'll put a negative
sign out front.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:48.940
So minus x over pi sine of pi x
minus 1 over pi squared cosine

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.975
of pi x.

00:13:49.975 --> 00:13:51.725
And of course, we took
the antiderivative,

00:13:51.725 --> 00:13:53.120
but it's a definite integral.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.000
We need to evaluate
it from 0 to 1.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.900
And we don't want to forget
that 2 pi squared out front.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.400
So let's evaluate this.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.260
So the first thing, we're going
to have 1 over pi sine of 1 pi.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.630
Sine of 1 pi is 0.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.070
So you have 0 minus 1 over
pi times sine of 1 pi again.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:25.400
That's again 0, minus 1 over
pi squared cosine of pi,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.480
or cosine of 1 pi.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.252
Cosine of pi is negative 1.

00:14:28.252 --> 00:14:30.390
Negative 1 times negative
1 over pi squared

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.270
is plus 1 over pi squared.

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.100
So we've evaluated it at 1.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.200
And from that, we want to
subtract it evaluated at 0.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.710
Sine of 0 is 0 minus--
this is clearly 0,

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.360
because you have a 0
out front-- minus 0.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.180
And then you have
minus cosine of 0.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.630
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.170
So then you have a
minus 1 over pi squared.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.400
And so this term, we could
just say this is a negative.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.030
These don't matter--
negative, positive, positive.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.140
And we're just left with
a 1 over pi squared plus 1

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:14.700
over pi squared, which is
equal to 2 over pi squared.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.440
That's what this
part evaluates to.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.900
It's 2 over pi squared.

00:15:20.394 --> 00:15:21.810
We can't forget
that we were going

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.105
to multiply this whole
thing times 2 pi squared.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.370
That's this thing
out front here.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.650
And so the pi squared
cancels out the pi squared.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:36.330
We're left with 2 times
2, which is equal to 4.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:37.772
And we're done.

00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:39.480
This thing that looked
pretty complicated

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.392
just evaluates out to 4.
