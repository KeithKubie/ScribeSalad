00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.149
Hi there. I'm John Green, you're watching
Crash Course World History, and today we're

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.990
going to talk about "Iraq" No, you purportedly
smart globe. We're going to talk about Mesopotamia.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.769
I love Mesopotamia because it helped create
two of my favorite things: Writing and taxes.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.519
Why do I like taxes? Because before taxes,
the only certainty was death.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.970
Mr. Green. Mr. Green, did you know that you're
referencing Mark Twain?

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.689
I'm not referencing Mark Twain, me from
the past, I'm referencing Benjamin Franklin,

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.179
who was probably himself quoting the unfortunately
named playwright Christopher Bullock. Listen.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.100
You may be smart, kid, but I've been smart
longer. By the way, today's illustration

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.969
points out that an eye for an eye leaves the
whole world monocular.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:47.780
[theme music]

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.460
So 5,000 years ago in the land meso, or between,
the Tigris and Euphrates potomoi, or rivers,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.800
cities started popping up much like they had
in our old friend the Indus River valley.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.000
These early Mesopotamian cities engaged in
a form of socialism, where farmers contributed

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.250
their crops to public storehouses out of which
workers, like metalworkers or builders or

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.230
male models or whatever—would be paid uniform
"wages" in grain. So, basically—

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.220
MR GREEN MR GREEN WERE THERE REALLY MALE
MODELS? CAN YOU DO BLUE STEEL?

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.369
Oh younger version of myself, how I hate you.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.500
Oh the humiliation I suffer for you
people... that was my best Blue Steel.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.460
That was as close as I can get.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.860
So anyway, if you lived in a city, you could
be something other than a shepherd, and thanks

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.280
to this proto-socialism you could be reasonably
sure that you'd eat--

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.039
STAN, Is there any way we could get another
globe in here? I feel like this shot is inadequately

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:42.920
globed.
Yes, much better.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.240
You know you can tell the quality of the historian
by the number of his or her globes.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.460
But even though you could give up your flock,
a lot of people didn't want to.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.020
One of the legacies of Mesopotamia is the
enduring conflict between country and city.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.539
You see this explored a lot in some of our
greatest art such as

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.130
The Beverly Hillbillies and Deliverance,
and the showdown between Enkidu and Gilgamesh

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240
in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh is one
of the oldest known works of literature and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.130
I'm not gonna spoil it for you—
there's a link to the poem in the video

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.900
info—but suffice it to say that in the showdown
between country and city, the city wins.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.210
So what were these city states like? Well,
let's take a look at one such city-state,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.140
Gilgamesh's home town of Uruk, in the Thought
Bubble:

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.820
Uruk was a walled city with an extensive canal system
and several monumental temples, called ziggurats.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.460
The priests of these temples initially had
all the power, because they were able to communicate

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.140
directly with the gods.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.890
That was a useful talent, because Mesopotamian
gods were moody and frankly pretty mean—like,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.680
according to Gilgamesh they once got mad at
us because we were making too much noise while

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.890
they were trying to sleep so they decided
to destroy all of humanity with a flood.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.090
The Tigris and Euphrates are decent as rivers
go, but Mesopotamia is no Indus Valley, with

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.090
its on-schedule flooding and easy irrigation.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.000
A lot of slave labor was needed to make the
Tigris and Euphrates useful for irrigation;

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.190
they're difficult to navigate and flood
unpredictably and violently. Violent, unpredictable,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.540
and difficult to navigate: Oh, Tigris and Euphrates,
how you remind me of my college girlfriend.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.220
So I mean given that the region tends to yo-yo
between devastating flood and horrible drought,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.270
it follows that one would believe that the
gods are kind of random and capricious, and

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:24.220
that any priests who might be able to lead rituals that
placate those gods would be very useful individuals.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.100
But about 1000 years after the first temples
we find in cities like Uruk, a rival structure

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.480
begins to show up, the palace.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.020
The responsibility for the well-being and
success of the social order was shifting from gods

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.600
to people, a power shift that will seesaw throughout
human history until...um, probably forever actually.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.200
But in another development we'll see again,
these kings, who probably started out as military

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.280
leaders or really rich landowners, took on
a quasi-religious role.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.510
How? Often by engaging in "sacred marriage"
-- specifically skoodilypooping with the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.620
high priestess of the city's temple.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.550
So the priests were overtaken by kings, who
soon declared themselves priests.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.520
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So how do we know
that these kings were skoodilypooping with

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.240
lady priests? Because they made a skoodilypooping
tape and put it on the internet. No, because

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.700
there's a written record. Mesopotamia gave
us writing, specifically a form of writing

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.459
called cuneiform, which was initially created
not to like woo lovers or whatever but to

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.729
record transactions like how many bushels
of wheat were exchanged for how many goats.

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.930
I'm not kidding, by the way; a lot of cuneiform
is about wheat and goats.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.990
I don't think you can overestimate the importance
of writing but let's just make three points here:

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:37.039
1. Writing and reading are things that not
everyone can do. So they create a class distinction,

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.240
one that in fact survives to this day. Foraging
social orders were relatively egalitarian;

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.729
but the Mesopotamians had slaves and they
played this metaphorically resonant sport

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.050
that was like polo except instead of riding
on horses you rode on other people.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.510
And written language played an important role
in widening the gap between classes.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.520
2. Once writing enters the picture, you have actual
history instead of just a lot of guesswork &amp; archaeology.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.150
3. Without writing, I would not have a job,
so I'd like to personally thank Mesopotamia

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.509
for making it possible for me to work while
reclining in my lay-z-boy.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.639
So why did this writing happen in Mesopotamia?
Well the fertile crescent, while it is fertile,

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:18.110
is lacking the pretty much everything else.
In order to get metal for tools or stone for

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.110
sculptures or wood for burning, Mesopotamia
had to trade. This trading eventually led

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.689
Mesopotamia to develop the world's first
territorial kingdom, which will become very

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.979
important and will eventually culminate in
some extraordinarily inbred Hapsburgs.

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.520
So the city state period in Mesopotamia ended
around 2,000 BCE, probably because drought

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.990
and a shift in the course of rivers led to
pastoral nomads coming in and conquering the

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.939
environmentally weakened cities. And then
the nomads settled into cities of their own

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:48.569
as nomads almost always will unless—wait
for it—

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:50.929
...You are the Mongols.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.060
These new Mesopotamian city states were similar
to their predecessors in that they had temples

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.779
and writing and their own self-glorifying stories
but they were different in some important ways.

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:04.789
First, that early proto-socialism was replaced
by something that looked a lot like private

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.520
enterprise, where people could produce as
much as they would like as long as they gave

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.169
a cut, also known as taxes to the government.
We talk a lot of smack about taxes but it

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:16.069
turns out they're pretty important to creating
stable social orders.

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.440
Things were also different politically because
the dudes who'd been the tribal chiefs became

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.719
like full-blown kings, who tried to extend
their power outside of cities and also tried

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.939
to pass on their power to their sons.

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:30.779
The most famous of these early monarchs is
Hammurabi or as I remember him from my high

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:35.669
school history class, "The Hammer of Abi".
Hammurabi ruled the new kingdom of Babylon

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.789
from 1792 BCE to 1750 BCE.

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.980
Hammurabi's main claim to fame is his famous
law code which established everything from like

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.240
the wages of ox drivers to the fact that the punishment
for taking an eye should be having an eye taken.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.860
Hammurabi's law code could be pretty insanely
harsh. Like if a builder builds a shoddy building

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:59.680
and then the owner's son dies in a collapse,
the punishment for that is the execution of

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.460
the builder's son. The kid's like, that's not fair! I'm
just a kid. What did I do? You should kill my dad.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.680
All of which is to say that Hammurabi's
law code gives a new meaning to the phrase

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.220
tough on crime, but it did introduce the presumption
of innocence. And in

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:17.920
the law code Hammurabi tried to portray himself in two
roles that should sound familiar: shepherd and father.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.939
"[I am] the shepherd who brings peace. My
benevolent shade was spread over the city,

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:28.159
I held the peoples of Sumer and Akkad safely
on my lap."

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.140
So again we see the authority for protection
of the social order shifting to men, not gods,

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.400
which is important, but don't worry, it'll
shift back.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.879
Even though the territorial kingdoms like
Babylon were more powerful than any cities

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:42.469
that had come before, and even though Babylon
was probably the world's most populous city

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:47.259
during Hammurabi's rule, it wasn't actually
that powerful, and keeping with the pattern

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:50.279
it was soon taken over by the formerly-nomadic
Kassites.

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:54.779
The thing about Territorial kingdoms is that
they relied on the poorest people to pay taxes,

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:59.729
and provide labor and serve in the army, all
of which made you not like your king very

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:04.849
much so if you saw any nomadic invaders coming
by you might just be like "Hey nomadic invaders!

00:08:04.849 --> 00:08:07.589
Come on in; you seem better than the last
guy."

00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:11.279
Well, that was the case until the Assyrians
came along, anyway. The Assyrians have a deserved

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:15.719
reputation for being the brutal bullies of
Mesopotamia. But the Assyrians did give us an

00:08:15.719 --> 00:08:20.740
early example of probably the most important
and durable form of political organization

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.490
in world history, and also Star Wars history,
the Empire.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.840
The biggest problem with empires is that by definition

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.439
they're diverse and multi-ethnic,
which makes them hard to unify.

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:35.910
So beginning around 911 BCE, the neo-Assyrian
Empire grew from its hometowns of Ashur and

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.410
Nineveh to include the whole of Mesopotamia,
the Eastern Coast of the Mediterranean and

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:45.960
even, by 680 BCE, Egypt! They did
this thanks to the most brutal, terrifying

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:51.340
and efficient army the world had ever seen.
More adjectives describing my college girlfriend.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.780
For one thing the army was a meritocracy.
Generals weren't chosen based on who their

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:58.690
dads were, they were chosen based on if they
were good at Generalling.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:02.040
Stan, is generalling a word? [pauses, two
thumbs up w answer] It is!

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.880
Also, they were super mean. Like they would
deport hundreds of thousands of people to

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.250
separate them from their history and their
familes and also moved skilled workers around

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:14.390
where they were most needed.Also the neo-Assyrians
loved to find would-be rebels and lop off

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.310
their appendages. Particularly their noses
for some reason. And there was your standard

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:23.350
raping and pillaging and torture, all of which
was done in the name of Ashur, the great god

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.940
of the neo-Assyrians whose divine regent was
the King.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.400
Ashur, through the King, kept the world going,
and as long as conquest continued the world

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.200
would not end. But if conquest ever stopped,
the world would end and there would be rivers

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.260
of blood and weeping and gnashing of teeth.
You know how apocalypses go.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.150
The Assyrians spread this world view with
propaganda like monumental architecture and

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.700
readings about how awesome the king was at
public festivals, all of which were designed

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.260
to inspire awe in the Empire's subjects.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:55.960
Oh that reminds me, ITS TIME FOR THE OPEN
LETTER.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.950
An Open Letter to the Word Awesome:

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.680
But first lets see what's in the Secret
Compartment today. Oh, Stan is

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.410
this yellow cake uranium? You never find that
in Mesopotamia...

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:10.790
Dear Awesome, I love you. Like most contemporary
English speakers in fact, I probably love you a little

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:16.820
too much. The thing about you, awesome, is that
awesome is just so awesomely awesome at being

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.230
awesome. So we lose track of what you really
mean, awesome: You're not just cool, you're

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:28.380
terrifying and wonderful. You're knees-buckling,
chest-tightening, fearful encounters with

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:33.810
something radically other- something that
we know could both crush and bless us. That

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.850
is awe, and I apologize for having watered
you down.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.690
But seriously, you're awesome.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.320
Best wishes,
John Green

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.580
So what happened to the Assyrians? Well, first
they extended their empire beyond their roads,

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.500
making administration impossible.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.370
But maybe even more importantly, when your
whole world view is based on the idea that

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:56.320
the apocalypse will come if you ever lose
a battle, and then you lose one battle, the

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:01.710
whole world view just blows up. That eventually
happened and in 612 BCE, the city of Nineveh

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.520
was finally conquered, and the neo-Assyrian
Empire had come to its end.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.480
But the idea of Empire was just getting started.
Next week we'll talk about mummies — oh,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.270
I have to talk about other things too? Crap,
I only want to talk about mummies. Anyway,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.610
we'll be talking about [tapping stylus to
talking globe replying Sudan] No! Dangit!

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.410
We'll actually be talking about [taps globe
to reply Egypt] Thank you, Smart Globe.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.510
See you next week.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.020
Today's episode of Crash Course was produced and

Johnson. The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer with some help from myself.

and our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.220
Last week's phrase of the week was "Better
Boyfriend." If you want to take a guess

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.900
at this week's phrase of the week, you can
do so in Comments where you can also suggest

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.280
new phrases of the week.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:46.000
And if you have any questions about today's
show, leave them in Comments and our team

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:49.090
of semi-professional quasi-historians will
endeavor to answer them.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:52.970
Thanks for watching and as we say in my hometown:
Don't forget to be awesome.
