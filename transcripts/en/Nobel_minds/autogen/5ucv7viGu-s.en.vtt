blessed with the lucky chance of knowing
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830
blessed with the lucky chance of knowing
that you wanted to be a biologist or a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840
that you wanted to be a biologist or a
 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.130

chemist from quite early very yeah very

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
chemist from quite early very yeah very
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.310
chemist from quite early very yeah very
very early on it was entirely because i

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
very early on it was entirely because i
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.510
very early on it was entirely because i
think i was sort of scientifically

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
think i was sort of scientifically
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.830
think i was sort of scientifically
minded but I you know and I can't really

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840
minded but I you know and I can't really
 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.979
minded but I you know and I can't really
remember it's a construct now but I did

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989
remember it's a construct now but I did
 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.350
remember it's a construct now but I did
very well in a biology exam when I was I

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
very well in a biology exam when I was I
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.810
very well in a biology exam when I was I
think 11 years old or something like

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
think 11 years old or something like
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.060
think 11 years old or something like
that and I came out somehow 13th in the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
that and I came out somehow 13th in the
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.530
that and I came out somehow 13th in the
whole school in those days you know you

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540
whole school in those days you know you
 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.630
whole school in those days you know you
everybody took the same science exam

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
everybody took the same science exam
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.630
everybody took the same science exam
whether you were seven or what was a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
whether you were seven or what was a
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.400
whether you were seven or what was a
1230 99 and so you knew exactly when I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
1230 99 and so you knew exactly when I
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.780
1230 99 and so you knew exactly when I
was kind of in the middle of that point

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790
was kind of in the middle of that point
 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.880
was kind of in the middle of that point
you know no and I did I did very well

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
you know no and I did I did very well
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.670
you know no and I did I did very well
and I realized that it just we know it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
and I realized that it just we know it
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.640
and I realized that it just we know it
came very naturally to me and I also

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
came very naturally to me and I also
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.890
came very naturally to me and I also
knew I mean another thing I had a great

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
knew I mean another thing I had a great
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.539
knew I mean another thing I had a great

Peter pewsey and he was so much better

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
Peter pewsey and he was so much better
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.070
Peter pewsey and he was so much better
at physics than I was you know I liked

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
at physics than I was you know I liked
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.630
at physics than I was you know I liked
physics I would have loved to been good

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
physics I would have loved to been good
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.010
physics I would have loved to been good
at physics but the fact of the matter

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
at physics but the fact of the matter
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.859
at physics but the fact of the matter
was I just wasn't you know Peter was

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
was I just wasn't you know Peter was
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.350
was I just wasn't you know Peter was
zoomed ahead you know a man's gotta know

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
zoomed ahead you know a man's gotta know
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.840
zoomed ahead you know a man's gotta know
his limitations dumb so I think he's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
his limitations dumb so I think he's
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.310
his limitations dumb so I think he's
terribly important to know what you're

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
terribly important to know what you're
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.770
terribly important to know what you're
good at and what you're not

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.840
