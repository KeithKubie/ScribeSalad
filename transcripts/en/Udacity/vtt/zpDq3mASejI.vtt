00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's do this in stages.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's program a function f(n) that takes as an input number of coconuts,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and that outputs the number of coconuts after 1 was given to the monkey

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and a 5th of those were removed.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's test it with the number 96.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's your turn to program this function, and when you hit the run button,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
we can look at the results, which for 96 I'd like to be 76.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If we subtract 1 from 96, you have 95,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and if you know subtract a 5th of those, you end up with 76.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So please insert your function here to see 76 down here.
