00:00:00.641 --> 00:00:02.844
- [Voiceover] We have two
inequalities here, the first one

00:00:02.844 --> 00:00:07.116
says that x plus two is
less than or equal to two x.

00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:10.895
This one over here in I guess
this light-purple-mauve color,

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:15.057
is three x plus four
is greater than five x.

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:17.826
Over here we have four numbers
and what I want to do in this

00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:21.507
video is test whether
any of these four numbers

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:24.884
satisfy either of these inequalities.

00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:26.957
I encourage you to pause this video and

00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:29.912
try these numbers out, does
zero satisfy this inequality?

00:00:29.912 --> 00:00:32.353
Does it satisfy this one?
Does one satisfy this one?

00:00:32.353 --> 00:00:33.708
Does it satisfy that one?

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:35.797
I encourage you to try
these four numbers out

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:38.949
on these two inequalities.

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.228
Assuming you have tried that, let's work

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:42.957
through this together.

00:00:42.957 --> 00:00:47.935
Let's say, if we try out
zero on this inequality

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:50.616
right over here, let's substitute

00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:53.283
x with zero.

00:00:53.283 --> 00:00:57.554
So, we'll have zero plus two needs to

00:00:57.554 --> 00:01:02.329
be less than or equal to two times zero.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.071
Is that true?

00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:07.235
Well, on the left hand side,
this is two needs to be

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:09.965
less than or equal to zero.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:12.359
Is that true, is two less
than or equal to zero?

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.743
No, two is larger than zero.

00:01:14.743 --> 00:01:18.900
So this is not going to be
true, this does not satisfy

00:01:20.304 --> 00:01:21.822
the left hand side
inequality, let's see if it

00:01:21.822 --> 00:01:26.200
satisfies this inequality over here.

00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:31.936
In order to satisfy it,
three times zero plus four

00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:35.651
needs to be greater than five times zero.

00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:39.495
Well three times zero is just
zero, five times zero is zero.

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:43.915
So four needs to be greater
than zero, which is true.

00:01:43.915 --> 00:01:47.766
So it does satisfy

00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:50.459
this inequality right over here so zero

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.525
does satisfy this inequality.

00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:55.233
Let's try out one.

00:01:56.902 --> 00:02:01.246
To satisfy this one, one plus
two needs to be less than

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:03.266
or equal to two.

00:02:03.518 --> 00:02:06.477
One plus two is three, is three
less than or equal than two?

00:02:06.477 --> 00:02:09.200
No, three is larger than two.

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:13.297
This does not satisfy
the left hand inequality.

00:02:13.297 --> 00:02:16.600
What about the right hand
inequality right over here?

00:02:17.218 --> 00:02:21.556
Three times one plus four
needs to be greater than

00:02:21.556 --> 00:02:24.176
five times one.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.392
So three times one is three, plus four.

00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:31.926
So seven needs to be greater
than five, well that's true.

00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:35.003
Both zero and one satisfy
three x plus four is greater

00:02:35.003 --> 00:02:38.707
than five x, neither of them
satisfy x plus two is less than

00:02:38.707 --> 00:02:41.502
or equal to two x.

00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:44.262
Now let's go to the two.

00:02:44.262 --> 00:02:46.701
I know it's getting a
little bit unaligned,

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:49.973
but I'll just do it all in the
same color so you can tell.

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:54.003
Let's try out two here, two
plus two needs to be less than

00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:56.333
or equal to two times two.

00:02:56.474 --> 00:02:59.744
Four needs to be less
than or equal to four.

00:02:59.744 --> 00:03:01.372
Well four is equal to
four and it just has to be

00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:04.558
less than or equal, so this satisfies.

00:03:04.558 --> 00:03:07.439
This satisfies this inequality.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.200
What about this purple inequality?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.687
Let's see, three times
two plus four needs to be

00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:17.064
greater than five times two.

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:21.265
Three times two is six plus four is ten,

00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:24.266
needs to be greater than 10.

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:27.090
10 is equal to 10, it's
not greater than 10.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.394
It does not satisfy this inequality.

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:34.814
If this was a greater than or equal to

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:37.211
it would have satisfied but it's not.

00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:40.400
10 is not greater than 10.

00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:42.070
It would satisfy greater than or equal to

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.869
because 10 is equal to 10.

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.104
So two satisfies the left hand one but not

00:03:46.104 --> 00:03:47.833
the right hand one.

00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:50.200
Let's try out five.

00:03:52.486 --> 00:03:56.725
Five plus two needs to
be less than or equal

00:03:56.725 --> 00:03:59.908
to two times five, once
again everywhere we see

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:02.033
an x, we replace it with a five.

00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:05.499
Seven needs to be less
than or equal to 10.

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:09.289
Which is absolutely true,
seven is less than 10.

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:11.662
So it satisfies less than or equal to.

00:04:11.662 --> 00:04:14.397
Five satisfies this
inequality and what you're

00:04:14.397 --> 00:04:16.123
probably noticing now is
that an inequality can

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:18.180
have many numbers that satisfy.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.113
In fact they sometimes will
have nothing that satisfies it

00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:23.546
and sometimes they might
have an infinite number of

00:04:23.546 --> 00:04:26.721
numbers that satisfy it and
you see that right over here.

00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:29.025
We're just testing out a few numbers.

00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:31.725
For this left one, zero
and one didn't work,

00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:33.329
two and five did work.

00:04:33.329 --> 00:04:36.352
This right one, zero and
one worked, two didn't work.

00:04:36.352 --> 00:04:38.246
Let's see what five does.

00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:41.616
In order for five to
satisfy it, three times x.

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:45.716
Now we're gonna try x being five.

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:49.181
Three times five plus four
needs to be greater than

00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:51.512
five times five.

00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:55.467
Three times five is fifteen,
fifteen plus four is nineteen.

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:59.704
Nineteen is to be greater
than 25, it is not.

00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:02.603
So five does not satisfy

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:05.466
this inequality right over here.

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:08.067
Anyway, hopefully you found that fun.
