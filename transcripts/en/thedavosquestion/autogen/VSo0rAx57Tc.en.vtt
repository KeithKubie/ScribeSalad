we've worked on a model of what we are

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750
we've worked on a model of what we are
 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.249
we've worked on a model of what we are
calling prisons precision medicine which

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
calling prisons precision medicine which
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.240
calling prisons precision medicine which
means medicine based on mechanistic

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250
means medicine based on mechanistic
 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.450
means medicine based on mechanistic
aspects that the science is bringing

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460
aspects that the science is bringing
 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.680
aspects that the science is bringing
forward in an attempt to predict how the

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690
forward in an attempt to predict how the
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.519
forward in an attempt to predict how the
science is going to change medicine we

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
science is going to change medicine we
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.429
science is going to change medicine we
made assumptions about how the science

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439
made assumptions about how the science
 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.410
made assumptions about how the science
will change and then proceeded to work

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
will change and then proceeded to work
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.459
will change and then proceeded to work
through a model that on the basis of

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469
through a model that on the basis of
 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.410
through a model that on the basis of
those assumptions how will that affect

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
those assumptions how will that affect
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.310
those assumptions how will that affect
the health system other patients will be

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
the health system other patients will be
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.970
the health system other patients will be
affected how the payers and providers

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
affected how the payers and providers
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.240
affected how the payers and providers
will need to respond and so forth and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250
will need to respond and so forth and
 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.180
will need to respond and so forth and
the model really is based on I think the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
the model really is based on I think the
 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310
the model really is based on I think the
next five to ten years of what will

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
next five to ten years of what will
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.170
next five to ten years of what will
Obama in the healthcare system it's

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180
Obama in the healthcare system it's
 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.970
Obama in the healthcare system it's
relatively complex going to be difficult

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
relatively complex going to be difficult
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.310
relatively complex going to be difficult
to implement a lot of challenges and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
to implement a lot of challenges and
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.850
to implement a lot of challenges and
risks but i think it's we're all

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860
risks but i think it's we're all
 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.020
risks but i think it's we're all
convinced it's the future of medicine

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
convinced it's the future of medicine
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.219
convinced it's the future of medicine
and therefore the future of the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
and therefore the future of the
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.310
and therefore the future of the
healthcare systems and i think it will

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320
healthcare systems and i think it will
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.399
healthcare systems and i think it will
be quite exciting and no matter what

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
be quite exciting and no matter what
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.010
be quite exciting and no matter what
happens it's clear that this is what's

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
happens it's clear that this is what's
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.409
happens it's clear that this is what's
coming
