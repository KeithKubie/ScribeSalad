world who's ever been cured of AIDS and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
world who's ever been cured of AIDS and
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.600
world who's ever been cured of AIDS and
that's Timothy brown and he was cured

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
that's Timothy brown and he was cured
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.160
that's Timothy brown and he was cured
because he got a bone marrow transplant

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
because he got a bone marrow transplant
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.760

from somebody who had a genetic mutation
 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.420
from somebody who had a genetic mutation
that that doesn't allow aids to

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
that that doesn't allow aids to
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.700
that that doesn't allow aids to
proliferate in the body and so

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
proliferate in the body and so
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.680
proliferate in the body and so
researchers are now working on how they

cells to try to cure AIDS he actually
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.350
cells to try to cure AIDS he actually
just had a really exciting announcement

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
just had a really exciting announcement
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.830
just had a really exciting announcement
recently where he used gene therapy to

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
recently where he used gene therapy to
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.560
recently where he used gene therapy to
cure leukemia what he did was he took

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
cure leukemia what he did was he took
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.990
cure leukemia what he did was he took
out some of the immune cells from the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000
out some of the immune cells from the
 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.710
out some of the immune cells from the
cancer patients tweaked them the t-cells

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
cancer patients tweaked them the t-cells
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.240
cancer patients tweaked them the t-cells
he tweaked them so that they would

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
he tweaked them so that they would
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.880
he tweaked them so that they would
notice cancer as an infection because

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
notice cancer as an infection because
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.260
notice cancer as an infection because
the problem with cancer is that your

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
the problem with cancer is that your
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.850
the problem with cancer is that your
body doesn't realize it's in a foreign

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
body doesn't realize it's in a foreign
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.649
body doesn't realize it's in a foreign
invader because it's part of your system

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
invader because it's part of your system
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.170
invader because it's part of your system
and it doesn't attack it and so what dr.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
and it doesn't attack it and so what dr.
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.590
and it doesn't attack it and so what dr.
June did was he tweaked the immune cells

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
June did was he tweaked the immune cells
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.030
June did was he tweaked the immune cells
of these patients so that they would

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
of these patients so that they would
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.120
of these patients so that they would
notice the cancer then rhian out in any

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
notice the cancer then rhian out in any
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.950
notice the cancer then rhian out in any
did that in the lab then he rejected

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
did that in the lab then he rejected
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.899
did that in the lab then he rejected
them into the patients and the patients

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
them into the patients and the patients
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.450
them into the patients and the patients
got huge fevers and reacted essentially

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
got huge fevers and reacted essentially
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.420
got huge fevers and reacted essentially
as if they had a big infection and after

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
as if they had a big infection and after
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.340
as if they had a big infection and after
a couple of weeks all of their cancer

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
a couple of weeks all of their cancer
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.139
a couple of weeks all of their cancer
was gone because their immune systems

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
was gone because their immune systems
 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.810
was gone because their immune systems
had had fought it off and so that's one

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
had had fought it off and so that's one
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.150
had had fought it off and so that's one
example of how scientists might be able

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
example of how scientists might be able
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.020
example of how scientists might be able
to recode are

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
to recode are
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.380
to recode are
systems to fight off diseases sometimes

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390
systems to fight off diseases sometimes
 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.809
systems to fight off diseases sometimes
it can take a long time to go from the

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819
it can take a long time to go from the
 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.390
it can take a long time to go from the
lab to widespread use in society for

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400
lab to widespread use in society for
 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.309

instance tissue engineering is already
 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.770
instance tissue engineering is already
here I mean scientists have the ability

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780
here I mean scientists have the ability
 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.410
here I mean scientists have the ability
to grow brand new human organs like

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420
to grow brand new human organs like
 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.050
to grow brand new human organs like
tracheas and bladders and blood vessels

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060
tracheas and bladders and blood vessels
 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.150
tracheas and bladders and blood vessels
in the lab it can be done with your own

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160
in the lab it can be done with your own
 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.479
in the lab it can be done with your own

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489
adult stem cells it's not in widespread
 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.850
adult stem cells it's not in widespread
use right now and how long will that

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860
use right now and how long will that
 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.460
use right now and how long will that
take you know that that's up to the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470
take you know that that's up to the
 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.410
take you know that that's up to the
regulators and and not only that but

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420
regulators and and not only that but
 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.600

how to use these techniques and so it
 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.590
how to use these techniques and so it
does actually take take a long time

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600
does actually take take a long time
 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.229
does actually take take a long time

you read it and you say oh that's great

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700
you read it and you say oh that's great
 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.340
you read it and you say oh that's great
and then you forget about it but if you

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350
and then you forget about it but if you
 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.140
and then you forget about it but if you
look around and you take all of those

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150
look around and you take all of those
 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.600
look around and you take all of those
stories and you put them together as as

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610
stories and you put them together as as
 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.850
stories and you put them together as as
I did and one in one big chapter you can

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860
I did and one in one big chapter you can
 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.160
I did and one in one big chapter you can
see a real clear picture of how the

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170
see a real clear picture of how the
 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.370
