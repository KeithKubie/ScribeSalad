00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.510
Most of the humor written with children in
mind is pretty on the nose.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.780
And while a lot of it is definitely funny,
sometimes the adults in the room get a little

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.780
bored.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.230
Parents almost never get the luxury of watching
a movie once, especially if it’s their kid’s

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.230
favorite.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.270
So, working with their audience in mind, writers
and animators will occasionally embed tiny

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.650
pieces of mature content into their work.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.550
When done correctly the jokes catch the attention
of the right people, but fly under the radar

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.219
of any youngsters who might be watching too.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:40.710
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Dirty Adult Jokes
Hidden In Popular Kids Movies.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.960
The Emperor’s New Groove
Wordplay is a great way to launch a joke right

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.390
over a kid’s head.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.829
And combining that with an innocent-looking
scene can take it to another level.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.350
In The Emperor’s New Groove, the lovable
Kronk spends a night in the great outdoors.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.329
And while kids may be laughing at the size
of his accommodations, everyone else is giggling

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.379
about what it really means to “pitch a tent.”

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.110
Sometimes the best place for a joke to hide
is in plain sight.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.310
Toy Story 3
There are certain situations where, if they’re

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.860
not careful, even adults are likely to miss
a dirty quip here and there.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.700
The Toy Story franchise is full of funny characters,
and some of them are fast-talkers.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.720
So there’s actually an abundance of sly
nods to the parents in the crowd, but some

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.000
of them are disguised as throwaway lines.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.810
For example, one scene in Toy Story 3 shows
the evil bear Lotso remove Mrs. Potato Head’s

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.930
mouth from her face.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.920
And in his protest, her husband shouts some
choice words at the burly villain.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.410
It happens so quickly that even some grown-ups
might miss it.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.120
But is very obvious in retrospect.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.450
Shrek
A few years ago, you’d be hard pressed to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.460
find a parent who hadn't seen all the Shrek
movies at least a dozen times over.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.580
The big green ogre muscled his way into living
rooms across the globe.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.710
Multiple sequels followed which led to a holiday
special, and even a spinoff film for the character

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.770
of Puss in Boots.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.530
Mercifully, the team behind the scenes included
a few doses of adult humor in the kid-friendly

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.530
franchise.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.530
And parents were thankful.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.080
First, the bad guy’s name is clearly an
allusion to the word “fuckwad.”

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.690
Plus, when Shrek and Donkey arrive at Farquaad’s
castle, they joke that maybe the royal uses

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.680
his home to distract from his small… family
jewels.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.120
Aladdin 3: Aladdin and the King of Thieves
Aladdin scored huge points for Disney when

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.510
it was released in 1992.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.629
And even though they were released straight
to video, the two sequels Return of Jafar

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.030
and King of Thieves were also well-received.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.910
Spoiler alert: it takes Aladdin and Jasmine
almost three whole movies before they get

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.910
married.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.269
And when they finally get the chance in the
third installment, the castle comes under

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.269
attack.

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.420
Thankfully for the characters, Genie is on
hand to help.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.170
And thankfully for the parents, that means
the quick-witted genius Robin Williams.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.230
Amidst all the chaos, the comedian spits out
a lightning-fast sex joke that maintains its

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.370
innocence so flawlessly, a lot of the parents
missed it too.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.920
Madagascar
Things change when you become a parent.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.739
Sleepless nights, hunger, and the sudden responsibility
of watching your mouth in front of an impressionable,

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:56.739
young brain.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.989
But at the end of the day, we’re all subject
to our instincts, and sometimes we just have

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:00.989
to swear.

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.250
Thankfully, there’s a way to be sneaky about
it.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.029
And in the 2005 movie Madagascar, Marty the
zebra shows us how.

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:09.139
After he and a few buddies escape from the
zoo, they find themselves on the island of

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.139
Madagascar.

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.700
After too long without a meal, his friend
Alex the lion gets so crazed with hunger that

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.090
he can’t control the instinct to hunt his
striped friend.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.730
When Marty realizes what’s about to happen,
he yells “sugar honey iced tea”.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.920
And you don’t need a degree in cryptology
to solve that anagram.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.920
(S.H.I.T.)

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.959
Hercules
Greek mythology is full of characters.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.870
And much like Game of Thrones, it can be hard
to keep all of them, and their storylines,

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.870
straight.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.249
Even then, there’s a lot of variation when
it comes to the stories themselves.

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:41.409
So its just expected that everyone who takes
on the subject matter will put their own spin

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:42.409
on it.

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.440
In 1997, Disney released their take on a story
of Hercules.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.749
And it has something for everyone, including
people who like their comedy low-brow.

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.980
Dirty minds should watch for a fight with
the centaur.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.590
After the beast gets walloped by Hercules,
his head swells into the shape of a.. well,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.590
you know.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.500
Like we said: something for everyone.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.010
Inside Out
Inside Out follows the story of a young girl

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.840
named Riley, who’s family moves across country
and leaves everything she knows behind.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.730
Told through the lens of psychology, the storytellers
turn emotions into characters.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.659
And use the girl’s mind as a landscape to
show how the change is affecting her personality.

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.060
Led by Joy, other emotions Sadness, Fear,
Anger, and Disgust also play a big part in

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.060
the film.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.970
Shortly after Riley sees their new house in
San Francisco, Fear wonders aloud about the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.360
city’s bear situation.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.690
And Anger’s response made more than a few
people chuckle.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.400
Bear is a slang word used in the LGBT community
that describes a particular body type.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400
Big and hairy.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.000
And given how central the city has been in
the gay rights movement, the line was definitely

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.220
a shout out.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.490
Frozen
Since its 2013 release, Frozen has become

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.770
one of Disney’s juggernauts.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.229
The tale of two sisters is the highest grossing
animated film in history.

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.490
The story is good, and the soundtrack is catchy,
even though we’ve all heard it too many

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.490
times.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.190
Thankfully, the writers reserved some of the
laughs for the grownups.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.250
And one scene sticks out above the rest.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.690
When Kristof is quizzing Anna about her love
life, he asks about her suitor’s shoe size.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.950
She might have shrugged the question off but
we’re willing to bet that most of the adults

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.340
in the room got a kick out of that one.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.590
Cars
If you’re in the public eye and good at

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.270
your job, chances are you have some fans.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.409
And that’s doubly true for racer Lightning
McQueen.

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:19.440
He lights up the track and is unstoppable
wherever he goes.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.400
People thought it would be tough to make something
like a car express emotions, but some cunning

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.150
animation proved all the naysayers wrong.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.860
There is one subtle gesture that only adults
will pick up on though.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.970
During an event, two sports-car groupies turn
on their high beams and the press goes wild

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.449
like girls on spring break.

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.650
Cars isn’t the first movie to compare a
woman’s chest to headlights, but it might

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:44.810
be the most subtle one.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.700
Zootopia
Since it’s release of March this year, Zootopia

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.190
has grossed over one billion dollars worldwide.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.169
Judy Hopps is a rabbit who’s always dreamed
of becoming a police officer.

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.120
Her city, Zootopia, is home to all different
animal species, but there has never been a

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.180
rabbit cop.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.430
After making her way through training, Judy
faces many obstacles.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.370
Audiences have spoken out about how the movie
is a mirror for issues society is facing today.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.169
One character describes another as “articulate”;
a callback to the word being used as a racist

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.910
backhanded compliment.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.449
And feminist scholars point to a scene where
everyone can reach their chair except Judy,

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.270
arguing the sequence is a metaphor for female
struggle in the workplace.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.590
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.990
