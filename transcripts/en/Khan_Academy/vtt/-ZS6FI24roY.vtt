00:00:00.475 --> 00:00:02.519
- In order for the audience to believe in

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:06.503
and be engaged by a
Shakespearean character,

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:10.798
they have to come across as
a real person on the stage.

00:00:10.798 --> 00:00:12.285
Or maybe we have no error.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:13.872
So you know when I read
that, when they said,

00:00:13.872 --> 00:00:17.030
"they have to come across as
a real person on the stage,"

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.771
the way that the sentence was constructed,

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.407
it looks like they're
referring to the audience.

00:00:20.407 --> 00:00:23.560
In order for the audience
to do this thing,

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.061
they, the audience, has to come across

00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:27.387
as a real person on the stage.

00:00:27.387 --> 00:00:28.526
Well that's not what
they're talking about.

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:30.511
They're really talking about the actors.

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.645
So this "they" here is confusing.

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:33.670
It could be...

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.544
Are they talking about the audience?

00:00:34.544 --> 00:00:37.421
Are they talking about
the characters on stage?

00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:40.279
So I would say the error
right here is in part C,

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:42.074
and I would change "they" to...

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.599
If I were editing this,

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:47.015
I would change this to "the actors."

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:50.391
"The actors" have to come across as a...

00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:56.317
You need to say "the
actors" have to come across,

00:00:56.317 --> 00:01:00.021
have to come across as real people,

00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:03.202
or you could say "the actor."

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:07.058
"The actor" has to come across

00:01:07.058 --> 00:01:09.083
as a real person on the stage.

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:10.151
So that would feel a lot better.

00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:12.967
In order for the audience to believe in

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.617
and be engaged by a
Shakespearean character...

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:16.330
And that's good.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.947
We're doing "a Shakespearean character,"

00:01:17.947 --> 00:01:19.770
not "Shakespearean characters."

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.534
So that's why it's good to do
the singular right over here.

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:25.204
"The actor" has to come across

00:01:25.204 --> 00:01:26.934
as a real person on the stage.

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:28.246
So this feels much better.

00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:30.092
And so I would definitely say

00:01:30.092 --> 00:01:32.493
the error was in part C.
