00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.790
This is the real deal.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.040
Whoa.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.210
This is the Jimi
Hendrix of hip hop.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.710
I keep on feeling
older and older

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.790
today, just so you guys now.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.540
[music playing]

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.620
Earlier, a guy came
in with an ancient coin

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.880
from the Roman Empire.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.790
He's asking $150,000 for this.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.500
So I called in my
buddy Dave, and he'll

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.250
let me know if I should
beware the Ides of March.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.080
DAVE: When you told me you had a
coin with two daggers and a cap

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.170
on it, I ran down here.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.920
RICK: It's like literally
a Game of Thrones

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.210
when this was going on.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.750
I mean, everybody
was vying for power.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.500
DAVE: It all boils
down to this coin.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.670
This is Brutus celebrating the
fact that he murdered Julius

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.420
Caesar on the Ides of March.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.330
OK, so the big question,
what do you think it's worth?

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.170
DAVE: Can I take a
closer look at it?

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.920
Absolutely.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.830
Thank you.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.000
[music playing]

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.750
This is the real deal.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.330
RICK: OK.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.210
DAVE: I think a collector
would be very happy to pay

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.750
about $125,000 for the coin.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.960
Thanks, man.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.960
DAVE: Best of luck.
Congratulations.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.880
RICK: I agree with Dave.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.960
It's an incredible coin.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750
It's like, uber, uber cool.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.540
And I would give
you $100,000 for it.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.290
I could come
down maybe to 140.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.290
RICK: I have to set it off.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.040
I have to get it capsulated.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.420
If I give you 110,000, I know
I will at least break even.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.750
I've got to have
more than that.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.250
110's it.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.460
I don't think I
can go below 140.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.290
If you change
your mind or have

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.580
really bad luck while you're
in town, come back and see me.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.120
I appreciate it.
Thank you.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830
RICK: OK, so we have
the headless horseman.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.000
[laughter]

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
CUSTOMER: No.
Drum roll.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.830
Whoa.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.620
So, is this George
Washington's too?

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.120
MAN 1: It is.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.500
It's a three-piece suit
that he acquired some time

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
in the mid 18th century.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.170
RICK: I'm just like, in awe.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.000
If I could go back and
have a cup of coffee

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.500
with just about anybody history,
it would probably be this guy.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.670
MAN 1: You just don't
see a piece of Americana

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.330
like that is very often.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.830
RICK: Does it have
a price on it?

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.420
MAN 2: I wouldn't sell
for less than $3 million.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.960
I'm going to go
think and contemplate

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.380
about this for a little bit.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.670
Can we meet up later?

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.830
- Absolutely.
- I'm back.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.880
You're back.
Good to see you.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.460
RICK: I've been offered items in
the millions of dollars before,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.210
but I've never really
considered them until now.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.880
The suit-- you asked
for $3 million,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880
but what's the best you can do?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.330
1.5?

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.670
No.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.170
I appreciate your
offer, but it's really

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.620
a major part of my collection.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.540
RICK: How about $2 million?

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.710
The best price--

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.000
absolute best price
would be 2.5 million.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.830
RICK: OK, and you're
firm with that?

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.620
Absolutely firm with that.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.080
I mean, OK, well I
guess the suit's out then.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.750
I'll talk to you soon, man.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.500
I didn't get the suit,
but you know what?

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.830
It didn't fit me anyway.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.750
I'm at a high end car
store here in Las Vegas,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.500
and I'm looking at the
1996 BMW that Tupac

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.830
was shot in over 20 years ago.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.880
Warwick's saying the car is
worth right around $200,000,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.420
but he's not a car guy.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.170
So I still have a few other
questions, some calling

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.420
in Bill, my car expert.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.080
BILL: This is an interesting
piece of history.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.420
We're talking about, it's one
car that signifies so much

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.830
in pop culture that took place.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.040
What happened to this
car changed history, Rick.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.750
BILL: To bring it up
to your day and age,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.250
this is the Jimi
Hendrix of hip hop.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.750
I keep on feeling
older and older

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.210
today, just so you guys know.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.960
My problem is, it's
a little weird.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.580
This was a car a celebrity got
shot and died a few days later.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.120
So in the car world, there's
the driveability factor.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.790
You can own a piece of
history and actually drive it,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.080
and it really won't
devalue it so much.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.540
But this car, because of
the connection to a crime

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.750
and a murder and all that
stuff, establishing that value

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.460
is the tough part.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.790
I think the right place, at the
right auction, this car, half

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.960
a million to a million bucks.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.620
Thanks man.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.080
All right.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.420
If Rick can come to a
deal and buy this car,

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.790
this is hands down the coolest
thing we've ever purchased.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.080
It's definitely the
closest thing we've

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.790
ever had a chance to purchase.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.580
RICK: How much do
you want for the car?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.120
We're actually
asking $1.5 million.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.290
Whoa.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.000
MAN 3: It's a big number.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.330
Yeah.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.750
A lot more than I'm
willing to pay for it,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.960
but I really appreciate it.
- No problem.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.290
Thank you very much.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.250
CHUMLEE: I can't believe that.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.670
Tupac.
