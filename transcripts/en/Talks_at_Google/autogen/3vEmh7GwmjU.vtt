[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.362
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:15.140
- Oh, pregnant women
smell so wonderful.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.309
- OK.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.595
- Look at you.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:20.140
You're huge.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.770
- I'm actually doing
a piece on motherhood.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.410
- Really?

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.320
- Did you know amniotic
fluid is actually urine?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.855
- Let's open that wine.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.130
[LAUGHS]

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.320
- We're having a baby, too.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.259
Yay.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.280
- How far along are you?

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.570
- I'm not actually pregnant.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.150
We have a surrogate.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.470
- I'm Kiki.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.630
I'm Wayne and Tina's
baby's surrogate mom.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.070
- Did you screw the surrogate?

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.000
- Whoa.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.410
- Um.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.150
- I think Don is
boning someone else.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.630
- OK, suppose he is.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.330
Do you care?

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.090
- Of course I care.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.560
- There are five phases
of a woman's life.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.210
I am in phase four.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.506
You have to be a mother.

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:01.710
- If government
and businesses are

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.930
going to devalue
women's work and make

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.540
motherhood economically
unfeasible,

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.130
why not outsource it?

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.290
- See, this is why
people hate liberals.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.430
- Huh.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.470
- I made fresh orange
juice for Karen--

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.100
folic acid.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.430
Tina is like a sperm donor.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.040
- I'm so not like a sperm donor.

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:31.400
- Oh, my god.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.500
I feel so fat.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.000
- Wow.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.908
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:41.700
BETHANIE BAYNES: Let's
welcome to the stage

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.500
Alysia Reiner, David Alan
Basche, and Madeline Di Nonno.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.890
Just to get things started,
we celebrated International

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.640
Women's Day on Friday.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030
Did anyone do anything
exciting in celebration?

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.697
ALYSIA REINER: I was
shooting, actually,

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:58.920
but at the end of the day,
Liv and I made a video.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560
I work a lot with
Equality Now, which

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.900
is another amazing
organization, and they

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.620
asked a lot of different women
to make a video about what

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.780
freedom means to them.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.880
And I wanted to wait
and do it with Liv,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.160
so if you check my
Instagram, you're

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.040
going to see what
freedom means to me.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.540
Yeah.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.980
BETHANIE BAYNES:
That's excellent.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.730
MADELINE DI NONNO: And
we just did so many

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.740
corporate presentations.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.185
We did a really large global
presentation for Sony,

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:26.435
for all the divisions of Sony.

00:02:26.435 --> 00:02:27.110
BETHANIE BAYNES: Oh, great.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.985
MADELINE DI NONNO: And
then the day before, I

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:32.210
did a big presentation
for CARU, which

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.300
is a Children's Advertising
and Online Organization,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.130
so it was a busy
presentation week.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.713
BETHANIE BAYNES:
Yeah, I would imagine

00:02:39.713 --> 00:02:43.340
it's kind of peak season for
you guys, so that's wonderful.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.563
I actually took the
day off of work.

00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:46.730
ALYSIA REINER: That's great.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.780
BETHANIE BAYNES: Not
specifically for that.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.370
It was my father's
birthday, but I

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.745
got to see him
spend some quality

00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:53.670
time with his granddaughters,
which was incredible.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.170
So great.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.040
So we are here to talk about
this amazing film, "Egg".

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.410
And as I said before, I've
watched it a few times,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.300
and every time, I'm
catching more and more

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.700
of the complexity
of the characters

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.540
and the nuances of,
really, both what

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.290
it means to be a woman and
what it means when we consider

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.770
or find ourselves faced with
or decide not to move forward

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.740
with motherhood, but also
what it means to all of those

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.370
around us, so how our
partners perceive it,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.480
how our former friends from
different parts of our lives

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.220
perceive our roles.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.290
And there's really just
a ton to unpack there.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.470
But I'd love to hear
from Alysia and David.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.570
Kind of, what brought
you to this project?

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.150
ALYSIA REINER: Very quickly,
we did a reading of it

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.620
almost 10 years ago.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.520
And I felt when we
did this reading

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.040
that it spoke to things.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.440
The characters said things
that I've always thought

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.090
but had been afraid to say.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.070
And I loved it so
much, and at that time,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.300
it was-- they were
considering it for the stage.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.620
And I just was like, oh,
my god, I want to do this.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.850
I want to do this.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.690
And then I got really
busy, like, first of all,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.500
making an actual human being,
but then also on "Orange

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.810
is the New Black" and
all these other shows.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.060
And two summers ago, we were on
a ferry boat from Fire Island,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.370
and I only bring
that up, because it

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.010
was from the town of Kismet,
so it was actually Kismet.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.430
And we bumped into the
writer, and she said,

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.867
I just did a rewrite on the
screenplay version of it.

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:31.950
Would you like to read it?

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.310
And we were both like, yes.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.810
And I felt, more than
ever, it was these things

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.110
that no one was talking about--

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.370
about the relationship between
work and art and commerce

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.580
and parenthood and
career and friendship.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.720
And, you know, I was
talking to someone recently

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.150
about how we're changing so much
in reference to gender norms

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.760
and how we talk about gender.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.960
And yet we haven't made those
changes around parenthood

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.200
and how we talk about
the roles of parenthood.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.510
And we have such an
antiquated version

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.960
of what a mother
and a father is,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.180
and it just hasn't caught
up to our world today.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.530
And I wanted to bring
up some of those issues.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.050
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
Yeah, what she said.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.220
It had stuck with us.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.680
I mean it was-- we--
we're actors by trade,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.960
and we both make a living
as actors, which is great.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.200
You know, Alysia
and another partner

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.090
produced the Wall Street--

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.970
the female-driven Wall
Street movie called "Equity."

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.613
and I had just finished
five years on a sitcom,

00:05:46.613 --> 00:05:47.780
and I thought I had a break.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.428
And Alysia said, hey, you're
going to produce this with us.

00:05:50.428 --> 00:05:52.470
You get to be the associate
producer, and I said,

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.110
what the hell is that?

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.730
It turns out that he runs around
putting out all the fires.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.990
ALYSIA REINER: Correct.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.700
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
So I learned that.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.822
And then we really
weren't necessarily

00:06:01.822 --> 00:06:03.530
sure we wanted to
produce anything again,

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.810
but then we met the
writer on the ferry,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.380
and there was "Egg" again.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.610
And we said, oh,
man, it's so good.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.240
And I-- as a man, I love
the male characters in it.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.750
I love what the male
characters have to say.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.670
You know, I was
excited about it,

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.730
even if it-- even if it's quote,
unquote, female-driven content.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.440
You know, I was all in.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.690
So when something sticks
with you like that, you know,

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.160
you got to do it.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.490
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah,
it's interesting to hear

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.560
that it was like a
multi-year process and just

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.770
kind of sticking in until
it finds its final form.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.690
ALYSIA REINER: And I'll
also say, for me, I like--

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.290
as a producer, I need to--

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.010
I don't produce
something, unless I

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.830
feel like it needs a voice.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.380
You know, there's a lot
of stories that I'll read,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.600
and I'll be like, that's
amazing, but I know some--

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.890
I know this will get produced.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.630
Like I know someone
will do this.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.155
This is one of those
where I was like,

00:06:55.155 --> 00:06:56.530
I feel like too
many people would

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.970
be afraid to make this movie.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.610
And I wanted to be
the one who wasn't

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.243
afraid to make this movie.

00:07:02.243 --> 00:07:03.660
BETHANIE BAYNES:
I'm glad you did.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.530
That actually is a
great segue, Madeline.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:11.410
I would love to hear from
the lens of the Geena Davis

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.053
Institute, why was this film
so important to your mission?

00:07:16.053 --> 00:07:17.470
Building off what
Alysia is saying

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.303
is that there was
probably-- a lot of people

00:07:19.303 --> 00:07:22.090
who would pass on this,
because it's not something that

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.350
is obvious to be spoken about.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.850
And why is that just even more
important to be spoken about?

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.600
MADELINE DI NONNO:
It's important in terms

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.000
of on-screen, behind
the camera, which

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.050
I'd love for Alysia and David
to talk about it, and you know,

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.430
there's a social imperative.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.150
So how do we take these
kind of societal norms

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.590
and turn them upside down,
which they did beautifully.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.220
But from a business
imperative, we just

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.230
did a benchmark study, which
looked at 10 years of films,

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.980
family films--

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.080
G, PG, PG-13.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.150
And what we found is
over the past decade,

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.550
female-centric films generated
55% more at the box office.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.180
And that change
happened in 2016,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.930
where female-centric films
generated 7% more at the box

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.460
office, and in 2017, it was
38% more at the box office.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.240
So there's the
social imperative,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.470
which we're talking about.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.250
But there's the
business imperative.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.630
So it's really,
really important.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.580
But yet, even still, female
lead characters-- there's

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.400
still a 2 to 1 ratio
of male characters

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.610
to female characters.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:36.785
So that's not what happened
in the case of "Egg",

00:08:36.785 --> 00:08:38.090
so it's really important.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.690
And then I'd love to
throw to you to talk about

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.070
behind the camera.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.580
ALYSIA REINER: So
our third partner

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:48.430
on this, Michele Ganeless, who
was the president of Comedy

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.130
Central and who had
left and was looking

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.900
into producing her
own stuff and who

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.790
has now started a great
production company as well--

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.610
this was her first piece
off of Comedy Central.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:08.480
And the thing that I loved
about Michelle from the get-go--

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.540
or we loved about
Michelle from the get-go--

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.620
was that she was equally
committed to hiring

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.880
all women across the board.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.700
So we hired all female heads
of every single department,

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.240
so we have--

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.790
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: For example--

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.332
ALYSIA REINER: For example, a
female writer, female director,

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:24.880
female cinematographer.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.460
And I love to talk about
her, because she had never

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.910
shot a feature, not because
she wasn't insanely talented,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.670
but because no one had
given her the opportunity.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:39.070
And I saw a short she did
in Africa with children

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.770
and a leopard, and
they say, like,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.360
the two things you
should never do

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.180
are work with
animals and children.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.890
And she did this spectac--

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:51.730
I mean the film is
spectacularly beautiful.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.620
But this was her first
feature, and now she's

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.530
shot like three more
in the past two years.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.190
And--

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.270
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
Female sound designer.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.330
ALYSIA REINER: Yeah,
female sound design.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:09:59.800
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.850
ALYSIA REINER: Female--

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.450
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Set designer.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.180
ALYSIA REINER: Set designer.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.860
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Wardrobe.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.437
ALYSIA REINER: Wardrobe.

00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:04.750
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: They
had a female camera op.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:05.917
ALYSIA REINER: Makeup, yeah.

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:06.990
Camera op, yeah.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.740
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
Production coordinator.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.810
ALYSIA REINER:
Everything, so editor.

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.510
So we did all female heads
of all departments, and then

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.670
70% female crew.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.510
And that felt amazing,
and yes, the women

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.630
made as much, if not
more, than the men.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:28.750
And it felt amazing, and one of
the things that I love to say

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:32.890
is there was way less drama
than any other set I've ever

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:33.430
been on.

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.290
If we have that--

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.350
the gender norms of,
like, women are dramatic

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.890
and throw a hissy fit,
whatever-- did not happen.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.470
There was no drama.

00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:48.040
We finished our days on
time or early every day,

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.060
and we were shooting sometimes
like eight pages a day.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.400
And it was an
incredible experience,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.920
and I think my favorite part
was the emails from women

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.920
and young women who this was
their first job on a set,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.960
and they wrote to us
afterwards and said,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.590
like, I've been on a couple of
sets, and it's not like "Egg".

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.630
Even our production
designer recently wrote us,

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.750
and she's like, I still
haven't had another experience

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.830
like "Egg".

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.020
And they said, I haven't--

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.440
like, other sets
weren't like this.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.220
But you gave me hope.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.510
And you made me feel like I
can create that in the future.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.850
Like when I'm the boss,
I'm going to do that,

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.470
and I'm going to
hire more women.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.810
And that's really
why I'm sitting

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.800
up here with this woman is
because way before I made

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.050
this movie, way before I
made movies, she inspired me,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.450
and the Geena Davis
Institute inspired me about

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:47.340
if you can see it, you can
be, both onscreen and off.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.740
And that is so deeply important.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.550
I'll never forget when I first
heard the statistic of when

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.780
you watch anything, even a
cartoon, 77% of the characters

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.980
are male, which means any
girl watching any media feels

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.495
like she's a minority.

00:12:03.495 --> 00:12:05.880
Like, that's a
ridiculous concept.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.510
Women are 50% of the
population, but no matter

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.710
what they're watching, when
they're watching any screen,

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.187
they feel like a minority.

00:12:15.187 --> 00:12:17.520
MADELINE DI NONNO: And just
to add some context to that,

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.340
our friends at
Common Sense Media

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.760
do a lot of analyses
on media consumption.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.970
So your average tween
in the United States

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.470
is engaging and watching media
upwards of six hours a day,

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:34.380
and teens are still
engaging with media

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.150
and watching about
nine hours a day.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.000
It's more than sleeping, school,
anything else they're doing.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.560
So when you think about media
impressions, and you think

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.610
about the repetitiveness and
how it's being reinforced,

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:53.040
they're seeing that stereotyped
media image over and over

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.910
and over.

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.410
And it does make an impact on
how they view the world, how

00:12:58.410 --> 00:12:59.710
they view each other.

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:01.853
So it's very significant.

00:13:01.853 --> 00:13:04.020
BETHANIE BAYNES: Actually,
I have a question for you

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.880
on that, because we
were talking earlier.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.570
I feel like I'm starting to
see more female leads, more

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:10.240
female-driven.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.720
We're starting to see a lot
of female superhero movies.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.330
Is this the case of being
hungry and seeing signs

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.700
for food all the time,
or are we really seeing

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.195
a shift in the industry?

00:13:19.195 --> 00:13:21.570
MADELINE DI NONNO: Well, in
terms of this benchmark study

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.880
that we just did, you know,
unfortunately, 10 years later,

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.390
it's still a 2 to 1 ratio of
male leads to female leads.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:34.230
And women are 52% of
the moviegoing audience,

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.390
and we're 51% of the population.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.690
So we're not really
being represented.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.270
And when we talk about people
of color, people of color

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:47.700
are 38% of the US population,
but in terms of the past decade

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.060
of film, there's only 16.7%.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.360
And then if you really want to
get into the intersectionality

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.550
of it, which is a really
important conversation,

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:04.710
people with disabilities,
people who identify as LGBTQ

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.220
are less than 1%
of any character

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.890
in a film over
the past 10 years,

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.490
the top 100 films from
the United States.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.147
So we have a lot of work to do.

00:14:16.147 --> 00:14:17.430
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.700
I'm glad you guys
are doing the work.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.950
There's another interesting
facet to the film,

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.130
where, Alysia, your
character, Tina,

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.670
is financially leading
the partnership.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.750
It comes up in a way in a
couple different conversations

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:38.610
that she is leading the
household from a contribution

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.170
perspective.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:45.570
Yet she's spun as kind
of not being woman enough

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.920
or not being nurturing enough.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.720
And when you compare that
with Kiki's character, who

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.900
is very needy and
very dependent,

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:57.360
and you know, the
men-- sorry, David--

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.050
are like tripping over
themselves to take care of her,

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.807
talk about that, a little
bit about that storyline.

00:15:04.807 --> 00:15:06.890
ALYSIA REINER: I think you
should talk about that.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:07.720
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah,
talk about it, David.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.137
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
Yeah, I think--

00:15:09.137 --> 00:15:15.200
I believe the line in the film,
where Tina, Alysia's character,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.193
is accused of not being
nurturing and kind of comparing

00:15:18.193 --> 00:15:19.110
the women in the room.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:20.460
And she says, I'm not nurturing?

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.640
And she says, look at her.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.620
She's a fucking train wreck.

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.120
Right?

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.400
And the power of the
powerless woman--

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.680
no man can resist.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.970
ALYSIA REINER: And
additionally, my character,

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.680
you find out in that moment,
is supporting her husband.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.340
And like, how is
that not nurturing?

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.490
And she says, like,
look, I support--

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.110
you wanted to do this.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.268
I supported that.

00:15:47.268 --> 00:15:48.185
You wanted to do this.

00:15:48.185 --> 00:15:48.930
I supported that.

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:49.763
You want to do this.

00:15:49.763 --> 00:15:50.640
I supported that.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.500
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
It's never enough.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.510
It was never enough, and
that's an interesting thing.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:00.710
And it is fascinating to
see the shift in society.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:02.640
We were talking
about this earlier

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.950
from women who are
breadwinners in their family

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.780
and make more money
than their husbands do.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.470
And in this case, I think it
was one of the things I really

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.890
liked about the film when I
read it, even before we made it,

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:18.210
was, Don, my character
is very happy

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.860
to be the wealthiest
person in the room.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.995
He's fairly certain of
that, even though none of us

00:16:22.995 --> 00:16:24.120
know anything about anyone.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:24.620
Right?

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.920
He makes that assumption.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.780
And he's perfectly
fine with that.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.140
And that gives him power over
people, especially over women.

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:34.650
And so it's a very
interesting thing to see,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:39.940
when a woman is an artist,
self-assured, financially

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.560
stable, financially independent,
and speaks her mind, you know,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.060
it's fascinating
to hear what people

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.080
have had to say about that
character in the film.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.272
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah.

00:16:50.272 --> 00:16:51.730
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
And I like that.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:55.797
And I've-- Don judges
everyone in the room,

00:16:55.797 --> 00:16:57.630
and we're all judging
everyone all the time,

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.440
but a little more so.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.180
That's what makes it fun.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:06.040
And Don gives voice to some
of the stereotypical misogyny

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.930
that we're hearing all the time.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:13.190
And I don't like him,
but I liked the chance

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.140
to do that so that people
would go, ugh, or people go,

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.660
oh, he didn't just say that.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.660
Did he just say that?

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.857
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah.

00:17:20.857 --> 00:17:23.190
ALYSIA REINER: There have
been a lot of audible groans--

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.040
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Yeah.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.030
ALYSIA REINER: --when Don says--

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.589
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: I get
very happy about those, yeah.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:27.099
BETHANIE BAYNES:
Well, I have to--

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:28.710
just knowing you, I was--

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.910
I mean it was just making
me laugh at every turn,

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.810
because it was so antithetical
to who you are, but it was--

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:37.860
it's almost like-- and
because it takes place

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:43.000
in this loft throughout the
film, mostly in this main area,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.540
you kind of get this
insular feeling of almost

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:47.830
being in somebody's head.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.620
And you have all the different
judgments or different aspects

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.410
of what could be firing off,
and there's a tremendous amount

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:54.910
of judgment.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.770
And it's coming
across both genders,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.400
and it's coming across
different parenting decisions,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.717
and it really--

00:18:02.717 --> 00:18:04.300
to that end, I'm
curious, did you guys

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.960
have to let go of any of
your preconceived notions

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.930
coming into this film in order
to portray these characters?

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:14.370
Like, how was that for you?

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.030
That's a juicy one.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.220
ALYSIA REINER: I know.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.470
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: I mean yes.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.430
I mean yes, right?

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.950
As actors, we always
do, because we're not--

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.170
unless we're playing
ourselves, then we

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.630
have our own
preconceived notions.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.510
But character-- characters
that you inhabit always

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.672
have preconceived notions.

00:18:31.672 --> 00:18:32.880
Sometimes that's your way in.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.255
Sometimes that--
I mean with Don,

00:18:34.255 --> 00:18:37.290
honestly, he's such a judgmental
asshole that I was like,

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:38.610
ah, got it.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.430
I know that guy.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:40.170
BETHANIE BAYNES: I
know that guy, yeah.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.010
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Yeah,
we all know that guy.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.927
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah.

00:18:41.927 --> 00:18:44.370
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: But we
may work with some of them.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:44.680
BETHANIE BAYNES: Maybe.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.120
I don't know.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.840
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Probably
not here at Google.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.490
BETHANIE BAYNES: I don't know.

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.230
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
Not here at Google,

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.610
but we all know those guys.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:55.710
And I had-- yeah, I mean-- and
honestly, I was on-- again,

00:18:55.710 --> 00:19:00.090
I was on a set that was 70%
female and fairly invisible,

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.590
unless I was in
front of the camera.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.030
And I don't-- and
that's not a criticism.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.030
It's not a complaint.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.870
And so I had to set aside
my preconceived notion of,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.070
oh, well, I'm a man, and
I'm producing a movie,

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.010
and I'm one of the big bosses.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.430
Everybody's going
to, come on now.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.710
Let's do what I say to do.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.300
Fall in line.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.310
Not that-- I guess not
that I was ever that guy.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.730
But I was in a room
full of smart women.

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.610
ALYSIA REINER: But I
think-- but that's actually.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.930
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: And things
were getting taken care of,

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.760
and I was kind of like, it's OK.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.658
If I don't have to--

00:19:27.658 --> 00:19:28.950
Alysia was talking about drama.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:30.420
Like, I don't have to yell.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.630
I don't have to be typically
male or loud to get

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:35.130
things done.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.590
Things seem to be happening
just fine, and it's OK.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.320
If I'm not seeing, it's because
there's no problems, no fire

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.190
to put out.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:43.410
So I had to kind
of adjust what I

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.560
thought my role was going to
be as producer in that way,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.210
I guess.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.020
BETHANIE BAYNES: Was
that change, to you,

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.260
the dynamic of the set and the
dynamic of the relationships?

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.427
Was that palpable to you
as well from previous films

00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:55.052
you've been on?

00:19:55.052 --> 00:19:56.400
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Oh, yeah.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.570
Oh, for sure.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.005
Yeah.

00:19:59.005 --> 00:20:01.380
ALYSIA REINER: You know, I
love that you brought that up,

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:07.500
because, for me, as
an actor playing Tina,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.780
like Tina has a lot
more preconceived

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:18.150
notions and judgment and her
way of doing things than I do.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:22.500
Like, I think, as a human
being, one of my biggest goals

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:28.380
is to sort of strip away
as many biases as I can,

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.570
because that makes
me a more open artist

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.810
and more able to play
the widest variety.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.610
It also makes life
more interesting.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.320
I'm just much more--

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.510
I find life much more
fun if you're really

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.940
willing to listen and wonder.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.930
Our production company is called
[? 2 ?] [? Wonder Full ?] to Be

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.540
Limited, like two
people full of wonder.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:56.480
And my biggest goal as I grow
and age is to keep wondering.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.240
Like, I feel like people tend
to get more and more narrow,

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.070
and they hang on to their
beliefs more and more

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:05.250
as they age, whereas small
humans are much more like,

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.180
I wonder.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:07.640
Oh, I don't know.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.770
And I want to stay
in that wonder place

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.760
as long as possible.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.420
And I think Tina feels
like she knows things

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.280
a lot more than I do.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.660
But in reference to
the dynamic of the set,

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:26.850
it was very surprising
I think to everyone.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:30.960
And I didn't realize
what a white male I

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.463
was married to until we
were in this dynamic,

00:21:33.463 --> 00:21:35.755
BETHANIE BAYNES: Because--
by the way, they're married.

00:21:35.755 --> 00:21:36.588
ALYSIA REINER: Yeah.

00:21:36.588 --> 00:21:41.310
He's a really evolved
feminist white male,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:46.140
but you put him in a room
with a lot of powerful women,

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.010
and he's still a white man.

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:52.260
And he still can fall--
like, we all as women

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:55.560
can fall in to
seeing him as such.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:02.100
And he still can fall into
those stereotypical roles.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.470
We all fall into our roles
sometimes on and off camera

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:08.790
without realizing it.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:10.040
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yep.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.898
Actually, let's roll-- we
have a couple of clips.

00:22:12.898 --> 00:22:14.190
Let's roll the first clip here.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.740
TINA: I forgot, I'm not--

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.880
I'm not actually pregnant.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.620
We have a surrogate mother.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:22.780
KAREN: Oh?

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.250
DON: Oh.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:24.830
KAREN: Oh.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.330
Wow.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:25.830
TINA: Yeah.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.510
WAYNE: Yeah.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.760
KAREN: Oh, a surrogate?

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.302
TINA: Yeah.

00:22:28.302 --> 00:22:30.010
KAREN: We know a gay
couple who did that.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:30.310
DON: We do?

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.435
KAREN: Yeah, the guy who
did our window treatments.

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:32.935
DON: OK.

00:22:32.935 --> 00:22:34.477
KAREN: Did you have
to go through all

00:22:34.477 --> 00:22:35.800
that awful IVF fertility stuff?

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.768
TINA: No.

00:22:36.768 --> 00:22:37.810
KAREN: Well, that's good.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:38.435
TINA: Yeah, no.

00:22:38.435 --> 00:22:40.240
I can't-- I mean we can.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.400
This was more of an option.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:42.910
KAREN: OK.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:48.380
TINA: A-- a-- sort of
a utopian pregnancy.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.420
KAREN: A utopian pregnancy?

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.710
TINA: It's sort of
dismantling and restructuring

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.770
of the traditional family
unit, a redistribution of rules

00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:02.120
to a more shared
economy kind of thing.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.262
WAYNE: Kind of.

00:23:03.262 --> 00:23:04.970
TINA: You're the first
people we've told.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.830
We don't really have
the rap down yet.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:09.320
DON: So you can have
the baby yourself?

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.430
TINA: Right, yes.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.480
We can.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.160
We choose not to.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.540
DON: You're paying someone
to have the baby for you?

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:16.460
TINA: Yeah.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.423
DON: Perfect.

00:23:17.423 --> 00:23:20.543
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:20.543 --> 00:23:21.710
BETHANIE BAYNES: So I love--

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.200
I love this clip,
because you come up

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.080
with the notion of language.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.990
Like, we don't have
the rap down yet.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:33.200
And I think this is
something that we all

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.490
have these judgments.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.650
We all have these
opinions that we

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:39.658
bring with us into,
certainly, family dynamics

00:23:39.658 --> 00:23:41.450
and this assumption of
how things should be

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.320
or how they can roll
off the tongue or not.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.710
And when we tend to
go outside those lines

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.590
with what we expect,
that's where we really

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:50.630
start to get tongue tied.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:54.050
And that's why I love the
vulnerability of showcasing

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.780
your character just
working through that

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.610
with exactly the judgments
that you would expect.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:00.110
What?

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.380
Huh?

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:00.740
Why?

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.240
What?

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.780
You know, talk to
me a little bit

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.262
about the importance
of that language.

00:24:07.262 --> 00:24:09.470
ALYSIA REINER: Language is
such an interesting thing,

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.250
and as an artist,
there are some writers,

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:17.780
for example, who are very
specific about language.

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.000
Aaron Sorkin doesn't
want you to change

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.180
a single word or a
period, and other writers

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:27.950
are much more open.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:31.520
Risa, our writer in
this, was somewhat open,

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.260
but interestingly
enough, our director

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.900
didn't want us to change a word.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:40.370
She's like-- she felt-- and
she's written and directed

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.070
things.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.410
And in this case, she
was just the director,

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:51.070
and she felt that the writing
was so precise that she didn't

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.630
want us to change
a thing, and she

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.030
didn't want us to improv a lot.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.190
But she wanted it
to feel like improv.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.070
So that moment
that you just saw,

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.700
even though I'm floundering for
the words, that's actually--

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.300
that was all written as such.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.210
And language-- in
our culture, I think

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.520
we are in this
moment where we don't

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.150
have language for a lot of
what's going on in the world.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.590
And we're creating new language.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:22.630
You know, when I was growing
up there was no such thing

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:28.180
as gender fluid and non-binary
and we have a 10-year-old,

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.310
and that is such--

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:31.810
it just is for her.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:36.520
And that's-- and that's such
a beautiful, miraculous thing,

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.420
because we, as a
culture, are evolving.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:48.010
But this, as I said earlier,
the way we handle parent roles

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:49.960
has not evolved.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:55.210
Like my daughter knows how to
describe her gender fluidity so

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.880
much better than we
as a culture know

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.880
how to describe parenthood.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.060
And that's, to me,
a problem and part

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.610
of what we were
looking to delve into.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:10.030
And sometimes it's my deepest
hope-- why I'm an artist--

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.490
is that we can
express these things

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.460
and delve into them
in art as a way

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.343
to bring up conversation to
then move our society forward.

00:26:20.343 --> 00:26:21.760
BETHANIE BAYNES:
Yeah, and I think

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.302
you were alluding to that, too,
when I'm thinking back to you

00:26:24.302 --> 00:26:26.320
guys on the boat, of
this being a story

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.170
that some people would shy
away from, because it does

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.410
unpack those things.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.130
And you can even
see the characters

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.640
questioning themselves.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.260
Am I happy?

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.370
Is this what I wanted?

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.410
Was that decision the
right decision for me?

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.250
And you know, it's just
regular human, that grappling.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.140
And I think we don't
see so much of that.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.750
I mean certainly, Madeline,
within the industry,

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.440
where there's a lot of glamor
and sheen to everything,

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.960
we don't see the
characters really

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.270
crumble as much on
these definitive parts

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:55.910
of their lives.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:57.470
Do you have any
thoughts on that?

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:02.800
MADELINE DI NONNO: Well, when we
look at attributes and careers,

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:07.840
only 15% of female
characters in TV and film--

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.870
and this is from our 2018 data,
which we haven't published

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:11.410
yet--

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.750
are shown working.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.280
And then--

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.197
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: 15?

00:27:16.197 --> 00:27:20.160
MADELINE DI NONNO: 15%
just showing working.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.660
And when you look
at, also, the ages

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.680
of the mother, which
is another thing,

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:29.830
in the movie, most
female characters

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:31.630
are shown in their teens.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.000
Most of them are shown under 19.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.180
Only 30% are shown in their
40s, and only 3% in their 50s.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.360
And so when you think
about motherhood and women

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.240
having children at
an older age, that's

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:52.730
not something that's really
being reflected in the media.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.510
And then when you think about
kind of the caretaking of it,

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:01.150
there's very few men
depicted as caretaking.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:04.060
And when they are, you see
a lot of the bumbling dad.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:05.140
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: The
bumbling [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:05.860
MADELINE DI NONNO:
You know, the silly--

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:06.150
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
Not doing it well.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.817
MADELINE DI NONNO:
--lazy, bumbling dad.

00:28:07.817 --> 00:28:11.520
And we know from our
friends at Promundo--

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.450
I happen to sit on their board--

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.960
that changing the
dynamics of masculinity

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.150
and really reflecting
that in the media

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.790
is important, because
most American fathers

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.390
want to spend more time.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.620
I think it's nearly
70% want to spend

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.690
more time with their children.

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.840
And that's their
data, not our data.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.480
So media is not
really keeping up

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.925
with how our
society is changing.

00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:38.800
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yes.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.810
You are preaching to
the choir [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.140
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: What do
the other 30% of the dads

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:41.860
want to be doing, by the way?

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.402
Just curious.

00:28:44.453 --> 00:28:45.870
MADELINE DI NONNO:
Well, what we--

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:46.900
well, it's funny.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:51.640
When we did an adv-- a study
on gender bias in advertising,

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:54.550
48% of the female
characters in ads

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.770
were most likely to
be in the kitchen,

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.950
and the men were at sporting
events and driving around

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:00.505
in cars.

00:29:00.505 --> 00:29:01.030
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Of
course [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.320
MADELINE DI NONNO: So
that's where they were--

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.320
driving around.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.120
BETHANIE BAYNES: What
they're doing, yes.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.495
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: I don't
own a car, so we'll get there.

00:29:06.495 --> 00:29:08.105
We'll get there.

00:29:08.105 --> 00:29:09.730
BETHANIE BAYNES: We
have one more clip.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:11.317
Go ahead with clip number two.

00:29:11.317 --> 00:29:12.900
DON: I can see why
you guys chose her.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.825
KIKI: Oh, shut up.

00:29:14.825 --> 00:29:16.450
TINA: I'll get you
something to put on.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.320
KIKI: Hi.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.540
I'm Kiki.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.630
I'm Wayne and Tina's
baby's surrogate mom.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:21.140
And you are?

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:21.903
KAREN: I'm Karen.

00:29:21.903 --> 00:29:23.320
KIKI: You're
pregnant, too, right?

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:23.903
KAREN: Oh, no.

00:29:23.903 --> 00:29:26.140
I'm not pregnant.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.700
I'm kidding.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.460
KIKI: Oh, god.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.920
Good.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.900
It's always so horrible
when you ask someone

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.400
if they're pregnant, and then
it just turns out that they're

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.740
just, you know, fat.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.007
KAREN: Oh, well, I'm
pregnant and fat.

00:29:38.007 --> 00:29:38.590
KIKI: Oh, god.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.560
No, no, no.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.400
I didn't mean that you're--

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:41.900
uh, sorry.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.540
I know.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:43.810
I mean, obviously,
you're pregnant.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.393
WAYNE: But doesn't
she look wonderful?

00:29:45.393 --> 00:29:48.400
KIKI: Yeah, you have
such rosy cheeks.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.270
TINA: Here.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:51.380
KIKI: Oh, thank you.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.510
ALYSIA REINER: Awkward.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.510
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yes, so
awkward, but also so relatable.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.420
And I just-- I think there's
so much packed into that one

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:09.000
exchange, whether it's the body
shaming, hypersexualization

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.040
of Kiki, and then
there's the question

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.790
of whether is she
pregnant, or is she fat,

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:15.750
and why does it matter?

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:18.690
And why is this a public thing
when women are carrying that,

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:20.490
and it's all they can
talk to you about?

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.430
There's so much packed
into that one exchange.

00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:26.470
Tell us-- tell us
about the scene.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.060
ALYSIA REINER: Well, it's funny.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.810
I was-- I did an evening--

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.490
I'm totally going
off on a tangent,

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.360
because everyone's
going to watch the movie

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.790
or watched it already, right?

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.300
BETHANIE BAYNES: That's right.

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:37.690
ALYSIA REINER: Oh, man.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.430
I don't want to
give anything away.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.290
But I did a--

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.590
with Time's Up, I
produced an evening

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.810
about Rebecca Traister's
book, or inspired

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:49.480
by Rebecca's Traister's
book, "Good and Mad," which

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.070
all of you should read.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:55.270
It's really the history of
rage and female rage and anger.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:59.950
And I did it, honestly, because
I'm afraid of my own anger.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:03.310
I'm afraid of anger,
and so when I--

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.160
in that wondering way,
when I find something

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.660
that I'm afraid
of and that makes

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.200
me have a pit in my stomach,
I'm like, go towards that,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.400
and go explore it.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.450
So we did this evening, and we
had a lot of different women

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:22.270
find a passage about rage
or raging to express.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:29.020
And so we had a comedian, who
I love, because she's a woman,

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.100
obviously.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:36.580
She is disabled,
and she is Muslim.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.900
And so she, like--

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.320
she is one of the most
amazing women I know.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.130
And she does a comedy
bit about being pregnant

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:49.840
and about how you never should
ask anyone if they're pregnant

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.100
ever, because--

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:55.360
or parents, because
people will tell you.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.840
Like, they will show you the
baby pictures before you can

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.270
even ask, so you never even--

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:02.770
and it's not even just pregnant.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.670
It's parenthood, because we
assume that all women want

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:09.550
to be parents, and
that's a really big topic

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:14.080
of this movie is not all
women want to be parents.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.530
Not all men want to be
parents, and that's OK.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:21.160
A woman is enough, whether
she's a mother or not.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.470
She's more than enough, and
that we've created this standard

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:32.110
and this norm that is completely
inappropriate and lets

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:34.180
go of any choice for women.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.727
And that's what
enraged me about it,

00:32:36.727 --> 00:32:38.560
and it was another thing
that made me really

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.740
want to make this movie is
I want women to have free--

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.420
all women to have
freedom of choice

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:48.530
in a full and complete way.

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.850
So that's, for me, what
that moment is about.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:52.822
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah.

00:32:52.822 --> 00:32:54.370
Yeah, I think it's
interesting how

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:58.990
you see the characters
evolve from pushing

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:00.850
each other to each
other's edge and then

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:03.530
really coming to each other's
rescue at the same time.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:07.240
And I think there's,
obviously, the motherhood

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.580
and the parenthood
topic, but there's

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.980
a lot to feminine relationships
that's explored as well.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.838
And I found that
really, really powerful.

00:33:14.838 --> 00:33:17.380
ALYSIA REINER: That's-- I mean
that's my favorite thing about

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:19.660
the movie is these two women--

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.180
you know, Kiki aside, sort of--

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:27.370
who are old friends
and really believe

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:31.660
deeply different things, have
made deeply different choices,

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:36.460
but are willing to
lovingly accept and listen

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:40.330
to each other's choices
without making the other

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:41.770
make the same choice.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:45.670
And that, to me, is what true,
authentic friendship is about.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:51.940
And it was another reason why
this was so deeply important

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:58.750
for me to make as a filmmaker
in this moment, because it was--

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:02.950
we read the script in October.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:08.199
The man people call President
became president in January,

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:13.030
and I met Christina
at the Women's March.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:17.659
And-- which was the weekend
of the inauguration.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:22.120
And I found out that she
was childless by choice,

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.489
and I thought, wow,
how interesting

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:27.550
to make this movie
in this moment

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:31.900
when women feel like
an endangered species.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:37.030
And additionally, when
53% of white women

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:41.570
voted for that human being--

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:45.889
it's a little bit of a
Voldemort thing for me--

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:52.780
I realized I wanted to also
make art about people listening

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.560
to each other, even if they
didn't believe the same thing.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.790
And that's incredibly important
to me in this moment--

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:03.760
learning how to listen
without judgment,

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.930
or even if you're judging, shut
the fuck up, and try and really

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:11.320
listen and learn something,
and ask as many questions,

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.870
and try and really
open up your heart

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.690
to, what can I relate to here?

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.880
What can I possibly
relate to here?

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:24.110
And I think these two women do
a really magical job of that.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:28.060
And that, to me, is what the
story, the core of the story

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.020
became.

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.520
And it wasn't what--

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.490
I didn't know that that's
what it really was deeply,

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:36.100
most deeply about
until the editing room,

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.670
really, but in watching
the edit, it was like,

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:44.980
oh, it's really about being
willing to listen and support,

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.292
even if you don't necessarily
believe the same thing.

00:35:48.292 --> 00:35:49.250
BETHANIE BAYNES: Right.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:50.667
Yeah, I think that
definitely came

00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:53.970
through-- in particular,
the scenes with just the two

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:54.470
of them.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.070
That was very strong.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:56.770
I'm curious of your
take on that clip

00:35:56.770 --> 00:36:01.253
we just watched in terms of
what you saw there from your--

00:36:01.253 --> 00:36:03.170
MADELINE DI NONNO: Well,
there's a few things.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:04.660
There's one clip that was in--

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.630
a little bit of it in the
trailer, where Kiki talks

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:10.390
about the five phases
of being a woman.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:14.170
And the second phase
is boobs, teens.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.820
And she talks about, that's
when you have your most power.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.140
But I'm in the fourth phase,
and I have to be just a mother.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.170
And then there's the other
scene, where you first

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:27.970
see Kiki, and you completely
see her actually objectified.

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:31.360
And so when I think about
that, and I think about some

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.060
of our new data,
female characters

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.990
are six times more likely
to be hypersexualized

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:42.310
and five times more likely
to be verbally objectified.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:45.620
And I thought-- and maybe
you can just talk about it.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.320
But there's scenes
in the movie that

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.150
do it with such great humor
and kind of point fun at it,

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:56.260
but truly, that's what
we're seeing in our--

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.270
in all of our family films.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:59.860
So I don't know if you want to--

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:01.690
ALYSIA REINER:
Yeah, it definitely

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:05.230
was taking a ribbing at it.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.748
And that five phases--

00:37:06.748 --> 00:37:08.540
I'm obsessed with that
five phase dialogue.

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:09.600
BETHANIE BAYNES:
No, it's so-- yes.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.540
You have to watch the movie.

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.498
ALYSIA REINER: One of
the most brilliant things

00:37:12.498 --> 00:37:16.360
I've ever read, and Anna
Camp does a genius job of it.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.670
And she-- I love that character
so much, because she really--

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.160
she's kind of doing
it to herself.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.610
Like her choices
as a human being,

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.340
the character's choices
as a human being,

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.370
are so fascinating,
and the patterns

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:37.550
she's going into, and
without ruining too much,

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:39.610
but she's in a relationship
with a married man.

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:45.320
And these patterns
that we fall into

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.530
and her choice of
what she wears,

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:51.040
which is written into
the script, and we just

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.740
followed that lead
that, in a way,

00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:07.560
she is choosing this stereotype
and this paradigm of what

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.360
a woman is.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.880
And it's the diametric
opposite to what

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.390
Tina is, because Tina is really
interested in sort of breaking

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.380
all those stereotypes.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.680
And then Wayne's
in between trying

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:22.688
to sort of navigate
these two women, which

00:38:22.688 --> 00:38:23.730
makes it all interesting.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.910
BETHANIE BAYNES: That's a
very complex part of it, too,

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:29.490
because each character--

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.310
David said earlier about
Don, we all know that guy.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:35.250
Each character-- we all
know that character.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:37.860
There's someone in our lives,
or there was a time in our lives

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:41.380
where we felt like we subscribed
to various similar paradigms.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.410
So I definitely
feel like there's

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:48.630
that sense of identification
that you can have through each

00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:50.575
of those characters.

00:38:50.575 --> 00:38:52.950
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: It's also
every dinner party we've all

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.450
ever been to gone wrong.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:55.430
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah.

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:56.190
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: And usually--

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.690
I mean I think we've all been
to those dinner parties, where

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.998
someone says something
a little bit off,

00:39:00.998 --> 00:39:02.790
and most eyes just kind
of go to the plate,

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.915
or someone gets an elbow
under the table or a kick,

00:39:04.915 --> 00:39:05.590
and that's it.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:06.090
Right?

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.430
And then you just rip it
apart on the way home.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.840
BETHANIE BAYNES: Right.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.300
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Right.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.320
Like on the subway ride home,
I can't believe she said that.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:11.660
I'm like, I know.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:12.360
What's her problem?

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.510
Well, she's never had to
work a day in her life,

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:14.510
so she doesn't ba-ba-ba.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.990
And he's ba-ba-ba,
and we all do that.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.863
And but we do there.

00:39:17.863 --> 00:39:18.780
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.740
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: We don't
do do it on the ride home.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:20.510
We do it there.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.060
BETHANIE BAYNES: Right.

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.170
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: It's
like we're at the table,

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.210
and someone says, why
would you say that to me?

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.460
The other person says, well,
because I think you're x.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.450
And the person says,
you don't know me.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:28.820
I'm not- why would you say that?

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.030
Like, this is an idea of how
we want to live our lives,

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:33.155
and the person says, well,
I don't agree with that.

00:39:33.155 --> 00:39:35.820
So it's-- we get to live out
that dinner party fantasy that

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.970
we've all had of, wouldn't it
be great if we could just tell

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:42.250
him, like nobody likes to
hear you talk about XYZ?

00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:44.340
We don't give a
shit, and you don't

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.750
seem to care about people.

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.880
Like, it's that
dinner party thing

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.347
that I think that we've
all wanted to talk about

00:39:52.347 --> 00:39:54.430
with subjects that we've
all wanted to talk about,

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:56.472
but are a little bit afraid
to, like we just said

00:39:56.472 --> 00:39:58.650
earlier, or very afraid to.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.820
And I think that's part of--

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.560
I hope that's part of
what happens in the film.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.893
We've been hearing from a lot
of people who have seen it

00:40:03.893 --> 00:40:05.920
that they have questions.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.750
They want to talk--

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.110
why did we do it this way?

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:08.910
Why did we do it that way?

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:09.820
Well, you know,
and that's great.

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.290
That's what we want.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:12.420
It's not ab-- you don't
watch it and be like, eh.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.830
BETHANIE BAYNES:
Pretty little bow and--

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:14.020
ALYSIA REINER: Yeah.

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.690
BETHANIE BAYNES: It's
not one of those.

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:16.725
It sits with you.

00:40:16.725 --> 00:40:18.600
ALYSIA REINER: And a
lot of people have said,

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.300
I went back and watched
it a bunch of times,

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.620
and every time, it's different.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.680
I see different things.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.552
And that's really
exciting and rewarding.

00:40:26.552 --> 00:40:28.260
BETHANIE BAYNES: Well,
there's a moment--

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.470
there's a scene where,
as Dave is describing,

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:32.490
it's uncomfortable.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.380
It's almost like, I
think this way sometimes

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.210
when you watch Ben
Stiller's comedies.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.550
You're like, no, don't,
don't, don't do that.

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:41.910
It's uncomfortable to
watch, because it puts you

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.520
in that position where you feel
that vulnerability of sharing

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.170
something that you
normally would just

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.290
keep to yourself or share with
your partner on the way home.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:51.840
But there's one
scene where there's

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.600
a question that comes out, and
David, your character, Don,

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.350
just goes, well, that's
a little personal.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:00.520
Meanwhile, we're talking about
the most personal things ever,

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.430
but there's that
dry humor to it.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:03.420
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
It was about money.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.420
It was a question about money.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.340
BETHANIE BAYNES: Oh,
right, right, right.

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.080
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Does your
boyfriend pay your rent?

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.247
Like, why do you have to
move out of your apartment?

00:41:09.247 --> 00:41:11.880
And we've just talked
about her uterus, her life,

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.065
her relationship, her identity
as a woman, and then I say--

00:41:15.065 --> 00:41:17.440
someone says, well, why do
you have to buy the apartment?

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.540
And I say, well, that's
a little personal.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:19.830
We don't want to get into that.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:21.560
BETHANIE BAYNES: Well, that
unfolds a whole other--

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.590
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
Money is a whole other--

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:24.715
BETHANIE BAYNES: Thinking
back to your last project

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:27.270
with "Equity," one
of your past projects

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:31.080
with "Equity" is just that
comfort around women and money

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.950
and certainly women and
money as portrayed in media.

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:38.700
And we talked a little bit
about breadwinning women

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:43.080
and primary earning women
who are 42% of our nation,

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.048
and we're not seeing that
showcased on screen anywhere.

00:41:47.048 --> 00:41:49.590
We're not seeing that pride,
and we're not seeing [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.960
ALYSIA REINER: That's
my next project.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.835
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yes.

00:41:51.835 --> 00:41:52.770
Love it.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.690
Yeah, so that's a great segue.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.048
What's up next for you guys
that you're able to share?

00:41:57.048 --> 00:41:59.340
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Is there
a part in your next project

00:41:59.340 --> 00:41:59.840
for me?

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:00.760
That's great.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.510
ALYSIA REINER: No,
there are no men in it.

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:03.112
No.

00:42:03.112 --> 00:42:04.320
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: That's OK.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.445
ALYSIA REINER: Right now,
I'm shooting "The Deuce,"

00:42:06.445 --> 00:42:07.470
which is so much fun.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.130
Oh, my god.

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:08.820
We're--

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.450
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Season three?

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.020
ALYSIA REINER: Last season
was-- yeah, season two,

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.070
we shot in-- it was the '70s.

00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:16.733
And now, in season three,
it's the '80s in New York.

00:42:16.733 --> 00:42:18.150
BETHANIE BAYNES:
Oh, the costumes.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.220
ALYSIA REINER: The
writing is so genius,

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.310
and I'm so, so, so enjoying it.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:26.070
And "Better Things,"
which I'm also on, just

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:29.340
started airing like two
weeks ago, I think this week.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.285
Sharon Stone is our guest star.

00:42:31.285 --> 00:42:32.160
BETHANIE BAYNES: Ooh.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:32.715
MADELINE DI NONNO:
That's terrific.

00:42:32.715 --> 00:42:34.715
ALYSIA REINER: I have a
gorgeous scene with her.

00:42:34.715 --> 00:42:37.180
She was such a joy to work with.

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:37.895
And--

00:42:37.895 --> 00:42:40.520
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: I'm going to
cro-- just to keep things even,

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.670
I'm going to cross [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:45.010
Men could do that, too.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:47.760
ALYSIA REINER: And we
just wrapped season seven

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:51.670
of "Orange," and they never tell
us when that's going to be out.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.140
But my guess is summer,
but don't quote me.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.523
That could be a lie.

00:42:55.523 --> 00:42:56.940
BETHANIE BAYNES:
And this is the--

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.840
is this the final season?

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.710
ALYSIA REINER: This
is our final season.

00:42:58.710 --> 00:42:59.930
That's for sure.

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:00.910
That's for sure.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:03.077
And I've definitely been
mourning that a little bit.

00:43:03.077 --> 00:43:05.410
BETHANIE BAYNES: I was going
to say, how does that feel?

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:06.500
That's a lifetime.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.500
ALYSIA REINER: It hurts.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.120
You know, I'll
miss the character,

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.190
because she was
so extraordinary.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:20.250
And this season is quite
epic in its social commentary

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:22.440
on what's going on in
the world right now.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:29.790
I'm really proud to be part of
this season for that reason.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.760
And-- but more
than anything, I'll

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:36.690
miss the people, because there
are some spectacular humans

00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:39.660
both behind and in
front of the camera, who

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.410
made that all happen.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.910
And I will love them forever,
and I'll see them forever,

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:46.250
but I won't see them as much.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.340
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yeah.

00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:48.440
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
Not behind bars.

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:49.050
ALYSIA REINER: Yeah.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:50.140
BETHANIE BAYNES:
No, hopefully not.

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:50.550
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Yeah, well.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:52.133
BETHANIE BAYNES: I
mean we never know.

00:43:52.133 --> 00:43:54.616
She's still curious.

00:43:54.616 --> 00:43:56.473
David, what's up next for you?

00:43:56.473 --> 00:43:58.890
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: If Alysia
hires me in her next project,

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:01.340
then I'll tell you what
that is when we get there.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:05.010
I just did a show on CBS called
"Instinct," and that was fun.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:09.272
And yeah, trying to get a
job and being a hands-on dad.

00:44:09.272 --> 00:44:11.230
BETHANIE BAYNES: That's
the most important job.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:12.350
DAVID ALAN BASCHE:
Which I'm very proud of,

00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:14.130
and Alysia's a
hands-on mom, but she's

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.200
been a lot busier than
I have, especially

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.680
since "Egg" came out.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.745
So yeah, I'm doing laundry
and the dishes and being a dad

00:44:21.745 --> 00:44:22.245
and--

00:44:22.245 --> 00:44:24.150
BETHANIE BAYNES: And
you're building tree forts.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:25.760
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Yeah,
we did build the treehouse.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:28.920
There were power tools involved,
so a little more stereotypical,

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.452
but yeah.

00:44:29.452 --> 00:44:30.910
BETHANIE BAYNES:
Big shoes to fill.

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:31.922
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Yeah.

00:44:31.922 --> 00:44:33.922
BETHANIE BAYNES: Madeline,
what does your season

00:44:33.922 --> 00:44:35.190
look like coming up with--

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.400
MADELINE DI NONNO: We have
a really rich research year.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:42.480
We're just about to publish
the next iteration of what

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.600
we call the GDIQ,
which was generously

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.280
funded by Google.org.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.830
It stands for the Geena
Davis Inclusion Quotient,

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:54.550
and it's a machine learning tool
that automates gender, screen

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.870
and speaking time, and
actually race for screen time

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.190
using audio and
facial recognition.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:04.680
So we have a really rich
partnership with Google,

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:06.460
so we're really
grateful for that.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:09.630
And this year, we're
releasing not only film, which

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.250
we have done, but also TV.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:16.800
So that's been really important
for us to evolve the GDIQ.

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.680
So that's coming
out soon for us.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:23.760
And then, as I mentioned,
we're partnering with Promundo

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.620
on a masculinity study.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.710
We're also partnering
with Plan International

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.510
on a study about girls'
relationship to leadership.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:35.250
So we have a lot of really
interesting research projects

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:35.920
coming out.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.950
And then we also
are commissioned

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:39.190
to do a lot of research.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:43.980
So we've done a lot of
research for leading brands,

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.930
content creators, studios.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:47.700
So behind the scenes,
a lot of people

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.580
want to know how they're doing,
and so we'll also conduct

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:51.878
a lot of research that way.

00:45:51.878 --> 00:45:53.420
BETHANIE BAYNES:
That's so important.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.378
I'm so glad to hear it.

00:45:54.378 --> 00:45:56.770
We are a data-driven
company here at Google,

00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:59.640
and I think the more you
have data telling a story,

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.520
while it may not be the
story we all want to hear,

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.663
it's telling a certain
story, and only then can

00:46:04.663 --> 00:46:07.080
you start to see action and
start to measure the progress.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.122
It's very, very important
work that you're doing.

00:46:09.122 --> 00:46:11.580
I'm thrilled that we're finding
ways to partner together

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.690
on that initiative.

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:19.290
So "Egg" is available on Amazon
and iTunes and Video On Demand.

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:22.410
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Coming
up on Hulu as of March 31.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:24.690
BETHANIE BAYNES: On
Hulu, March 31st.

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:27.910
ALYSIA REINER: It's a great
Mother's or Father's Day gift.

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:28.910
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Yeah.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:30.000
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yes, exactly.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.010
We actually flipped Mother's
and Father's Day in my house,

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:32.927
so I get Father's Day.

00:46:32.927 --> 00:46:34.135
My husband gets Mother's Day.

00:46:34.135 --> 00:46:35.200
ALYSIA REINER: Nice.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:35.910
MADELINE DI NONNO:
And for anyone

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.327
who's watching the
global channel,

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:38.970
aren't you coming
out internationally?

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:39.480
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Yes.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.140
ALYSIA REINER: Yes.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.070
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Yeah,
we're premiering in the UK

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:41.400
March 31st.

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.608
ALYSIA REINER: March 31st,
we open in theaters, which

00:46:43.608 --> 00:46:44.880
is Mother's Day in the UK.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.610
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: UK, Ireland,
New Zealand, Australia.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.210
ALYSIA REINER: It's actually
called something else there.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:50.550
It's called "Motherhood."

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:52.092
BETHANIE BAYNES: I
wasn't sure if you

00:46:52.092 --> 00:46:55.200
were going to share that yet,
so for our UK subscribers

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.440
and counterparts, make sure
that you keep an eye out

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.290
for "Motherhood."

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.500
ALYSIA REINER: And if
you follow @alysiareiner,

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.892
you'll get all the
scoop about it always.

00:47:03.892 --> 00:47:05.100
BETHANIE BAYNES: The updates.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:05.340
ALYSIA REINER: Yeah.

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.010
BETHANIE BAYNES: Yes, and for
the Geena Davis Institute,

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:09.540
anybody that wants
to learn more,

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.050
there's some great
infographics throughout there.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:17.100
I do just think some of the data
just really makes you mindful,

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.850
and that can be
found at seejane.org.

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:22.510
So thank you all so much.

00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:24.090
This was such a
great conversation,

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:26.620
and we're really looking
forward to more success to come.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:27.180
MADELINE DI NONNO: Thank you.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:27.940
BETHANIE BAYNES: Thank you.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.148
DAVID ALAN BASCHE: Thank you.

00:47:29.148 --> 00:47:32.600
[APPLAUSE]
