00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.050
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.720
More about eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.440
Well, actually, it's
going to be the same thing

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.700
about eigenvalues
and eigenvectors

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.770
but I'm going to
use matrix notation.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.670
So, you remember I have a
matrix A, 2 by 2 for example.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.580
It's got two eigenvectors.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.180
Each eigenvector
has its eigenvalue.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.240
So I could write the
eigenvalue world that way.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.770
I want to write
it in matrix form.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.580
I want to create an
eigenvector matrix

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.570
by taking the two
eigenvectors and putting them

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.915
in the columns of my matrix.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.900
If I have n of them, that
allows me to give one name.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.660
The eigenvector matrix, maybe
I'll call it V for vectors.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.950
So that's A times V. And
now, just bear with me

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.790
while I do that
multiplication of A times

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.110
the eigenvector matrix.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.120
So what do I get?

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.260
I get a matrix.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.410
That's 2 by 2.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.870
That's 2 by 2.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.900
You get a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.040
What's the first column?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.720
The first column of
the output is A times

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.160
the first column of the input.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.440
And what is A times x1?

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.080
Well, A times x1 is
lambda 1 times x1.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.130
So that first column
is lambda 1 x1.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.520
And A times the second column
is Ax2, which is lambda 2 x2.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.030
So I'm seeing lambda
2 x2 in that column.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.670
OK.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.420
Matrix notation.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.210
Those were the eigenvectors.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.590
This is the result of A times V.
But I can look at this a little

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.970
differently.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.759
I can say, wait a minute, that
is my eigenvector matrix, x1

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.650
and x2-- those two
columns-- times a matrix.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.150
Yes.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:27.560
Taking this first column, lambda
1 x1, is lambda 1 times x1,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.910
plus 0 times x2.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.280
Right there I did a
matrix multiplication.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.800
I did it without
preparing you for it.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.660
I'll go back and do that
preparation in a moment.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:51.010
But when I multiply a matrix by
a vector, I take lambda 1 times

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.630
that one, 0 times that one.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.130
I get lambda 1 x1,
which is what I want.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.150
Can you see what I want
in the second column here?

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.840
The result I want
is lambda 2 x2.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.430
So I want no x1's, and
lambda 2 of that column.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.510
So that's 0 times that
column, plus lambda 2,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.000
times that column.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.440
Are we OK?

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.390
So, what do I have now?

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.130
I have the whole thing
in a beautiful form,

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.140
as this A times the
eigenvector matrix

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.810
equals, there is the
eigenvector matrix again, V.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.710
And here is a new matrix
that's the eigenvalue matrix.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.960
And everybody calls
that-- because those

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.080
are lambda 1 and lambda 2.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.900
So the natural letter
is a capital lambda.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.700
That's a capital Greek lambda
there, the best I could do.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.310
So do you see that the two
equations written separately,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.040
or the four equations
or the n equations,

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.980
combine into one
matrix equation.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.040
This is the same as
those two together.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.390
Good.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.190
But now that I have
it in matrix form,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.790
I can mess around with it.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.050
I can multiply both
sides by V inverse.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.420
If I multiply both sides by
V inverse I discover-- well,

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.140
shall I multiply on
the left by V inverse?

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.690
Yes, I'll do that.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.742
If I multiply on the left by
V inverse that's V inverse AV.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.790
This is matrix multiplication
and my next video

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.180
is going to recap
matrix multiplication.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.410
So I multiply both
sides by V inverse.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.150
V inverse times V
is the identity.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.070
That's what the
inverse matrix is.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.120
V inverse, V is the identity.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.070
So there you go.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.670
Let me push that up.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.940
That's really nice.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.920
That's really nice.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.560
That's called diagonalizing
A. I diagonalize

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.750
A by taking the eigenvector
matrix on the right,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.710
its inverse on the left,
multiply those three matrices,

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.520
and I get this diagonal matrix.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.020
This is the diagonal
matrix lambda.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.730
Or other times I might want
to multiply by both sides

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.300
here by V inverse
coming on the right.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.350
So that would give me A, V,
V inverse is the identity.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.440
So I can move V over
there as V inverse.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.490
That's what it amounts to.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.590
I multiply both
sides by V inverse.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:02.270
So this is just A and this is
the V, and the lambda, and now

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.040
the V inverse.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.783
That's great.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:18.640
So that's a way to see how
A is built up or broken down

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.640
into the eigenvector matrix,
times the eigenvalue matrix,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.970
times the inverse of
the eigenvector matrix.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.920
OK.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.800
Let me just use
that for a moment.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.960
Just so you see how it
connects with what we already

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.900
know about eigenvalues
and eigenvectors.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.400
OK.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:52.120
So I'll copy that great fact,
that A is V lambda, V inverse.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.370
Oh, what do I want to do?

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.580
I want to look at A squared.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.130
So if I look at
A squared, that's

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.670
V lambda V inverse
times another one.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:05.330
Right?

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.790
There's an A, there's an
A. So that's A squared.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.140
Well, you may say I've made
a mess out of A squared,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.080
but not true.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.410
V inverse V is the identity.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.570
So that it's just the identity
sitting in the middle.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.880
So the V at the far left,
then I have the lambda,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.780
and then I have the other
lambda-- lambda squared--

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.360
and then the V inverse
at the far right.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.020
That's A squared.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.730
And if I did it n
times, I would have

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:52.400
A to the n-th what would be
the lambda to the n-th power V

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.590
inverse.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.320
What is this?

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.530
What is this saying about?

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.590
This is A squared.

00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:05.220
How do I understand
that equation?

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.200
To me that says that the
eigenvalues of A squared

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.170
are lambda squared.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.340
I'm just squaring
each eigenvalue.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.200
And the eigenvectors?

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.970
What are the eigenvectors
of A squared?

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:23.980
They're the same V, the
same vectors, x1, x2,

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:28.190
that went into v. They're
also the eigenvectors

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.860
of A squared, of A cubed, of
A to the n-th, of A inverse.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.710
So that's the point of
diagonalizing a matrix?

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.220
Diagonalizing a
matrix is another way

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.590
to see that when I square
the matrix, which is usually

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:50.330
a big mess, looking at the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.970
it's the opposite of a big mess.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.640
It's very clear.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:01.710
The eigenvectors are
the same as for A.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:17.130
And the eigenvalues are squares
of the eigenvalues of A.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.990
In other words, we can
take the n-th power

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.870
and we have a nice
notation for it.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.040
We learned already
that the n-th power

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.350
has the eigenvalues
to the n-th power,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.330
and the eigenvectors the same.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.270
But now I just see it here.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.320
And there it is
for the n-th power.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.440
So if I took the same
matrix step 1,000 times,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.040
what would be important?

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.860
What controls the thousandth
power of a matrix?

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.710
The eigenvectors stay.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.100
They're just set.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:01.150
It would be the thousandth
power of the eigenvalue.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.550
So if this is a matrix with
an eigenvalue larger than 1,

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.700
then the thousandth
power is going

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.540
to be much larger than one.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.240
If this is a matrix with
eigenvalues smaller than 1,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.690
there are going to
be very small when

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.410
I take the thousandth power.

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.770
If there's an eigenvalue
that's exactly 1,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.880
that will be a steady state.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.830
And 1 to the thousandth
power will still be 1

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.590
and nothing will change.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.920
So, the stability.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.200
What happens as I multiply,
take powers of a matrix,

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.020
is a basic question parallel
to the question what

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:43.070
happens with a
differential equation

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.170
when I solve forward in time?

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.790
I think of those two
problems as quite parallel.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:57.140
This is taking steps, single
steps, discrete steps.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.040
The differential equation is
moving forward continuously.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.690
This is a difference
between hop,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:10.190
hop, hop in the discrete case
and run forward continuously

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.510
in the differential case.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:17.390
In both cases, the eigenvectors
and the eigenvalues

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.951
are the guide to what
happens as time goes forward.

00:11:21.951 --> 00:11:22.450
OK.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.630
I have to do more about
working with matrices.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.330
Let me come to that next.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.880
Thanks.
