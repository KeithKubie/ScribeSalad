context of science and in talking about
simplicity I do not mean to suggest that

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830
simplicity I do not mean to suggest that
 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.800
simplicity I do not mean to suggest that
science itself is simple

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810
science itself is simple
 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.560

ivermectin was an exercise in simplicity
I want rather to call attention to the

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539
I want rather to call attention to the
 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.830
I want rather to call attention to the
element of simplicity within science and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840
element of simplicity within science and
 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.760
element of simplicity within science and
I want to do that by pointing out the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770
I want to do that by pointing out the
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.690
I want to do that by pointing out the
prominence of simplicity in the genesis

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700
prominence of simplicity in the genesis
 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.400

of ivermectin it has of course long been
 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.540
of ivermectin it has of course long been
acknowledged and recognized that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550
acknowledged and recognized that
 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.090
acknowledged and recognized that
simplicity has an intrinsic appeal to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100
simplicity has an intrinsic appeal to
 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.540
simplicity has an intrinsic appeal to
scientists as it does to others and

scientists as it does to others and

scientists as it does to others and
indeed simplicity is widely celebrated

indeed simplicity is widely celebrated
 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.509
indeed simplicity is widely celebrated
in science as a matter of beauty but I

in science as a matter of beauty but I
 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.850
in science as a matter of beauty but I
want to talk about simplicity not as a

purposely infected with worms but not
enough to cause illness and on that

liquid stirred into its regular food and
 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.699
liquid stirred into its regular food and
it ate that food for almost a week and

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709
it ate that food for almost a week and
 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.970
it ate that food for almost a week and
then this regular diet was restored and

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980
then this regular diet was restored and
 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.909
then this regular diet was restored and
almost a week after that its worms were

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919
almost a week after that its worms were
 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.050
almost a week after that its worms were
gone the mouse had been cured of its

and from that moment there was a train

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250
and from that moment there was a train
 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.790
and from that moment there was a train
of events set in motion that would lead

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800
of events set in motion that would lead
 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.840
of events set in motion that would lead
to an advance in medicine both human

that advanced in the basic science would
 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.830
that advanced in the basic science would
in turn lead to practical changes in the

in turn lead to practical changes in the
 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.510
in turn lead to practical changes in the
management of diseases so to a very

large extent the drug ivermectin was
 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.640
large extent the drug ivermectin was
brought about by simple science it is

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650
brought about by simple science it is
 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.830

microbiologists and we found that one of
 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:47.709
microbiologists and we found that one of
those unfamiliar microbes produced an

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:47.719
those unfamiliar microbes produced an
 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:50.920

microorganisms can make molecules that
 

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.590
microorganisms can make molecules that
humans cannot but they also seem to

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600
humans cannot but they also seem to
 

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.870
humans cannot but they also seem to
believe that only a chemist can make it

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880
believe that only a chemist can make it
 

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.170
believe that only a chemist can make it
properly and so they they tweak these

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180
properly and so they they tweak these
 

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.780
properly and so they they tweak these
things and modified and so what they did

00:10:59.780 --> 00:10:59.790
things and modified and so what they did
 

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.500
things and modified and so what they did
was to make a better version of it which

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:03.510
was to make a better version of it which
 

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.380
was to make a better version of it which
is shown here now I trust you all have

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:06.390
is shown here now I trust you all have
 

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.500
is shown here now I trust you all have
noticed the difference but just in case

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:11.510
noticed the difference but just in case
 

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:16.190
noticed the difference but just in case
you haven't just focus on the upper

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200
you haven't just focus on the upper
 

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.780
you haven't just focus on the upper
right hand corner where you see here and

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:20.790
right hand corner where you see here and
 

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.370
right hand corner where you see here and
here the 2223 bond between those carbon

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:25.380
here the 2223 bond between those carbon
 

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.210
here the 2223 bond between those carbon
atoms each of them has been and it has

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220
atoms each of them has been and it has
 

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.460
atoms each of them has been and it has
been given another hydrogen so this was

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:31.470
been given another hydrogen so this was
 

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.920
been given another hydrogen so this was
accomplished by hydrogenation of a verme

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:33.930
accomplished by hydrogenation of a verme
 

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.510
accomplished by hydrogenation of a verme
actin to make ivermectin

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:37.520
actin to make ivermectin
 

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:43.850
actin to make ivermectin
and so this ivermectin is 2223 dye hydro

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860
and so this ivermectin is 2223 dye hydro
 

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.540
and so this ivermectin is 2223 dye hydro
a permanent B 1 a B 1 a just been one of

a permanent B 1 a B 1 a just been one of
 

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:50.390
a permanent B 1 a B 1 a just been one of
these closely related molecules so they

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:50.400
these closely related molecules so they
 

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.640

microscopic larvae the baby worms in the
 

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.600
microscopic larvae the baby worms in the
skin of people and that was of course

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:36.610
skin of people and that was of course
 

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.180
skin of people and that was of course
thought to be exactly what is needed the

thought to be exactly what is needed the
 

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.500
thought to be exactly what is needed the
trial had to be very cautious because

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:41.510
trial had to be very cautious because
 

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.299
trial had to be very cautious because
there had been some precedent that it

00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:43.309
there had been some precedent that it
 

00:19:43.309 --> 00:19:45.250
there had been some precedent that it
was dangerous to kill those microscopic

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:45.260
was dangerous to kill those microscopic
 

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.380
was dangerous to kill those microscopic
worms but this turned out not to be

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:47.390
worms but this turned out not to be
 

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.230
worms but this turned out not to be
dangerous and in fact to be very safe

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240
dangerous and in fact to be very safe
 

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.890
dangerous and in fact to be very safe
and do you understand why the activity

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:53.900
and do you understand why the activity
 

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.740
and do you understand why the activity
of that against those larvae is

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:56.750
of that against those larvae is
 

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.930
of that against those larvae is
important it's necessary to understand

00:19:58.930 --> 00:19:58.940
important it's necessary to understand
 

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.850
important it's necessary to understand
that in river blindness unlike the

that in river blindness unlike the
 

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.460
that in river blindness unlike the
situation was dog heartworm it is the

that caused the damage to the skin and
 

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:11.530
that caused the damage to the skin and
to the eye and eventually leads to

the drug for the use against river
 

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.620
the drug for the use against river
blindness and this led to an

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:44.630
blindness and this led to an
 

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:49.000

about it if you have to be accountable

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000
about it if you have to be accountable

then it becomes a big decision to make
 

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.780
then it becomes a big decision to make
and that's why Roy evangelist made such

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:13.790
and that's why Roy evangelist made such
 

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:20.140
and that's why Roy evangelist made such
an important decision now I would like

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.150
an important decision now I would like
 

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.260
an important decision now I would like
to not talk further about how great an

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:23.270
to not talk further about how great an
 

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.890
to not talk further about how great an
impact this was but rather I want to get

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:26.900
impact this was but rather I want to get
 

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:31.210
impact this was but rather I want to get

with which I began the operation of that

with which I began the operation of that
 

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:41.080
with which I began the operation of that
assay was simple as I have explained the

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:41.090
assay was simple as I have explained the
 

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.970

operation was simple but so was the

thinking on the part of my colleagues
but the underlying principle was simple

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200
but the underlying principle was simple
 

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.280
but the underlying principle was simple
it was bizarre but it was simple and I

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:57.290
it was bizarre but it was simple and I
 

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.370

have described it this way you line up a

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:00.380
have described it this way you line up a
 

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:04.480
have described it this way you line up a

unknown substance that might not be
 

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.930
unknown substance that might not be
there and then you check to see if it

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:13.940
there and then you check to see if it
 

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:19.720
there and then you check to see if it
