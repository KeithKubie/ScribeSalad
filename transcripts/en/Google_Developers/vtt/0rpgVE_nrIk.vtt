00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Google Sheets lets you
collaborate with others

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.368
to organize, track,
and analyze your data,

00:00:05.368 --> 00:00:09.272
whether you're using the
web, Android, or iOS.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:12.200
Sometimes it's hard to import
data from other sources

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.650
without considerable
manual work.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.295
That's why we built
a new Sheets API.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.205
We want to save users time by
enabling richer connections

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.630
between other tools and Sheets.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.055
Let's see how it works
by reviewing integrations

00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:26.995
built by two of our partners.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:29.740
Sage, a leader in accounting
and financial software,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.240
has found an
innovative way to let

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.540
small business users customize
their analysis and reporting.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.940
They've used the new
Sheets API to allow

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.940
users to export a spreadsheet
packed with charts and analysis

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.140
in one click.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
After a user tailors the
spreadsheet to their needs,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.590
the data is kept in sync
with Sage so users only

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.240
need to set it up once.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.640
The new Sheets API makes
it easy for partners

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.040
to create always
in-sync reporting that

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.740
uses the rich
functionality of Sheets.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.840
Next is Anaplan, a
popular cloud planning

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.440
tool that connects enterprise
business planning and action.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.240
Anaplan recognized
that users want

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.940
to collaborate with others to
inform better decision-making

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.140
across the enterprise.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.057
And that collaboration
is at the core of Sheets.

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:12.640
As a result, they
built an integration

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.340
that allows users to
easily share their latest

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.240
data with Sheets, collaborate
with others to receive input,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.840
then push select changes
from Sheets back to Anaplan.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.240
The new API can be
used to empower users

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.340
to collaborate around
their data from leading

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.024
applications in Sheets.

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.940
Partners can then
automatically import changes

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.240
from Sheets via the
API or let users choose

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.040
when to push select data back.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.440
This new Sheets API
is available today,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.440
enabling developers to build
rich integrations and workflows

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.940
around Google Sheets.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.640
These integrations, along with
those from our other partners,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.740
will be launching in
the coming month, all

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.740
working to save users
considerable time and effort.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.440
Visit
developers.google.com/sheets

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.940
for more details.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.690
We look forward to
seeing what you create.
