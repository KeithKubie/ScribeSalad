00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.740
All righty!

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.810
So now that we know how to
submit scores to leader boards,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.180
let's go through the process
of removing these hard coded

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.047
strings.

00:00:14.047 --> 00:00:15.880
I'm going to do something
a little different

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.392
than the Achievement
Manager You'll

00:00:17.392 --> 00:00:18.850
remember in the
Achievement Manager

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.174
we created a new enum for
each of the achievements.

00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:24.340
Now I could do the same
thing for our leader boards,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.360
but the thing is we
basically already

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.390
have an enum set up for this.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.260
If you look in our
enums.h file, we

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.630
have this difficulty level one.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.300
And since our leader
boards correspond exactly

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.880
to difficulty levels,
I'm just going

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.100
to go ahead and reuse this.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.320
So let's see, I'm going
to set this to zero just

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.150
to kind of ensure
that, yes, easy really

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.360
is going to correspond to zero.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.320
And then in our
leader board manager,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.290
I'm going to create
a new method called

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.270
Submit Score for
Difficulty Level.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.800
And let's write negative up
here and import my enums.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.140
Difficulty level -- Next
code why are you giving me?

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.890
There we go.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.040
Right.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.150
Now to implement
this, I do still

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.070
need to create the
array of static strings

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.700
that lets me know what
leader board corresponds

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.750
to each difficulty level.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.420
So I'm going to do our
static in a string const

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.020
leader board IDs.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.030
And that will
equal-- And now I got

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.900
to go to my developer
console and make

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.720
sure I copy and paste these.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.840
So let's bring that up.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.500
There you go.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.825
And copy this one.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:06.894
Let's copy this one.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.560
I think these are really all the
same except for the last letter

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.410
here, but just in case I always
like copying and pasting.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.173
Here we go.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.390
And we can do this.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.290
And we can create a little in a
string for our leader board ID.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.140
And that equals our
leader board ID's level.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.070
And you know what?

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.670
I'm just going to combine
these two methods into one.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.420
So there we go.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.160
We get our leader
board ID by looking

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.175
at our leader board ID's array.

00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:48.550
And then basically
I'm just going

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.440
to combine this with the
rest of the sinit square

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.340
for leaderboard ID method.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.190
Now I basically just need to go
back to my .h file and delete

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.100
this method because we
no longer want to use it.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.950
And we're pretty good.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.900
So now I can go back
to my game model class

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.540
and replace this
method, where I'm

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.100
submitting a score to a hard
coded leader board string,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.070
to just leader board,
managers, submit score,

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.390
num_guesses for
difficulty level.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.230
And oh, at this point I
realized you know what,

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.480
I'm not actually storing the
difficulty level anywhere

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.920
in this class.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.750
Well this is
something we can fix

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.975
with a simple property
or a variable.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:33.660
Let me just go up here
and add it as a property.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.970
By the way, I often
go back and forth

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.440
about whether I should be
storing these private variables

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.550
as you know, little ints
here, or has actual properties

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.880
in the class extension.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.140
I go back and forth.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.130
I'm not quite sure
if one way's really

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.590
considered more
proper than the other.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.240
But I'm just going to
go ahead and do it here.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.410
Going to create
a little int that

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.060
is going to store
our difficulty level.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.368
So there we go.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.330
I do know however that since
I've kind of created most

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.500
of these others as properties,
I don't know why I'm referring

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.410
to them using their private
variable names with this

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.040
_gamemax _secretnumber.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.709
I should probably be using
some self dot notation here.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.940
Sorry about that.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.670
But in any case I guess I'll
be consistently incorrect here

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.900
and we'll store our
difficulty level

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.980
as the level that
gets passed in.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.010
And now that this
has been recorded

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.960
I can now go back to the bottom
here and for difficulty level

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.580
I can now change that to
difficult level property.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.590
And there you go.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.415
Let's run this now.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:04.000
And we'll see that well hey
look at that, three guesses.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.700
I got a better
score than before.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.780
And by the way, you will
notice as I mentioned

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.880
before in this score
report that gets returned,

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.400
the high score for player today
all those Booleans are true

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.710
and the actual high
score objects are null.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.930
Remember those only get
returned if you did not

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.880
get a new high score for today
or for the week or all time.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.050
And now what's even better
is without any extra work

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.740
on my part, I can now go ahead
and play a medium difficulty

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.240
game.

00:05:33.787 --> 00:05:36.120
Boy, I guess I should have
made a more fun game to play.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.670
There we go.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.790
And now I've
submitted a high score

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.450
to the medium leader
board as well.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.780
Let's go back, check
our leader boards.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.750
Here's our medium
leader board and there I

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.454
am with a score of 10.

00:05:52.454 --> 00:05:54.870
I could likewise do the same
for the hard difficulty level

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.740
but I really don't want
to play a game where

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.850
I guess a number
between 1 and 10,000.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.320
So I will leave that as
an exercise to the viewer.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.980
So we're almost done here.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.990
The only other
refinement I want to make

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.475
is I found it sort of awkward
they had to go back here

00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:10.110
to this mean screen
to view the leader

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.142
boards for the game
I was just playing.

00:06:12.142 --> 00:06:13.850
Gee, wouldn't it be
nice if in the middle

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.020
of playing my easy game I could
see the current high scores.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.470
And so we can do that
pretty easily as well.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.480
And we'll tackle that final
step in the next lesson.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.000
So I'll see you soon.
