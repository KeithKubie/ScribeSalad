00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.330
if you look at the neuroscience the way

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340
if you look at the neuroscience the way
 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.280
if you look at the neuroscience the way
that we're wired has a profound effect

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290
that we're wired has a profound effect
 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.909
that we're wired has a profound effect
on how we hear and respond to feedback

00:00:06.909 --> 00:00:06.919
on how we hear and respond to feedback
 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.950
on how we hear and respond to feedback
now we took a look at three variables

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
now we took a look at three variables
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.660
now we took a look at three variables
that are particularly important in terms

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670
that are particularly important in terms
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.400
that are particularly important in terms
of your reaction to feedback the first

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
of your reaction to feedback the first
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.620
of your reaction to feedback the first
is your baseline in the literature this

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630
is your baseline in the literature this
 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.680
is your baseline in the literature this
is called setpoint sometimes it's served

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690
is called setpoint sometimes it's served
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.540
is called setpoint sometimes it's served
how happy or unhappy are you in the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
how happy or unhappy are you in the
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.269
how happy or unhappy are you in the
absence of other events in your life

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279
absence of other events in your life
 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.500
absence of other events in your life
where's that level that you come back to

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
where's that level that you come back to
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.679
where's that level that you come back to
if it's a scale of 1 to 10

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
if it's a scale of 1 to 10
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.390
if it's a scale of 1 to 10
some people just live their lives at 9

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
some people just live their lives at 9
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.460
some people just live their lives at 9
right they're just so unbelievably happy

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
right they're just so unbelievably happy
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.520
right they're just so unbelievably happy
and cheerful about everything like from

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530
and cheerful about everything like from
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.920
and cheerful about everything like from
a cup of coffee to a promotion they're

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
a cup of coffee to a promotion they're
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.139
a cup of coffee to a promotion they're
just thrilled this research comes from

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
just thrilled this research comes from
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.139
just thrilled this research comes from
looking at lottery winners a year later

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
looking at lottery winners a year later
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.209
looking at lottery winners a year later
they're about as happy or unhappy as

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219
they're about as happy or unhappy as
 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.229
they're about as happy or unhappy as
they were before they won the lottery

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
they were before they won the lottery
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.630
they were before they won the lottery
and people who go to jail a year or

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640
and people who go to jail a year or
 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.920
and people who go to jail a year or
later they're about as happy or unhappy

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
later they're about as happy or unhappy
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.619
later they're about as happy or unhappy
as before they went to jail now the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
as before they went to jail now the
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.510
as before they went to jail now the
reason this matters for feedback is if

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
reason this matters for feedback is if
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.160
reason this matters for feedback is if
you particularly if you have a low set

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
you particularly if you have a low set
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.430
you particularly if you have a low set
point or baseline positive feedback can

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
point or baseline positive feedback can
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.290
point or baseline positive feedback can
be muffled for you the volume is turned

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
be muffled for you the volume is turned
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900
be muffled for you the volume is turned
down it's harder for you to hear it now

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
down it's harder for you to hear it now
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.399
down it's harder for you to hear it now
we look at the second variable which is

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
we look at the second variable which is
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.649
we look at the second variable which is
swing when you get positive or negative

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659
swing when you get positive or negative
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600
swing when you get positive or negative
feedback how far off your baseline does

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
feedback how far off your baseline does
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.910
feedback how far off your baseline does
it knock you the same piece of feedback

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
it knock you the same piece of feedback
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.010
it knock you the same piece of feedback
can be devastating for one person and

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
can be devastating for one person and
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.760
can be devastating for one person and
you know kind of annoying for another

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770
you know kind of annoying for another
 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.130
you know kind of annoying for another
and then the third variable is how long

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
and then the third variable is how long
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.080
and then the third variable is how long
does it take you to come back to your

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
does it take you to come back to your
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.490
does it take you to come back to your
baseline how long do you sustain

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500
baseline how long do you sustain
 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.830
baseline how long do you sustain
positive feeling or how long does it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
positive feeling or how long does it
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.450
positive feeling or how long does it
take you to recover from negative

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
take you to recover from negative
 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.730
take you to recover from negative
feeling so taken together that's where

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
feeling so taken together that's where
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039
feeling so taken together that's where
the big variation in sensitivity comes

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
the big variation in sensitivity comes
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.690
the big variation in sensitivity comes
from that some people are extremely

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
from that some people are extremely
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.789
from that some people are extremely
sensitive and other people are pretty

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799
sensitive and other people are pretty
 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.460
sensitive and other people are pretty
insensitive or maybe I should say even

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
insensitive or maybe I should say even
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.940
insensitive or maybe I should say even
keel

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
keel
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560
keel
but I suppose if you're insensitive you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
but I suppose if you're insensitive you
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.480
but I suppose if you're insensitive you
don't really care what I call you so it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
don't really care what I call you so it
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.700
don't really care what I call you so it
doesn't matter here's why this is

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
doesn't matter here's why this is
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.740
doesn't matter here's why this is
particularly important there are two

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
particularly important there are two
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.219
particularly important there are two
reasons one is your own footprint or

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
reasons one is your own footprint or
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.399
reasons one is your own footprint or
feedback profile not only influences how

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
feedback profile not only influences how
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.319
feedback profile not only influences how
you receive feedback it also influences

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
you receive feedback it also influences
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.959
you receive feedback it also influences
how you give feedback so if you're

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
how you give feedback so if you're
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.120
how you give feedback so if you're
pretty even keel it could be that you're

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
pretty even keel it could be that you're
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.359
pretty even keel it could be that you're
more likely to be pretty direct or other

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
more likely to be pretty direct or other
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.399
more likely to be pretty direct or other
people would describe you as harsh in

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
people would describe you as harsh in
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.749
people would describe you as harsh in
your feedback because you think like

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
your feedback because you think like
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.249
your feedback because you think like
this isn't that big a deal and you're

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
this isn't that big a deal and you're
 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.339
this isn't that big a deal and you're
overreacting to it other people who are

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349
overreacting to it other people who are
 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.860
overreacting to it other people who are
very sensitive are likely to tiptoe

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
very sensitive are likely to tiptoe
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.760
very sensitive are likely to tiptoe
around issue

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
around issue
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130
around issue
and if they're talking to someone who's

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
and if they're talking to someone who's
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.660
and if they're talking to someone who's
pretty even keel like they're not even

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670
pretty even keel like they're not even
 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.710
pretty even keel like they're not even
understanding that you're giving them

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720
understanding that you're giving them
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240
understanding that you're giving them
feedback right like you have to be

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
feedback right like you have to be
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.530
feedback right like you have to be
pretty direct to even get through to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540
pretty direct to even get through to
 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.910
pretty direct to even get through to
them

the second reason it matters is that

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020
the second reason it matters is that
 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.550
the second reason it matters is that
particularly if you swing negative it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
particularly if you swing negative it
 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800
particularly if you swing negative it
can actually distort your sense of the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810
can actually distort your sense of the
 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.420
can actually distort your sense of the
feedback itself and your sense of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
feedback itself and your sense of
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.390
feedback itself and your sense of

yourself so in terms of distorting your
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.640
yourself so in terms of distorting your
sense of the feedback itself it's almost

sense of the feedback itself it's almost
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.920
sense of the feedback itself it's almost
like it super-sizes it you know one

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
like it super-sizes it you know one
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.280
like it super-sizes it you know one
piece of feedback triggers sort of an

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290
piece of feedback triggers sort of an
 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.100
piece of feedback triggers sort of an
overwhelming flood where the feedback

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110
overwhelming flood where the feedback
 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.650
overwhelming flood where the feedback
itself overruns its borders it's not one

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660
itself overruns its borders it's not one

it's as if mentally and emotionally you
 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.510
it's as if mentally and emotionally you
google everything that's wrong with me

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520
google everything that's wrong with me
 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.880
google everything that's wrong with me
and you get like 1.2 million hits all

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890
and you get like 1.2 million hits all
 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.980

book is how do you dismantle the
distortions so that you can see the

distortions so that you can see the
 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.880
distortions so that you can see the
