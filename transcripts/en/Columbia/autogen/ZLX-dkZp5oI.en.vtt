the first study i did was looked at the

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.310
the first study i did was looked at the
 

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.240
the first study i did was looked at the
young adolescents in penny Trickett's

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:20.250
young adolescents in penny Trickett's
 

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.030
young adolescents in penny Trickett's
data and i looked at the rates of

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040
data and i looked at the rates of
 

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.720
data and i looked at the rates of
obesity in both the maltreated

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:26.730
obesity in both the maltreated
 

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.360
obesity in both the maltreated
adolescence and the comparison and one

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:29.370
adolescence and the comparison and one
 

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.050
adolescence and the comparison and one
of the things that she did is that she

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:32.060
of the things that she did is that she
 

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.329
of the things that she did is that she
has have comparison adolescents in the

00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:35.339
has have comparison adolescents in the
 

00:12:35.339 --> 00:12:38.860
has have comparison adolescents in the
same not just census tracks but blocks

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:38.870
same not just census tracks but blocks
 

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.829
same not just census tracks but blocks
within so they have the same

00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839
within so they have the same
 

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:44.810
within so they have the same
socioeconomic status they're very

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820
socioeconomic status they're very
 

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:51.400
socioeconomic status they're very
similar in ethnicity and age in an

income education all those kinds of
 

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.480
income education all those kinds of
things and I also determined again

00:12:59.480 --> 00:12:59.490
things and I also determined again

difference in terms of the type of
whether they were obese or not and this

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300
whether they were obese or not and this
 

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.010
whether they were obese or not and this
is published in child abuse and neglect

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.020
is published in child abuse and neglect

between 2002 and
 

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:18.680
between 2002 and
2005 and there were 303 maltreated kids

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:18.690
2005 and there were 303 maltreated kids

this group whether you were sexually

00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:51.779
this group whether you were sexually
 

00:15:51.779 --> 00:15:55.069
this group whether you were sexually
abused versus the kids who were not

00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079
abused versus the kids who were not
 

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:58.220
abused versus the kids who were not
sexually abused so even though i'm

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:58.230
sexually abused so even though i'm
 

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.619
sexually abused so even though i'm
looking at sexual abuse they likely had

00:16:00.619 --> 00:16:00.629
looking at sexual abuse they likely had
 

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:02.809
looking at sexual abuse they likely had

other kinds of co other kinds of
 

00:16:02.819 --> 00:16:07.569
other kinds of co other kinds of
maltreatment also and i found that for

00:16:07.569 --> 00:16:07.579
maltreatment also and i found that for
 

00:16:07.579 --> 00:16:12.530
maltreatment also and i found that for
overweight obesity females being

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540
overweight obesity females being
 

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.819
overweight obesity females being
physically abused reduced the odds when

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:16.829
physically abused reduced the odds when
 

00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:20.480
physically abused reduced the odds when
you look at stress and maltreatment one

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:20.490
you look at stress and maltreatment one
 

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:24.019
you look at stress and maltreatment one
usually thinks that or has found that

usually thinks that or has found that
 

00:16:24.029 --> 00:16:26.869
usually thinks that or has found that
sexual abuse is the most stressful for

00:16:26.869 --> 00:16:26.879
sexual abuse is the most stressful for
 

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:29.290
sexual abuse is the most stressful for
kids followed by physical abuse

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:29.300
kids followed by physical abuse
 

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.360
kids followed by physical abuse
emotional abuse and then neglect not

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:32.370
emotional abuse and then neglect not
 

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.519
emotional abuse and then neglect not
that they are all not stressful for kids

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:34.529
that they are all not stressful for kids
 

00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:39.230
that they are all not stressful for kids
but in terms of cortisol reactivity and

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.240
but in terms of cortisol reactivity and
 

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.230
but in terms of cortisol reactivity and
other stressful measures those that's

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240
other stressful measures those that's
 

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.110
other stressful measures those that's
kind of how they they are so this was

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120
kind of how they they are so this was
 

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.379
kind of how they they are so this was
against my hypotheses this finding and

00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:50.389
against my hypotheses this finding and
 

00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:54.710
against my hypotheses this finding and
then for females being physically abused

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720
then for females being physically abused
 

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.960
then for females being physically abused
reduced the odds of being obese just

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:56.970
reduced the odds of being obese just
 

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:59.990
reduced the odds of being obese just
like overweight for females being

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000
like overweight for females being
 

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.540
like overweight for females being
sexually abused reduce the odds of being

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:02.550
sexually abused reduce the odds of being
 

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:06.319
sexually abused reduce the odds of being
obese and for neglect reduce the odds of

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:06.329
obese and for neglect reduce the odds of
 

00:17:06.329 --> 00:17:09.370
obese and for neglect reduce the odds of
a being obese so all these findings were

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:09.380
a being obese so all these findings were
 

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:15.020
a being obese so all these findings were
against my hypotheses but you know that

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:15.030
against my hypotheses but you know that
 

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.149
against my hypotheses but you know that
that's you know that's one of the

00:17:17.149 --> 00:17:17.159
that's you know that's one of the
 

00:17:17.159 --> 00:17:19.340
that's you know that's one of the
reasons i think that the meta-analysis

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:19.350
reasons i think that the meta-analysis
 

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:23.360
reasons i think that the meta-analysis
found that obesity was not specifically

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:23.370
found that obesity was not specifically
 

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:29.930
found that obesity was not specifically
related to maltreatment but even though

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940
related to maltreatment but even though
 

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.279
related to maltreatment but even though
that's the case these kids were very

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:33.289
that's the case these kids were very
 

00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:37.730
that's the case these kids were very
obese and they were more obese than the

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740
obese and they were more obese than the
 

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.610
obese and they were more obese than the

in itself the longitudinal study we used
 

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.289
in itself the longitudinal study we used
we looked at the BMI trajectory from age

00:18:56.289 --> 00:18:56.299
we looked at the BMI trajectory from age
 

00:18:56.299 --> 00:19:01.760
we looked at the BMI trajectory from age
92 22 so that and we did it by age as

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.570
everybody who was 10 11 going up to age
22 and we looked at the same four types

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580
22 and we looked at the same four types
 

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.350
22 and we looked at the same four types
of abuse and neglect and we looked at

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360
of abuse and neglect and we looked at
 

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.060
of abuse and neglect and we looked at
them compared to other types of

group I did separate the maltreatment

00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559
group I did separate the maltreatment
 

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:27.710

group a little differently in this one I

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720
group a little differently in this one I
 

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:30.500
group a little differently in this one I
looked at everybody taking that idea of

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:30.510
looked at everybody taking that idea of
 

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.530
looked at everybody taking that idea of
stress everybody with sexual abuse

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:32.540
stress everybody with sexual abuse

versus everybody with without sexual
 

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.909
versus everybody with without sexual

abuse but then I took those people out
 

00:19:37.919 --> 00:19:40.460
abuse but then I took those people out
and then looked at what was left

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:40.470
and then looked at what was left
 

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:45.110
and then looked at what was left

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.930
thing for for emotional abuse and the
same thing for neglect

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:54.940
same thing for neglect
 

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.870
same thing for neglect
and this made four separate groups where

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:57.880
and this made four separate groups where
 

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:04.680
and this made four separate groups where
there was no overlapping of groups and I

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:04.690
there was no overlapping of groups and I
 

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.400
there was no overlapping of groups and I
used individual growth curve modeling

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:07.410
used individual growth curve modeling
 

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:12.740
used individual growth curve modeling
and quadratic and linear and I

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:12.750
and quadratic and linear and I
 

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.900
and quadratic and linear and I
controlled for the same demographic

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:15.910
controlled for the same demographic
 

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.680
controlled for the same demographic
variables and anxiety depression and

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:19.690
variables and anxiety depression and
 

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:24.120
variables and anxiety depression and
pubertal stage this is what for this is

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.130
pubertal stage this is what for this is
 

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:28.770
pubertal stage this is what for this is
women or girls the boys there were no

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:28.780
women or girls the boys there were no
 

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.590
women or girls the boys there were no
differences between between different

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600
differences between between different
 

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.900
differences between between different
types of maltreatment or between the

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:33.910
types of maltreatment or between the
 

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:35.940
types of maltreatment or between the
comparison and the non comparison in the

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:35.950
comparison and the non comparison in the
 

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:40.470
comparison and the non comparison in the
community but in girls generally most

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480
community but in girls generally most
 

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.580
community but in girls generally most
curves kind of at age about between 15

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:44.590
curves kind of at age about between 15
 

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.540
curves kind of at age about between 15
and 16 17 18 kind of went down and there

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:48.550
and 16 17 18 kind of went down and there
 

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.610
and 16 17 18 kind of went down and there
were no differences between the total

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620
were no differences between the total
 

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:55.740
were no differences between the total
maltreated and the comparison but there

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:55.750
maltreated and the comparison but there
 

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.020
maltreated and the comparison but there
was a difference between sexual abuse

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.030
was a difference between sexual abuse
 

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:02.040
was a difference between sexual abuse
girls and non sexually abused girls who

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:02.050
girls and non sexually abused girls who
 

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.220
girls and non sexually abused girls who
didn't have any maltreatment so in this

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:05.230
didn't have any maltreatment so in this
 

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.730
didn't have any maltreatment so in this
the darker is the sexual abuse and the

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:08.740
the darker is the sexual abuse and the
 

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.090
the darker is the sexual abuse and the
comparison is the lighter and you can

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:12.100
comparison is the lighter and you can
 

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.210
comparison is the lighter and you can
see there was a statistically different

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220
see there was a statistically different
 

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.060
see there was a statistically different
curve for them and the sexually abused

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:18.070
curve for them and the sexually abused
 

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:21.960
curve for them and the sexually abused
girls continue to go up and wait whereas

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.970
girls continue to go up and wait whereas
 

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.290
girls continue to go up and wait whereas
the comparison girls about age 16 or 17

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:25.300
the comparison girls about age 16 or 17
 

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.680
the comparison girls about age 16 or 17
started to come down which was kind of

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:28.690
started to come down which was kind of
 

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.050
started to come down which was kind of
what everybody did in the study but the

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:31.060
what everybody did in the study but the
 

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.850
what everybody did in the study but the
sexually abused girls so there is some

00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860
sexually abused girls so there is some
 

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:41.130
sexually abused girls so there is some
theory about obesity being protective in

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:41.140
theory about obesity being protective in
 

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.900
theory about obesity being protective in
terms of your body image and not having

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:44.910
terms of your body image and not having
 

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.660
terms of your body image and not having
you know the opposite sex look at you

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:48.670
you know the opposite sex look at you
 

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.240
you know the opposite sex look at you
and that maybe have gone on for this

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:51.250
and that maybe have gone on for this
 

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.080
and that maybe have gone on for this
group there's also a lot of research on

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.090
group there's also a lot of research on
 

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.660
group there's also a lot of research on
binge eating and obesity and binge

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:57.670
binge eating and obesity and binge
 

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.600
binge eating and obesity and binge
eating is more likely and sexually

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:00.610
eating is more likely and sexually
 

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:03.240
eating is more likely and sexually
abused girls since then sexually abused

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.250
abused girls since then sexually abused
 

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.760
abused girls since then sexually abused
boys and binge eating also not only

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:05.770
boys and binge eating also not only
 

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.110
boys and binge eating also not only
causes obesity it

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120
causes obesity it
 

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.660
causes obesity it
perpetuates obesity so that may be

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:10.670
perpetuates obesity so that may be
 

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:14.470
perpetuates obesity so that may be
another possible explanation for this

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480
another possible explanation for this
 

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.780
another possible explanation for this
but this kind of reinforces penny

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:19.790
but this kind of reinforces penny
 

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.730
but this kind of reinforces penny
Trickett's research she did just on

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:21.740
Trickett's research she did just on
 

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.090
Trickett's research she did just on
sexual abuse because we did not find any

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:25.100
sexual abuse because we did not find any
 

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.400
sexual abuse because we did not find any
differences in the non sexually abused

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:27.410
differences in the non sexually abused
 

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:35.740
differences in the non sexually abused
girls um so we just said that so these

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:35.750
girls um so we just said that so these
 

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:41.020
girls um so we just said that so these
studies are in a very dense urban sample

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:41.030
studies are in a very dense urban sample
 

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.870
studies are in a very dense urban sample
I wasn't able to control for all the

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:43.880
I wasn't able to control for all the
 

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.610
I wasn't able to control for all the
things you really want to control for an

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:45.620
things you really want to control for an
 

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.300
things you really want to control for an
obesity research which is parental

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:48.310
obesity research which is parental
 

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.890
obesity research which is parental
weight status because many of these kids

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:50.900
weight status because many of these kids
 

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.420
weight status because many of these kids
are in foster care and then we're not

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:52.430
are in foster care and then we're not
 

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.430
are in foster care and then we're not
with their parents and we did not have

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440
with their parents and we did not have
 

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.820
with their parents and we did not have
their parents weights and I used

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:57.830
their parents weights and I used
 

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.490
their parents weights and I used
official child welfare records and you

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:00.500
official child welfare records and you
 

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.890
official child welfare records and you
know which may be different if you ask

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:02.900
know which may be different if you ask
 

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.880
know which may be different if you ask
people if they've been maltreated so we

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:06.890
people if they've been maltreated so we
 

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.310
people if they've been maltreated so we
talked a little bit about the catch

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.320
talked a little bit about the catch
 

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.650
talked a little bit about the catch
clinic which is a community assessment

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:11.660
clinic which is a community assessment
 

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:14.560
clinic which is a community assessment
and treatment clinic in Los Angeles and

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:14.570
and treatment clinic in Los Angeles and
 

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.380
and treatment clinic in Los Angeles and
it's in right next to the County

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:17.390
it's in right next to the County
 

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.590
it's in right next to the County
Hospital in Los Angeles it's one of the

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:20.600
Hospital in Los Angeles it's one of the
 

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.970
Hospital in Los Angeles it's one of the
seven hubs only takes kids who are in

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:24.980
seven hubs only takes kids who are in
 

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:30.280
seven hubs only takes kids who are in
the child welfare system and I they are

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:30.290
the child welfare system and I they are
 

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.700
the child welfare system and I they are
seen up where's about a thousand kids a

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:33.710
seen up where's about a thousand kids a
 

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:37.270
seen up where's about a thousand kids a
year so I was able to look at a lot of

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280
year so I was able to look at a lot of
 

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.180
year so I was able to look at a lot of
medical records with very valid and

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:40.190
medical records with very valid and
 

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:43.330
medical records with very valid and
reliable heights and weights and I

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:43.340
reliable heights and weights and I
 

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.760
reliable heights and weights and I
looked at birth date gender ethnicity

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:45.770
looked at birth date gender ethnicity
 

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.390
looked at birth date gender ethnicity
exam date recorded weights and the

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400
exam date recorded weights and the
 

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.060
exam date recorded weights and the
maltreatment type that came from DCFS

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:52.070
maltreatment type that came from DCFS
 

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.970
maltreatment type that came from DCFS
when they were referred to the clinic so

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:54.980
when they were referred to the clinic so
 

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.180
when they were referred to the clinic so
not looking at their previous records

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:58.190
not looking at their previous records
 

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.290
not looking at their previous records
just what came so again I've tried to

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:02.300
just what came so again I've tried to
 

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.530
just what came so again I've tried to
see for this a very large sample whether

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:05.540
see for this a very large sample whether
 

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:09.670
see for this a very large sample whether
there was any relationship between the

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:09.680
there was any relationship between the
 

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.630
there was any relationship between the
maltreatment type and obesity and this

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:13.640
maltreatment type and obesity and this
 

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.670
maltreatment type and obesity and this
is published in child maltreatment I

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:17.680
is published in child maltreatment I
 

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.620
is published in child maltreatment I
looked at poly victimization which means

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:20.630
looked at poly victimization which means
 

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:21.190
looked at poly victimization which means
more

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200
more
 

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.090
more
and one type of melt maltreatment as

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.100
and one type of melt maltreatment as
 

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.370
and one type of melt maltreatment as
opposed to only one type and I looked at

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:27.380
opposed to only one type and I looked at
 

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.519
opposed to only one type and I looked at
abuse versus neck of neglect anybody who

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:30.529
abuse versus neck of neglect anybody who
 

00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:35.169
abuse versus neck of neglect anybody who
did was only neglected versus only

00:24:35.169 --> 00:24:35.179
did was only neglected versus only
 

00:24:35.179 --> 00:24:38.259
did was only neglected versus only
abused either sexually physically or

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:38.269
abused either sexually physically or
 

00:24:38.269 --> 00:24:43.149
abused either sexually physically or
emotionally abused this is was a study

00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159
emotionally abused this is was a study
 

00:24:43.159 --> 00:24:47.169
emotionally abused this is was a study
of 2,000 subjects 2 to 18 year old years

00:24:47.169 --> 00:24:47.179
of 2,000 subjects 2 to 18 year old years
 

00:24:47.179 --> 00:24:50.139
of 2,000 subjects 2 to 18 year old years
old who attended their initial foster

00:24:50.139 --> 00:24:50.149
old who attended their initial foster
 

00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:53.460

care clinic medical appointment at catch
 

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.529
care clinic medical appointment at catch
so these were all in foster care and for

00:24:56.529 --> 00:24:56.539
so these were all in foster care and for
 

00:24:56.539 --> 00:24:58.629
so these were all in foster care and for
this study there were no kids with their

00:24:58.629 --> 00:24:58.639
this study there were no kids with their
 

00:24:58.639 --> 00:25:02.259
this study there were no kids with their
birth parents they were not pregnant and

00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:02.269

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:46.140
or Hispanic and there were more
Hispanics in kinship foster care then

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:46.150
Hispanics in kinship foster care then
 

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:52.080

the other kinds of placements this is

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:52.090
the other kinds of placements this is
 

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:55.260
the other kinds of placements this is
the same statistics as I found for the

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:55.270
the same statistics as I found for the
 

00:30:55.270 --> 00:31:00.060
the same statistics as I found for the
Hispanic study is that almost 40% of

00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:00.070
Hispanic study is that almost 40% of
 

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:04.190
Hispanic study is that almost 40% of
them that were overweight or obese but

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200
them that were overweight or obese but
 

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:07.290
them that were overweight or obese but
sixty percent in group homes were or

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:07.300
sixty percent in group homes were or
 

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.049
sixty percent in group homes were or
overweight or obese so that's more than

00:31:10.049 --> 00:31:10.059
overweight or obese so that's more than
 

00:31:10.059 --> 00:31:12.510
overweight or obese so that's more than
half and the greatest percentage in

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:12.520
half and the greatest percentage in
 

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.060
half and the greatest percentage in
group homes and there's maybe a lot of

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:15.070
group homes and there's maybe a lot of
 

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:17.730

reasons for that it's not necessarily

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:17.740
reasons for that it's not necessarily
 

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.430
reasons for that it's not necessarily
that the group homes are causing that

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440
that the group homes are causing that
 

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.320
that the group homes are causing that

are much more related to obesity so that

2006 and 2010 medical records I used
 

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:36.210
2006 and 2010 medical records I used
chi-square tests as well as the

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:36.220
chi-square tests as well as the
 

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.589
chi-square tests as well as the
MacNamara tests for comparing paired

00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599
MacNamara tests for comparing paired
 

00:35:38.599 --> 00:35:40.870
MacNamara tests for comparing paired
proportions what happened is when you

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880
proportions what happened is when you
 

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.300
proportions what happened is when you
look at these you look at it by age

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:43.310
look at these you look at it by age
 

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:48.309
look at these you look at it by age
between 0 to 2 2 to 5 6 to 11 and 12 to

00:35:48.309 --> 00:35:48.319
between 0 to 2 2 to 5 6 to 11 and 12 to
 

00:35:48.319 --> 00:35:51.040
between 0 to 2 2 to 5 6 to 11 and 12 to
18 so when I was looking at proportions

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.050
18 so when I was looking at proportions
 

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.920
18 so when I was looking at proportions
I did it using the MacNamara test for

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:53.930
I did it using the MacNamara test for
 

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.510
I did it using the MacNamara test for
everybody but many of them

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520
everybody but many of them
 

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.970
everybody but many of them
change what age they were in you know

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:57.980
change what age they were in you know
 

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.190
change what age they were in you know
and they ruin a year so they changed

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200
and they ruin a year so they changed
 

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.460
and they ruin a year so they changed
from 0 to 22 to 25 year olds so I looked

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:03.470
from 0 to 22 to 25 year olds so I looked
 

00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:05.920
from 0 to 22 to 25 year olds so I looked
at the proportions at those particular

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:05.930
at the proportions at those particular
 

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:10.120
at the proportions at those particular
ages and i looked at the change in

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:10.130
ages and i looked at the change in
 

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.170
ages and i looked at the change in
weight categories and I categorized them

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:13.180
weight categories and I categorized them
 

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:17.500
weight categories and I categorized them
by looking at either a decrease in

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:17.510
by looking at either a decrease in
 

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:21.310
by looking at either a decrease in
weight which mean they went from obese

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:21.320
weight which mean they went from obese
 

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.680
weight which mean they went from obese
to overweight or overweight to normal

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:23.690
to overweight or overweight to normal
 

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:26.680
to overweight or overweight to normal
weight or I looked at increased they

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:26.690
weight or I looked at increased they
 

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.260
weight or I looked at increased they
went the opposite way like normal to

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:29.270
went the opposite way like normal to
 

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.560
went the opposite way like normal to
overweight or overweight to obese or

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:32.570
overweight or overweight to obese or
 

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:35.530
overweight or overweight to obese or
they stayed in their overweight or obese

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:35.540
they stayed in their overweight or obese
 

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:38.260
they stayed in their overweight or obese
category or and they remain normal

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:38.270
category or and they remain normal
 

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:43.080
category or and they remain normal
weight so I mean if you had more kids

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:43.090
weight so I mean if you had more kids
 

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:46.740
weight so I mean if you had more kids
you could look at a change in weight

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:46.750
you could look at a change in weight
 

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:49.390
you could look at a change in weight
within the normal weight because if you

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400
within the normal weight because if you
 

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.430
within the normal weight because if you
went you were at thirty percent and the

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440
went you were at thirty percent and the
 

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.220
went you were at thirty percent and the
in a year you were up to seventy percent

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.230
in a year you were up to seventy percent
 

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.610
in a year you were up to seventy percent
that in itself would be a serious

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:57.620
that in itself would be a serious
 

00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.890
that in itself would be a serious
problem but I wasn't able to do it for

00:36:59.890 --> 00:36:59.900
problem but I wasn't able to do it for
 

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:09.640
problem but I wasn't able to do it for
this study here are the kids and the

this study here are the kids and the
 

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:12.940
this study here are the kids and the
only significant changes in weight were

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:12.950
only significant changes in weight were
 

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:16.000
only significant changes in weight were
the two to five year olds they

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.010
the two to five year olds they
 

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:19.060
the two to five year olds they
significantly changed from being obese

significantly changed from being obese
 

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.490
significantly changed from being obese
or overweight to more likely normal

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:21.500
or overweight to more likely normal
 

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:28.570

weight after a year in the total

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:28.580
weight after a year in the total
 

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.500
weight after a year in the total
population there was no difference in

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:31.510
population there was no difference in
 

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:34.630

between overweight and obesity greater

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:39.650
between overweight and obesity greater
 

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.290

and stayed that way placement was not

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:29.420
and stayed that way placement was not
 

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.420
and stayed that way placement was not
related to weight change and the only

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:31.430
related to weight change and the only
 

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:34.060
related to weight change and the only
type of reason for foster care that was

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:34.070
type of reason for foster care that was
 

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:36.520
type of reason for foster care that was
related was parental drug use which I

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:36.530
related was parental drug use which I
 

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.600
related was parental drug use which I
could not really explain why that was so

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:39.610
could not really explain why that was so
 

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:47.290
could not really explain why that was so
that's okay we compared these categories

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:47.300
that's okay we compared these categories
 

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.590
that's okay we compared these categories
to the national statistics at time one

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:52.600
to the national statistics at time one

19 year olds was higher and overweight

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:03.620
19 year olds was higher and overweight
 

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.160
19 year olds was higher and overweight
and obesity was higher for the 22 19

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.170
and obesity was higher for the 22 19
 

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.970
and obesity was higher for the 22 19
year olds but at time to the lower the

year olds but at time to the lower the
 

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.510

under two year olds remained lower fruit

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520
under two year olds remained lower fruit
 

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.950
under two year olds remained lower fruit
and the two to five year olds became

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960
and the two to five year olds became
 

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.370

lower the national statistics and the 69
 

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:25.390
lower the national statistics and the 69
19 year olds remained higher so just

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:25.400
19 year olds remained higher so just
 

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:30.130
19 year olds remained higher so just
that to 25 year olds changed and there

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:30.140
that to 25 year olds changed and there
 

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.170
that to 25 year olds changed and there
were no differences when I looked at

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:32.180
were no differences when I looked at
 

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.950
were no differences when I looked at
only Hispanics statistics why did these

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960
only Hispanics statistics why did these
 

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.710
only Hispanics statistics why did these
two to five year olds lose weight in

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720
two to five year olds lose weight in
 

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.380
two to five year olds lose weight in
foster care when nobody else did and it

may not be the foster Keller itself it
 

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.880
may not be the foster Keller itself it
could be that there's a lot of research

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:45.890
could be that there's a lot of research
 

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.190
could be that there's a lot of research
about two to five year olds they're much

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:48.200
about two to five year olds they're much
 

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.680
about two to five year olds they're much
more active they go to preschool many of

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:50.690
more active they go to preschool many of
 

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.690
more active they go to preschool many of
them go to preschool it's a time when

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:52.700
them go to preschool it's a time when
 

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.270

generally kids who might have been obese

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280
generally kids who might have been obese
 

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.150
generally kids who might have been obese
when they were under two are not obese

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160
when they were under two are not obese
 

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.910
when they were under two are not obese
when they are starting to be active so I

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:00.920
when they are starting to be active so I
 

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.460
when they are starting to be active so I
I don't know whether it was foster care

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:03.470
I don't know whether it was foster care
 

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.830
I don't know whether it was foster care
that did that or it was just the natural

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:05.840
that did that or it was just the natural
 

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:10.330
that did that or it was just the natural
progression of being more active in

did I find other
the 20 to 25 year olds the kids in

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.160
the 20 to 25 year olds the kids in
 

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:31.000
the 20 to 25 year olds the kids in
foster care actually lost weight so you

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:31.010
foster care actually lost weight so you
 

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.790
foster care actually lost weight so you
know that was that they did find in and

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800
know that was that they did find in and
 

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.460
know that was that they did find in and
UK they did actually find that they

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:36.470
UK they did actually find that they
 

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:43.090
UK they did actually find that they
gained weight so from this study is

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:43.100
gained weight so from this study is
 

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.470
gained weight so from this study is
where I'm kind of going now it suggests

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.480
where I'm kind of going now it suggests
 

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.470
where I'm kind of going now it suggests
that we should do something about the

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480
that we should do something about the
 

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.760
that we should do something about the
this the kids who are six or older and

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:53.770
this the kids who are six or older and
 

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:57.430
this the kids who are six or older and
who will come into foster care obese but

00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440
who will come into foster care obese but
 

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.650
who will come into foster care obese but
there were quite a few kids who were not

00:40:59.650 --> 00:40:59.660
there were quite a few kids who were not
 

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.080
there were quite a few kids who were not
obese and became obese in foster care

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:02.090
obese and became obese in foster care
 

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:04.990

pediatricians are very stumped on what
 

00:44:06.019 --> 00:44:09.069
pediatricians are very stumped on what
to do and this they know that these kids

00:44:09.069 --> 00:44:09.079
to do and this they know that these kids
 

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:12.400
to do and this they know that these kids
need a change and this is what they can

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:12.410
need a change and this is what they can
 

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:14.410
need a change and this is what they can
think that foster care is supposed to

think that foster care is supposed to
 

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.839
think that foster care is supposed to
make that change but from my research

00:44:16.839 --> 00:44:16.849
make that change but from my research
 

00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:20.650
make that change but from my research
foster care does not treat obesity and

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:20.660
foster care does not treat obesity and
 

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.900
foster care does not treat obesity and
putting kids in foster care may also

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:22.910
putting kids in foster care may also
 

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.239
putting kids in foster care may also
increase their stress which is highly

00:44:25.239 --> 00:44:25.249
increase their stress which is highly
 

00:44:25.249 --> 00:44:27.459
increase their stress which is highly
related to obesity so there have been a

00:44:27.459 --> 00:44:27.469
related to obesity so there have been a
 

00:44:27.469 --> 00:44:30.059
related to obesity so there have been a
lot of pushback from the child welfare

00:44:30.059 --> 00:44:30.069

kids I'm going to just look at Hispanic
 

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:33.700

kids because that's what you know that's
 

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:37.900
kids because that's what you know that's
a increasing majority of kids in LA and

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:37.910
a increasing majority of kids in LA and
 

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.480
a increasing majority of kids in LA and
in California are Hispanic in foster

in California are Hispanic in foster
 

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:44.680
in California are Hispanic in foster
care and and in California more we have

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:44.690
care and and in California more we have
 

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:46.960

more Hispanics than not Hispanics in the

what happens at it in the child's life
 

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.090
what happens at it in the child's life
and I'm going to look specifically at

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:40.100
and I'm going to look specifically at
 

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:42.910
and I'm going to look specifically at
six to 11 year olds because in my study

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920
six to 11 year olds because in my study
 

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.020
six to 11 year olds because in my study
those are the kids who gained weight and

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:46.030
those are the kids who gained weight and
 

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:50.020
those are the kids who gained weight and
I want to see what's happening before we

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:50.030
I want to see what's happening before we
 

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:53.530
I want to see what's happening before we
look at what to do in placing

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:53.540
look at what to do in placing
 

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:56.920
look at what to do in placing
interventions in foster care homes there

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:56.930
interventions in foster care homes there
 

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.020
interventions in foster care homes there
is a lot of literature that says that

00:46:59.020 --> 00:46:59.030
is a lot of literature that says that
 

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:00.720
is a lot of literature that says that
home based interventions

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:00.730
home based interventions
 

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:03.420
home based interventions
are even more successful than school

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:03.430
are even more successful than school
 

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.820
are even more successful than school
based or community-wide interventions

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:05.830
based or community-wide interventions
 

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:08.520
based or community-wide interventions
for obesity but none of them has been

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:08.530
for obesity but none of them has been
 

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:11.040
for obesity but none of them has been
tested in foster homes so I think we

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:11.050
tested in foster homes so I think we
 

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:12.660
tested in foster homes so I think we
kind of need to know what's happening in

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:12.670
kind of need to know what's happening in
 

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.790
kind of need to know what's happening in
these homes before we place

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800
these homes before we place
 

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.860
these homes before we place
interventions that have been not

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:16.870
interventions that have been not
 

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:19.380
interventions that have been not
designed for foster homes in foster

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:19.390
designed for foster homes in foster
 

00:47:19.390 --> 00:47:22.320
designed for foster homes in foster
homes are there questions comments I'm

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:22.330
homes are there questions comments I'm
 

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:24.180
homes are there questions comments I'm
very interested in what you have to say

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:24.190
very interested in what you have to say
 

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:31.590
very interested in what you have to say
about what I talked about in your own

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:31.600
about what I talked about in your own
 

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.900
about what I talked about in your own
experience are any of you working with

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:33.910

kids in foster care or you are do you
find them obese or normal weight you

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:40.810
find them obese or normal weight you
 

00:47:40.810 --> 00:48:02.590
find them obese or normal weight you
haven't seen that not particularly yes

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:02.600
 

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:08.339
yes

00:48:08.339 --> 00:48:08.349
 

00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:12.829
there was a study done in Virginia by a

00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839
there was a study done in Virginia by a
 

00:48:12.839 --> 00:48:15.989
there was a study done in Virginia by a
nutrition PhD student who's finished her

00:48:15.989 --> 00:48:15.999
nutrition PhD student who's finished her
 

00:48:15.999 --> 00:48:17.940
nutrition PhD student who's finished her
program and it's going to be published

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:17.950
program and it's going to be published
 

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:21.719
program and it's going to be published
in Youth and Family Services review that

00:48:21.719 --> 00:48:21.729
in Youth and Family Services review that
 

00:48:21.729 --> 00:48:25.319
in Youth and Family Services review that
looked at the eating and activity levels

00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:25.329
looked at the eating and activity levels
 

00:48:25.329 --> 00:48:27.299
looked at the eating and activity levels
in home environment in foster homes in

00:48:27.299 --> 00:48:27.309
in home environment in foster homes in
 

00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:30.630
in home environment in foster homes in
Virginia and almost eighty percent of

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640
Virginia and almost eighty percent of
 

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.239
Virginia and almost eighty percent of
the parents in the foster homes the

00:48:33.239 --> 00:48:33.249
the parents in the foster homes the
 

00:48:33.249 --> 00:48:35.099
the parents in the foster homes the
foster care givers were obese in

00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:35.109
foster care givers were obese in
 

00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:38.729
foster care givers were obese in
Virginia and the kids were also about

00:48:38.729 --> 00:48:38.739
Virginia and the kids were also about
 

00:48:38.739 --> 00:48:40.759
Virginia and the kids were also about
the same in terms of forty to forty

00:48:40.759 --> 00:48:40.769
the same in terms of forty to forty
 

00:48:40.769 --> 00:48:43.460
the same in terms of forty to forty
about forty percent overweight and obese

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:43.470
about forty percent overweight and obese
 

00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:47.489
about forty percent overweight and obese
so I mean it's a problem because we you

00:48:47.489 --> 00:48:47.499
so I mean it's a problem because we you
 

00:48:47.499 --> 00:48:50.039
so I mean it's a problem because we you
know in your case the birth parents

00:48:50.039 --> 00:48:50.049
know in your case the birth parents
 

00:48:50.049 --> 00:48:52.109
know in your case the birth parents
enough and how about the foster parents

00:48:52.109 --> 00:48:52.119
enough and how about the foster parents
 

00:48:52.119 --> 00:49:00.870
enough and how about the foster parents
were not obese and the kids not so okay

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880
were not obese and the kids not so okay
 

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:17.819
were not obese and the kids not so okay
Oh babies yeah yeah I think that's like

00:49:17.819 --> 00:49:17.829
Oh babies yeah yeah I think that's like
 

00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:21.209
Oh babies yeah yeah I think that's like
very small kids I don't know the

00:49:21.209 --> 00:49:21.219
very small kids I don't know the
 

00:49:21.219 --> 00:49:23.579
very small kids I don't know the
necessary underweight but there's one

00:49:23.579 --> 00:49:23.589
necessary underweight but there's one
 

00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:25.979
necessary underweight but there's one
particular damn thinking he's 16 he's

00:49:25.979 --> 00:49:25.989
particular damn thinking he's 16 he's
 

00:49:25.989 --> 00:49:30.450
particular damn thinking he's 16 he's
actually in eighth grade and look at the

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:30.460
actually in eighth grade and look at the
 

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.739
actually in eighth grade and look at the
same sizes on the sixth graders okay so

00:49:33.739 --> 00:49:33.749
same sizes on the sixth graders okay so
 

00:49:33.749 --> 00:49:36.599
same sizes on the sixth graders okay so
there's like kissing both spectrums okay

00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:36.609
there's like kissing both spectrums okay
 

00:49:36.609 --> 00:49:37.520
there's like kissing both spectrums okay
I'm

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:37.530
I'm
 

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:39.710
I'm
I don't know just like the bump

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720
I don't know just like the bump
 

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.680
I don't know just like the bump
developing later or maybe has some

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:42.690
developing later or maybe has some
 

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.620
developing later or maybe has some
metabolic problem or you know we don't

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:45.630
metabolic problem or you know we don't
 

00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:49.610
metabolic problem or you know we don't
know yeah any other questions or

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:49.620
know yeah any other questions or
 

00:49:49.620 --> 00:50:09.100
know yeah any other questions or
comments you can ask them all primarily

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:09.110
 

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:14.360
we I didn't have most of the kids that

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:14.370
we I didn't have most of the kids that
 

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:17.390
we I didn't have most of the kids that
the parents are often born elsewhere but

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400
the parents are often born elsewhere but
 

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.870
the parents are often born elsewhere but
the kids are often born in LA and the

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880
the kids are often born in LA and the
 

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.700
the kids are often born in LA and the
longer the parents stay here the more

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:22.710
longer the parents stay here the more
 

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.190
longer the parents stay here the more
likely they are going to be take our

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200
likely they are going to be take our
 

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:35.060
likely they are going to be take our
lifestyle and be yes they do but these

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:35.070
lifestyle and be yes they do but these
 

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:36.830
lifestyle and be yes they do but these
are these appearance that often have

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:36.840
are these appearance that often have
 

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:38.660
are these appearance that often have
been here a long time the kids are

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:38.670
been here a long time the kids are
 

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:41.180
been here a long time the kids are
usually born here so they take our our

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:41.190
usually born here so they take our our
 

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:44.840
usually born here so they take our our
lifestyle behaviors in America and adopt

in the house it's on the weekends it's
 

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:10.990
in the house it's on the weekends it's
you know you think of other ways of

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000
you know you think of other ways of
 

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:26.920
you know you think of other ways of
doing things yes yes the dangers like to

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:26.930
doing things yes yes the dangers like to

get shopping for diamonds that happen
 

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.529
get shopping for diamonds that happen
sure and that's a lot of it why the kid

00:52:32.529 --> 00:52:32.539
sure and that's a lot of it why the kid
 

00:52:32.539 --> 00:52:34.210
sure and that's a lot of it why the kid
part of you could you know they aren't

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:34.220
part of you could you know they aren't
 

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:36.309
part of you could you know they aren't
being active if they should be good mean

00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319
being active if they should be good mean
 

00:52:36.319 --> 00:52:38.740
being active if they should be good mean
I think that's like an hour a day of

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:38.750
I think that's like an hour a day of
 

00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:40.059
I think that's like an hour a day of
activities at least five days a week

00:52:40.059 --> 00:52:40.069
activities at least five days a week
 

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:41.529

getting that yes these you're absolutely
 

00:52:48.019 --> 00:52:49.960
getting that yes these you're absolutely
right these are low-income neighborhoods

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:49.970
right these are low-income neighborhoods
 

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:54.430
right these are low-income neighborhoods
that are violent you know i don't i

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:54.440
that are violent you know i don't i
 

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.230
that are violent you know i don't i
don't know whether i can compare the

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240
don't know whether i can compare the
 

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.599
don't know whether i can compare the
violence in LA to the violence here in

00:52:58.599 --> 00:52:58.609
violence in LA to the violence here in
 

00:52:58.609 --> 00:53:01.180
violence in LA to the violence here in
New York but I mean we have very poor

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:01.190
New York but I mean we have very poor
 

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:04.329
New York but I mean we have very poor
neighborhoods and LA and many gangs just

00:53:04.329 --> 00:53:04.339
neighborhoods and LA and many gangs just
 

00:53:04.339 --> 00:53:07.809
neighborhoods and LA and many gangs just
as you do so whether the parks are

00:53:07.809 --> 00:53:07.819
as you do so whether the parks are
 

00:53:07.819 --> 00:53:09.400
as you do so whether the parks are
really available is something I'm going

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:09.410
really available is something I'm going
 

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:13.329
really available is something I'm going
to look at and it's a very good point so

00:53:13.329 --> 00:53:13.339
to look at and it's a very good point so
 

00:53:13.339 --> 00:53:16.720
to look at and it's a very good point so
I'm good when I do this should the NIH

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:16.730
I'm good when I do this should the NIH
 

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:20.950
I'm good when I do this should the NIH
choose to sit to shoot to fund me I'm

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:20.960
choose to sit to shoot to fund me I'm
 

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.970
choose to sit to shoot to fund me I'm
going to have

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:21.980
going to have
 

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.590
going to have
the kids in the same neighborhoods who

00:53:23.590 --> 00:53:23.600
the kids in the same neighborhoods who
 

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.099
the kids in the same neighborhoods who
remain at home and it remain and who go

00:53:27.099 --> 00:53:27.109
remain at home and it remain and who go
 

00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:28.780
remain at home and it remain and who go
into foster care to see if there is a

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:28.790
into foster care to see if there is a
 

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:31.690
into foster care to see if there is a
difference in terms of what foster care

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:31.700
difference in terms of what foster care
 

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.770
difference in terms of what foster care
can do for these kids but you're right

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:34.780
can do for these kids but you're right
 

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:37.990
can do for these kids but you're right
you know the recommendations for

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000
you know the recommendations for
 

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.630
you know the recommendations for
exercise sometimes cannot be done

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640
exercise sometimes cannot be done
 

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:57.359
exercise sometimes cannot be done
because of where they live absolutely

00:53:57.359 --> 00:53:57.369
 

00:53:57.369 --> 00:54:00.390
well they were more obese in group homes

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400
well they were more obese in group homes
 

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.010
well they were more obese in group homes
they were sixty percent of them were

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:03.020
they were sixty percent of them were
 

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:04.990
they were sixty percent of them were
overweight or obese but they were at

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.000
overweight or obese but they were at
 

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.120
overweight or obese but they were at
older population and you know I don't I

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.130
older population and you know I don't I
 

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:11.590
older population and you know I don't I
didn't have their medication history

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:11.600
didn't have their medication history
 

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.510
didn't have their medication history
which I hopefully will get I didn't have

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:16.520
which I hopefully will get I didn't have
 

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.510
which I hopefully will get I didn't have
pubertal status because this was a

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520
pubertal status because this was a
 

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.359
pubertal status because this was a
retrospective medical record study so i

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:22.369
retrospective medical record study so i
 

00:54:22.369 --> 00:54:25.150
retrospective medical record study so i
didn't have pubertal status which is

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160
didn't have pubertal status which is
 

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.270
didn't have pubertal status which is
important to control for so i only had

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280
important to control for so i only had
 

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.150
important to control for so i only had
all he could do the prevalence of

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160
all he could do the prevalence of
 

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:35.190
all he could do the prevalence of
obesity based on age gender ethnicity

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:35.200
obesity based on age gender ethnicity
 

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:40.090
obesity based on age gender ethnicity
and placement so absolutely that maybe

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:40.100
and placement so absolutely that maybe
 

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:44.890
and placement so absolutely that maybe
some of the reason that that they were

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:44.900
some of the reason that that they were
 

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.050
some of the reason that that they were
so overweight and obese in the group

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:47.060
so overweight and obese in the group
 

00:54:47.060 --> 00:55:13.060
so overweight and obese in the group
homes

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:13.070
 

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:16.220
yeah i mean i think that one of the

00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:16.230
yeah i mean i think that one of the
 

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:19.190
yeah i mean i think that one of the
issues is not the obesity itself which

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200
issues is not the obesity itself which
 

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.440
issues is not the obesity itself which
is you know it's detrimental to their

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:21.450
is you know it's detrimental to their
 

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:23.600
is you know it's detrimental to their
health but the fact that these kids have

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:23.610
health but the fact that these kids have
 

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:26.630
health but the fact that these kids have
the highest rates of chronic illness in

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640
the highest rates of chronic illness in
 

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.880
the highest rates of chronic illness in
the united states many of them have

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:28.890
the united states many of them have
 

00:55:28.890 --> 00:55:31.430
the united states many of them have
asthma which obesity makes it harder to

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440
asthma which obesity makes it harder to
 

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.100
asthma which obesity makes it harder to
treat so it's a combination of all those

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:34.110
treat so it's a combination of all those
 

00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:42.770
treat so it's a combination of all those
things and this is yes there is so in

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:42.780
things and this is yes there is so in
 

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:47.170
things and this is yes there is so in
this hopefully new study I'm going to

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:47.180
this hopefully new study I'm going to
 

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.340
this hopefully new study I'm going to
control for those kinds of things

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:49.350
control for those kinds of things
 

00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:51.530
control for those kinds of things
because I'll have access to that

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:51.540
because I'll have access to that
 

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:54.650
because I'll have access to that
information not just psychotropic

00:55:54.650 --> 00:55:54.660
information not just psychotropic
 

00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:57.170
information not just psychotropic
medications but it steroids and other

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180
medications but it steroids and other
 

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.810
medications but it steroids and other
kinds of medications that cause weight

00:55:59.810 --> 00:55:59.820
kinds of medications that cause weight
 

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.970
kinds of medications that cause weight
gain I'll have more information about

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:01.980
gain I'll have more information about
 

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:12.830
gain I'll have more information about
that pardon me that's ok screen time yes

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:12.840
that pardon me that's ok screen time yes
 

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.230
that pardon me that's ok screen time yes
we have a home environmental measure

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240
we have a home environmental measure
 

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:19.340
we have a home environmental measure
that looks at screen time that we're

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:19.350
that looks at screen time that we're
 

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:22.760
that looks at screen time that we're
using or we're planning on using and I

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:22.770
using or we're planning on using and I
 

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:26.030
using or we're planning on using and I
have a pediatric endocrinologist we're

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:26.040
have a pediatric endocrinologist we're
 

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.010
have a pediatric endocrinologist we're
not going to take blood even though they

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:28.020
not going to take blood even though they
 

00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:31.120
not going to take blood even though they
want me to because it's very traumatic

00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:31.130
want me to because it's very traumatic
 

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.650
want me to because it's very traumatic
going to people's homes and bringing it

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660
going to people's homes and bringing it
 

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:35.900
going to people's homes and bringing it
full botanist take blood but not they

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:35.910
full botanist take blood but not they
 

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:37.550
full botanist take blood but not they
wouldn't invite us back again I don't

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:37.560
wouldn't invite us back again I don't
 

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.040
wouldn't invite us back again I don't
think so we're going to look at there is

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:40.050
think so we're going to look at there is
 

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.480
think so we're going to look at there is
a way of looking at insulin sensitivity

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:43.490
a way of looking at insulin sensitivity
 

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:48.980
a way of looking at insulin sensitivity
through darkening in the neck I on we're

00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:48.990
through darkening in the neck I on we're
 

00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:50.810
through darkening in the neck I on we're
going to do that kind of thing so we're

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:50.820
going to do that kind of thing so we're
 

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.700
going to do that kind of thing so we're
going to estimate insulin sensitivity

00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:52.710
going to estimate insulin sensitivity
 

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:54.320
going to estimate insulin sensitivity
and we're going to do body fat

it's a it's very complicated so that

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:50.230
it's a it's very complicated so that
 

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:52.470
it's a it's very complicated so that
just placing these interventions that

01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480
just placing these interventions that
 

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:56.190
just placing these interventions that
are even for low-income families that

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200

are that are in non foster care homes
 

01:04:59.050 --> 01:05:03.300
are that are in non foster care homes
nom non maltreating homes may not be the

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:03.310
nom non maltreating homes may not be the
 

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:05.670
nom non maltreating homes may not be the
answer unless we know more about what

01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680
answer unless we know more about what
 

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.140
answer unless we know more about what
happen is happening in those

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:07.150
happen is happening in those

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:18.700
hopefully I can find some of that out so
 

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.770
hopefully I can find some of that out so
the proposition is to look at these kids

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:22.780
the proposition is to look at these kids
 

01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:28.680
the proposition is to look at these kids
a 450 families kids over a year in

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:28.690
a 450 families kids over a year in
 

01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:32.310
a 450 families kids over a year in
foster care or a year at home and doing

01:05:32.310 --> 01:05:32.320
foster care or a year at home and doing
 

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:48.200
foster care or a year at home and doing
three time points of measurements yes

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:48.210
 

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:51.210
yeah that you're very right that that

01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:51.220
yeah that you're very right that that
 

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.710
yeah that you're very right that that
could make a difference but this was a

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720
could make a difference but this was a
 

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.380
could make a difference but this was a
medical record retrieval so all I had

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:55.390
medical record retrieval so all I had
 

01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:59.340
medical record retrieval so all I had
the only information I had was that they

01:05:59.340 --> 01:05:59.350
the only information I had was that they
 

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:01.230
the only information I had was that they
were in a group home when they came and

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240
were in a group home when they came and
 

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.660
were in a group home when they came and
that that was their permanency placement

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:03.670
that that was their permanency placement
 

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:05.820
that that was their permanency placement
but definitely that could make a very

01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:05.830
but definitely that could make a very
 

01:06:05.830 --> 01:06:07.140
but definitely that could make a very
big difference about what was happening

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:07.150
big difference about what was happening
 

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:09.600
big difference about what was happening
in the group home in terms of the staff

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:09.610

01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:12.420
in the group home in terms of the staff
and the support systems that they had

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:12.430
and the support systems that they had
 

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:17.310
and the support systems that they had
within that group home or not absolutely

01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:17.320
within that group home or not absolutely
 

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.690
within that group home or not absolutely
