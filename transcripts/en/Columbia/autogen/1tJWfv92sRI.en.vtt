00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.469
secondary school majority white so there
was very few black people but it wasn't

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479
was very few black people but it wasn't
 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.870
was very few black people but it wasn't
an issue for me because um I was always

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880
an issue for me because um I was always
 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.390
an issue for me because um I was always
different do you have any memories of

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400
different do you have any memories of
 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.930
different do you have any memories of
facing any racism at the time

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940
facing any racism at the time
 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.689
facing any racism at the time
no because when I came there was this

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699
no because when I came there was this
 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.820
no because when I came there was this
whole thing and it was he surprised me

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830
whole thing and it was he surprised me
 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.110
whole thing and it was he surprised me
that in primary school and secondary

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120
that in primary school and secondary
 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.379
that in primary school and secondary
school the the children themselves my

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389
school the the children themselves my
 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.570
school the the children themselves my
peers you know had understood that

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580
peers you know had understood that
 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.810
peers you know had understood that
racism is wrong and they did they really

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820
racism is wrong and they did they really
 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.129
racism is wrong and they did they really
did not they're not like racists they

did not they're not like racists they
 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.960
did not they're not like racists they
don't like people who racist in general

don't like people who racist in general
 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.420
don't like people who racist in general
and then they knew it was wrong so you

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430
and then they knew it was wrong so you
 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.129
and then they knew it was wrong so you
know it wasn't something that I faced on

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139
know it wasn't something that I faced on
 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:08.110
know it wasn't something that I faced on
a frequent frequent basis what kind of a

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120
a frequent frequent basis what kind of a
 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.710
a frequent frequent basis what kind of a
student were you I I don't know maybe

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720
student were you I I don't know maybe
 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.750
student were you I I don't know maybe
it's cause of Africa my genes I'm the

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760
it's cause of Africa my genes I'm the
 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.339
it's cause of Africa my genes I'm the
kind of student that does my own work

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349
kind of student that does my own work
 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:22.149
kind of student that does my own work
I'm self-motivated and I think my mother

00:05:22.149 --> 00:05:22.159
I'm self-motivated and I think my mother
 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.680
I'm self-motivated and I think my mother
instilled into me that imports of

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690
instilled into me that imports of
 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.680
instilled into me that imports of
education and learning and maybe it's a

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690
education and learning and maybe it's a
 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.600
education and learning and maybe it's a
genetic thing as well that's where and

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610
genetic thing as well that's where and
 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.689
genetic thing as well that's where and
that's why I can I incline so I did I

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699
that's why I can I incline so I did I
 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.580
that's why I can I incline so I did I
did okay I mean I wasn't the brightest I

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590
did okay I mean I wasn't the brightest I
 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.500
did okay I mean I wasn't the brightest I
wasn't the best I wasn't getting a stars

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510
wasn't the best I wasn't getting a stars
 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.149
wasn't the best I wasn't getting a stars
over the time but you know I was doing

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159
over the time but you know I was doing
 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.159
over the time but you know I was doing
fine where did you go to college or

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169
fine where did you go to college or
 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.730
fine where did you go to college or
university Oh to university I actually

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740
university Oh to university I actually
 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.010
university Oh to university I actually
went to university after coming back

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020
went to university after coming back
 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.200
went to university after coming back
from Guantanamo oh yeah

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210
from Guantanamo oh yeah
 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.810
from Guantanamo oh yeah
I don't know I'm the Oh College let's go

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820
I don't know I'm the Oh College let's go
 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.180
I don't know I'm the Oh College let's go
to your for your education before water

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190
to your for your education before water
 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.020
to your for your education before water
okay

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030
okay
 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.390
okay
College was John Ruskin yeah

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400
College was John Ruskin yeah
 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.450
College was John Ruskin yeah
turning to do what I was doing my

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460
turning to do what I was doing my
 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.909
turning to do what I was doing my
a-levels

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919
 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:09.520
I kind of like I said I was going

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530
I kind of like I said I was going
 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.080
I kind of like I said I was going
through a crisis yeah I started off with

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090
through a crisis yeah I started off with
 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.580
through a crisis yeah I started off with
four levels which is unusual at that

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590
four levels which is unusual at that
 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.559
four levels which is unusual at that
time and I don't know I was doing our

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:14.569
time and I don't know I was doing our
 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:16.239
time and I don't know I was doing our
thesis I say to myself I was setting

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:16.249
thesis I say to myself I was setting
 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:18.610
thesis I say to myself I was setting
myself up for four because I guess I

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620
myself up for four because I guess I
 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.219
myself up for four because I guess I
don't know why but I said I start off

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229
don't know why but I said I start off
 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.739
don't know why but I said I start off
with four levels I think it was

00:06:22.739 --> 00:06:22.749
with four levels I think it was
 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:27.219
with four levels I think it was
chemistry physics maths was a biology

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229
chemistry physics maths was a biology
 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.140
chemistry physics maths was a biology
you know electronics and then I dropped

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150
you know electronics and then I dropped
 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.080
you know electronics and then I dropped
one just chemistry and then mass I

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090
one just chemistry and then mass I
 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.570
one just chemistry and then mass I
wasn't doing too well and then then I

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580
wasn't doing too well and then then I
 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.749
wasn't doing too well and then then I
took up general studies and basically I

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759
took up general studies and basically I
 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.369
took up general studies and basically I
just kind of scraped through and when he

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:39.379
just kind of scraped through and when he
 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.950
just kind of scraped through and when he
came to college I barely made it

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960
came to college I barely made it
 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.219
came to college I barely made it
what did you have any idea of what you

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:48.229
what did you have any idea of what you
 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:49.929
what did you have any idea of what you
were studying for what's your future

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:49.939
were studying for what's your future
 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:53.890
were studying for what's your future
would be yeah it comes from Uganda for

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:53.900
would be yeah it comes from Uganda for
 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.070
would be yeah it comes from Uganda for
me I had this thing that about welfare

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080
me I had this thing that about welfare
 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.189
me I had this thing that about welfare
that because we want you know our

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199
that because we want you know our
 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:05.709
that because we want you know our
background is poverty oh I had this

00:07:05.709 --> 00:07:05.719
background is poverty oh I had this
 

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:08.739
background is poverty oh I had this
thing that welfare was important and but

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:08.749
thing that welfare was important and but
 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:10.869
thing that welfare was important and but
I had this idea I was just a kid that

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879
I had this idea I was just a kid that
 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:14.170
I had this idea I was just a kid that
you know if you can do robots if robots

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180
you know if you can do robots if robots
 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.730
you know if you can do robots if robots
can do the work then people have more

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740
can do the work then people have more
 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.640
can do the work then people have more
leisure time so if you know so I had

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650
leisure time so if you know so I had
 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.300
leisure time so if you know so I had
this whole thing about science and

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310
this whole thing about science and
 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.619
this whole thing about science and
electronics and electronic engineering

00:07:23.619 --> 00:07:23.629
electronics and electronic engineering
 

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:24.820
electronics and electronic engineering
and then I wanted to go into neural

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830
and then I wanted to go into neural
 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.409
and then I wanted to go into neural
networks artificial neural networks

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419
networks artificial neural networks
 

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:28.209
networks artificial neural networks
because that was the next generation of

00:07:28.209 --> 00:07:28.219
because that was the next generation of
 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:30.219
because that was the next generation of
computers and that kind of thing so

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:30.229
computers and that kind of thing so
 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:33.480
computers and that kind of thing so
that's what I was looking to go into

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:33.490
that's what I was looking to go into
 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.320
that's what I was looking to go into
when you were growing up in what what

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:38.330
when you were growing up in what what
 

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.019
when you were growing up in what what
sense did you did you have of the the

00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:41.029
sense did you did you have of the the
 

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:43.329
sense did you did you have of the the
Uganda that you left behind did you

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:43.339
Uganda that you left behind did you
 

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:46.540
Uganda that you left behind did you
gather go back there did you did you did

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:46.550
gather go back there did you did you did
 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.050
gather go back there did you did you did
you stay in touch with relatives did you

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:49.060
you stay in touch with relatives did you
 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.769
you stay in touch with relatives did you
know the I think there was because I'm

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:53.779
know the I think there was because I'm
 

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:56.939
know the I think there was because I'm
growing up so I'm going from 8 to about

00:07:56.939 --> 00:07:56.949
growing up so I'm going from 8 to about
 

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:01.809
growing up so I'm going from 8 to about
1617 and because were immigrants in this

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:01.819
1617 and because were immigrants in this
 

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:03.639
1617 and because were immigrants in this
country there was restrictions on travel

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:03.649
country there was restrictions on travel
 

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.589
country there was restrictions on travel
and so forth and not going back and etc

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599
and so forth and not going back and etc
 

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:08.200
and so forth and not going back and etc
in order to get your British citizenship

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:08.210
in order to get your British citizenship
 

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.610
in order to get your British citizenship
so I think that kind of restricted us

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:09.620
so I think that kind of restricted us
 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.939
so I think that kind of restricted us
from going back and basically when we

00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:12.949
from going back and basically when we
 

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:17.040
from going back and basically when we
went back in 1999 so I was like 18 and

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.050
went back in 1999 so I was like 18 and
 

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.580
went back in 1999 so I was like 18 and
think maybe 19 I think 18 in terms of

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:20.590
think maybe 19 I think 18 in terms of
 

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.469
think maybe 19 I think 18 in terms of
keeping in touch I don't know why but it

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479
keeping in touch I don't know why but it
 

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:26.700
keeping in touch I don't know why but it
just doesn't seem that that side of the

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:26.710
just doesn't seem that that side of the
 

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.920
just doesn't seem that that side of the
family I don't know what happened but we

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:28.930
family I don't know what happened but we
 

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.869
family I don't know what happened but we
never kept in touch my mother keeps in

00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879
never kept in touch my mother keeps in
 

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:31.050
never kept in touch my mother keeps in
touch

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:31.060
touch
 

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.909
touch
obviously her brothers and sisters my

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:41.320
I knew there was a third truth out there
I was searching for the truth but you

know I was and Buddhism wasn't and
 

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.970
know I was and Buddhism wasn't and
Christianity wasn't it and it was just

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:45.980
Christianity wasn't it and it was just
 

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.220

like you know I couldn't find it so

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:48.230
like you know I couldn't find it so
 

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.210
like you know I couldn't find it so
obviously if you're searching for

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:49.220
obviously if you're searching for
 

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.340
obviously if you're searching for
something that you know you don't it's

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:54.350
something that you know you don't it's
 

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.380
something that you know you don't it's
not like I knew it's like I read it in a

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:56.390
not like I knew it's like I read it in a
 

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:57.610
not like I knew it's like I read it in a
book somewhere and I forgot what the

00:19:57.610 --> 00:19:57.620
book somewhere and I forgot what the
 

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.750
book somewhere and I forgot what the
book was and I were to search from the

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760
book was and I were to search from the
 

00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.950
book was and I were to search from the
book you know he's just something innate

00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960
book you know he's just something innate
 

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.420
book you know he's just something innate
in yourself that you know that the truth

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:01.430
in yourself that you know that the truth
 

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.130
in yourself that you know that the truth
is out there but sometimes you've maybe

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:03.140
is out there but sometimes you've maybe
 

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.570
is out there but sometimes you've maybe
become disillusioned maybe think

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:04.580
become disillusioned maybe think
 

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.640
become disillusioned maybe think
yourself you're fooling yourself by that

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:06.650
yourself you're fooling yourself by that
 

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.770
yourself you're fooling yourself by that
so that's the kind of battle those I

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:08.780
so that's the kind of battle those I
 

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.570
so that's the kind of battle those I
think that I knew that reader truth was

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:10.580
think that I knew that reader truth was
 

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.100
think that I knew that reader truth was
out there but it was only more of a hope

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:12.110
out there but it was only more of a hope
 

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.040
out there but it was only more of a hope
and obviously hope can can can rise and

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:15.050
and obviously hope can can can rise and
 

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.200
and obviously hope can can can rise and
fall but it was just hope because I

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.210
fall but it was just hope because I
 

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.390
fall but it was just hope because I
didn't I didn't have anything definite I

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400
didn't I didn't have anything definite I
 

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.160
didn't I didn't have anything definite I
hadn't seen it it wasn't a flicker I

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.170
hadn't seen it it wasn't a flicker I
 

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.910
hadn't seen it it wasn't a flicker I
hadn't someone told me about everybody's

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:23.920
hadn't someone told me about everybody's
 

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.990
hadn't someone told me about everybody's

approx over there I don't know I had to
 

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.070
approx over there I don't know I had to
go search for it was just something

within myself telling me that there is a
truth early and you know but you know

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:35.630
truth early and you know but you know
 

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.720
truth early and you know but you know
when you become disillusioned and you

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:37.730
when you become disillusioned and you
 

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.450
when you become disillusioned and you
start losing hopes and mr. atheism and

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:40.460
start losing hopes and mr. atheism and
 

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.040
start losing hopes and mr. atheism and
with atheism the world just becomes a

yourself how can you find friends who

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:04.940
yourself how can you find friends who
 

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.150
yourself how can you find friends who
have the somewhat similar values and a

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:07.160
have the somewhat similar values and a
 

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.460
have the somewhat similar values and a
similar outlook when you don't know your

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:09.470
similar outlook when you don't know your
 

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.430
similar outlook when you don't know your
own values or your outlook that's oh

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440
own values or your outlook that's oh
 

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.450
own values or your outlook that's oh
yeah

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:13.460
yeah
 

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:18.070
yeah
so really like I said atheism was kind

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080
so really like I said atheism was kind
 

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.140
so really like I said atheism was kind
of winning and then but it was

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:20.150
of winning and then but it was
 

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.600
of winning and then but it was
necessarily I was broken down so things

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:22.610
necessarily I was broken down so things
 

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.590
necessarily I was broken down so things
had to become hard until I cracked and

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600
had to become hard until I cracked and
 

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.400
had to become hard until I cracked and
basically there was I just remember

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:27.410
basically there was I just remember
 

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:30.070
basically there was I just remember
being in my room and then saying oh god

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080
being in my room and then saying oh god
 

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:30.520
being in my room and then saying oh god
help me

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:30.530
help me
 

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:32.800
help me
now this is very strange because you

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:32.810
now this is very strange because you
 

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.150
now this is very strange because you
know before I didn't believe in God and

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:34.160
know before I didn't believe in God and
 

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.770
know before I didn't believe in God and
with Zen Buddhism you don't believe in

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:35.780
with Zen Buddhism you don't believe in
 

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.470
with Zen Buddhism you don't believe in
God you don't believe in God but you

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480
God you don't believe in God but you
 

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.170
God you don't believe in God but you
know I asked God to help me and then but

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:41.180
know I asked God to help me and then but
 

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.300
know I asked God to help me and then but
then I got angry and because it helped

an Afghan I remember on a bike who was
 

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:22.370
an Afghan I remember on a bike who was
kind of just riding out in that area and

00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380
kind of just riding out in that area and
 

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:23.720
kind of just riding out in that area and
it's kind of outskirts I'm wondering

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:23.730
it's kind of outskirts I'm wondering
 

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:25.039
it's kind of outskirts I'm wondering
whether he's kind of doing recon for

00:57:25.039 --> 00:57:25.049
whether he's kind of doing recon for
 

00:57:25.049 --> 00:57:26.720
whether he's kind of doing recon for
someone and then you know he's he

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:26.730
someone and then you know he's he
 

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:29.000
someone and then you know he's he
spotted us like you know the foreigners

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:29.010
spotted us like you know the foreigners
 

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.589
spotted us like you know the foreigners
and and that's why the bombs are hitting

00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599
and and that's why the bombs are hitting
 

00:57:30.599 --> 00:57:32.630
and and that's why the bombs are hitting
so close so basically I thought to

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640
so close so basically I thought to
 

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.089
so close so basically I thought to
myself I'm not gonna sleep here where

00:57:35.089 --> 00:57:35.099
myself I'm not gonna sleep here where
 

00:57:35.099 --> 00:57:36.440

the snake and the text or whatever he

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:36.450

said I'm gonna sleep and one of the bomb
 

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:40.400
said I'm gonna sleep and one of the bomb
craters so I thought I thought we was

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:40.410

safer to sleep one of the bomb craters

00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:42.680

that's the only thought of it I'm not
 

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:28.260
that's the only thought of it I'm not
breathing so the dry riverbed kind of

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:28.270
breathing so the dry riverbed kind of
 

01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:29.519
breathing so the dry riverbed kind of
went straight and then turned around the

01:00:29.519 --> 01:00:29.529
went straight and then turned around the
 

01:00:29.529 --> 01:00:30.539
went straight and then turned around the
corner and I'm just thinking is gonna

01:00:30.539 --> 01:00:30.549
corner and I'm just thinking is gonna
 

01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:31.740

made it around the corner because I
 

01:00:37.359 --> 01:00:39.329

you know we get far so I made it around
 

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:48.320
you know we get far so I made it around
the corner and obviously I'm clamoring

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:48.330
the corner and obviously I'm clamoring
 

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:51.050
the corner and obviously I'm clamoring
so I just kind of just try to get away

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:51.060
so I just kind of just try to get away
 

01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:53.900
so I just kind of just try to get away
from that place as quickly as possible

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:53.910
from that place as quickly as possible
 

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:57.350
from that place as quickly as possible
and you know I got down the dry riverbed

01:00:57.350 --> 01:00:57.360
and you know I got down the dry riverbed
 

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.010

I got over the top and went on the bank
 

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.560
I got over the top and went on the bank
of the other side and I just hid in the

of the other side and I just hid in the
 

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:07.070
of the other side and I just hid in the
kind of depression and I remainder and

can see somewhere for their long time
 

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:16.670
can see somewhere for their long time
very far and I'm not really gonna get

01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680
very far and I'm not really gonna get
 

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.680

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:19.820
away and if they decided to shoot me I'm
sure they could shoot me from a distance

small jam jars one was broken in that
 

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:21.109
small jam jars one was broken in that
way I knew there was a river in the

01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119
way I knew there was a river in the
 

01:02:21.119 --> 01:02:24.349
way I knew there was a river in the
distance away from candy hearts of my

01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359
distance away from candy hearts of my
 

01:02:24.359 --> 01:02:26.990
distance away from candy hearts of my
priority was water so I made my way

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000
priority was water so I made my way
 

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.320
priority was water so I made my way
there and it's just you're making my way

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:30.330
there and it's just you're making my way
 

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:32.630
there and it's just you're making my way
across the open plain and then I

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640
across the open plain and then I
 

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.510
across the open plain and then I
remember passing one Afghan I saw him in

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520
remember passing one Afghan I saw him in
 

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.670
remember passing one Afghan I saw him in
a distance and he saw me because the

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680
a distance and he saw me because the
 

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.750
a distance and he saw me because the
Afghans I have this thing they don't

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760
Afghans I have this thing they don't
 

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.700

walking past they just walk everywhere

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:40.710
walking past they just walk everywhere
 

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:42.950
walking past they just walk everywhere
so there's no way you can walk in the in

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960
so there's no way you can walk in the in
 

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:45.230
so there's no way you can walk in the in
the open kind of in the wilderness and

01:02:45.230 --> 01:02:45.240
the open kind of in the wilderness and
 

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.460
the open kind of in the wilderness and
not come across an Afghan they're always

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:46.470
not come across an Afghan they're always
 

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:48.410
not come across an Afghan they're always
there so I don't know what's the problem

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420
there so I don't know what's the problem
 

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:52.640
there so I don't know what's the problem
but that's it so this guy had a
