00:00:00.628 --> 00:00:02.636
- [Voiceover] How many more bikes does

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:06.049
Bike World have than Bikes R Us?

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.973
So let's compare Bike World to Bikes R Us.

00:00:09.973 --> 00:00:12.539
So Bike World is right over here

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.837
and we see that Bike World,

00:00:14.837 --> 00:00:18.378
if we just look at this right over here,

00:00:18.378 --> 00:00:21.280
Bike World has 19 bikes,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.463
has 19 bikes.

00:00:23.463 --> 00:00:27.425
And they wanted us to compare
Bike World to Bikes R Us

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:30.150
and say how many more
bikes does Bike World have

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.968
than Bikes R Us?

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:33.761
So Bike World has 19,

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:35.893
how many does Bikes R Us have?

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:38.346
This is Bikes R Us right over here,

00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:40.818
Bikes R Us has,

00:00:40.818 --> 00:00:43.721
Bikes R Us has 12 bicycles.

00:00:43.721 --> 00:00:47.389
So how many more does Bike
World have than Bikes R Us?

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:50.082
Well we can just subtract
Bikes R Us's number

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:53.321
of bikes from Bike World's, 19 minus 12.

00:00:53.321 --> 00:00:55.492
What is that going to be?

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:56.943
Well if we look at the ones place,

00:00:56.943 --> 00:00:59.509
nine ones minus two ones is seven ones,

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.028
and then one ten minus one ten is no tens.

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:04.501
I could write no tens there
but I don't have to write that.

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.088
So there's seven more bikes
at Bike World than Bikes R Us.

00:01:08.088 --> 00:01:09.492
And you can also see it here.

00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:12.012
If you start at Bikes R Us,

00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:13.416
If you were to start at Bikes R Us

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:14.968
and you wanted to go

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:15.978
and you wanted to see how many more bikes

00:01:15.978 --> 00:01:18.327
would I have to get to the same number

00:01:18.327 --> 00:01:20.324
of bikes as Bike World,

00:01:20.324 --> 00:01:23.656
you would see that you would
have to go from 12 to 19,

00:01:23.656 --> 00:01:26.082
or you would have to add seven bikes,

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:29.843
or that Bike World has seven
more bicycles than Bikes R Us,

00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:34.278
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:37.737
So how many more bikes does
Bike World have than Bikes R Us?

00:01:37.737 --> 00:01:40.765
It has seven more bikes.
