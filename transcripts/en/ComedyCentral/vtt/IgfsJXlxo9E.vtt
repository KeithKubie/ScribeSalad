00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:01.968
Hello.

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:05.271
My name's Alison Rich.

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:07.373
Today we're gonna be talking
about Edie Windsor

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:11.144
and the end of DOMA,
the Defense of Marriage Act.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:12.779
Cheers. Come on.
Cheers!

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.313
I feel like
I could puke tonight.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.115
You know what?
Let's do it.

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.017
Tonight's the night to puke.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.685
Yeah. Let's just get it
all out of us.

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:22.488
 So the year is 1950.

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:25.158
 The place is
 the United States of A.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.027
 At this point in history,
 it's not even legal

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.230
 to dance closely to a person
 of the same sex.

00:00:31.263 --> 00:00:33.833
 So Edie Windsor
 was a young lesbian.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.203
 She's like, “Oh, I gotta keep
 my personal life private,

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:40.706
 'cause this is the past,
 and the past is closed-minded”"

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.643
So then - 
I'm talking about gay stuff.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.411
[Laughs]

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.713
So then, Edie is
in Greenwich Village,

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:51.851
 and she notices a beautiful,
 leggy brunette.

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:54.887
 She goes, “Hey.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.523
 Are you... 
 Can I dance with you?”

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:01.160
 The woman goes, “Hello. My name
 is Thea Spyer, and yes.”

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.895
 That's a great name.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:04.464
We've got Edie Windsor
and Thea Spyer.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.332
Two, like, cool lesbian names.
Yeah.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.134
You know?
And then Edie goes,

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:09.902
 “Is your dance card full?”

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.772
 Which is an old-timey way
 of being like, “You single?”

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.508
 And she goes, “It is now.”

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:19.645
 Meaning, “I'm ready to...
 bump clams.”

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:21.447
[Laughs]

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.483
Is that... I don't know
if that's offensive.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.151
A clam? No. They have
pearls in them.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.919
Yes.
Pussy pearls!

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:28.421
Pussy pearls!

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.190
 So then they date,
 and they fall in love.

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:35.995
 But then, on June 28, 1969,

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.964
 she encounters
 the Stonewall riots,

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.800
 where gay people
 were being out and proud

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.502
 about who they were
 amid this police raid

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:44.470
 at the Stonewall Inn.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:45.938
 So she goes home
 and she's like,

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.674
 “Thea, there's a big riot
 at Stonewall about gay rights.

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:51.010
 Maybe this is the moment
 that we should come out

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:54.080
 and - and tell the world
 who we really are.”

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.681
 So she's like, “Hmm.
 I don't know.

00:01:55.714 --> 00:01:57.617
 That's really risky.
 Maybe not.”

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.085
 So Edie and Thea are like,
 “You know what?

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:00.553
 We're not revolutionaries.

00:02:00.586 --> 00:02:02.622
 We're just two ladies.
 We're in love

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.724
 and like to dance, and we're
 gonna be private about it.”

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:08.528
And they do that
for the next 30 years.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:09.929
That's a long time.

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:12.031
And the thing that
they really bonded over

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:13.699
was dancing.

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.635
 In any situation, their
 bodies could always connect

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:16.736
 through dance.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.838
 And it's about 2007 now,

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.040
 and Thea was in a wheelchair
 with M.S.

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:22.942
 Thea was like,
 “I want to get married.”

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:26.479
 By this time, Canada had
 made gay marriage legal.

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:30.449
 So Thea and Edie
 go to Toronto,

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:32.552
 and they get married
 in front of six buddies.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.487
 They exchange rings,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.255
 and Edie and Thea
 are like, “Whoa.

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:38.090
 This feels different.

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:41.027
 To truly be married, like... 
 There's a tangible difference.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.461
 This is not bullshit.”

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.230
That's very sweet
to be like, I'm...

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:45.565
To flaunt the laws.

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:46.599
Yeah!

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:48.334
 “F**k those laws.”

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:50.937
 So in 2009, Thea dies.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.572
 And Edie is there
 in the hospital,

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.040
 and she's like,
 “You know what?

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:56.309
 I had a good life.
 We had a beautiful love.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.044
 What more could I ask for?”

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.879
 And then:
 “Knock, knock, knock!”

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:01.948
 The U.S. government says,

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:05.184
 “Hey! So you're friend Thea

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:08.721
 left you a bunch of
 property, money, assets.

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:11.157
 And we don't recognize that,
 'cause you're two ladies.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.226
 It's not like
 you were married,

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:17.163
 so we're gonna tax you
 on the order of half a millio”"

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:19.699
 And Edie goes, “Bitch,
 you know we were married,

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:22.201
 and this is
 discrimi-f**king-nation.

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:23.736
 I'm gonna call
 a bunch of lawyers.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.771
 I'm gonna call a bunch
 of gay rights activists.”

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:28.207
 Um, so then she says,
 “Excuse me,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.076
 I was in a relationship
 with this woman for forever.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.411
 We got married in Toronto.
 This is legit.

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:34.013
 They're not recognizing
 the marriage,

00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:35.748
 and they're trying
 to tax the shit outta me.”

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:37.583
 And the lawyers
 and activists are like,

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.619
 “Yeah. That's DOMA, you know?

00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:42.388
 Since 1996, this law
 was enacted that says,

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:45.157
 on a federal level, a marriage
 is between a man and a woman,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.861
 and it's just unde...
 indefeatable. Undefeatable?

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:50.930
 In...?
 You can't do it.”

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:55.434
But then Edie calls
Roberta “Robbie” Kaplan.

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:58.037
Is her name
Roberta “Robbie” Kaplan?

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.172
Her fun name is Robbie.
Oh.

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.775
 Her name is Roberta Kaplan.
 And this woman goes,

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.510
 “You know what?
 I'll take you on.

00:04:04.543 --> 00:04:06.946
 You're what
 marriage is about.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:08.814
 You two were married
 for decades,

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.349
 through sickness
 and in health.

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:12.151
 You're a sweet old woman.

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:15.721
 You're the perfect example
 of what gay marriage can be.”

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:19.258
So Roberta and Edie...
Mm-hmm.

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.193
...sue the federal government,

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:23.095
 and it goes all the way
 to the Supreme Court.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:25.131
 And Edie goes
 before them and says,

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:28.701
 “If my love isn't real,
 no f**king love is real.

00:04:28.734 --> 00:04:31.270
 We were together for so long.

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:35.041
 Our love deserves to be
 recognized.”

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:37.209
Wow.
[Laughs]

00:04:37.242 --> 00:04:39.211
[Laughs]

00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:41.748
It's actually
very classy.

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:47.153
OK.

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:48.554
[Laughs]

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:54.060
So on June 26, 2013,
Edie and her supporters

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:56.862
 gather around a computer.
 Pops up on the screen:

00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:59.598
 “DOMA is unconstitutional,
 5-4.”

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:02.535
 And everyone's like, “Woo!

00:05:02.568 --> 00:05:04.303
Ooh-ooh!”

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:07.073
 [Cheering]

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:10.443
 “If I cheer too hard,
 I'm gonna pee my pants.”

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.912
 So she goes back to Stonewall
 in Greenwich Village.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:15.414
 And crowds were gathered,
 and they went,

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:18.617
 “Edie! Edie! Edie!”

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.287
 And Edie thought to herself,
 “Wow. Years ago,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.823
 when I walked past here
 during the Stonewall riots,

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:26.392
 me and Thea thought,
 we're not revolutionaries.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:28.027
 But here we are, years later,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.995
 and we are
 the revolutionaries.

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:32.698
 We're the face of what
 gay marriage can be.”

00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:35.935
 And Edie dances

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:38.137
 one last dance

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.006
 in the name of the love
 of her life,

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.575
 Thea.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.477
To Thea!
To Thea.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.711
And Edie.
And Edie.

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:47.646
Whoa!
It's beautiful.

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:49.482
That's amazing.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:50.983
Thanks to this
one brave woman

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:53.786
and her belief in
the equality of her love,

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:55.454
gay marriage became legal.

00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:58.591
Do you think,
in memory of them,

00:05:58.624 --> 00:05:59.725
that you and I should dance?

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:01.060
We should dance so close.

00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:04.864
Well, can I give you
a quick peck?

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.432
[Laughs]

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:08.501
One...
Two...three!

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:11.104
Mwah!
Awwww.
