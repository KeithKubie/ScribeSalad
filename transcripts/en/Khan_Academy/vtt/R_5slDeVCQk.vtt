00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.400
In the last video, I talk about
how there's multiple

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.340
ways to define return
on asset.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.690
This is given in some textbooks
and maybe some

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.490
professors would give this in
a finance class: net income

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.600
divided by assets.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.410
If you look on Wikipedia, they
say it's net income plus

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.030
interest minus tax savings
from interest. So notice,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.270
they're not adding back
all of the taxes.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.440
They're still taking taxes
into consideration, but

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.350
they're saying you're not
getting any tax deduction from

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.770
your interest. So we'll talk
about that in a second.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.860
So this kind of still does
factor in taxes.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.400
This one definitely does
and interest as well.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.280
And then there are these
two other ones.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.340
One was operating profit divided
by asset, which is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.500
what I gave in the
first video.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.070
It really just is kind of a
simplifying assumption and

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.190
really to give you the intuition
in my mind of what

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.560
ROA really is about, of how good
is a company at operating

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.280
its assets, at actually getting
a return from them.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.090
And then a slightly more general
definition would be

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.020
EBIT divided by assets. and we
talk about the fact that EBIT

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.730
is just net income plus interest
plus taxes, or

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.160
another way to think about it,
it's operating profit plus

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.010
non-operating profit. so any
other type of profit that the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.880
company might have gotten from
some assets that it owns that

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.990
actually aren't essential
to actually

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.200
managing the business.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.840
But then in the last part of
the video, I talk about you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.610
have these definitions out here,
but I don't like using

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.100
them as much, and then I ran
out of time, and I said I

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.090
would cover in this video why I
don't like using it as much.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.510
I think the best way to talk
about it is with an example.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.095
So let's say I have
two companies.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.600
I want to do thicker lines.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.100
So I have one company here.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.050
Say they have the same
amount of assets.

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.290
That's one company, and then
this is the other company

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.140
right here, and I'm drawing the
left-hand side of their

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.600
balance sheets.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.850
These are the assets.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.840
Now let's say that they're the
same amount, so they have $10

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.230
million of assets.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.620
And let's say that these are the
actual ROA's as the way I

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.760
calculated them.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.980
So this is your EBIT divided
by total assets.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.230
So if EBIT is 10% of this, that
means that this guy is

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.850
spitting out 10%, which would
be $1 million of EBIT.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.840
And in a world where there's no
non-operating profit, this

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.930
you could view as operating
profit.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.530
Remember, EBIT is just
Earnings Before

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.450
Interest and Taxes.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.300
Let's go back to that income
statement that

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.340
we started off with.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.720
EBIT is Earnings Before
Interest and Taxes.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.800
So if you add back interest and
taxes, you essentially get

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.310
back to operating profit unless
there's a little bit of

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.510
non-operating profit
right here.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.320
So that's the way to
think about EBIT.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.170
For most functional purposes,
unless you're talking about

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.080
like a financial statement, most
firms that aren't doing

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.160
anything too fancy on their
non-operating side of their

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.770
balance sheet, EBIT and
operating profit are pretty

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.060
close to each other.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.500
But anyway, in this case
this guy's generating

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.690
$1 million of EBIT.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.150
And let's say that this company,
Company B-- we'll

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.340
label these as Company
A, this is Company B.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:32.470
Company B, it's getting a 15%
EBIT return on its assets, so

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.490
it's generating $1.5 million
in EBIT per year.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.470
So just when I look at the
left-hand sides of the balance

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.940
sheet-- I haven't drawn the
right-hand side yet-- I would

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.670
say that this guy is a better
manager of these assets.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.450
He's better at extracting value,
given the amount of

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.410
capital that has been put
into this company.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.430
So that's why I like the
definition of EBIT divided by

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.000
assets, or operating profit
divided by assets.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.580
Now, let's give a situation
where this guy

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.920
has very little debt.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.350
Let's say he has no debt and
he has all equity, so the

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.110
right-hand side of his balance
sheet looks like this.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.460
Let's say he has no liabilities
of significance.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.910
He has no liabilities
of significance,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.160
so this is all equity.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.680
So when you want to figure out
this guy's pre-tax income, you

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.480
take EBIT minus-- actually, let
me move the window down a

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.470
little bit.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.880
You take EBIT minus interest
to get pre-tax.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.960
So how much pre-tax
does he have?

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.340
Pre-tax earnings?

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.580
Well, he has no debt, right?

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.420
So he has no interest. So his
pre-tax earnings, or you can

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.060
call it, which no one else ever
does, is EBT, which you

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.290
don't want to say because it
sounds like EBIT, but Earnings

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.400
Before Taxes.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.420
No one ever says EBT.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.110
They always say pre-tax.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.720
But that would also
be $1 million.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.830
And then if you go even further,
and you say, this guy

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.840
for some reason, he had a bunch
of tax credits this year

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.090
or he had some losses last
year that he was able to

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.370
offset to use against his taxes,
so this year, he also

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.570
didn't have to pay any taxes.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:36.200
So his earnings or his net
income is also $1 million.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.440
Fair enough.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.530
So this guy has a 10% EBIT
return on his assets, but his

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.110
earnings or his net income
is also this $1 million.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.790
Now let's say this guy over
here, he has a little bit more

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.100
debt on his balance sheet.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.380
Let's say it's similar to the
first example we did, so let

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.090
me draw that.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.600
So let's say he has $5
million of debt.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.340
But the amount isn't
necessarily the

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.000
most important thing.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.780
So he has $5 million of
debt or liabilities.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.940
Liabilities could be other
things as well.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.370
It could be he owes pension
liabilities or

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.740
who knows what else.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.670
So he has $5 million of debt,
but the important thing is he

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.790
has interest. So every year,
let's say he has to pay

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.570
$500,000 in interest.
He's paying 10%

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.010
interest on his debt.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.340
10% of $5 million is $500,000.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.865
So his pre-tax-- let's do the
bottom part of his balance

00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:36.550
sheet-- his EBIT, his Earnings
Before Interest and Taxes, is

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:42.680
$1.5 million, but then if you
want to subtract out interest,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:48.230
you'd subtract out minus $0.5
million, $500,000, and so his

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:55.940
pre-tax is going to
be $1 million.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.770
And now this guy also-- so
essentially the equity holder

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.420
before paying tax --this
is equity here.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.140
He has $5 million of equity.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.230
This guy had $10 million
right here.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.670
And this is pre-tax.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.800
He has to pay the 30% like we
did in the previous example.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.270
He has to pay 30% on taxes.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:19.500
So his net income will
be $700,000, right?

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.490
Because he has $1 million
pre-tax, he has to pay

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.900
$300,000 in taxes, so he has
a $700,000 net income.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.130
Now, let's look at what we would
get in terms of an ROA

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.340
if we did it using this
definition that some textbooks

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.790
will give you.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.200
For the first guy, his net
earnings are $1 million and

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.760
his assets were $10 million.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:50.760
So by this definition up here,
Company A has a 10% ROA.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.140
By that definition over here,
this guy made $700,000 of net

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.620
income off of $10 million, so
he is going to be making an

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.800
ROA of what? $700,000
divided by 10 is 7%.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.000
So now if you just look
superficially at these numbers

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.070
as defined by this ratio right
here, you'll say, oh, this

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:12.610
guy, Company A, has a better
return on asset.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.030
He's better at managing
his assets.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.330
And you know that that's
completely false.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.660
Company A was getting
a much lower EBIT

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.630
return on his assets.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.790
He was only getting 10%.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.610
This guy was getting 15%.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.960
Company A was just better at,
one, it didn't have any debt,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.140
and it was also better at
maybe this year avoiding

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.230
paying taxes.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.030
So when you talk about ROA,
there are other ratios that

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:41.159
start factoring in how good is
a company at financing its

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.990
assets and how good is a
company at paying taxes

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.800
efficiently, which is just
another way of evading as many

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.510
taxes as possible.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.020
But that's a separate ratio.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.940
Return on asset to me says, what
does a company do with

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.770
the left-hand side of
the balance sheet?

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.280
And when you do the net income
version, you're factoring

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.760
things in like interest and
taxes, and then you're

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.320
muddying up the picture.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.950
You're not telling me which
company is better at actually

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.070
giving a return just on its
assets, not how it actually

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.430
pays for its assets.

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:16.740
This definition that Wikipedia
gives-- and it's good to be

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.470
aware of all of them, because
I don't want you to watch

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:19.840
these videos and say, oh, no.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.860
Sal said it's operating profit
divided by asset, or EBIT

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.900
divided by asset.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.830
It's good to know these so that
these aren't unfamiliar

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.600
terms to you.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.420
What I'm telling you is that
this definition is more of a

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.130
real intuitive sense of what
a company's doing with its

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:38.930
assets, while these are kind
of textbook definitions.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.950
This one attempts to add back
interest. It adds back

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:47.620
interest, so just the interest
part between this company and

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.800
this company won't differentiate
between the two.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.490
But this one does take into
account which company is good

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.210
or bad at paying taxes.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.660
And I realize I'm out of time.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.780
In the next video, maybe I'll
talk a little bit more in

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.000
depth about the tax savings from
interest, because it's an

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.240
interesting concept
right there.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.110
But I think I'm getting a little
bit into the weeds now,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.550
because I want to kind of get
back high level and give you

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.080
an overarching view of how you
can think about investments

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.490
and price to earnings
and whatever else.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.780
I'll focus back on that
on the next video.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.200
See you soon.
