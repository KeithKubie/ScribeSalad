SPEAKER 1: Please help me
welcome to the stage Tara Mohr.

00:00:04.885 --> 00:00:05.570
TARA MOHR: Yeah.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.592
Thank you.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.740
Thank you for having me.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.310
Everybody can hear me OK?

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.030
Great.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.200
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.650
This is the neck of the woods
where I grew up, actually.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.720
So nice to be back
down on the peninsula.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.800
And I'm really thrilled to
be talking with all of you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.950
about women playing big,
how we end up playing small,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.830
and how we can play bigger.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.790
And I want to begin by
sharing with you why I started

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.620
doing this work and
how I came to be

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.990
thinking about these topics.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.580
About 10 years
ago, I was starting

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.290
to make a big transition
in my own career.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.300
I had identified
that I didn't really

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.780
love the work I was doing.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.520
And I wanted to
be doing work that

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.630
dealt with people's
inner lives and helping

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.650
them create the lives and
careers they really wanted.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.860
And I didn't know exactly
what that would look like.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.790
But I thought coaching would
have something to do with it.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.230
And so I had gotten
trained as a coach.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.080
And while I was still
working full-time

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.860
in another job during the
evenings and the weekends,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.820
I was squeezing in this
exploration of this new area

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.350
and starting to
coach mostly friends

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.630
of friends and
colleagues of colleagues

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.490
who had heard I was
exploring coaching

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.720
and starting a little
coaching practice.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.970
And most of the women that
came to that practice I

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.310
had the exact same response to.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.330
I would sit across from these
women in a coaching session

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.790
and get to hear about their
dreams, what they wanted

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.510
for their careers, what
they saw that was happening

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.400
in their company or
their organization

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.160
that they had a critique of or
a better vision for what they

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.950
thought their
industry was missing.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.800
I got to hear all of
these amazing reflections

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.660
of their insights
and their brilliance.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.550
And I just became so inspired
by every single one of them.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.389
By the ideas they had,
by their thoughtfulness,

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:15.920
by how ethical and conscientious
they were in their approach

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.290
to their work.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.400
And so I just wanted
to see them leading

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.220
and having more influence
and power in our world.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.640
And yet over and
over and over again

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.230
I heard the same
things from them.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.850
I'm not ready yet to
take that next step.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.930
I probably need
more training first.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.110
I need a few more
years experience.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.047
Don't I need another degree?

00:02:41.047 --> 00:02:42.630
If that was a good
idea, someone would

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.540
have thought of it already.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.000
Let me think about that more
and do more research on it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.980
before I do anything about it.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.690
And I started to
feel really pained

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.850
by this, because as we all know,
we look in the news headlines

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.820
or we see the decisions that
are being made by people

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.770
in leadership, and
we know that seems

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.290
like our world deserves better.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.330
And here I was sitting
across from these women.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.190
And I thought this is the
better that we deserve.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.530
And yet it's somehow not--
that brilliance isn't really

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.410
making it to the seats of power
and the places of influence

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.770
where it deserves to be.

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.410
And so that phenomenon--
that gap between potential

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.010
and how people saw themselves
I needed a shorthand way

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.020
to label.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.440
And "playing small" seemed
like a good term for it.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.170
At about the same
time, I had started

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.820
blogging about
personal growth topics

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.650
and professional
development topics.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.800
And a few years into blogging,
my readership had grown.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.590
And I got very curious to learn
more about who was reading

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.940
and why.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.310
And so I sent out a
survey to my readers.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.970
And in the survey,
one of the questions

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.550
was, what's the biggest
challenge in your life?

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.050
Right.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.130
Probably many of you
know from your work,

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.902
that's a great market
research question.

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:03.860
You want to know what
are people feeling pained

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.180
by and challenged by.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.900
And knowing that most of
my readers were women,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.330
I had this list of options
on the multiple choice survey

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.240
of things I thought
might be the biggest

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.830
challenge in their life.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.620
So of course, I put
work/family balance on there,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.029
because that's what everybody
talks about as a huge challenge

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.670
in women's lives.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.190
I put health issues up
there, and financial issues,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.760
relationship challenges.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.900
I'm not sure what I
want, a whole host

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.550
of things from different
domains of life.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.670
Then I looked at that
list and I thought,

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.320
there's actually
nothing on that list

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.730
that reflects what I'm hearing
from women in my coaching

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.080
practice.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.970
And so kind of on
a whim I added,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.010
"I'm playing small" as
a possible challenge

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.130
that people could choose.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.160
And when the
responses came back,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.750
that was what the
most women said

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.580
was the biggest
challenge in their life.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.060
I'm playing small.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.660
And that was so striking
to me that so many of us

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.280
are walking around with some
sense that we're playing small.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.390
And we feel challenged
by it, meaning

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.870
we must somehow be stuck there.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.130
We don't know how to
fix that or change it.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.600
And so that became the
focus of my work-- trying

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.890
to understand why
are we playing small,

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.000
and then most importantly,
what really makes a difference.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.730
What makes a difference so we
stop saying, I'm not ready yet,

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.150
we stop saying I need
more qualifications,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.110
we start sharing more of
ourselves more bravely.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.020
And I found through
my coaching practice

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.150
that there really were some
tools and some new pieces

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.280
of knowledge, and some
everyday moment-to-moment

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.430
practices we could do
that produced really

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.410
big change for people quite
consistently, whether they were

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.730
in a junior or senior
level of their career,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.790
whether they were working in
business or the social sector,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.210
whether they were entrepreneurs
or inside a large organization.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.250
The fundamentals of change that
needed to happen were the same.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.900
And those fundamentals
became the basis for the work

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.640
that I now do for leadership
trainings, for the book.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.140
And we're going
to talk about some

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.030
of the key pieces of that today.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.740
Before we jump into that,
there is one important thing

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.930
I want to address.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.770
Because we are going
to be talking today

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.540
about the inner barriers
for women around our playing

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.710
bigger.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:39.300
And it can be easy for that
to be misconstrued as then

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.630
that disparity that we see
in leadership, the challenges

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.230
that women face are inside
us all our own fault. Right?

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.490
And I certainly don't want
to convey that in any way.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.970
So first I want
to give voice to,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.380
of course there are
huge external barriers.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.750
Many of which I am sure
through the Women at Google

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.800
work you're learning about
here all kinds of bias,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.090
and implicit and explicit
discrimination, the pay gap,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.923
and so on.

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:13.420
Right?

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.270
And there are
these inner issues.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.820
And the inner
barriers that we face,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.210
the kind of playing
small and talking about I

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.270
don't see it as disconnected
from those external barriers

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.410
at all.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.954
So we didn't just make
this up because we

00:07:28.954 --> 00:07:31.370
thought it would be great to
play small and hold ourselves

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.230
back.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.180
But rather that if
you think about what

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.670
it means to be a woman
in our time right now,

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:41.850
we are in this amazing
transitional moment in history.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.580
We're coming out of thousands
of years of a legacy

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.130
where women were pretty
much marginalized entirely

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.800
from professional life,
political life, public life.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.960
And the legacy of that--
the residue of that--

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.050
is still so alive in our culture
in many ways, in our media.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.000
It's so alive in the
messages we get at school

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.320
and often at home, as well.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.980
And that has certain effects
on how we see ourselves

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.560
and how we behave.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.650
And so when we talk
about the inner barriers,

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.910
we're really talking about the
inner imprint of that legacy

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.980
and of that culture.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.530
OK.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.140
So with that, let's jump in.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.230
We'll talk about
three areas today

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.640
where I commonly see so many
women holding themselves back,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.750
and where we can make really
transformative change.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.890
And the first one is
our inner critics.

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.560
So anyone have one of these?

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.424
Yes.

00:08:46.424 --> 00:08:48.160
Two hands.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.510
Two hands go up.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.170
Yeah.

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.840
Anyone feel like you don't have
an inner critic that you're

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.770
burdened by or
affected by as you move

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.950
through your life or your work?

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:57.480
OK.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:57.980
Yeah.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.440
So most of us are aware that we
do have this voice in our head

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.170
that says not very nice things
to us about ourselves that

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.270
voices a lot of self-doubt.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:10.460
And as much as
we're aware of it,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.060
we also probably don't even
notice-- for most of us

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.860
we don't even notice
about 90% of what

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.260
it's saying, because
it's become so habitual.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.760
It's the water that we swim in.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.780
So that oh, I'm just not good
at that whole set of things.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.670
Oh, there's no way I could
be the person to do that.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.610
Things that maybe we just
feel like that's true about us

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.340
or that's our way of thinking
is often the inner critic.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.280
So the first piece
of work we need to do

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.350
is start to recognize when
am I hearing my inner critic.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.000
And start to notice that
as a voice in our heads,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.310
not just how my thinking
sounds, not just that's

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.310
who I am, but start to
notice it as one voice

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.430
so that over time we can
get connected to some

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.480
of the other voices
inside of us.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.200
So how do we recognize it?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.530
We listen for when do you hear
a voice talking to you in a way

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:08.390
that you would not intend
to talk to someone you love?

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.360
When do you hear the voice
of I'm not ready yet?

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.120
That's usually
your inner critic.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.230
For women, interestingly,
there is really

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.770
not good research that says we
have more self-doubt than men.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.300
That's a common
misunderstanding.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.960
But there is data that suggests
women do feel more self-doubt

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.320
than men around those things
that are traditionally

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.580
associated with
masculinity in our culture.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:40.930
So that's quantitative work,
financial work and decisions,

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:45.070
negotiation, and leadership.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.710
There we see that
women tend to have

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:52.040
more self-doubt about themselves
in those areas of skill

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.810
and work.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.060
On the other side
of the coin, there's

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.940
some data that
suggests that men feel

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.970
more self-doubt around
emotional and relational skills

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.520
like listening,
reading nonverbal cues,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.920
and communication.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.120
So our self-doubt, of
course, is showing up

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.030
in what's been
conditioned in our culture

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.380
to have us think it's associated
with us or people like us.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:18.970
So listen.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.520
Particularly when do you
notice that voice of,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.200
I'm just not good at
those kinds of things.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.790
That's your inner critic.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.850
You might notice your inner
critic is often also for women

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.900
the voice of body perfectionism
or self-consciousness

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.860
around our bodies.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.160
It tends to be a very
repetitive, broken record

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.250
kind of voice.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:45.580
And it may take some cues from
outer critics in your life.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.080
Right?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.630
So you might notice, oh, that
inner critic voice is saying

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.440
a lot of things that when I
really think about it, that

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.400
sounds like an internalized
voice of that really

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.180
tough first boss I had, or that
professor who delivered that

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.050
really, really harsh feedback,
or that person in my childhood

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.300
who was very critical of me.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.670
But that's not
true for everyone.

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:12.700
You don't have to find
an external source

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.710
for your critic.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:16.520
You might just notice
some echoes there.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.570
So starting to
notice that voice.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.030
A question I get a lot around
noticing the inner critic

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.800
is what's the difference
between the inner critic

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.520
and realistic thinking?

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.650
Right.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.440
There's good critical thinking
that might realistically

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.245
assess something and come back
with yeah, it's not that good.

00:12:36.245 --> 00:12:37.120
You're not ready yet.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.710
I'm not good at that, right?

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.090
So how do we know
when we're hearing

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.410
that more irrational
inner critic

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.165
versus realistic thinking?

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:47.790
And the way you can
tell the difference

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.690
there is really the tone of
the thoughts in your head.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.290
It's not even a distinction
of what those two voices say.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.270
They might have
the same concerns.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.320
I'm not sure you're ready for
that stretch assignment yet.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.250
But the way they talk to
you about those concerns

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.900
will be very different.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.340
So the inner critic will sound
more anxious, more chattery,

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.137
more repetitive.

00:13:12.137 --> 00:13:13.220
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.370
I really don't think
I could do that.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.078
What if this worst-case
scenario happens.

00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:19.010
More fearful about
future consequences.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.280
And you'll notice that if
it's your inner critic,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.770
it's not trying to move
towards any solution

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.620
or resolution of the problem.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.850
Realistic thinking
might say, you

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.120
know, I am not
sure if I am ready,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.490
if I have what I need to
take that stretch assignment.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.440
How can I find that out?

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.910
Who could I talk to?

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:43.620
How can I evaluate it?

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.280
How can I test it?

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.689
Is there a low-risk
way to do it?

00:13:47.689 --> 00:13:49.480
Let's think through
what would be the worst

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.280
thing that could happen.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.540
So you can hear the tone.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.380
Realistic thinking is curious.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.160
It's generative.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.740
And it's on your side.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.340
It moves forward down
a path of reasoning,

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.120
whereas your inner critic
is going to loop and loop

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.170
and loop.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.160
So why do we have
this inner critic?

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.170
What is it?

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.200
What is it?

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.980
A mistake that I
think a lot of us

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.100
make-- and I used to
share this misconception--

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:23.340
is that if we're not confident,
if we feel a lot of self-doubt,

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:27.270
one, that's a personal
problem-- something missing

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.640
from us as individuals.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.410
And two, somehow if we
look back into our history,

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.000
we can find the reason for it.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.600
Was it that I never learned to
develop enough confidence doing

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.214
competitive things as a kid?

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:42.880
Was it these critical
people in my life?

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.930
Was it that my parents
were so supportive of me

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.360
that now the world feels
really dangerous and scary

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.910
in contrast, and everything
feels so critical?

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.110
We look to our
biography for some sort

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:56.030
of reason for that self-doubt.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.550
And after talking to so many
women about their inner critics

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:04.040
and really digging into the
mechanics of self-doubt,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.080
I can say that that's not
the place to find the answer.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.570
There's nothing in
your life experience

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.260
that is responsible
for self-doubt.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.420
That in fact, we're all
hardwired-- we're all

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.530
hardwired to have that
inner critic voice.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:26.070
And the reason is this-- that
we all have a very strong safety

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.850
instinct.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.380
And the safety instinct
is the part of us

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:37.170
that wants to keep us safe
from harm at any cost.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.860
It's a very old
ancient, reptilian part

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.790
of our-- comes from the
reptilian part of our brain

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.180
that's always on the
lookout for danger and risk.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.040
And it's trying to
make sure we survive.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.860
That was very useful
when human beings

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.720
were faced with a lot of
life-threatening dangers

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.530
all the time.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:00.380
That instinct to look for danger
and go into fight or flight

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.180
when we perceive
any possible danger

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.500
is still alive in all of us.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.010
And in our modern
time, it doesn't just

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.960
fire when there's
a physical threat.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.200
It fires when there's
an emotional threat.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.290
So when we feel an
emotional threat like,

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.890
I might really embarrass
myself saying that idea.

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:27.620
I might really bring some
conflict or criticism

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.610
if I point out the
elephant in the room

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:32.580
that I see that nobody
is talking about here.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.940
I might fail.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.370
I might be criticized.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.390
Those are all things we
perceive as emotional threats.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.240
And the safety
instinct is saying no.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.700
We gotta avoid all of those.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.940
Let's stay in the comfort zone.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.720
But if every time
you wanted to take

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.760
a stretch, a step in your
life or make a change

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.290
or do something that
risked emotional harm,

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.860
if every time your safety
instinct just said, hi.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.090
I'm your safety instinct.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.880
I don't like that.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.119
I think we should stay
exactly with the status quo.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.380
I think we should stay
really safe over here.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.990
Let's not try it.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.660
Let's not speak up,
you would say, no.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.406
I want to.

00:17:14.406 --> 00:17:15.220
I want to.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.900
I have a longing in
me to try that thing.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.280
I want to make this change.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.609
And you would pretty quickly
overrule your safety instinct.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:29.440
So our safety instincts have
developed a more sophisticated,

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.840
more effective
strategy at getting

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.080
us to stay in the comfort zone.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.440
Instead of saying, Hi,
I'm your safety instinct,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.800
please don't do that,
the safety instinct says,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.130
you have no idea what
you're talking about.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.440
Who do you think you are?

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.350
You're not ready
to say that yet.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.280
Let's go research
it for a few months

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.430
first, and then come
back and say it.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.380
And that is an intimidating
enough narrative

00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.130
to get most of us to stay
in that comfort zone.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.570
So the inner critic
is a strategy

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.350
that your safety
instinct is using

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:08.580
to make sure you
don't do things that

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.290
raise that risk of
emotional vulnerability

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.050
or possible
emotional discomfort.

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:19.330
And the problem is that
just like in a company,

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:21.170
you end up with
a lot of problems

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.840
when you have two departments
that don't coordinate at all.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.240
The risk aversion
department in us

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.650
never talks to the fulfillment
department or the reward

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:31.790
department.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:32.930
It doesn't care.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.190
It really doesn't
care if you ever have

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.780
a fulfilled day in your life.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.850
It has one mission--
stay in the comfort zone.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.670
So if we listen to it,
that's what happens.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.350
We stay in the comfort zone.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.020
But we miss out on a lot.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.940
And that's what happens when
we listen to our inner critics.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:55.230
So if we're hardwired for
self-doubt, what do we do?

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.850
What do we do about that?

00:18:56.850 --> 00:18:59.320
Safety instinct
isn't going anywhere.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.160
Our desire to do
things that have

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.640
us risking failure and criticism
also isn't going anywhere.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.450
So the thing we don't try
and do is become confident.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.427
And this is where I am
against all this advice

00:19:11.427 --> 00:19:13.760
that women should just become
more confident, that we've

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.590
gotta encourage our girls to be
confident, that confidence is

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:21.540
the answer, because I know
that the women who are leading

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.090
and risking and speaking
up and excelling

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.160
don't feel confident
as they're doing it.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.570
A couple of my favorite
examples of this one

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.390
comes from Twyla Tharp, who
is-- how many people have

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.350
heard of Twyla Tharp?

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.710
She is one of the most famous
choreographers of our time.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.590
She has won about
10 Tony awards.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.970
She has tons of
honorary degrees.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:50.040
Her work is celebrated
all over the world.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.070
And she says, every time
I start a new dance when

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.460
I go into the studio, I am
completely sure that this is

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.250
the one where the audience is
going to walk out on opening

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:04.090
night laughing, because
they're going to see my talent

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:04.830
has run out.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:08.960
Another one of my
favorite examples

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.860
comes from Cherry Murray, who
is the dean of engineering

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.100
at Harvard.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:18.550
And she says, every single day
I feel unqualified for my job.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.810
So what's fascinating
about that is

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.190
that Twyla Tharp is
doing the dance anyway,

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.250
and Terry Murray took
that job and continues

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.700
to show up at that job anyway.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.790
And that's the name of the game.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:35.520
It's how do I hear the
voice of self-doubt?

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.980
It's going to be very
loud if you are truly

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.180
playing to your potential.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.240
It's going to be
very loud if you're

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.340
sharing your voice and
your gifts in the world,

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.700
because the safety
instinct doesn't like

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.570
the risk that comes with that.

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:55.070
So how do we let it be there and
hear it, but not take direction

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.960
from it in just that way
that Cherry Murray and Twyla

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.070
Tharp are talking about?

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:04.275
So to do that we need
to one-- know that it's

00:21:04.275 --> 00:21:06.527
that voice when it's talking.

00:21:06.527 --> 00:21:08.860
Twyla Tharp actually says,
and then I think, oh, there's

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:09.568
that voice again.

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:11.340
It's been there with
me for every dance

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.875
I've started to choreograph.

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:14.500
And I know if I
listened to it, I would

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.130
stop choreographing entirely.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.060
So hearing the
voice of self-doubt,

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.720
recognizing it for what it is.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.130
You can even ask yourself in
the moment, what does my safety

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.350
instinct not like about
this situation when

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.890
you hear self-doubt.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:36.450
So if you hear, I'm really just
always been horrible at that.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:38.180
And I'm going to
totally screw this up,

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.681
what does my safety instinct
not like about this situation?

00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:42.930
And you'll see it immediately.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:47.080
Oh, it doesn't like that
I'm going to get feedback

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.670
on this that might hurt.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:53.040
It doesn't like that if I apply
for this, I may get it or not.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.260
And then you can start to
see why the inner critic is

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.760
speaking up.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.460
It can also be fun-- just a
few more playful strategies

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:00.960
you can use.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.270
You can create a character
for your inner critic.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.509
So think about if you were going
to give it a personality, what

00:22:07.509 --> 00:22:09.300
kind of personality,
what kind of character

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.160
personifies it for you.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.590
And then when you
hear that voice,

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.420
you can notice it as
coming from that character.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.230
Whether you imagine
that visually or it's

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.779
a particular voice.

00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:21.320
And that can just
add some lightness.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.620
And you can see the humor
in what it's saying.

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.570
And also, it can
help you remember,

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:26.950
that's not the core of me.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.270
The core of me is the
part that has that desire

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.450
to fulfill my potential.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.450
You can also even sometimes
imagine it leaving the space

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.620
that you're in.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.150
So if you are writing
an important email

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.600
and you notice you're
feeling like you're

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.852
being very perfectionistic
in the editing of it,

00:22:45.852 --> 00:22:48.060
and feeling like it's not
going to come across right,

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.643
and you're hearing
a lot of self-doubt

00:22:49.643 --> 00:22:52.580
about what you're
saying, to actually

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.800
picture that inner critic
voice leaving the room,

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.850
or picture the character
leaving the room.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.990
And then come back
to your screen.

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:01.490
OK.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.450
Now it's just me.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:03.530
Let's go.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.119
And it sounds hard to believe.

00:23:05.119 --> 00:23:07.410
But that actually can make
a really powerful difference

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.890
for people and how present
that voice is for them.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.950
So noticing the
inner critic voice,

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:16.840
learning to live with it,
not waiting on confidence.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.890
Please do not wait on
confidence for anything

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.500
that you're wanting to do.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.030
But rather the answer is,
it's not becoming confident.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.172
It's having a new kind of
relationship with self-doubt.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:30.710
OK.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:35.950
So let's move on to a second
topic, which is unhooking

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.390
from praise and criticism.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.950
Unhooking from
praise and criticism.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.640
And this is an area
that really surprised me

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.980
in my work with women to
see how many of the issues

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.040
that people were coming to
coaching with looked like one

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.180
thing on the surface, but were
really something else that

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.240
had to do with
their relationship

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.110
to praise and criticism.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:03.440
So one of my clients
came with, I've

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.370
been working in my
field for 25 years.

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.030
I have done really well in it.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:12.170
But I see this huge problem
with the conventional way things

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.740
are approached in my field.

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:18.290
And she worked in domestic
violence prevention

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.820
and services.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.070
I see this huge problem.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.990
And I want to start
my own program

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.840
with a different approach.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.020
And my job is so demanding.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.110
I'm so over taxed.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.860
I can never get to this thing.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:34.730
I want a coach to help
me carve out the time

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:36.720
and hold me accountable
so I can make

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.250
some movement on this thing.

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:39.650
OK, great.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:42.510
Well, I didn't know
yet what I know now,

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.732
which is time is
never the real issue.

00:24:44.732 --> 00:24:48.952
It's maybe the real
issue 0.5% of the time.

00:24:48.952 --> 00:24:50.410
But when we delved
a little deeper,

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.470
what was clear for
her was she had always

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.370
been a star within her field.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:25:01.410
She had always gotten a
lot of positive feedback

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.010
and excelled in the
conventional way.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.380
And she knew that
this new approach

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.160
that she wanted to bring forward
was going to be controversial.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.140
And as someone who had always
been a good student in school

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.931
and done well at
work, that move to how

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:17.680
am I going to launch
something that I know

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:20.410
will be controversial?

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.440
Can I live with the
criticism and feedback

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.330
and the polarized reactions
that are going to come my way,

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.690
was really what was
keeping her stuck.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:30.650
So that's one example.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:34.530
Another was a woman who works in
management consulting who said,

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:35.790
you know, I love my job.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:37.310
I love the analysis.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.060
I really like the
work with clients.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.550
But I have been promoted
to this new level.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:46.940
And now where I am there's a
lot of harsh feedback coming

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.400
my way.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.590
Some of it is at this
level the way my colleagues

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:53.790
and I-- the culture of
how we talk to each other,

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.540
there's just a lot of criticism.

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.440
Some of it is that now when the
client doesn't like something,

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.190
I'm the one that's hearing
everything about it.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.450
And I am finding myself so
on such an emotional roller

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:09.360
coaster with that, and
so uncomfortable with it,

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.650
that it's keeping me
from liking my job.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.710
So I'm coming to
coaching to figure out

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.320
should I change careers?

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:15.920
Or wait.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.545
That doesn't seem
right, because I love

00:26:17.545 --> 00:26:19.455
the actual heart of the work.

00:26:19.455 --> 00:26:21.080
And so with her,
again, we have to look

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.630
at what's this
relationship to criticism

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:28.880
and negative feedback, and
how does that block us.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.870
I have really found that for
every person, and particularly

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:37.440
for women, there
is a point where

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.040
we get stopped in our growth
because of our relationship

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.760
to praise and criticism.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.980
And that could be we're
avoidant of criticism,

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.750
we're seeking of praise.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.200
For some of us it's that we're
avoidant of a lot of praise.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.430
Paradoxically if you grew
up in a culture where you're

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.700
supposed to blend in and don't
brag and don't do things,

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.470
don't try to be
in the spotlight,

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.330
you will unconsciously
or consciously

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.800
avoid the things that will
bring a lot of praise.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.530
So that's another way
we can get hooked.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.560
And so part of this
journey to playing bigger

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:13.000
is unhooking from
praise and criticism.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.050
This does affect women in
particular in a few ways.

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.830
Certainly, all of
us human beings

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.910
were affected by
praise and criticism.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:23.280
But there are some
interesting dimensions

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.810
of how it affects
women in particular.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:30.020
One is that we know women
get more harsh criticism

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.010
than men in the workforce.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.880
And we get more
personal criticism.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.420
Some of you may
have seen the study

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:39.500
that was done by Karen Snyder.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:45.220
She's a linguist and
a tech entrepreneur.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:49.490
She did a study looking
at performance reviews

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:55.660
from about 30 tech companies
and analyzing them using

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.340
a variety of linguistic tools.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.970
And she found that
not only did women

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:04.880
get a lot more negative feedback
than men in their performance

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.250
reviews, but 73% of the
negative feedback that women got

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:13.520
was criticism of
their personality.

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.110
And 2% of the negative
feedback that men got

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.560
was criticism of a
personality trait.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.110
So this sense of
the feedback we get

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.950
is more personal, and
therefore more wounding for us,

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.970
of course, and more
become something

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.760
that we're more
alert on avoiding,

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.660
there's a real gender gap there
in the kind of feedback we get.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:37.730
So of course, as a
result of that, we're

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:41.450
going to feel more hooked,
more caught up in what's

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.680
going on with the
negative feedback we get.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.990
Another interesting factor
that has a gender dimension

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:51.580
is what I call the "noisy room."

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.770
And I call it the noisy
room because I always

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.560
felt when I was working
inside a large organization,

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.230
if I was in a meeting with
15 people around a conference

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:06.330
table, that room felt
incredibly noisy to me

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:11.950
with the cues and the dynamics
of everything that was going on

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.620
amongst that group.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.340
So when people were talking,
I would be noticing well

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.175
that person really seems
to be resisting everything

00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:21.050
that person's saying.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.139
And that person's in a
really grumpy mood today.

00:29:23.139 --> 00:29:24.680
And that person is
always just trying

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.850
to win over these people.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:27.890
All those dynamics.

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.070
Very, very full of information.

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.760
And I found that for me,
that often sometimes got

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.500
in the way of my ability
to really push forward

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:47.530
in the midst of complex dynamics
and kind of see the main event,

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.837
or let those dynamics just be.

00:29:49.837 --> 00:29:52.170
And let the project go forward
without feeling like they

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:53.950
needed to be resolved.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.360
So I had noticed that
in myself, and noticed

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.920
that I didn't see some
of my male colleagues

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.470
grappling with all
of-- they weren't

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.344
even aware of the things
I was talking about.

00:30:03.344 --> 00:30:05.270
If I had to bring them
up to be resolved,

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:07.000
often they weren't even aware.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.830
And they certainly didn't think
they needed to be resolved.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.260
And so then I was
really intrigued

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.230
when I read that there's
research that supports exactly

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.355
what that experience was.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.180
One-- that there is
a gender difference

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:27.710
in the amount of information
that women and men pick up

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.100
in non-verbal cues.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.830
There's very few
gender differences

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.830
that actually are consistently
borne out by the research.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.140
One of them that there's a
pretty solid body of studies

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:42.440
around is that women pick
up a lot more information

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:46.741
from facial expressions,
from body language.

00:30:46.741 --> 00:30:48.490
And so if you think
about what that means,

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.070
it means we're
processing a lot more.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:55.490
And that includes
people's reactions to us.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:31:00.780
We're processing a lot more of
people's subtle reactions to us

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.280
than our male counterparts are.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.280
And that's something that
can be distracting for us.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.520
This particular
study done at Harvard

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.640
also found that contrary
to all that research

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:19.060
on emotional the benefits of
high emotional intelligence--

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:23.040
there's also some downsides
of high emotional intelligence

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.980
around morale and productivity.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.230
So I think it really speaks
to what I'm talking about.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:29.710
If you have very high
emotional intelligence,

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.910
you're picking up
all those cues.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.090
It can interfere with a
certain kind of productivity.

00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:38.270
You may feel kind of
down about the dynamics

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.340
you're observing that other
people aren't even noticing.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.630
So that's another way we can
get hooked on people's reactions

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:45.130
to us.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.850
We just get more information
about that as women.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:48.930
We're oblivious to less.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.430
And that can be
helpful, but we have

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.660
to be really discerning
about when it's helpful

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.410
and when it's not.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:57.860
And then lastly,
another factor that

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.520
informs our relationship to
feedback is our history, again.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.460
That if you think
about women's history,

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:10.180
for most of our
history, women could not

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:16.410
survive through financial
power, political power,

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.280
physical strength.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.580
We didn't have those things.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:21.290
Right?

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:24.180
We weren't going to be
able to survive or ensure

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:31.340
the survival of our dearest
ones through physical might,

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:34.770
through political rights,
through legal protection,

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.680
through financial
ownership of property.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.900
We didn't have any
of those things.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:44.950
And our primary survival
strategy-- or you

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.080
could also say our
primary strategy

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:52.020
for thriving-- was social
influence and likability.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.720
Working through
relationships to do what

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.490
would be approved
of or tolerable

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:02.260
or met with a positive reaction.

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.730
And the reason
that's so important

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.220
is because for a
lot of us there's

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.220
a kind of legacy of
that that still lives

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.870
where conflict or
harsh criticism

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.930
really does feel
life-threatening,

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:17.040
really can feel
life-threatening if we really

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.100
tune into our inner
experience of it.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.450
And that's why.

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:27.580
So how do we unhook from
praise and criticism?

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.930
There are a bunch of
strategies in the book.

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:34.790
There's one I want to focus
on today, which is changing

00:33:34.790 --> 00:33:37.640
your story about feedback.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.540
And the new story that I
want to offer you today

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.920
is a little bit-- it
sounds a little bit

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.290
radical to some people at first.

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.460
So hang in there with me.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:47.940
And it's this.

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.270
That feedback never tells
you anything about yourself.

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:56.340
It can only tell you about the
person giving the feedback.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:00.280
So I'm guessing this is a pretty
feedback-oriented culture.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.690
Yes?

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:03.900
We have to take
feedback very seriously.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.620
It's going to help us grow.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.260
It's key to our development.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.223
It's integral.

00:34:09.223 --> 00:34:10.639
Something great
leaders are always

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.300
looking for a lot of feedback.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.840
So to say feedback can
never tell any tell you

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.489
anything about you, it can
only tell you about the people

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:19.889
you're getting
feedback from, kind of

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:23.397
seems like it flies
in the face of that.

00:34:23.397 --> 00:34:24.980
So let's talk about
that for a minute.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:32.090
So let's say your
manager says you're

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.719
really great with details
and project management.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:41.929
But, there's something missing
in the sort of team interaction

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:44.580
and the ability to
motivate people and make

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.110
them feel comfortable, kind
of on the soft skills side,

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.940
there's something missing.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.679
So that's the feedback.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:53.830
So what does that
tell us about you?

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.180
Does that tell us you're
a good project manager?

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.260
Does that tell us
there's something missing

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.850
in the soft skills side?

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.090
Does it tell us any
facts about that?

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.500
Really, when you think about it?

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.800
The only fact we're
actually getting there

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.960
is the fact of that is the
feedback my manager gave me.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.940
That sounds like
that's the feedback.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.220
That is his or her perception,
his or her experience

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:20.960
of my work.

00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.300
That's the fact.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.690
That's his or her
experience of my work.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:30.530
What if your whole
team says, you're

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.860
a really great project manager,
great with the details.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.260
But we all feel kind of
like we can't connect,

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.140
we're not really
motivated by you.

00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:43.110
Does that give us
any facts about you?

00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:47.020
Does that give us some facts
about that group of people?

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:51.580
Perhaps some facts about
what's coming across to them,

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.801
tells us about their
experience of you.

00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:03.200
So the next step there is
not to dismiss the feedback.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.610
This is not, oh,
that's all about them.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:07.160
So I'm going to ignore it.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.210
It's oh, that's
giving me information

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.080
about these individuals.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.990
And if these are
people that I want

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:17.770
to work with
effectively, if these

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.680
are important stakeholders
to what I'm doing,

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.300
I'm going to really
listen to that feedback.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.310
I'm going to try and understand
what it is telling me about

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:30.750
them, what they need from
me, what they expect of me,

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:32.950
what they expect of
someone in this role,

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:35.750
what works for them
and what doesn't.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.320
And if I want to work
with them effectively,

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:43.480
I may incorporate or adapt
with some of that feedback.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.410
So the power of
that is that when

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:49.960
we're looking at feedback as,
that's information about them,

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.820
we don't get defensive.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.334
You never have to decide
if it's true or not.

00:36:54.334 --> 00:36:55.750
You never have to
call your friend

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.120
and talk about how crazy your
manager is or what they said,

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.690
because it really doesn't
matter whether it's

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.140
true in some objective
sense or not.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:06.260
What matters is you're
getting information

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:09.780
about someone who potentially
is an important stakeholder

00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:11.440
for you.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.860
And when we're not
taking it personally,

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.670
when we're not making
the feedback about us,

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:17.930
something interesting happens.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.280
We start to get really
curious about the feedback,

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.470
because it's not personal.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.240
We're not defending against it.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:24.810
Oh.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:25.720
Interesting.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.325
Hm.

00:37:26.325 --> 00:37:29.230
They think I'm not
connecting with people.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:32.270
I would love to
understand more like what

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:34.010
is their vision of
what that looks like?

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:38.240
Or how do they see that
fitting into my job?

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:43.320
Where would that happen
in the flow of my work?

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.710
We can ask a lot of questions.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:45.980
We can learn more.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.130
We can be truly open.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.780
And then we can adapt and
incorporate the feedback,

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.900
but from the
perspective of, that's

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:56.060
what it takes to
be effective here.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.920
Not from the
perspective of, there's

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.460
something defective about me.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.110
And that is so important for
us, particularly for women,

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.730
for people of color,
because the feedback we get

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:12.610
is often going to
be impacted by bias.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.250
And we don't want to take
that on and make it about us.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.960
We want to allow it to be
looked at more neutrally,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.610
and with more curiosity.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.650
What is this telling
me about what

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.820
it takes to be effective
in this context?

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:30.337
So thoughts, questions on
anything we talked about today?

00:38:30.337 --> 00:38:31.795
And this is a great
time-- I always

00:38:31.795 --> 00:38:35.850
say this is a great time to not
listen to your inner critic,

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:38.060
take that first
step of if you hear

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:40.710
the voice in your head
saying, that question

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.840
does-- I know it's not well
thought out enough yet.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.400
Or it might not be
a good question.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.640
Or maybe she said that and
I wasn't gonna catch it.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.880
That's your inner critic.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.760
So this is a great
opportunity to practice

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:55.900
not listening to that voice.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.380
AUDIENCE: While women may
receive more negative feedback

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.810
about their more
personal attributes,

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:10.240
that they may get actually
less useful critical feedback

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.731
about things they can do to grow
that men in the same position

00:39:15.731 --> 00:39:16.230
do.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.120
So yeah.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.910
If you have any thoughts on
that, and maybe strategies

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:22.974
for getting more of
that kind of feedback.

00:39:22.974 --> 00:39:23.640
TARA MOHR: Yeah.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:23.820
Yeah.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:24.740
And I'm not sure if
you're referring--

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.770
there was one
study that came out

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:31.410
last fall about the feedback
that women get tends to be

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.197
more general and more vague.

00:39:33.197 --> 00:39:33.780
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:33.880
TARA MOHR: Yeah.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:34.420
Yeah.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.650
Exactly.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.460
Just that it's another really
important thing to be aware of.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.920
I think for men
and women, knowing

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.720
these trends are so
important, because it

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.594
means if you look at
your performance review,

00:39:45.594 --> 00:39:47.220
you can say, oh.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.460
A lot of this feedback
is personality-driven.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.430
There's nothing specific
here that's tied

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.730
to the core objectives
for my role.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:55.230
OK.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:56.700
That's not just me.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.090
I know that's part
of a larger pattern.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:01.310
And that's potentially
then something

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:04.230
you might want to ask
for more specifically.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.110
If you're in the kind
of team or department

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.720
where you can have a
constructive discussion

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.920
outside of specific
performance reviews,

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:14.380
like circulate those articles,
and make sure everybody who's

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.490
giving and receiving
performance reviews

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:19.330
is aware of those patterns
so they can catch themselves

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:21.090
in them.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.750
I spoke at a company
a few years ago,

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:27.380
and was talking about the
personality feedback thing

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.650
and talking about
the word abrasive,

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.040
and how abrasive--
you know, it's

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.430
very commonly used with women.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.040
It's never used with men.

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.160
And there was a male executive
in the audience who said,

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.080
I just used that word in
three performance reviews

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.800
last week with three women.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.270
And now I realize I
need to go change it.

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:49.780
So I think raising the
awareness there is huge,

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.080
and then asking for
more specific feedback,

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.300
and feedback around
your objectives

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.790
for your job is really important
if you see that's happening

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.062
in your reviews.

00:41:02.062 --> 00:41:04.020
AUDIENCE: One thing that
I think a lot of women

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.740
at Google all struggle with,
because tech can be a very,

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:09.170
very male-dominated world.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.940
And I personally work
in sales at Google.

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.450
So business is also a
fairly male-dominated world,

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:18.920
is that there's this constant
conflict between discomfort

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.590
in the situation that you're
in, and wanting to improve it,

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.870
and wanting to make
sure that people

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:27.940
are educated about implicit
bias and all that good stuff.

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:31.030
But at the same time,
yearning for a community

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.360
where that doesn't
have to be explained,

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.110
that it's already understood.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:37.330
So in your experience
coaching, did you

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:40.830
ever find women that were also
dealing with that dichotomy?

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:43.470
And how did you coach
them through it?

00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:44.410
TARA MOHR: Yeah.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:49.870
I would just say I think
that's a really important need.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:52.250
I would go further than
to say it's a want.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.870
It's a need to have that
kind of like-minded community

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:58.750
or community where you
feel like you're not--

00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:01.750
you don't have to be in change
agent mode and navigating

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:05.399
how exactly do I be a diplomatic
change agent all the time.

00:42:05.399 --> 00:42:06.940
And that can happen
in a lot of ways.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:09.640
It could happen with women
inside your organization,

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.200
if there's an
opportunity for that.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.290
It is the reason that I think
a lot of women do things

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:21.410
that even our cross industry--
whether that's a group coaching

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:25.364
experience or some other
kind of self-formed women's

00:42:25.364 --> 00:42:27.530
group, or a book club that
talks about these issues,

00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:28.390
or whatever.

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:31.450
It's just so tremendously
nourishing for people.

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:33.620
And I would really
encourage you to create

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.240
that whatever way you can.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.650
AUDIENCE: What was the
most challenging pushback

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:43.260
you experienced in trying
to play big and speak up?

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:47.260
TARA MOHR:
Personally, or-- yeah.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.310
That's a great question.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:51.390
Well, I'm writing a lot
of political pieces now.

00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:52.500
So that's interesting.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:58.010
I get some pushback around that.

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:02.120
And for me, it's usually around
political or social issues.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.430
And that's definitely a
playing big edge for me

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:08.920
that I still grapple with,
like, how much am I really

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.680
willing to speak out about
what I perceive as happening

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.730
in our collective milieu.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:18.690
And yeah.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:20.940
I just find the more radical
I get with that, the more

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.210
pushback I get.

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:23.840
So it's a good playing
big edge for me.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.540
And I think we're always
on this journey of what's

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.060
my playing big edge now?

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.400
What feels really scary but
important now that doesn't end?

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.110
Yeah.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:38.820
AUDIENCE: In terms of
educating those around us-- so

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.520
the men in the room--
especially when they're

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.350
in very senior
leadership positions,

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:49.490
and you can see certain
characteristics and behaviors

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:52.932
kind of trickle through
all of the layers.

00:43:52.932 --> 00:43:54.890
I mean, coming to talks
like this is fantastic.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:58.734
But how do we help bring
that message outward?

00:43:58.734 --> 00:43:59.400
TARA MOHR: Yeah.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:06.550
So the interesting thing is that
I believe that education really

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:10.390
needs to happen for
everyone, and not just

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:11.350
women for themselves.

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:14.810
But women for how they manage
and work with other women.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:20.780
For example, the research
on the double bind

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:24.540
that women are often perceived
as competent or likable,

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:26.070
but not both.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:29.590
That phenomenon is worse
with a female manager

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.200
than a male manager.

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.690
And a lot of times
there is a kind

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:39.520
of policing that women have
done of their own voices,

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.840
or their own
expression, or whatever

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.630
they had to compartmentalize
on the way up, that

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:48.690
really makes it hard for them
to fully support other women.

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:51.530
So I think it's really
important to think

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.500
of the education
and the conversation

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.330
as needing to
happen for everyone.

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.776
And it's tricky,
because with leaders--

00:44:59.776 --> 00:45:01.650
and I would say even
particularly with female

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.360
leaders-- the most important
thing is that they're doing

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.700
their own playing big
work, because you really

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:13.100
can't support-- as a woman,
you cannot, you will not,

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.190
end up supporting in another
woman what you are not allowing

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.360
in yourself.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.240
So if you're
walking on eggshells

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.740
with the way you
express your voice,

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:24.270
you really don't want a
direct report who's not.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.980
That's not going to
go over well, right?

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.060
So that.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.370
And I think that's really
important for everyone

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:32.310
to reflect on.

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.150
How do I do my own
playing big work,

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:37.270
knowing that it's going to
change my ability to embrace

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:39.550
and support others' ambitions?

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:44.759
That's more effective than
receiving an education.

00:45:44.759 --> 00:45:46.050
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, everyone.

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:46.860
TARA MOHR: Thank you, everyone.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.359
SPEAKER 1: That's
all we have today.

00:45:48.359 --> 00:45:49.790
TARA MOHR: Thank you.
