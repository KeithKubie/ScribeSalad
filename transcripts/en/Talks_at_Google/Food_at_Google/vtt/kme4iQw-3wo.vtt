[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.987 --> 00:00:11.320
KIM ALTER: Thank you for coming.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.528
I'm super excited to be here.

00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:14.830
This is my first
time on the campus.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.840
And I always ask
my friends who work

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.805
here, cause I'm probably a dork,
and I watch "The Internship,"

00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:20.680
and things like that.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.010
And I get all excited
about being here.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.942
So thank you for having me.

00:00:24.942 --> 00:00:27.150
When they asked me to come
and talk about vegetables,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.640
that's really easy for me,
because I worked on a farm.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.520
I worked in places
like Ubuntu and Manresa

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.799
where it just changes
your mind about vegetables

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:37.215
when you actually
plant something,

00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:38.860
and you see how long
it takes to grow,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.084
and how much care goes into it.

00:00:41.084 --> 00:00:43.000
How can you make that
interesting for somebody

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.240
who thinks of vegetarian
food maybe as like portabello

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.330
mushrooms and balsamic?

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.200
So I use a lot of
Asian ingredients

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.590
to kind of bring umami to
things and kind of change

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.561
the idea of it.

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:56.560
And do you want me to go
straight into the demo?

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.010
All right.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.590
So I'll try to give ideas
as to how we could also

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.780
make this at home a little
bit easier than maybe

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.270
what I'm doing here, which
I kind of already did.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.020
But we can make it easier.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.620
So this is kind of a tomato
salad that we actually did.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.660
We do themed menus at Nightbird.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.130
So every two weeks I change it.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.600
And I did a Hey Ladies menu.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.510
So everything was
sourced from women,

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.560
whether it was a
vegetable, a wine, a soy,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.570
the music we listened to.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.400
So everything on the
menu came from women.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.150
And this salad in particular
came from Tenbrink Farms,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.920
which is Linda, who is amazing.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.690
Her tomatoes blow my mind.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.190
And we really just wanted
the tomato to shine.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.150
So by just adding
things like finger limes

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.631
to bring acidity, and soy and
tomato dashi to highlight,

00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:45.130
instead of just
throwing salt on it,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.500
it really just made
the vegetables kind

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.570
of get interesting, and
not just be a tomato salad.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.160
So I'm just going to reference
my notes occasionally.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.817
But this could get a
little complicated.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:58.150
But for the most part, it's not.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.730
We're going to make
a tomato dashi, which

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.217
is tomato water and kombu.

00:02:03.217 --> 00:02:05.050
Sometimes when you go
to the farmer's market

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.299
you get too much stuff, right?

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.229
Like maybe your tomatoes
start going bad.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.104
And you don't want to
throw them away, right.

00:02:10.104 --> 00:02:13.311
So I found that making tomato
water, which is super easy,

00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:15.560
is a great way to either
have like a palette cleanser,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.050
a cold soup.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.640
Put it into a
cocktail with vodka

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.320
and you have a
clarified Bloody Mary.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.730
I mean, you can do so
many different things

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.604
with something you would
normally throw away.

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:25.784
So let's pretend that these
tomatoes aren't the best

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:26.950
tomatoes in the whole world.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.820
They're very lovely.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.874
But all you need to
do is blend them.

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.374
I've never used
this blender before.

00:02:35.374 --> 00:02:38.340
Let's see.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.350
Basically just blend
them till they're water.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.910
And this is tomato water.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.950
So you just put it through--

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.941
you can use a
napkin, a towel you

00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.940
have at home that's maybe
thinner that you would

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.524
use like at a dinner party.

00:02:56.524 --> 00:02:58.940
Or cheesecloth, which you can
buy at Rainbow, Whole Foods,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.900
any of the places.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.120
And you basically just let it
drip 24 hours, set it aside,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.650
and, through the magic of
Google, you have tomato water.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.890
And it's basically just
the essence of tomato.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.650
Right now we have a tomato
salad for the first course.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.760
And we do reflection courses.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.650
So the first course
is a tomato salad,

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.358
and I didn't want to
throw away anything.

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:23.630
So we follow it with
a palate cleanser

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.000
of tomato water with olive oil.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.810
Another kind of light,
refreshing thing you can do.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.270
To make a dashi,
dashi is basically

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.550
a light broth that is seasoned
with kombu and sometimes

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.050
bonito.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.090
But we're going to do
a vegetarian style.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.885
And it's just filtered
water, the tomato water.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.000
AUDIENCE: Chef, for those
not familiar with kombu.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.110
KIM ALTER: So
kombu is a seaweed.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.260
We use a lot of seaweeds
in our preparation.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.500
On this salad in particular
we cured fish on it

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.390
to kind of tie-in
the tomato water.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.970
I like to use seasonings,
and it's not just salt.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.030
So I'll use soy so
it's not as aggressive.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.490
Or I'll use shio
koji, or like a kombu,

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.050
and it just adds in flavor to
what is normally just water.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.899
And when you're making something
like a dashi, or a soup,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.670
or like a miso broth,
most of those things

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.100
are started with
dashis or kombus.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.400
Pardon my mess.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.940
And you basically
just let it kick it.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.565
And then in the
end you get dashi.

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:37.280
I normally say seaweed,
when it starts to boil,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.060
can make any of your
liquids turn bitter.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.100
So we never want it
to come to a boil.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.440
You almost never want really
anything to come to a boil,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.000
at least in my
kitchen, unless you're

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.550
boiling water for
something, like tomatoes,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.900
which we will do next.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.990
Just because by boiling
you're creating friction.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.530
It creates cloudiness and
brought bitterness out

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.960
of a lot of products that
normally wouldn't be bitter.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.350
So I always just
let things kick it.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.502
I have French flattops
in every kitchen

00:05:05.502 --> 00:05:06.710
I've ever worked in actually.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.500
And everything's always
going around the pilot.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.070
Because boiling just is, for the
most part, creating not things

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.220
you want in your food.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.500
So the dashi just
kind of kicks it.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.290
You go over here and then
we'll start plating things

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.380
for a tomato salad.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.320
I like doing different
kinds of textures,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.230
and shapes, and sizes to
keep things interesting.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.170
So knife.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.560
And we'll blanch some.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.092
Blanching is something that
you want to do really quickly,

00:05:38.092 --> 00:05:40.550
cause you don't want a cooked
tomato like an Italian Sauce.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.270
You just want to blanch it quick
enough to take the skin off.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.460
If they're small sometimes
I don't make incisions.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.400
But sometimes to make
it a little bit easier,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.130
you can make a little bit
of an incision on the skin,

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.016
cause the skin will come off.

00:05:54.016 --> 00:05:55.640
To make anything more
fine, you kind of

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.240
would take the skins off.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.300
But for the most part, I just
count in my head 10 seconds.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.820
And then that's
normally enough time

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.420
to not affect the actual
flesh of the tomatoes,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.370
but just enough time to
kind of create the hot water

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.790
from taking the skins off.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.572
And this isn't too
hard to do at home.

00:06:18.572 --> 00:06:20.030
I have faith in
all of you that you

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.010
would want to do this
and impress everybody.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.299
So while those are
kind of cooling,

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:30.090
you want to make sure
they're fully cooled,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.880
because then there's going to
be a cooked, stewed tomato.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.254
And you really
want tomato salads

00:06:33.254 --> 00:06:36.590
I think to be fresh
and beautiful.

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.995
AUDIENCE: So that's ice water?

00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:38.620
KIM ALTER: Oui.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.110
Sorry.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.110
Ice water.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.490
Ice is going to
obviously stop it

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.110
from cooking faster
than if you just

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.200
like ran it under
cold water, or put it

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.500
in a pot with cold water.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.930
You're really highlighting the
loveliness of the tomatoes.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.410
So I like to cut things
in different shapes

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.800
so it looks like
it's growing out

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.520
of a plate, or something
for another tomato

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.760
to kind of sit on
and give height.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.470
I use a lot of different
colored tomatoes.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.500
I worked in Manresa
and Love Apple Farms.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.140
She grows like 380
different types of tomatoes.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.330
And I'm growing a bunch
in my yard right now.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.010
Not as lovely as hers.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.000
But really just you eat
with your eyes, right,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.260
before you eat with anything.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.720
So you got to impress
people nowadays.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.330
So lots of colors
and brightness.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.770
So you have tomatoes cut.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.510
You have your tomato water
and dashi kind of happening.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.397
Are we all excited to
do this at home later?

00:07:35.397 --> 00:07:38.600
[LAUGHS]

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.900
Luckily, the team here already
kind of prepped everything,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.810
because my staff hates
peeling and getting things,

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.790
cause it takes up
a lot of time when

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.340
you don't have a lot of time
when full service is happening.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.720
But as you can see with my
hands, it's just really easy.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.737
It was like a quick,
5, 10 second blanch.

00:07:57.737 --> 00:07:59.070
And the tomatoes are pulled off.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.500
So then you're not
getting sometimes

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.420
the skins stuck in your teeth.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.130
So it's a little
bit more refined.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.770
And then at the restaurant,
we don't throw anything away.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.970
So we take the tomato skins.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:09.900
We dehydrate them.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.358
And then we turn
them into a powder

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:15.450
to put back in
something on the plate.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.790
So, again, my stuff loves that.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.890
I brought a couple things
with me that we make.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.610
So I say I use a lot
of Asian ingredients.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.720
When I'm doing stuff
with vegetables,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.090
I love pulling
from that culture.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.419
And something like
kumquat kosho.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.710
I think most people are
familiar with yuzu kosho, which

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.710
is yuzu leaves, and
jalapenos and salt

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.112
that are kind of fermented
and then turned into a paste.

00:08:40.112 --> 00:08:41.820
So I thought it would
be fun to kumquats,

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.530
cause one of my farmers
had an abundance this year.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.090
And we just chopped them
up, took out the seeds,

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.700
threw salt and jalapenos on
it, and just let it ferment.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.330
And now it's like this
citrus pepper condiment that

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.110
just really brings life to the
vegetables and the tomatoes,

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.470
and some brightness and
acidity that you need.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.880
You can buy that.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.640
Actually there's a place.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.150
I think it's called The
Cultured Pickle in Berkeley.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.630
And he actually makes a
kumquat kosho that's delicious.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.370
Whole Foods.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:12.870
Rainbow.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.970
All those places you
can find yuzu kosho.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.160
In any like Ranch
99 I have definitely

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.170
bought yuzu kosho
that's like in a paste.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.420
And if you just put a little
bit on the bottom of even

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.530
like a steak, or like on
the bottom of a tomato,

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.737
it just brings a
different level of flavor,

00:09:25.737 --> 00:09:27.570
which is all you're
trying to do so you have

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.080
different notes
hitting your palate

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.680
so you're excited
when you're eating.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.670
Or for me.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.740
I like to be excited.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.660
These are finger limes,
which probably are

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:37.950
a little bit harder to find.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.340
So you can easily supplement
by getting limes and just

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.520
chopping up the segments to
give little pops of acidity

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.522
and whatnot.

00:09:47.522 --> 00:09:49.230
They're originally
from, I believe, what?

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.010
New Zealand.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.950
And a couple farmers
started growing them here.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.620
They definitely don't look
like the ones from New Zealand.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.521
They're really bright
pink and lovely.

00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:01.020
Afterwards if you want to come
up and try them on their own,

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.660
they're just little
tapioca pearls, kind

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.150
of almost like caviar of acid.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.800
And they just bring little pops
to kind of surprise your palate

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.040
while you're eating.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.200
I also like using, as in using
kombu, agrettian sea beans,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.255
which one of my farmers,
Marin Roots, I think--

00:10:18.255 --> 00:10:20.380
I don't know if they're at
the Palo Alto Farm ever.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.080
But they're always at the
ferry building on Saturdays

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.850
and the marine
market on Thursdays.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.660
They have a lot of swamp,
and they can grow agretti.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.840
Which is like salty,
earthy, just brightness.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.924
Sea beans, like at Haven
right in Jack London Square,

00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:36.090
they used to grow out there.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.410
I would not use them.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.190
But they grow in
those kind of areas

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.470
where you can just have
a salty brightness that's

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.980
not kosher or fleur de sel.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.290
And they're lovely.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.420
I also like using
stuff like togaroshi,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:56.755
and other kind of peppers,
and sancho to kind of give it

00:10:56.755 --> 00:10:57.630
a little bit of heat.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.520
So we just got a little
togaroshi and some fleur

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.777
de sel, and ground it
up that we'll sprinkle

00:11:02.777 --> 00:11:03.735
on top of the tomatoes.

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:08.900
This might be taking it too far
if you want to do it at home.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.239
But K&amp;J Farms, which is
one of my favorite farms--

00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:13.780
she grows a lot of
great stone fruit.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.120
She goes kaffir limes,
which are bright, and green,

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.080
and beautiful.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.580
And they're great just
microplaned like on a salad.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.690
But I like to burn them.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.761
So I throw them in the
oven for about six hours

00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:27.760
at 500 degrees until the
point where they become

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.320
a charcoal for the most part.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.810
But there's so much
essential oils in the skins

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.410
that it still smells and
tastes like kaffir lime,

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.597
which I'm sure all of
you have had kaffir

00:11:37.597 --> 00:11:38.680
lime before at some point.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.157
I brought a fresh
one somewhere so

00:11:41.157 --> 00:11:42.490
that you can see the difference.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.680
And it's crazy to
me that this was

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.930
burned for five to six hours and
it still has the essence of it.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.350
And it just brings
it down a notch.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.750
But it still has that
subtle like, what is that?

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:53.800
Oh, that's kaffir lime.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.530
I love the thought of people
being like, what is that?

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.400
And just thinking constantly.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.750
So we burn that out.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.480
We made the salt.
We made the kosho.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.320
Tomato water.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.720
Let's just pretend this
dashi is done and beautiful.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.850
We're doing it vegetarian style.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.350
So instead of
seasoning with salt,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:15.430
I like to season with soys.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.920
Normally it's a shiro soy,
because it's like a clear.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.030
But if you don't have shiro
soy at your house or shio koji,

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.620
a regular tamari or
soy sauce will do.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.510
It'll just adjust the
color a little bit.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.690
And this will make it so
it's not just a hit you

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.150
in your face, like,
uh, that's salt.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:36.400
It'll just be like, oh,
that's a lovely little water.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.410
Tasting everything
along the way too.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.480
I make my cooks
taste all day long.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.210
Like from the point where
it's almost inedible so they

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.060
understand where it's at, to
an hour later to being like,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.800
OK, that's where
it's at in an hour.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.360
Here's where it's at two hours.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.520
And so they're constantly
understanding the process

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.730
of seasoning, and
cooking, and opening

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.420
their minds to what it's
supposed to be, in my eyes.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.060
So the tomato water is
seasoned and beautiful.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.310
We have the blanched tomatoes.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.476
Do you want me to
plate on a plate?

00:13:05.476 --> 00:13:06.997
May I just take this one?

00:13:06.997 --> 00:13:07.622
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.460
KIM ALTER: You can kind
of do whatever you want.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.190
My go to vinegar
is always Banyuls,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.430
because I think it's not
as sweet as balsamic.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.140
It's not as acidic as Sherry.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.330
It's a little bit more refined.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.100
I never use something
like white vinegar.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.840
Only to clean things.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.160
Personal preference.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.710
But fresh citrus is
always a go to for me.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.020
So I thought, let's
sub it with lemon.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.790
So you're getting a
lemon dress salad.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.470
My hands are clean.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.270
But we'll just go like this.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.000
You're not going to actually
eat this vinaigrette.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.860
You don't want seeds.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.040
So just some straight
up lemon juice, salt,

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.810
like right in the beginning.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.550
Something that I do
in the next salad,

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:53.590
I like to crush
garlic, and just let

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.340
it sit in the actual
vinegar and oil

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.966
so it infuses maybe
some garlic flavor,

00:13:58.966 --> 00:14:00.715
but it's not going to
hit you in the face.

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.800
It's all about, I think,
subtleness with me.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.430
So you could do
something like that.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.970
Editing and doing what you
want with the recipe I think

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.530
is why recipes are there.

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.800
Following a recipe,
and myself included,

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.570
it's never going to come out, I
think, how the person intended.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:15.820
So just throw your own.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.090
Add more salt. Add
some lemon zest.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.470
Change it up and use--

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:21.570
I normally use shiro soy.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.870
But we're using tamari today.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.900
That's how you get
creative and start thinking

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.690
about different ways to cook.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.400
And so recipes are
always like a base.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.990
That's why my recipes
probably weren't

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:35.230
the best for these lovely people
who were figuring them out.

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.330
They were a little weird.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.530
So we have a little bit of
lemon juice, a whisk, a fork.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.540
You can make it kind of
a broken vinaigrette.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.100
I always like to use olive
oil when I'm making a salad,

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.450
just because sometimes
extra virgin gets

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.190
a little bit too bitter.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.230
So since we already
have bitterness

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:58.350
from the kumquat, and
peppers, and things like that,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:00.490
I'll just use a
straight up olive oil.

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.620
I use a 90/10 from
[? Scabika, ?]

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.350
which is a farm in Marin.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.840
So we barely made any here.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.150
Oh, you know what I
didn't talk about?

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.157
The sesame.

00:15:12.157 --> 00:15:13.990
This one you're going
to have to do at home.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.160
But you need a Teflon pan.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:15.910
Do you have one?

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.570
AUDIENCE: I don't.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:18.820
KIM ALTER: Then we'll fake it.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.560
So there is a pan de tuile,
which is basically a bread

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.990
tuile that you make in a pan.

00:15:29.247 --> 00:15:30.080
We have time, right?

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.919
KIM ALTER: And I think most
people have Teflon at home,

00:15:34.919 --> 00:15:36.460
because it makes it
so you don't have

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.016
to clean them as much, right?

00:15:38.016 --> 00:15:39.640
So everyone has a
Teflon even if you're

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.520
using it for a purpose
that's not for Teflon.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.410
A pan de tuile is
basically something

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.642
that makes this salad
look very beautiful.

00:15:46.642 --> 00:15:48.850
I'll show you on my Instagram
what the salad normally

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.670
looks like, just so you can
see, since it's probably not

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.870
going to look the same.

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:55.270
But basically a pan de
tuile is really easy.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:59.740
This is just sesame paste,
oil, flour, and water.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:01.240
I've done this
without sesame paste.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.040
I'm going to do something sweet
and just do flour, water, oil,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.100
and salt. And then you can add
like a dehydrated strawberry.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.570
And you have a
pretty tuile that's

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.120
going to be on top of a
dessert, like a creme brulee

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.320
that you made at home.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.667
I've put it on a lobster
salad without sesame paste.

00:16:16.667 --> 00:16:17.500
And it's just brown.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.250
And then we sprinkle a
different kind of powder on it.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.740
So it's a different color.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.650
You just basically want
to get this ripping hot.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.550
And the heat is going to
evaporate the water, which

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.610
will make holes in the
tuile, which they have

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.340
some examples in case this
doesn't work out perfectly

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.090
for me right now.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:40.300
But while that is getting
hot, I will plate this salad.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:46.420
I always like to season with
a little bit of kosher salt,

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:53.210
even though we're going to
put on fleur de sel as well.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.877
And then tasting throughout
the whole process obviously.

00:16:56.877 --> 00:16:58.960
I'm not going to eat with
a microphone on, though.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.510
So we'll pretend
that I did taste.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.500
And then plating is
always up to you.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.819
Put your own style on it.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.940
I always like to think
of food as something

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.520
like a mountain or
a desert, and things

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.337
are growing out of other--

00:17:17.337 --> 00:17:18.670
this is a little slippery plate.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.650
So it might not be it.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:20.890
But you always want height.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.180
If everything was flat, which
is what's happening right now,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.280
it could be a little bit boring.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.959
So this definitely looks
a little bit different

00:17:29.959 --> 00:17:31.750
than I would normally
do at the restaurant.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.910
But I think that
you'll get the idea

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.400
when I show you my Instagram.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.140
So you're kind of
building a salad.

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.340
And then all of the components
that we talked about.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.860
I like to just kind of
put little pluches almost

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.710
of like the finger
limes everywhere,

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.090
just so you get little
hits of acidity.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.535
And then this is pretty spicy.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.180
So not like a ton.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.240
So not every single bite will
coat your palate with pepper.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.680
And then have like
sea beans growing out

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.010
of the ground a little bit.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:16.100
This might be hot enough.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.350
You basically want it smoking.

00:18:20.087 --> 00:18:21.420
But I don't know if you can see.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:25.470
But the water
automatically evaporates.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.680
And the holes start.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.850
Which is what gives the
cool kind of effect.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.190
And really my mom can do it.

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:40.196
So that means that
you guys could.

00:18:40.196 --> 00:18:42.120
AUDIENCE: How did you
make the paste, again?

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.790
KIM ALTER: So I have the
recipe I'm happy to give you.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.950
But it's just water, oil,
salt, and a little bit

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:47.700
of sesame paste.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.080
And you just shake it up.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.910
And you really want
the pan super hot.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:54.660
But it just starts to
create little holes.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.890
I made a bunch earlier today.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.670
So you will see a better
representation of it.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.800
Microplane is definitely
one of my favorite tools

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.920
in the kitchen, because
you can zest anything.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.977
Herbs, or like
nutmeg, the kaffir,

00:19:07.977 --> 00:19:09.810
lemon zest, just to
give it some brightness.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.995
And I just like to go a little
bit over with the charcoal.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.330
That's one of my favorites.

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:23.795
And then kind of
garnish with salt.

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:26.040
Eh, not my best one.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.930
But I'll steal one of those
if there's going to be any--

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.235
I might be forgetting something,
but for the most part it's--

00:19:36.235 --> 00:19:37.090
oh, tomato water.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.690
We make a gel at the restaurant
to give different textures.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:48.200
But you can just pour a little
bit of the tomato water.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.370
And it'll be like a
nice bright salad.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.670
So kind of.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:56.757
It's kind of like this.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.270
All right.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:02.450
On to the next.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.052
Thank you.

00:20:07.052 --> 00:20:09.260
AUDIENCE: So chef, I was
looking and listening to all

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:10.730
the ingredients you have here.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.052
And as our program is--

00:20:12.052 --> 00:20:13.760
KIM ALTER: I swear
it's not overwhelming.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.050
AUDIENCE: Well, what's
really interesting

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.160
is there's a lot of parallels.

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.660
And Chef Marty can
probably contest.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.554
We have a huge focus
on getting users

00:20:20.554 --> 00:20:22.345
to enjoy eating more
plants and vegetables.

00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:24.393
And when you have something
as beautiful as this,

00:20:24.393 --> 00:20:27.440
and as complex as this,
I guess the question

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.995
is, what is your philosophy
on having fruit and vegetables

00:20:31.995 --> 00:20:33.120
really be at the forefront?

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.464
You've got so many
interesting aspects here.

00:20:35.464 --> 00:20:36.380
It's very intentional.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:38.213
You've got a lot of
flavor, depth of flavor,

00:20:38.213 --> 00:20:39.510
textures, colors.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.760
Has this been something that
you've always focused on?

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.490
Has it evolved over time?

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:46.010
KIM ALTER: You know, I
think my mind changed when

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:49.310
I worked at Manresa, for sure.

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:53.450
Working with such amazing
people, like Marty,

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.310
[? Kinch, ?]
Jeremy, James, who I

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.980
think was here a few
weeks ago doing this,

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.210
it just changes your mind.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.520
And then physically
working on a farm.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.790
And it's such hard work,
and planting things,

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:07.100
you really just want
the vegetables to shine.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.920
And working for
Daniel Patterson,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:14.750
obviously, like he's
very vegetable focused.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.480
And there's a lot of
different reasons behind that.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.360
I think a lot of
it is food cost,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.350
and just really letting
California shine.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.670
Like I moved to Chicago.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.820
I lasted one winter and
then came right back.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.260
But the reason why
I came back was

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.775
because I couldn't
understand not

00:21:31.775 --> 00:21:33.025
going to the market every day.

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:35.894
I couldn't wrap my head around
manipulating like an apple,

00:21:35.894 --> 00:21:38.060
and then deconstructing it,
and then turning it back

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:38.780
into an apple.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.010
Like that's rad.

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.090
And I respect that so much.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.030
But for me, I'm
not on the length

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.370
of like Alice Waters, where
it's like figs on a plate.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.930
But I'm somewhere in between.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.930
I really just want the tomatoes
to be amazing, and then

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:54.680
have highlights of whether
it's an Asian ingredient

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.390
or a succulent to make that
vegetable kind of shine

00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.912
forward.

00:21:58.912 --> 00:21:59.870
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.030
KIM ALTER: So I think
it's definitely grown.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.850
Chef Marty influenced me a ton.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:07.520
I mean, just blew my mind
when we were working together.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.040
I heart him the most.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.150
So on to the next.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:11.790
Tofu.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.260
So one of my first ever dinners,
I was paired with Hoto--

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.310
which Ming Tsai is the owner.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.020
And it was his first
dinner ever as a farmer.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:23.420
And I got to go on the first
tour to see how it was made.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.450
And growing up in
a very hippie town,

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.930
we would get tofu mushroom
burgers, all a little tipsy

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.430
after going to parties.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.940
And then I thought
it was amazing.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.850
And then I tried his tofu,
and I was like what have I

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:35.970
been eating my whole life?

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.090
Like what is this
disgusting stuff in water

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:39.680
that you get at Safeway?

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.950
His tofu, there's so much
fat and protein, and so much

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.636
deliciousness in it, like
the soy milk you can drink,

00:22:45.636 --> 00:22:47.510
and you can create so
many different products

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:51.110
from this that you just
start thinking, how can I

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.940
make this, not like meat, but
how can tofu be the forefront?

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:00.440
How can we make something that
people think is gross really--

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.380
most people aren't
tofu and tempeh fans--

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:06.580
into, wow, I want
to go eat some tofu?

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.970
So I love curing things in
miso, whether it's a vegetable,

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:14.540
curing carrots in miso,
or curing tofu in miso.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.790
It really adds a different
flavor and texture

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.330
to something.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.840
And I'm actually
working with Min

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.750
about hopefully producing
something on a bigger level

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:26.950
that someone could
buy at home so they

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:30.632
don't have to sit there, and
get all dirty, and wait for it.

00:23:30.632 --> 00:23:32.840
I have some miso that I've
been curing for six months

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.810
to see what happens.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.710
I have a lot of weird
experiments in my refrigerator

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.760
at home, because we don't have a
lot of space at the restaurant.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.410
I have some cream
that I think has been

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:43.760
aging for about two years now.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.990
My partner hates it.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.430
[LAUGHS]

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:49.375
But for miso, I think
the longer that you

00:23:49.375 --> 00:23:51.500
let it go, the more moisture
is getting sucked out,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.416
because it's salty, and
it's all these things.

00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:56.180
So this has only
been a couple days.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.840
And then we're going to sear it.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.880
So this was a play on gribiche.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.130
Which I love gribiche.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:03.470
And how can we let a
vegan or a vegetarian

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.960
enjoy something that I
get to enjoy on a day

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.080
to day, because I eat like
four boiled eggs a day.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.990
So working at
Ubuntu and Manresa,

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.710
we used to do a lot
of gribiche I think.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.740
And this was my
kind of play on it.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:22.790
So to make the gribiche, you
can either do just regular tofu,

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.910
or the miso cured tofu,
and kind of cut it up,

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:27.770
almost emulating an egg.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.990
And you can either use
a knife, or if you want,

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:35.900
use a microplane if you wanted
a little bit more kind of soft.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.802
I like the texture
of the knife cut

00:24:38.802 --> 00:24:40.010
of something like a brunoise.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:47.830
So I will cut them like an onion
dice or something like that.

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:48.330
Sorry.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.480
I've only had coffee today.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.420
I'm really shaky.

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.540
I just don't want
to cut my finger.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.700
Cut it into any shape you
want as big as you'd like.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.670
And then I like to use
fermented black beans a lot.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.310
You can get a container
of fermented black beans

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:06.720
that will probably be OK for
your whole life at Chinatown

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.610
for like $2.99.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:11.010
I like I think the
Yang Jiang brand

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.150
that you can get on Amazon.

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:14.940
And they do a flavored
one with ginger.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.850
But I just like the
straight up fermented beans.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:21.900
I just think it's a really good
substitute for, in this case,

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:27.090
the anchovies, or just bringing
some umami to the plate

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.137
that you normally wouldn't
have from just salt.

00:25:31.137 --> 00:25:32.970
Definitely I don't know
if you guys ever had

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.180
from eating them before,
kind of get a good grip

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.640
as to where the salt
level is, because it

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.072
can get overpowering.

00:25:40.072 --> 00:25:43.680
And it has, I don't even
know how to explain it,

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.070
almost like miso kind of umami.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.350
I've used that word
like four times already,

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.460
but it's just got a
really rich flavor that's

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.200
going to bring some
depth to a salad that

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.540
could be maybe boring.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.200
We have a couple different
components going on.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.600
I'm just going to take this.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.130
Add a little bit of oil.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.380
And then I put chives
kind of in everything.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.060
I'm that person who eats onions.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:18.150
And I think it stems from
when I was working in really

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.320
strict four-star kitchens.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.420
And you had to have perfect
cuts of leeks and onions.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.878
I didn't want the
chef to ever see.

00:26:22.878 --> 00:26:25.170
So I'd eat them when they
weren't the perfect cut.

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:29.760
And so now I just see myself
eating chives and onions

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.900
for no reason.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.680
Now that I'm the
chef, I still do it.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.180
But I kind of put in shallots,
onions, and all those things,

00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.280
and everything.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.790
So a little bit of chives.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:41.490
You can just like
even tear parsley

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.736
if you don't want to cut it.

00:26:43.736 --> 00:26:46.110
Or skip that if you don't want
to buy a whole bunch so it

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.477
doesn't go bad in your fridge.

00:26:48.477 --> 00:26:50.310
I like to put, like I
said, kind of shallots

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.690
and garlic in everything.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:56.610
And you can either cut
them really small, or just

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.937
bigger like me, since I
like to eat them like that.

00:26:58.937 --> 00:27:00.770
And then you can kind
of put it to the side.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.645
You normally don't need
to add too much salt,

00:27:02.645 --> 00:27:05.600
because the fermented bean
is going to be your salt.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.570
But tasting, like I said, will
always be a way you can tell.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.250
With the tofu being
cured in miso,

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.710
that's adding a lot of flavor.

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:22.000
So you don't need
to add too much.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.330
Searing it, the miso
definitely can stick.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.890
So using actually
your Teflon pan

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:28.590
is probably a better
way to go than what

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.215
I'm about to do right
now, because it's

00:27:30.215 --> 00:27:31.680
going to stick and
burn, and maybe

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.300
smoke out this whole place.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.370
So we might pretend
a little bit.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:39.555
But basically, you kind of
can wipe off some of the miso.

00:27:39.555 --> 00:27:41.250
And you can reuse the miso too.

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.770
Like I'm a big fan of
thinking that there's flavor

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.460
that has created into that.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.155
A good amount of oil.

00:27:48.155 --> 00:27:49.530
And it's probably
not hot enough.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:50.696
So, again, we're pretending.

00:27:50.696 --> 00:27:53.400
And we can just let it sit
there and start to caramelize.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.401
You want to get a
little bit of a brown.

00:27:55.401 --> 00:27:57.400
If you get it a little
black, that's no problem.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.560
I like trying things a lot.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.740
I mean, you don't want
to think cancer black,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.620
but like char
black, where it just

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.510
gives a little bit of flavors.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.850
Lovely.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.100
This might be a little
bit much at your house.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.100
But I love yuba.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.570
So yuba is kind of
in the same lines.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.970
We used to do it with milk.

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.400
And then also soy milk.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.610
And a kin forms on the top.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.710
And if you ever get an
opportunity to go to a tofu--

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.475
I don't want to say farm--

00:28:23.475 --> 00:28:25.320
a center where they
make it, it's just

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.480
like a swimming pool of soy milk
with these wood kind of planks,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.080
and then people just pulling
up the skins, literally

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.870
the skins that have
formed from the air.

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.240
And then they just drain.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.310
I feel that hotos are the best.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.890
The ones that we make
at the restaurant

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:45.810
don't hold up to frying.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.239
I mean, this is insane.

00:28:47.239 --> 00:28:48.780
And that's because
of all the protein

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.050
that they have in theirs.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.590
So we make as much as we
can in the restaurant.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.936
We make our own butter.

00:28:53.936 --> 00:28:55.560
Everything gets made
in the restaurant.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.810
But I will not make
my own of these,

00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.790
because I think
that they're good.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.600
And we use them.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.080
We're a tasting menu
restaurant in a city

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.940
that has a ton of restaurants.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.470
And so we try to
be as accommodating

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:08.629
as we can to everybody.

00:29:08.629 --> 00:29:10.170
So if someone's a
vegan, gluten free.

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.336
Someone came in with the
Whole30 diet the other day.

00:29:12.336 --> 00:29:13.600
And I was like, what that?

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.110
And I'm like googling like
what these things are.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:19.140
But we want to make
everyone feel welcome.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.940
So we have a lot of
things to supplement.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.890
I always am thinking
when I'm doing a menu,

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.480
will a vegan like this?

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.170
What can I do?

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:29.010
So we always kind of have yuba
as a possible gluten supplement

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:34.140
if we're doing like a pasta,
or a supplement for meat

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.610
if it's a vegan, and it's
not the entree course.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:41.520
So I recently have been
told I shouldn't eat gluten

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.920
and sugar, which really sucks.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.330
And when my staff makes
pasta, which they try not to

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.064
so I don't feel bad, they'll
make me some with yuba.

00:29:51.064 --> 00:29:52.230
And it's a great supplement.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.852
Just throw it in the water.

00:29:53.852 --> 00:29:55.560
If you guys have ever
been to State Bird,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.470
it's one of their signatures.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:58.750
Just some yuba in a pan.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.270
Toss it in some garlic and oil.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.610
It's amazing.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:04.110
Yeah.

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.930
We're faking this.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.502
So at the restaurant
we'll fry it.

00:30:08.502 --> 00:30:10.210
I'm just going to put
it in there with it

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:11.830
and see if anything happens.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.580
And we fried it a
little bit ahead of time

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.690
to kind of have a crispiness.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.481
So you have a couple
of different textures.

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.560
So you're going to
have the raw tofu

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.590
as a gribiche, a seared
tofu to have the more

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.720
earthy carmelization
flavor, and then

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:26.700
the fried yuba as crunchiness.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.559
Having no texture in something
I think gets people bored.

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:31.850
It's kind of along the same
lines of not having acidity

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:33.810
and brightness in chili.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:37.770
So having different textures
gets you interested,

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.900
especially if it's
something like a tofu salad.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:46.132
So while that's frying,
we can kind of mix greens.

00:30:46.132 --> 00:30:48.590
I personally love chickpeas on
this, because they're bright

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:52.370
and they hold up to what
will be the vinaigrette.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.950
If you want to do this
with arugula, spinach,

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:58.070
or anything, like I
said earlier, making it

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.560
your own makes it yours.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:04.784
So on this one we
have chickarees.

00:31:04.784 --> 00:31:06.200
To make the
vinaigrette, it's kind

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:12.530
of like a play on a Caesar
salad, which is not vegan.

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:13.190
But you can.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.800
I've done this dressing
with a soft tofu

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.660
in supplement of the egg.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.520
So when you're
making a Caesar, you

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.780
want a nice ribbon
on your egg yolks.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.610
And we use a Robot
Coupe sometimes.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:34.760
But when we're feeling old
school, we'll do it by hand.

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.020
I have a way tougher
right arm than a left arm.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:43.821
And then once you get it to a
nice ribbon, you add the acids,

00:31:43.821 --> 00:31:46.070
which, for me, are a lot--
and this I'm actually going

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.290
to reference my recipe--

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:52.730
I use red wine vinaigrette, rice
wine vinaigrette, or vinegar.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.560
Dijon mustard kind of
also holds and makes

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.950
the vinaigrette stable so
it kind of stays emulsified,

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:03.620
and it isn't like a gross,
broken egg vinaigrette.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.610
I put miso in it to kind
of just really bring home

00:32:07.610 --> 00:32:11.602
the fact that I love
using Asian ingredients.

00:32:11.602 --> 00:32:17.370
And some soy and Parmesan.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.520
And we'll microplane
some garlic up in there.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:25.270
Sorry.

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:31.190
Like I was saying
earlier with the garlic,

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:33.770
to add a little bit of heat
without making it insane,

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:35.750
throw in some chili, just
like a couple pieces.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.200
And while you're whisking
everything together,

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.200
it'll infuse that chili flavor
without killing your palate.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.480
I am a baby with spice.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.490
I can't really take a lot.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.740
It could be the 20 years
of cooking, and drinking,

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.790
and I don't know.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.200
Too much coffee.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:33:01.590
So I go really light
on anything spicy.

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.760
And, again, this is something
that at the acidity level

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.610
that you like, the
dressing that you like,

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:17.750
you can add as much oil or as
little to make it your own.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.995
Maybe I don't understand how
your guys' flat tops work.

00:33:21.995 --> 00:33:23.730
AUDIENCE: Jared's on it.

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:24.540
KIM ALTER: Oh.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.380
We'll fake it.

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.460
Or you can fix it.

00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:30.120
You can kind of see.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.700
I don't know if you
guys can see this.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.120
By slowly adding a
little bit of oil,

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.340
you're just creating
an emulsification,

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.600
which is how you make like
a non-broken vinaigrette.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.680
Constantly whisking.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.320
It's how you make
an aeoli, anything.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.720
And then just a
slow stream of oil

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:52.110
brings it all together,
which I'm not going to lie.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.100
At my house I normally just
throw a tortilla on a stove

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.740
and put a little
bit of butter on it.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.026
And that's what I eat.

00:33:58.026 --> 00:33:59.900
But when I'm feeling
fancy, I'll do something

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.450
like this, which is rare.

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:04.775
But it happens.

00:34:11.729 --> 00:34:13.020
I think that's an extra virgin.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.519
You can already
taste the bitterness

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:16.155
in it, which is fine.

00:34:16.155 --> 00:34:18.030
Could I just have a
plate to plate the salad,

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.779
if you don't mind?

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:24.750
When I'm dressing a salad
I never really put it

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.739
directly on the greens.

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:28.530
I kind of always put it like
around so you're not just

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:30.744
drenching the greens.

00:34:30.744 --> 00:34:34.830
It can pick up the
dressing along the side.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:37.199
And then season the
lettuce as well.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:38.370
I'm not a big pepper person.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.745
I normally don't
put it on a lot.

00:34:39.745 --> 00:34:41.730
But on this salad, I
think it's pretty nice.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:47.870
Sorry.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:48.370
Tasting.

00:34:50.918 --> 00:34:53.570
Pardon my eating.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.239
So gribiche is normally
like creamy sauces

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:57.560
at the bottom of the plate.

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.370
So we'll put it on the bottom.

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:02.230
I just did something
actually for bon appetite.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.697
Very similar.

00:35:03.697 --> 00:35:04.780
Except we added asparagus.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.100
So we just roasted some
asparagus, a fried egg,

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.220
and had the tofu gribiche on
the bottom, roasted asparagus,

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.070
a bunch of like beautiful
greens and flowers.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:21.467
And it looked really nice.

00:35:21.467 --> 00:35:22.050
And then yeah.

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:25.190
Just a little bit of height.

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.910
And then seared
tofu and fried tofu.

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.800
Sorry it's not searing.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:35.132
Once you sear it and you
get it beautifully brown,

00:35:35.132 --> 00:35:35.840
just some slices.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.430
And you can kind
of intermittently

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:47.330
put it in your salad so
you get little surprises.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:51.350
And then fried tofu
chip kind of on top.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.920
And then if you want to be
fancy, a little bit around.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:05.086
And super easy tofu salad that
has some meat to it I think.

00:36:05.086 --> 00:36:05.585
OK.

00:36:05.585 --> 00:36:07.710
AUDIENCE: Now you get to
take a break for a second.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.830
[LAUGHS]

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.440
KIM ALTER: Sorry I
talk fast and a lot.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.497
[LAUGHS]

00:36:13.497 --> 00:36:15.580
SPEAKER 2: So we have a
few minutes for questions.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.496
I have a few that I'm
going to start off with.

00:36:17.496 --> 00:36:19.090
But this is always
our interactive.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.260
And we have chef for
another 10 or 15 minutes.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.960
So if there are
initial questions,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.980
raise your hand quickly.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:26.304
Otherwise I will start.

00:36:26.304 --> 00:36:27.070
Yes.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.684
AUDIENCE: Besides
tortilla and butter,

00:36:28.684 --> 00:36:30.974
what are some like
quick, if you're tired,

00:36:30.974 --> 00:36:32.015
or you have half an hour.

00:36:32.015 --> 00:36:32.890
KIM ALTER: At my house?

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:33.348
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:33.348 --> 00:36:34.264
Like what do you
make for yourself?

00:36:34.264 --> 00:36:35.638
AUDIENCE: What was the question?

00:36:35.638 --> 00:36:35.868
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:36:35.868 --> 00:36:36.701
Repeat the question.

00:36:36.701 --> 00:36:38.590
KIM ALTER: So when
I'm at home and I just

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:41.390
worked an 18 hour day, and I'm
like what do I want to cook?

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:42.520
And it's not a tortilla.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.840
Well, it's normally
an ice cream bar.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.880
No.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.330
I was actually on a child
video where they're like, cook

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:50.560
something late night.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.640
And they took six chefs.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.510
And I'm like green beans.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:53.230
I love green beans.

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.572
So it was just like seared
green beans, and chili flake.

00:36:55.572 --> 00:36:56.530
And I'll just eat them.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:57.696
I like to eat with my hands.

00:36:57.696 --> 00:36:59.860
And I would just cook some
green beans real quick.

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:00.490
Five minutes.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.360
Throw in some chili flakes.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.170
Squeeze some lemon.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:03.627
A little bit of salt. Done.

00:37:03.627 --> 00:37:04.960
I wouldn't even clean the sides.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.880
And then, of course, like the
chefs from the video after me,

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.080
it was Daniel Humm.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.090
And he made a peach
gazpacho with fois gras.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.485
Charles Phan from Slanted Door
busted out his wok at his house

00:37:15.485 --> 00:37:16.610
and did a whole fried fish.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:20.740
And I'm looking like a real jerk
eating green beans in my ghetto

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:21.910
kitchen.

00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:23.140
But I do things like that.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:27.070
Normally actually I always
have rice in my fridge.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.620
Rice and kimchi is kind of
my go to with everything.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.940
It's what I eat on
my day off and when

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:35.360
I'm at home to try to stay
healthier and satisfied.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.780
AUDIENCE: What is it
again with kimchi?

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.300
KIM ALTER: Brown
rice and kimchi.

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:41.180
Always.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.115
I cook for my dog.

00:37:43.115 --> 00:37:43.750
Well, I make--

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:44.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:46.750
AUDIENCE: He eats
better than anybody.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:50.230
KIM ALTER: My dog eats
better than anybody I know.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.627
His name's Ralph.

00:37:51.627 --> 00:37:53.710
But we always have brown
rice and chicken for him.

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:55.660
So I don't take his food.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.570
But I mean, I always make
extra brown rice for myself

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.961
and then have it there, because
we always have my dog's food.

00:38:02.961 --> 00:38:03.460
But yeah.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.585
That's what I cook.

00:38:05.585 --> 00:38:06.210
SPEAKER 2: Yes.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.710
AUDIENCE: What's
your favorite thing

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:09.950
that you've cooked in
one of your restaurants?

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.200
KIM ALTER: That's really hard.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.310
I know what I get pegged
to cook a lot of times.

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:19.810
But for me, it's normally
the simple thing.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.049
When I have guests
come to Nightbird,

00:38:22.049 --> 00:38:23.590
they still request
things that I used

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:25.900
to cook at Haven,
which is I think

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.880
normally frustrating for chefs.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:28.480
It's funny.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.855
I change my menu
every two weeks.

00:38:29.855 --> 00:38:31.720
And I try not to
replicate anything.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:34.060
When I go out to eat, I get
the same thing every time,

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.290
no matter where I'm at.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.420
If I'm at a Thai restaurant,
I order the same thing

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:37.937
every time.

00:38:37.937 --> 00:38:39.520
We went to Blue Plate
the other night.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.382
I get the meat loaf
and the burgers.

00:38:41.382 --> 00:38:43.090
Or the meat loaf and
the mashed potatoes.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:45.210
And if it comes off
the menu, I'm pissed.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.870
But at my restaurant
I'm like, let's

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.200
change it after two weeks.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.960
So actually I'm really happy
with my menu right now.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.940
I'm doing kind of what
I call a crowd pleaser

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.409
menu, which is like, I
really like our tomato salad.

00:38:58.409 --> 00:38:59.950
So I'm using Tenbrink
Farms tomatoes.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:00.970
And I made a burrata.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.440
So I got burrata.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.375
And I emulsified
it into a siphon,

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:06.250
and made it aerated so
it's a little bit more

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.390
refined with lovage.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:08.400
Which I love lovage.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.650
It's kind of like a
fruity celery almost

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:14.680
in a pumpernickel crouton
with little baby cucumbers

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.520
from Tucker Taylor.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.370
And it's just bright.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:18.370
But it has a creaminess.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:20.350
But it doesn't take
away from the tomatoes

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:21.370
because it's a spuma.

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:24.160
So I think it's definitely
one of my favorite dishes

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.299
that we're doing right now.

00:39:26.299 --> 00:39:29.750
AUDIENCE: I'm always
afraid to use that raw egg.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:33.694
How do you-- is this always
safe to use a raw egg?

00:39:33.694 --> 00:39:35.670
Like can you use it
to make a [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.850
KIM ALTER: For me,
I feel comfortable.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.400
I mean, I don't put eggs in
refrigerators at my house.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.031
My farmers never have--

00:39:44.031 --> 00:39:46.530
I put them in a refrigerator
once it gets to the restaurant.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.440
But like at my house when I
get like a dozen eggs for me,

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.140
they sit out on a counter,
because they never

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.550
normally see refrigeration.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.466
And they're perfectly fine.

00:39:55.466 --> 00:39:57.090
But I know where I'm
getting them from.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:58.080
I know what farm.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.000
I know when those
eggs were laid.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.740
And I know when I
shouldn't use them.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:05.250
And if you ever don't
know, put it in some water.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.500
And you can tell by
the floatiness of it

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.880
if it's gotten to the point
where you shouldn't eat it.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.430
But I mean, eggs
pretty much stay

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:13.110
good for a good amount of time.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.210
But normally I would say
get like a half a dozen

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:16.470
so you go through
them in a week and you

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.678
don't have to worry about it.

00:40:17.678 --> 00:40:20.760
But, I mean, Caesar salad,
all those dressings,

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.680
unless you're buying
it from like a bottle

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.390
in a store at a restaurant,
same difference.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:30.330
It's just like an egg yolk,
Robot Couped, and oils

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:31.200
emulsified into it.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.150
So it's technically raw.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.420
But some people say that
it's being cooked by the heat

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.926
from like a blender.

00:40:37.926 --> 00:40:40.050
I mean, it all says-- but
as long as you know where

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:41.250
your eggs are--

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:42.050
anything actually.

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:43.350
As long as you know where
everything you're eating

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:45.058
is coming from, you
shouldn't be worried.

00:40:45.058 --> 00:40:47.984
I have done pork tartar before.

00:40:47.984 --> 00:40:50.400
I called it tartaranosis, and
no one thought it was funny.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.050
And no one wanted to eat it.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:55.290
But I feel comfortable
eating it because I

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.985
know what that pig's name was.

00:40:56.985 --> 00:41:01.080
And I think California, we're
really lucky to be in a place

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:05.460
where the farmers care and are
at farmers markets every day.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.426
And I know you guys
are super busy.

00:41:07.426 --> 00:41:09.300
You can't go to markets
every day like I can.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.130
If I had a job like yours
I probably wouldn't either.

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.760
But just going like on
a Sunday or something,

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.597
and then that lasts
you for the week.

00:41:16.597 --> 00:41:18.930
I mean, you also have amazing
chefs cooking food for you

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:19.430
here.

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:22.560
But when you feel
like cooking at home.

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.000
I think there's a really
amazing farm not far from here.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.630
A farmer's market not far from
here that a lot of my farmers

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:29.130
go to.

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:31.213
Or if you're ever in the
city, the ferry building.

00:41:31.213 --> 00:41:32.160
And just ask them too.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.243
Like when was this picked?

00:41:33.243 --> 00:41:35.880
When did you kill these rabbits?

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.480
And they'll tell
you, cause they know.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.362
Cause they did it.

00:41:40.362 --> 00:41:41.820
SPEAKER 2: She
raises a good point.

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.730
Just a show of hands--

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:44.438
I'm not going to put
anyone on the spot--

00:41:44.438 --> 00:41:49.000
who here regularly shops
at farmer's markets.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.452
So I think it's a good
point the chef makes

00:41:51.452 --> 00:41:53.910
is to really get out there and
know where your products are

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:54.480
coming from.

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.370
I think the food industry,
for so many years,

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.834
has hidden the story
behind the food.

00:41:58.834 --> 00:42:00.750
And I think what Chef
Kim is doing is actually

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:01.560
celebrating that.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.830
So when you have time,
really get out there

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:06.765
and see where those
local farmers are.

00:42:06.765 --> 00:42:09.262
AUDIENCE: So first of all,
I actually [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:09.262 --> 00:42:10.738
my roommate, [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:10.738 --> 00:42:13.666
So those were [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:13.666 --> 00:42:15.166
So I'm very interested
to learn more

00:42:15.166 --> 00:42:18.610
about kind of the process of
putting out a tasting menu.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:24.022
So [INAUDIBLE] So what actually
inspires you in this process?

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:28.600
KIM ALTER: OK.

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.040
My mom was just here yesterday.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.730
And so I did a menu for
my mom a few months ago,

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.200
because she went blind.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.860
And through the grace of God a
year later a surgery happened.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.870
And she got transplants.

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.130
And now she can see again.

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:45.670
So when she was blind for
that year that I was aware of,

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.740
I started making a
menu that I was hoping

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.219
that she could appreciate.

00:42:50.219 --> 00:42:51.760
A lot of it touching
with your hands.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.550
A lot of things that were
just all whites or all brown.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:55.930
Because she could see blur.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:57.790
She couldn't just see people.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:00.970
And then before the
restaurant opened

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.320
she was able to see again.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.440
So the dessert was
all color and flowers.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:10.840
So I try to have a very personal
connection with each menu.

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.114
But then also sometimes,
like my last menu,

00:43:13.114 --> 00:43:14.530
being a little
creatively drained,

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:15.700
and dealing with a lot
of stuff with the city,

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.910
it was like summer textures.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.470
So it was obviously things that
are at the farmer's market that

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.182
are really bright,
tomatoes and corn,

00:43:22.182 --> 00:43:23.890
and then trying to
put a technique on it.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:25.690
But I'm working on
a menu right now

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:29.650
of like a lot of famous
chefs have died this year.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.890
So I'm doing a menu with
each course inspired

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:36.130
by a different chef who's
passed away that cohesively

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.140
can kind of come together.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.160
I try to pull from pop--

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.154
I did "A Christmas
Story" menu at Christmas.

00:43:41.154 --> 00:43:43.570
So I don't know if you guys
have seen "A Christmas Story."

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:44.740
It's my favorite.

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:47.020
And my dog's named Ralphy.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.470
But every course had something
to do with the movie.

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.860
Or I'm doing a menu right
now built with a musician.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:57.160
Like each course is a different
song that he has written.

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.560
So I try to do stuff
that interests me,

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:03.230
that's fun and a little kitschy,
but also has a cohesiveness

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.730
to it.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:10.310
And it just depends on my
creative level at the time.

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:11.590
I'm getting more sleep now.

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:13.060
So it's getting a
little more creative.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.893
AUDIENCE: Very cool.

00:44:13.893 --> 00:44:14.533
Thank you.

00:44:14.533 --> 00:44:16.006
KIM ALTER: Mhm.

00:44:16.006 --> 00:44:18.461
AUDIENCE: For someone who
didn't go to culinary school,

00:44:18.461 --> 00:44:20.916
what would you recommend
as the most [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:20.916 --> 00:44:23.371
of learning about,
not necessarily

00:44:23.371 --> 00:44:25.335
how to make food
for everyday life,

00:44:25.335 --> 00:44:29.995
but things that are a little
bit more extraordinary?

00:44:29.995 --> 00:44:30.870
KIM ALTER: Technique.

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:33.000
I mean, there are so
many cookbooks now.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.040
When I was starting off
cooking 20 years ago it

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.352
was like "On Cooking," and--

00:44:37.352 --> 00:44:38.435
AUDIENCE: There was eight.

00:44:38.435 --> 00:44:39.345
KIM ALTER: I know.

00:44:39.345 --> 00:44:41.100
But now it's like--

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.010
chefs are coming out with
cookbooks three years

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:45.220
after being open.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.100
And so there's so
much out there.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.990
Omnivore Cookbooks
in San Francisco.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.180
Cecilia is rad.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:53.700
It's kind of like a Kitchen
Arts, which is in New York.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:57.822
Books that are inspiring to
me right now that you could

00:44:57.822 --> 00:44:59.280
take technique and
actually do them

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.040
without having to buy
20 modern ingredients,

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.660
I would say I really like
the Astrance Cookbook.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.280
I think it's called--

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.420
it's a book for cooks.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.739
It's a restaurant in
Paris that's beautiful.

00:45:12.739 --> 00:45:13.530
I really like that.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:17.795
And, I mean, any
book, just I think

00:45:17.795 --> 00:45:18.962
the pictures inspire people.

00:45:18.962 --> 00:45:20.836
When they start reading
the recipes sometimes

00:45:20.836 --> 00:45:21.710
you just glaze over.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:23.668
I'm guessing sometimes
like when you're reading

00:45:23.668 --> 00:45:25.270
code would be the same thing.

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:26.700
So when you see these
bright, beautiful pictures,

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:27.900
and then you went to
the farmer's market

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.233
and you see those same things,
I think that's inspiring.

00:45:30.233 --> 00:45:32.910
So if you're in
the city, I highly

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:34.500
recommend going to
Omnivore Cookbooks.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.250
And she will find you whatever
it is you're looking for.

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:39.915
But I think that just
using your imagination

00:45:39.915 --> 00:45:43.560
and looking at the pictures
will make you push forward

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.380
and create something, I think.

00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.941
But honestly, "On Cooking,"
it was my first cookbook

00:45:48.941 --> 00:45:50.190
that I got in culinary school.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.540
And it teaches you
a lot of technique,

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.860
and how to do some
butchering things.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.420
So it at least
gives you the base

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.510
so then you can move on
to the Alinea cookbook.

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:01.660
I have a friend who was in tech,
and he got the Alinea cookbook.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.390
And he cooked his
way through it,

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:06.024
and did every
single recipe, which

00:46:06.024 --> 00:46:07.440
is more than I can
say for myself,

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.738
because that cookbook's insane.

00:46:09.738 --> 00:46:12.228
AUDIENCE: When you have
traveled [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:12.228 --> 00:46:14.995
what would you say are your
top five favorite restaurants,

00:46:14.995 --> 00:46:16.212
like as a chef?

00:46:16.212 --> 00:46:19.038
Like this is [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:19.038 --> 00:46:22.929
Don't have to be
expensive, but [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:22.929 --> 00:46:23.970
KIM ALTER: I've traveled.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.428
I mean, I've been pretty ball
and chained to my restaurant.

00:46:26.428 --> 00:46:28.530
But I've been to Dubai,
Zurich, and Paris

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:29.580
in the last few years.

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:32.910
And actually outside of
Paris I was most entranced

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:34.050
with La Grenouillere.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.240
And then I mean, at Astrance.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:39.750
In the city I go very
casual, and I love sushi.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.430
Japan is definitely
my next place.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:45.580
But I had an amazing
meal at Ju-Ni.

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:48.282
I was just in Zurich, and
I'm actually hosting a chef

00:46:48.282 --> 00:46:48.990
at my restaurant.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.406
And his restaurant's
called Jacob.

00:46:50.406 --> 00:46:53.390
And it was very much
like minded like me.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:58.770
And it's random,
but like in Dubai

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:01.819
going to Toro was delicious
and very eye opening.

00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:04.110
Because I can't remember all
of the names of the places

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.490
I went and ate lamb brains.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.350
But those would be
some of the restaurants

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:10.765
in the last few years I've
gone that were inspiring to me.

00:47:10.765 --> 00:47:11.640
SPEAKER 2: Excellent.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.931
Well, let's give a huge round
of applause for Chef Kim.

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:15.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:16.960
KIM ALTER: Thank you.
