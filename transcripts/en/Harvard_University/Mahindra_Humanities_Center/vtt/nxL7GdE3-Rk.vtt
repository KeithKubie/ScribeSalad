00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.470
Dear friends, thank you so
much for being here today.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.320
And I want to especially
thank Claire Messud, who

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:28.190
has been driven hoarse by her
various speaking engagements.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.865
I want to thank her for agreeing
to speak to us this evening.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.740
The best thing one
can do in introducing

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.300
an author to her audience
is to get out of the way

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.970
as soon as possible.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.490
I mean to do just
that after paying

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.000
a short tribute to Claire,
a dear friend and a valued

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.500
colleague.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.850
Claire is senior lecturer
in the English department

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.410
and host's the Writers
Speak series at the Mahindra

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.620
Humanities Center.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.850
For me, one of the
great experiences

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.640
of working with Clare to
establish the Writers Speak

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:24.630
series has been the experience
that if you look around today,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.280
there is absolutely no
question-- you don't even

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.840
have to work that hard to
see that the very cannon

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.770
and the very archive
of writing in English

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.020
has changed dramatically.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.830
While departments
are agonize over how

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.430
to diversify their
syllabus, their syllabi

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.920
in their curriculum,
here we have

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.101
hosted writers who we
have chosen because we've

00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:53.600
been interested in
them, and they've

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.160
been interested in coming.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.020
They come from all
over the world.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.060
They're writers,
some of whom actually

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.820
was first language is
Spanish, who write in French--

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.820
the diversity these days
amongst minority writers

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.460
and amongst writers,
who although they

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.760
belong to a majority
or take a very

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.300
oblique view on the
tradition, it's remarkable.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.120
And this has been one of the
great things about this series

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.150
that we have had
writers who have just

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.420
been chosen by us-- the
quality of their work

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.480
and we realize how great
the archive is today.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.740
And if you actually don't
think in those terms,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.080
If you don't give new
voices, older voices,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.560
voices from elsewhere
a chance, then you're--

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.730
you are depriving,
suffocating the archive

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.030
of contemporary writing.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.692
And I think that's been
a great experience.

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:53.900
Claire is a recipient of
the Guggenheim and Radcliffe

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.300
fellowships, and
the Strauss living

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.660
award from the American
Academy of Arts and Letters.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.510
The Burning Girl, published
at the end of August,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.620
is her sixth book.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.270
The best writers, and Claire
is simply one of the very best,

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.280
create a world that we recognize
as our own as our belonging,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.120
while helping us to explore
ways in which we might realize

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.240
our longing to plot
our lives afresh

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.870
or to desire the same old
things all over again.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.170
As we struggle to experiment
with the precarious perversity

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.770
that exists in what we
thought was predictable,

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.150
great writers never
say, "I told you so."

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.960
They tell us another story
and then another one that

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.380
doesn't beam the truth
straight into our eyes,

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.705
but redirects our gaze to take
in a more complex chiaroscuro.

00:03:54.705 --> 00:03:57.790
Claire Messud's writings
explore deep veins

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.920
of irony and affinity.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.650
But there is no cynicism in her
vision, no immodesty of purpose

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.320
or prose.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.770
As a friend and a writer,
our favorite authors

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.680
are often both, she remains
happily an intimate stranger.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.079
Claire engages with the
messiness of the moment

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:26.800
as it unsettles social rife and
renders psychic life fragile.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.450
She places us, her characters
and readers, at an angle

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.470
to what might be called
the face to face.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.370
Like the elsewhere
acoustic of echoes,

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.370
we hear ourselves entering
the world of her fiction

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.620
from a distance, emerging into
a slow, yet deliberate process

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.340
of self-awareness.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.070
The Burning Girl, a fable
of childhood friendship

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.700
lost and found,
coiled and recoiled

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.990
has the eerie accuracy of
an everyday school yarn--

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.910
slights, fights, envy, ennui--

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.680
that turns the ordinary into
augury and the predictable into

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.550
premonition.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.080
Julia, the narrator, sums
it up in a wonderful phrase,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.130
which suggests that when you
proceed with instincts rather

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.480
than logic, it's difficult to
know whether you are thinking

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.650
like a child or a prophet.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.410
The Burning Girl
bears some resemblance

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.660
to a coming of age novel, but it
is considerably more than that.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.880
It is, in my view, a
coming of rage novel.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.160
A novel that spares
nothing in trying

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.910
to understand how
relentless and redemptive,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.100
how desperate and defiant is
the power of making a story

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.390
and telling a story to
oneself or to others

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.770
to survive the trauma of
the transitions in our life.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.040
Like the mythic Cassandra,
these burning girls--

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.010
Cassie Burns, Julia
Robinson and Claire Messud--

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.570
with their ferocious gifts
of prophecy and poetry

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.070
torched the quiet town of
Royston, Massachusetts.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.090
Wait for it.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.980
And now, let me
get out of the way.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.310
Thank you, Homi, for that
beautiful introduction.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.690
I feel like I should
just go home now.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.660
That was the was so great.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.050
And thank you all
for being here.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.670
I know it is a
rough time of term,

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.380
so it's extraordinary
that you guys are here.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.470
Thank you for coming along.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:03.600
So you're a captive
audience, huh?

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.930
One of the things that--

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.080
I've been giving readings
over the course of the fall.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.290
And one of the things
that's become clear

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.590
is that people don't
actually much want

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.090
to hear readings anymore.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.170
They come, but they want
you to talk and not read.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.800
But I thought, well, today,
I could actually read.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.010
So I thought I would
do that if that's OK.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.800
And I thought I would just read
a couple of pages from the very

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.430
beginning that's-- that set
it up and then a scene--

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.670
whoops-- a scene
from a bit later on.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.070
The novel is narrated
by Julia and she's

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.340
telling it from just the
summer before her senior year

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.120
in high school.

00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:48.650
She's talking about her
best friendship with Cassie

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.430
and it's dissolution
or unraveling.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.410
The book is divided
into three sections.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.569
The first section is
the summer after--

00:07:57.569 --> 00:07:59.360
the summer between
sixth and seventh grade.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.670
The second section, which
I think of as time passes,

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.220
is seventh and eighth.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.106
And the third section
is in-- takes place

00:08:07.106 --> 00:08:14.670
in the spring of ninth grade,
by which time the jig is up.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.760
It's a different story depending
on where you start, who's good,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.070
who's bad, what it all means.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.870
Each of us shapes our
stories so they make

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.180
sense of who we think we are.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.790
I can begin when Cassie
and I were best friends,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.950
or I can begin when
we weren't anymore,

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.490
or I can begin at the dark
end and tell it all backward.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.190
There's no beginning
before though, Cassie and I

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.039
met at nursery school and I
can't remember a time when

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.190
I didn't know her, when I didn't
pick her sleek white head out

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.070
of a crowd, and know exactly
where she was in a room,

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.830
and think of her
some ways as mine.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.560
Cassie was tiny with
bones like a bird.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.840
She was always the
smallest girl in the class

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.050
and the span of her ankle
was the span of my wrist.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.070
She had shiny white blond hair,
almost albino she was so fair,

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.620
her skin translucent
and a little pink.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.360
But you'd be wrong
to mistake her size

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.070
and pallor for frailty.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.770
All you had to do was to
look into her eyes, still

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.870
blue eyes that turned
gray in dark weather

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.460
like the water in the quarry.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.350
And you could see
that she was tough--

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.480
strong I guess is a better word.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.732
Although, of course, in the
end, she wasn't strong enough.

00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:20.190
But even when we
were small she had

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.830
a quality about her, a "what
the hell" and "I'm not chicken,

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.904
are you?" sort of way.

00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:26.820
According to my mother
and to Cassie's mother,

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.120
Bev, Cassie and I became friends
in the second week of nursery

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.787
when we were four years old.

00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:33.870
That was always the story,
though I can't tell now

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.750
whether I remember it or have
just been told so many times

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.340
that I invented the memory.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.549
I was playing with a group
of kids in the sandbox.

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:42.840
And Cassie stood in the middle
of the playground, hands

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.240
at her sides like a zombie,
staring at everything,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.370
not apparently nervous,
but totally detached.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.460
I left my friends to
come touch her elbow

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.420
and I said, so I was told, "hey,
come build a castle with me."

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.574
And she broke into that
rare, broad smile of hers.

00:09:56.574 --> 00:09:57.990
A famous smile
made all the better

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.906
when she was [INAUDIBLE]
by the Georgia Jaggar

00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:01.410
gap between her front teeth.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.140
She came with me back
to the sandbox and that,

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.180
my mother always said, was that.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.010
So the first section--

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.340
well, I'm really
struggling with that wire.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.620
The first section, which takes
place in this summer just

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:25.570
before middle school--

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.520
the girls have been volunteering
at the animal shelter.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.280
And Cassie gets bitten by a
dog and has to have stitches,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.890
and so they can't volunteer
there anymore for a while.

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.320
And so they need
something to do.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.190
And Royston, which is a
town that doesn't exist,

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.770
but if it did exist
would be not far

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.380
from where Georgetown,
Massachusetts, is,

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.560
if that gives you some idea.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:55.222
Th-- there's a quarry outside
the town that they know about,

00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:57.180
and they decide to make
their way to the quarry

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.760
and beyond the quarry they
know somewhere in the woods

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.090
is an abandoned asylum.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:09.290
So there are--

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:10.530
Homi and I will be chatting.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.860
I don't want to go on about it.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:17.400
But what-- the intention was a
very simple melody with riffs.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.640
The intention wasn't
a archetypal story

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:27.030
of American adolescent
girlhood in which

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.150
the quarry and the
abandoned asylum

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.740
have their archetypal quality.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.940
But I-- so I thought I
would read about them--

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.400
their first visit to the asylum.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.230
And they've been looking for it.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.240
They've been stumbling through
the woods and they have--

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.360
and they come upon it.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.100
The sad building
loomed enormous.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.770
We crested the hillock
toward the light and at first

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.130
could see nothing but more
sky down the other side.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.890
100 yards down the slope,
we broke out of the trees

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.280
into what had obviously been
a large lawn, a field now.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.850
It's long grasses swaying in
the hot sun, the desperate saw

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:09.950
of crickets all around.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.200
Wildflowers were scattered
through the grasses--

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.270
flashes of pink,
purple, and orange

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.710
in the bleached ripples--

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:19.130
coneflowers, cosmos,
calendula, coreopsis.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.440
And the air is so long
moist between the trees

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.760
smelled dry, a late
summer smell of safety.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.960
The long grassy stretch
broken here and there

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.240
by wispy saplings ended in
steps leading to a stone patio.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.860
We'd come up the back.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.590
Instead of the circular drive,
the portico, and the garages,

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.960
we were confronted by
banks of darkened windows

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.770
like eyes in the three story,
u-shaped, brick facade,

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.619
as if the building were
an almost human monster.

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:47.660
On the ground floor, on
the wings at either side,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.880
we could see brown
painted metal doors.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.800
But in the middle
of the U, it's basin

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.590
if you will, stretched a
span of French windows giving

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.500
onto a terrace and there
just for a moment you could

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.520
picture the rich man's residence
the house had originally been.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.160
You could imagine the
French doors ajar, curtains

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.480
fluttering in the breeze.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.190
On the terrace a
few tables shaded

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.880
by large parasols and a house
party of elegant men and women

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.750
drifting, holding China
tea cups or smoking cigars.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.670
Then you noticed the
heavy padlocked chain

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.070
that ran through the
doors institutional bars--

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.710
rusty but still newer than
the general disintegration

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.090
it first suggested.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.540
Some poorly scrub blue graffiti
stretched along one wall.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.360
We could make out, "go
Cavaliers," our high school ice

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.360
hockey team and motherfuckers.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.270
"Lunchtime," I said, when
we reached the patio strewn

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.340
not only with leaves,
but with shards of glass

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.100
and strips of roof tile with
crushed beer cans and cigarette

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:40.820
butts.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.730
I slapped myself down on the
top step, the house behind me

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.520
and the hairy green forest we'd
come out of in front of me.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.419
And I opened the backpack on
the [INAUDIBLE] stone edge.

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:51.710
I laid out the tea towel from
my mother's clean kitchen

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.110
and on it I placed
the items one by one--

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.570
the carrot and cucumber
sticks, the hard boiled eggs

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.570
with their little sealed packets
of salt filched from diners,

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.570
the sandwiches wrapped in
foil, the camelback of lemonade

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.340
and the one of iced
tea their ice cubes

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.980
long melted after our trek.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.620
While we ate, Cassie
stalked the terrace,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.110
squinting in at the windows,
grasping her sandwich

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.210
with both hands in
her distinctive way,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:15.770
made slightly
comical by the fact

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.830
that one hand was a gauzy paw.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:20.930
What did we know
about the asylum?

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:21.799
Not much.

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:23.840
It had been built at the
turn of the last century

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.430
by a textile merchant named
Ebenezer Otis to house

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.580
his collection of Asian art.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.660
His mills were in Lowell.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.030
His city house was on
Commonwealth Avenue in Boston.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.810
But this, outside Royston,
was his country estate.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.880
The fortune was lost
in the crash of '29.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.860
And the house and the
art had to be sold.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.680
Some giant vases, ivory
dragons, and lacquered chests

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.510
were acquired by the
Peabody Essex museum

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.880
where a couple are
even on display.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.707
The state ended up buying the
property at a discount price.

00:14:49.707 --> 00:14:51.290
Where were the Otis
descendants today?

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.660
In condos on the
outskirts of Gloucester.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.790
And after leaving it empty
for a few lean years,

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.490
they converted it to a women's
mental asylum, the Bonnie

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.240
Brook.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.460
I guess there was
that brook at least.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.470
It housed up to
45 women at a time

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.500
stricken with a gamut of
complaints-- depression, mania,

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.474
schizophrenia, addiction.

00:15:08.474 --> 00:15:09.890
According to the
official records,

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.130
many got better and went
back to their real lives.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.550
Time passed, views changed,
laws and funding with them.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:19.010
By the late 1980s, it was
seen as unsalvageable.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:22.190
And by '93, the Bonnie Brook
was shuttered, forgotten.

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.230
Part of the same parcel
of land as the quarry,

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.850
it was sold to a
consortium that then

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.290
couldn't agree on its fate--

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.820
whether to refit
it as apartments

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.490
or restore it as
a mansion hotel.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:33.680
Word was there'd been
a dragging lawsuit.

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.310
It had been padlocked and empty
longer than I'd been alive.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.810
I imagined that the
building carried

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.139
the sadness of the women
who been trapped there.

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:43.430
The anorexic teenagers, and
the young mothers who heard

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.620
voices, and the old women
shattered past repair

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.880
by their tragedies.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.780
I didn't see them.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.880
There was no visible mass
of ghosts peering out

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.310
of the hollowed windows,
but I couldn't help but feel

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.260
they marked the territory.

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.570
Cassie didn't feel that way
at all, quite the opposite.

00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:59.120
She wouldn't be put off.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.190
I trailed after her as
she walked the perimeter

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.720
and climbed a
rickety fire escape,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.444
fruitlessly rattling the windows
in their frames on each floor.

00:16:06.444 --> 00:16:09.110
When we reached the front of the
house, its broad circular drive

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.200
long overgrown and its crumbling
stables off to one side,

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.760
she counted the entrances--

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.370
six ground floor windows,
three visible doors

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.290
and divided them between us.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.600
As I tugged half-heartedly
at a bolted knob,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.820
I heard the tinkle
of glass breaking.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.150
I looked to see Cassie curiously
bent, her ear against a window

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.230
and her paw to the frame.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.720
Her good arm stuck up
inside its shattered pane

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.710
like she was birthing a calf.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:33.510
"Are you fucking insane."

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:34.670
She didn't turn her head.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.380
Her tongue stuck out
between tight lips,

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.000
the way it did when she
concentrated in math class.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.100
But she paused
long enough to say,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.580
"It's going to work, Juju,
I'm going to get it."

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:45.050
And after a minute
more of trying,

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:47.150
"I didn't break the window, you
know, it was already broken.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.550
I just knocked the bits
sticking out along the edges."

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.051
"Tell that to the jury."

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:52.550
"Christ, what's
wrong with you," she

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.550
stuck her tongue out
again, twisted and fiddled,

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.610
and paused again.

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.320
"Can't you see
this could be ours.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.520
Our own world.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.090
A real world that we found,
and we made and we kept.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.860
Our real secret."

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.500
When she put it that way
I suddenly understood.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.129
The mansion looked different,
no longer a house of sorrows

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:10.670
or a hideout for
drunk hockey players

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.980
from the high school
or a possible flophouse

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.619
for escapees from the
penitentiary up the highway.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:16.790
I could see it--

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.470
the Bonnie Brook
as a magical place

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:21.410
we could invent, the two
of us and have us ours--

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.480
the way we thought of
it before I saw it.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.089
A stage for our best
imaginary adventurers.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:28.820
Like seeing the hot sun
and the crickets as a gift,

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.890
like the bright wild
flowers, instead of

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.330
as a sinister menace.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.820
Like we had the power,
Cassie and I, the two of us

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.407
12 years old, to make anything
into what we wanted it to be.

00:17:39.407 --> 00:17:40.240
I said, "Let me try.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.600
My arms longer."

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.810
Cassie and I looked at
each other almost smiling,

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.480
but not, a kind of
mutual Mona Lisa look.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.340
She extricated her
good arm, careful not

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.530
to nick herself on any
protruding fragments,

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.380
straightened and stepped
away, crunching broken glass

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.400
on the gravel as she went.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.340
I took Cassie's place
and folded myself

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:59.740
like a strange origami,
my cheek pressed

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:02.260
against an unbroken pane
and my neck stretched flat

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.380
along the rib of the window,
and my left arm, my writing arm,

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.110
I always thought faintly
guiltily my better arm,

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:11.170
up inside the house
squirming and reaching.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:14.330
The air inside the house was
cooler, fresh on my skin.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.790
I could feel the
lock, but I wasn't

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.070
able to reach quite high
enough to flick it from one

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.450
side to the other.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:20.890
Cassie started to laugh.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:21.670
"What?"

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:22.960
"Did I look like that?"

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.160
She made a crazy face.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.240
"It's hard.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.610
You don't need to tell
me," she laughed again,

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.520
light in her bird bones
like the wind in the grass.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.840
"It's not going to work."

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.690
My sweat left a film on the
window when I pulled away.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:37.630
"It's got to work," Cassie
said, "we're going in."

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.010
I peered in the window.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.530
We stood outside a big common
room with fancy moldings

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.230
on the ceiling and
wainscotting waist high.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.330
The plaster was crumbling
and in places mold

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.450
bloomed giant flower
paintings along the walls.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.280
A dozen folding
chairs stood stacked

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.490
in rows against the far wall
and old paint cans rusted

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.190
in piles next to a swing door.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:59.980
The air in the gloom was
hazed with dust and the floor

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.010
once fancy parquet, the kind
you might find in a ballroom,

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.422
was strewn with debris,
with plaster crumbs,

00:19:05.422 --> 00:19:06.880
and plastic bottles
and what looked

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.770
like a layer of dried mud.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.110
From the ceiling hung two
wagon wheel chandeliers,

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.270
ugly clunky things
surely acquired cheaply

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.745
to replace whatever had
originally been in the house.

00:19:15.745 --> 00:19:18.550
A long buffet bar extended
along the far wall.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.790
Next to the chairs,
the dining hall.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.380
Cupping my eyes
against the window,

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.120
I could almost see
the institutional room

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.130
with its stacks of
damp fake wood trays

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.500
and stringy haired
shiftless girls barely older

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.810
than me lined up
before steaming vats

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.790
of baked beans and
soggy broccoli.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.529
Some hideous perversion
of summer camp

00:19:35.529 --> 00:19:37.570
where you didn't get any
care packages and nobody

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.550
came to take you home.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.290
I could see too the
parquet sparkling

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.790
beneath the crystal
chandeliers that

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.980
once had hung from
their sunburst moldings

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.020
and the flickering wall
sconces along the walls,

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.540
this diffuse and
inconstant light

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:52.330
illuminating again the
faces of girls and boys

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.970
not so much older than me,
but in a different life.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.130
One of spangled baubles
and velvet dresses.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.480
The young men in dinner jackets.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.220
A jazz band installed
in the rooms

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.250
back right corner where
I could swear a dais

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.920
had been placed
precisely for them.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.680
Instead of the plastic paneled
buffet bar with its red heat

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.460
lamps, long cloth covered tables
bore silver tureens of punch,

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.550
and pyramids of petit fours
and chocolate strawberries.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.100
And behind these stood a quiet
row of young men and women

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.740
in dark uniforms,
the staff attending

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:24.270
to every whim of the North
Shore's gilded youth.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:28.680
Just a big abandoned room,
almost empty, but like Cassie,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.140
I understood now
that we had to go in.

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.200
I suggested breaking the window
pane above the broken one, that

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.820
would put the window latch
firmly in my fingers.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.880
We knew we were crossing a line.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.700
This went further than trying a
joint with Devon McIntyre down

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.790
in the cemetery at Luna's end
of school party back in June

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.130
or then Cassie filching a
20 from her mother's wallet

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.560
to buy a jumbo bag of
Skittles and big gulps of Coke

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.830
at the multiplex when Bev had
expressly forbidden us to.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.270
This was lawbreaking.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.220
The sign on the gate out at the
road did say, "No trespassing.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.190
Trespassers will be prosecuted."

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.230
And we were already
trespassing and were

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.110
about not just to enter,
but to break and enter.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.620
But it felt necessary, like we
didn't really have a choice.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.300
I made Cassie stand
far back while I

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.850
broke the window because
I didn't want the glass

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.260
to bounce up and hit her.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.930
And I didn't want the fragments
to get in her bandage.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.700
She stood by with
the otherworldly look

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:21.180
she'd worn when we crossed the
field, a look, if you like,

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.850
of destiny.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.470
When we'd climb through the
open window, Cassie whooped.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.410
A testing sort of whoop,
louder at the end,

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:30.090
that echoed in the hollow room.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.220
Then she spun in circles,
arms outstretched,

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.320
leaving swirling marks
along the dusty floor,

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.820
whooping the whole time.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:38.430
I fussed about a glass cut
along my elbow, not deep,

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.290
but I squeezed out a
little rivulet of blood

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:41.990
that I wiped with my
finger and sucked.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.490
My mother always told me that
if you don't have disinfectant

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.500
you want to make sure
the cut bleeds cleanly

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.820
to wash the germs out.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.830
So that's what I did first.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.320
We push the swinging door to
check out the kitchen's two

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.930
big rectangular
rooms, laid end to end

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:56.700
with black and white
checkerboard flooring

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.530
like at my house,
but miles of it

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.450
like something out of
Alice in Wonderland

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.280
and rows of stainless
steel counters

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.440
dulled by years of filth.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.960
Cassie tried the taps at
one of the industrial sinks,

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.610
but nothing came
out, which was just

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.790
as well as it would have flushed
the complex spider's web spun

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.710
across the sink itself.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.980
We opened some cabinet doors,
not metal, but painted wood

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.480
or once painted wood.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.760
And when we left them open
the doors dangled drunkenly

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.590
on their hinges,
but found nothing

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.600
except a clutch of
stiffened paint brushes

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.136
and an ancient, empty
gallon plastic Coke bottle.

00:22:28.136 --> 00:22:29.760
"People have been
here," Cassie pointed

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.218
to some sticky rings in the
dust on one of the countertops,

00:22:32.218 --> 00:22:33.390
"before us."

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:34.307
"Not for a long time."

00:22:34.307 --> 00:22:36.806
"Do you think the Coke's from
when they moved everything out

00:22:36.806 --> 00:22:39.780
20 years ago or from last year
when, say, DeLouis Runyon was

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.250
hiding out here."

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.659
DeLouis Runyon was a high
school junior from Worcester,

00:22:43.659 --> 00:22:45.450
famous because he beat
up his math teacher,

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.600
also his hockey coach, and ran
away before the cops got him.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.630
He was missing for 72 hours
and then turned himself in.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.110
Nobody knew where he'd been
exactly or they weren't saying.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.734
But he hadn't been
at the Bonnie Brook,

00:22:55.734 --> 00:22:57.120
we were too far from Worcester.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.270
Most likely he'd been in
his girlfriend's garage.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:00.780
"Last year?

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.996
I doubt it, but maybe
not so long as 20 years.

00:23:02.996 --> 00:23:04.870
Remember the chains on
the doors at the back?

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.150
They're newer than that.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.340
So maybe they had a problem
with people, you know,

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.560
coming in a while back,
like five years or 10

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.390
and put the locks on."

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.890
We both considered
the crazy number

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:15.306
of days in which
this building had

00:23:15.306 --> 00:23:16.890
stood empty, how
any one of them--

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.410
far more days than either
of us had been alive,

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.966
though not quite as many as
all of our days put together.

00:23:21.966 --> 00:23:23.340
In this house
anything could have

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.500
happened and most
strangely of all,

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.930
how on most of those days,
even almost all of those days,

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.280
nothing had.

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.152
Sure, kids like us
had broken in before

00:23:31.152 --> 00:23:32.610
and hung out drinking
on the patio.

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.850
And maybe a few times some nut
had spent a night here, maybe

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.500
even half a dozen nights.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.660
Imagine someone had even
lived in the Bonnie Brook

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.870
for a month, that would still
leave 17 years and 11 months,

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.000
well over 6,000 days and
nights of total silence.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.080
A once human habitation
uninhabited, given over

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.450
instead to spiders, and
chipmunks, and robins,

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.060
and potentially
the occasional fox.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.740
It overwhelmed in
the way the night

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.660
sky overwhelms when
you lie on your back

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.110
in the grass and stare at it,
at all the tiny points of light.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.880
And imagine the
unimaginable distances

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.430
between those stars and
earth and how long even

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.346
the light has taken
to get to your eye,

00:24:07.346 --> 00:24:09.470
so long that maybe the star
that emitted that light

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.330
is already, in
actuality, long gone.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.210
"I vote we see upstairs
first," Cassie said.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.250
In the front hallway, we
peered up the staircase

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.350
at the big stained glass
window with its lilies

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.270
in a vase and crimson tracery--

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.910
only a few panes knocked
in, their bright fragments

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.590
scattered on the wood floor.

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.044
Someone had pulled up boards,
leaving rutted gaps underfoot.

00:24:29.044 --> 00:24:30.960
But the newel post at
the bottom of the stairs

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.240
had proven too sturdy
for the thieves.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.270
It's carved finial was the
size of my head, a great, once

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.800
polished ball of patterned
flowers and vines.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.640
A vinery traced all up the
banister and the length

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.010
of the balustrades as well.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.990
"Can't you see the grand
ladies coming down,"

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:49.230
Cassie breathed at my ear,
"in their evening dresses."

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.444
"Sure, I can," I said,
and it was true, I could,

00:24:51.444 --> 00:24:52.860
"and right behind
them, do you see

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.320
the crazy girls in blue smocks
with their hair sticking up

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.550
anyhow and wild eyes.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.950
Do you see them, too?"

00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.790
I gave a great
cackling laugh that

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:02.345
resounded up the stairwell--
an evil mad woman's laugh.

00:25:02.345 --> 00:25:03.720
"That's the noise
they're making.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.386
Can you hear it?

00:25:04.386 --> 00:25:05.910
It's wicked loud."

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.070
"Don't," Cassie pressed my arm.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.170
We both looked up the
stairs at the dust motes

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:12.900
drifting in a shaft of
sun across the landing.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:14.130
We could feel them with us.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.140
I knew she did,
just as much as I.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.110
And they too were our sisters.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.250
"Don't."

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.360
To be in that ruin
with Cassie, it

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.360
was such a particular feeling
that I've had nowhere else.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.520
If ever I have it again,
I will recognize it

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.670
like a long lost scent, and
that afternoon and the ones that

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:33.330
followed will return to me in
all their visceral intensity.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.660
The Bonnie Brook was at once the
most unlikely, vivid experience

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.510
of our lives up till
then and like a dream--

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:41.460
a dream miraculously
that Cassie and I

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.810
dreamed in tandem, touching,
hearing and feeling together.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.750
The asylum was darkened
by the traces of its past,

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.420
made titillating even
scary by its silences,

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:54.030
but made safer too
by our sharing it.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.710
Being in the Bonnie
Brook was like being

00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:59.970
inside both Cassie's head and
my own, as if we had one mind

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.920
and could roam its
limits together,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.740
inventing stories
and making ourselves

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.700
as we wanted them to be.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.200
I'll stop there.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:08.876
Thank you.

00:26:08.876 --> 00:26:14.112
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:14.112 --> 00:26:15.560
Claire, thank you very much.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:20.750
It's wonderful to be read to.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:26.620
I think people don't quite
realize how comforting it is.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.120
People have mixed
feelings about it.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.950
Some people really dislike it.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:31.489
Those are the
competitive people who

00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:33.280
want to hear their own
voices all the time.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.770
Maybe, maybe.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.090
But let me ask you something.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:42.820
When you were writing
this book you said to me,

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.770
this is a small book.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.510
I'm writing a small book.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.950
I've written a small book.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:56.590
And I want to ask
you about that.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.990
I want to ask you about scale.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.146
In fact, I thought we'd
talk about four things

00:27:00.146 --> 00:27:01.520
and then open up
to the audience.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.530
One is scale.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:08.960
The other is voice,
love, and narrative--

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.570
four aspects.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.670
Four small things.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:11.957
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:11.957 --> 00:27:13.790
Well, I mean small in
the sense in which you

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.260
claim this is a small book.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.970
I mean, in the same sense.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.760
So I mean, you know, I
know that Conrad thought

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.400
that Heart of Darkness was a
small book that he was writing

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.650
in between Lord Jim.

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.330
He couldn't quite do
it, and he thought

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.130
he should write a small book.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.770
And I think Thomas Mann
thought Death in Venice

00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.770
was also relatively
a small book.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.990
What makes a small book small?

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.690
What is it?

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.726
I'm interested in
the scale question.

00:27:40.726 --> 00:27:41.225
It's short.

00:27:41.225 --> 00:27:45.307
[LAUGHS] I mean, you
know, it's interesting.

00:27:45.307 --> 00:27:46.140
Do better than that.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:46.640
I'll try.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.280
I'll try.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.070
I mean, it's interesting.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:53.720
Because a number of people
that you said to me, oh, well,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.570
of course, the scale
of, the ambition in this

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:00.410
is so much smaller, less than
in some of your other books.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.770
And I feel like I have been
a little baffled by that.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:09.650
Because actually, it seems to
me that the challenge for me

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:10.690
was greater.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:13.190
Or certainly, I mean, it always
seems like a great challenge

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.190
whatever you try, right?

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.340
If it doesn't seem
impossible, why bother?

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.950
But the challenge was
simplicity, right?

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:30.620
So the challenge was to
try to write a story that

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:36.260
would have about it, as you said
in your lovely introduction,

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.760
that would have
about it the quality

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:45.640
of a simple bildungsroman,
That would have about it

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.540
a sort of familiarity.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.720
But it's like a souffle, right?

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.120
Like, I feel like the
aim was, like, a souffle.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.910
The aim was to write something
that people could sit

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.760
down and read and just enjoy.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.800
And then I had an idea.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.989
You know, you never know.

00:29:01.989 --> 00:29:02.530
Does it work?

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.220
Who knows, who knows?

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.720
But somebody said to me, oh, I
read your book a second time,

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.580
and it was completely different.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.300
It felt like a piece of
quartz, that I turned it--

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.670
I turned it, and it
was a different book.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:18.244
And I felt that was a
great compliment to me.

00:29:18.244 --> 00:29:19.910
I mean, I took it as
a great compliment,

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.201
because that was what I wanted.

00:29:21.201 --> 00:29:25.460
I wanted it to be something that
would seem simple and possibly

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.990
even familiar, but
that would have

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.060
certain strangenesses
about it that that

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:30.710
would make a reader think, huh.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.300
Well, that clearly
was on purpose.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.440
So what?

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.760
Let me look again.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:41.950
And then upon looking again,
there would be this other,

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:43.810
if you will, this
other story revealed

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.730
or these other
questions explored.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.320
Yeah, the souffle
thing only works

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.810
because you've got to eat
the souffle straight away.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.710
If it collapses, it actually
doesn't taste that different.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.611
But it loses its
aesthetic standing--

00:29:57.611 --> 00:29:58.110
Right.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.270
--so to speak.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:01.250
But let me say this.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:04.010
That there's, of
course, another way

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:07.940
of thinking about this, which is
Walter Bingham [INAUDIBLE] way.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.620
That you take the
small thing, which

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.840
is polished and
polished and polished,

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.750
and it just throws out
all kinds of light.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:20.587
Now the notion of small and
big is interesting, of course,

00:30:20.587 --> 00:30:21.170
in literature.

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:25.920
Because in a funny way, this
is not a bildungsroman, I feel.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.520
It's not, because as I said,
whereas in a bildungsroman

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.390
there is a kind of,
at the end of the day,

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:34.900
a sort of moral realism
that takes over.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.490
Here, the rage never stops.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.220
In the end, the dream
at the end, you know,

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.420
that great dream at the
end is full of complexity.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.980
It's full of passion and
incest and love bites

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.865
all over and unresolved.

00:30:50.865 --> 00:30:52.490
I mean, I don't mean
actual love bites.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:55.550
I mean wounds, you
know, that you see.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.680
But it seemed to
me that a painter--

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.750
it's interesting that
Peter is here today--

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.740
a painter would never say a
miniature work is a small work.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:07.550
Because in a way, scale
is about complexity.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.700
And that's why I
felt that I was just

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:17.900
very interested in where
and how you decided to work,

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.730
to play out this narrative,
which is about youth

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:26.120
and sexuality and puberty
and growth and death

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.860
and the mistakes
of one's parents,

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:31.020
all in this very
compressed form.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.170
Why Royston?

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:39.340
What were you trying to
do with these locations?

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:41.850
You know, my question
is not about context.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.400
It's not about why is
this a small town novel,

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.200
is it a big town?

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.272
Is it a city novel?

00:31:46.272 --> 00:31:50.610
It's more about how you assemble
the different bits of it,

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.400
the mythos, the
mythical parts of it,

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.250
the fable with the
realist detail,

00:31:56.250 --> 00:32:02.370
with the girlish silliness,
with the girlish maturity,

00:32:02.370 --> 00:32:03.940
with the fear.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:04.650
Right.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:12.390
I mean, it's a good question.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.505
I think one of the things--

00:32:14.505 --> 00:32:16.380
there are a couple of
my students here today,

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.004
and this is not what one should
say in front of one's students.

00:32:19.004 --> 00:32:21.940
But it's all a mystery.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.130
It's all a mystery.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.641
I can't really tell you.

00:32:24.641 --> 00:32:25.140
I mean--

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.310
Royston is a mystery?

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.680
Well, I think what leads
one to make certain--

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:35.700
I mean, I'm actually a
great believer in intuition,

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.790
in the id at work.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:45.010
And I can give you all sorts
of reasons why Royston.

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.880
You know, Royston, which
had another name until I

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.740
realized that all of the--

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.716
it had a Germanish name.

00:32:53.716 --> 00:32:55.590
But then I realized,
actually, in that corner

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.570
of Massachusetts, all
the names are British.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:59.882
[MAKES BUZZER SOUND]

00:32:59.882 --> 00:33:02.090
If it were upstate New York,
that would be different.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.585
Maine-- that would be different.

00:33:06.396 --> 00:33:08.520
You know, there are all
sorts of practical reasons.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.730
I wanted these girls--

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.000
and it's interesting.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.130
People talk.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.870
People keep referring to
sort of Julia and Cassie.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.230
Cassie's mother
is a hospice nurse

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.147
and Julia's father is a
dentist and her mother

00:33:25.147 --> 00:33:26.230
is a freelance journalist.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.370
And people say, well, of
course, upper middle class

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.070
Julia and struggling Cassie.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.250
I'm, like, Cassie, in
the scheme of the world,

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.010
is not struggling.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:37.199
Cassie's a middle
class girl, too.

00:33:37.199 --> 00:33:38.240
She's perfectly well off.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.730
Her mother's a professional.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.010
I feel as though the ways
people want to talk about--

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.080
and that was important
to me-- that it

00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.774
wasn't a story about girls
who come from radically

00:33:48.774 --> 00:33:49.940
different class backgrounds.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:53.020
One happens to be more stable
and slightly more prosperous.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.660
But they're actually both--

00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:00.020
but I wanted them to
be from households

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.710
where the understanding and
the prospects looking forward

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:05.004
were quite different.

00:34:05.004 --> 00:34:06.920
Which is to say the
difference between a house

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.080
where it's assumed you'll
go to college and a house

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.770
where that's not an
assumption that all.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:17.130
And I actually-- maybe
that can happen still

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:20.750
in Cambridge, just about.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:25.090
But I feel that by the time
you got to high school,

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.639
the distances would be greater.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.290
The small town, you
know, this may not

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.581
be what you were asking at all.

00:34:31.581 --> 00:34:34.175
But there were all sorts
of practical reasons.

00:34:34.175 --> 00:34:36.050
I can give you all sorts
of practical reasons

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.230
why I needed it to be
a town of this scale.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.386
And I wanted it to be
outside-- in Massachusetts,

00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:44.719
but I did not want it to be
Western Massachusetts, which

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:45.594
is a different thing.

00:34:45.594 --> 00:34:49.520
I wanted it to be closer to
Boston, all of this stuff.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.199
And because the
quarry, the quarry

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.960
was in there from
the beginning, that

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.710
was another eastern
Massachusetts thing.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:01.340
So you know, there were
just all sorts of--

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.220
every decision you make sort
of limits the further choices.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:06.470
And eventually,
you come down to--

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.320
I was watching for
the first time--

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:14.790
I'm ashamed I hadn't seen
it before, but Skip's DNA,

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:15.416
you know?

00:35:15.416 --> 00:35:16.790
And I feel like
at some point you

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.740
do those DNA tests--
it's like, well, you

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.010
have only four possible
great grandparents.

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:22.487
That's it, like, right?

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:24.320
I mean, at some point,
it's a similar thing.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.627
You put all this stuff
together, and it is where it is.

00:35:26.627 --> 00:35:28.460
But of course, one of
the interesting things

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:34.490
here is that the issue, the
social issues you talk about,

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:39.290
the aspirational issue,
are so finely made, finally

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:42.140
problematized by the fact
that, at this age group,

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:48.920
if you're in school together,
Cassie and JuJu think

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.750
the same thoughts.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.333
I was just going
back to your reading.

00:35:51.333 --> 00:35:54.620
It doesn't matter that one
is in a single parent home.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.790
The other is somewhat
different [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.330
And I think that's
the beauty of it.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.960
That there is a
certain point at which

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.150
you realize that your
futures and your destinies

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.780
are going to be different
unless you really fight them.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.340
But I want to take
up this phrase

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.970
you used, the id at work.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:15.410
And of course, the id
at work in this novel

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:18.626
really is a first
person narrative.

00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:20.880
If you think about
it, the id at work,

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:26.020
as it gets a form in this novel,
is the first person narrative.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:30.420
And this is where I want to
bring in the question of voice,

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.580
partly because many of
the reviewers, I think,

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.880
have got it the wrong
way around and keep

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.720
asking the traditional question
about first person narratives.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.340
Which is, is this
a reliable author

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:43.890
or is this an unreliable author?

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:46.080
This is a, you know,
post-Wayne Booth

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.730
in The Rhetoric of Fiction.

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:51.290
Or is there authenticity in
this first person narrative?

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:53.970
Does the narrative hold
together as it goes on?

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.840
And of course, there, this
is a work about transition.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.776
So it cannot hold together.

00:37:00.776 --> 00:37:03.630
But it seems to
me that this idea

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.130
of thinking about
first person narratives

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:10.680
as belonging to persons is
almost less interesting,

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.080
as you show in this
book, than the way

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.320
in which the first
person emerges

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:18.570
in different mis en scene.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.600
So in the quarry scenes,
the first person narrator

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.000
is a different kind of narrator.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.010
In the other scenes
in school, it's

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.104
a different kind of
first person narrator.

00:37:28.104 --> 00:37:30.270
And there, I thought, was
something very interesting

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:32.550
in this novel, and
didn't allow you

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:37.106
to use the moral calculuses,
is this a [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:37.106 --> 00:37:37.980
is it a nonrealistic?

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.030
Is it reliable or not--
but, or otherwise.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.880
But you also brought
to mind something else.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.222
Which is that first
person narratives

00:37:47.222 --> 00:37:50.410
are vampiric narratives.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:55.310
They feed-- the narrator
feeds off the life and blood

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:59.320
of somebody else to the
extent to which you ask,

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:02.010
because you do
with, say, Conrad--

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:07.052
why the hell is Marlow
so obsessed with Kurtz?

00:38:07.052 --> 00:38:08.516
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:08.516 --> 00:38:09.500
But why?

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.820
What is there about--

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.152
Why is Marlo so obsessed
with Kurtz, or indeed, here--

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.140
Julia?

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.390
It's almost as if she
doesn't have a life--

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.350
[LAUGHS]

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:25.459
--outside of this
obsession with--

00:38:25.459 --> 00:38:26.000
She has some.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.330
She makes some other friends.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.750
But she makes-- it is all
so self-conscious, you know?

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:31.651
If I tap this boy's
hand, is he wincing?

00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:32.400
Is he not wincing?

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.235
Is he coughing?

00:38:33.235 --> 00:38:33.860
Is he sneezing?

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.880
All very interesting,
but the real issue here

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.410
is that without Cassandra--

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.057
Right, there is no story.

00:38:43.057 --> 00:38:43.690
Yeah.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:44.190
Right.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.900
But I mean--

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:45.650
There's no person.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:46.557
There's no person.

00:38:46.557 --> 00:38:48.140
But, I mean, there
are various things.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.140
And I think those two
things are not unrelated.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:59.720
And there is the
fact that we could

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.690
say the trajectory throughout--

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.420
I mean, for me, this is a book
about this transition from--

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.711
I mean, it's about many things.

00:39:06.711 --> 00:39:09.260
It's about what happens in
this transition from childhood

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:16.950
to adulthood, from a sort of
state of accepting the world

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:20.480
and however strange it may
be without really questioning

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.180
your place in it, to a period--
which is what adolescence is--

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.440
when you look up,
and you look around,

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.060
and you say, well,
where do I fit in?

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:31.820
And how do I relate to
these people next to me?

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.300
If going to her house,
if her house is normal,

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.260
my house is not normal.

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:38.440
So which is it,
hers or mine, right?

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:42.110
There's this sort
of taxonomy that

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.840
goes on of trying
to sort of order

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:48.080
the world in some way
that seems logical.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:53.350
And to sort of claim a voice--
and part of claiming a voice,

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.540
it comes from absorbing
all the narratives

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:02.660
that we have internalized and
heard and watched and been

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.090
told from earliest childhood.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:11.220
And for me, you know, there
are many, many stories

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:15.590
that are in this simple story.

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:21.770
From Hansel and Gretel to, as
you know, I've said to you--

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.570
many years ago, I said,
I think to you, Peter--

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:28.785
I said, when asked, what
would be a sort of influence

00:40:28.785 --> 00:40:31.220
or antecedent-- and
I said, Le Grand

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.830
Meaulnes the
Alain-Fournier novel.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:35.680
And--

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:36.680
[INAUDIBLE]

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.630
And by and large,
you know, that's

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.370
just not a common reference now.

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:44.150
So when I said that to my
editor, she was, like, huh?

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:47.660
But Ursula Le Guin, reviewing
the book in The Guardian

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.790
in the UK, said, and
this book reminds

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:50.790
me of Le Grand Meaulnes.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.170
And I felt-- it was great.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.045
It was a little like
the [? quartz ?] moment.

00:40:54.045 --> 00:40:56.390
I was, like, well,
OK, maybe it's

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:59.390
only obvious to five
people in the world.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.360
But that's OK.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.600
It's there.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.820
And anyway, but I digress.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:10.010
But the taking of a
voice is something

00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:14.610
that is a mishmash, a sort
of pastiche of all the voices

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.130
that we've heard.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:22.610
And we come into
our adult voices,

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:27.850
such as they are, by a sort of
maceration and bastardization

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.250
of all sorts of
different voices.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:35.960
You Again, a digression,
but you know, expressions

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.560
like in any way, shape, or
form that people sometimes

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:45.320
throw in, because it
sounds professional, right?

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.742
Because it sounds like--

00:41:47.742 --> 00:41:49.700
in any way, shape or form
is actually, strictly

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.970
speaking, a phrase that has
no purpose anywhere, right?

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.410
It doesn't do anything, right?

00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:55.460
It's a kind of taxonomy.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.960
But it sort of sounds good.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.320
And when you're trying
to sound grown up

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.810
or you're trying to sound
impressive, you might say,

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.510
I don't agree with you in any
way, shape or form, right?

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:10.484
And it it sounds somehow better
than I don't agree with you.

00:42:10.484 --> 00:42:11.900
It sounds like
more authoritative.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:14.050
Or like when you're just about
to spit in somebody's face

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.140
you say, with respect.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:19.490
No, or as we say at
our house, no offense,

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:23.715
the phrase that presages
certain offense, right?

00:42:23.715 --> 00:42:25.590
Like, you don't say
that unless [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.460
But let me tell you
that, as an undergraduate

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.960
at my undergraduate
college in Bombay,

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.860
Le Grand Meaulnes
was a set text.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:35.370
We studied it there.

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.940
So amongst the five people
you know, I'm the sixth.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.510
But did you actually mean
to put in the importance

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:45.110
of being patience as playing
off The Importance of Being

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:46.490
Earnest?

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:48.590
No, that may have come--

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.710
The importance of being patient,
and I thought, how funny.

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.930
This is ripping off The
Importance of Being Earnest.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:56.346
That one that one will have
come, that one will have come.

00:42:56.346 --> 00:42:59.890
But you see, it's all
in there, you know?

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:04.940
I had this experience when
I was reading to my kids,

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.400
of discovering-- there was a
book that my sister and I had

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.579
loved as children.

00:43:09.579 --> 00:43:11.120
And it's called The
Wind On The Moon,

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.869
and it's by somebody
named Eric Linklater.

00:43:12.869 --> 00:43:15.570
And the New York Review
of Books reissued it.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:19.910
And when I read it to my kids,
now already some years ago,

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:21.830
I discovered that
all these jokes

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:23.900
that I thought of as
family jokes, that I

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.390
thought we made up, no.

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:29.010
They're jokes from
that book, right?

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.410
I mean, I felt we were just--

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:32.360
I want to go back to
something you said.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:35.190
Yes, of course, we
absorb all these voices.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:37.490
That's why I said, you
know, it's a kind of--

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:41.390
growing up is a kind of
vampiric exercise, you know?

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.240
We're all frankensteins
and of a certain kind.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:49.010
But what I wanted to say--
but here, interestingly,

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:53.250
you pick all those things
up, and then you shape them.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:56.290
But the point about this
is her making the story.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:43:57.010
Yes.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:02.120
Now you talked about the
taxonomic moment of this time,

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:04.190
in transitions, you know.

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.640
What is me is in me and not me.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.210
But the interesting
thing here is not so much

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:15.170
the taxonomic as I read it,
I may be wrong, with respect.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.480
You can read it anyway you want.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.020
But the tropic, the
translational entropic-- so

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.930
that she's continually
taking something, taking

00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:26.270
the binary taxonomy,
if you like,

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:29.420
and then translating it and
making it into a metaphor

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:32.550
and into a trope, putting
it in different places.

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.350
And this, again,
brought back to me

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:41.300
how inadequate the
critical approach

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.110
to voice as authentic
or unauthentic,

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:47.900
or voices simply belonging
to one person is.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:51.260
Because here, the
voice is neither--

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:54.650
in a way, it's JuJu or Julia.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:58.430
But the real issue is the
tension between her and Cassie.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:00.350
The voice keeps
going in between.

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.670
It's a very citational voice.

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:04.710
So we've done our voice bit.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:05.630
OK.

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:08.690
Now I want to talk about love,
quickly, and then narrative,

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:10.700
and then open up.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:16.550
So I thought that there was
a kind of real complex depth

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:20.870
when, you know, the
relationship breaks up, really.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:25.430
There are attempts where
it sparks up again.

00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.740
There are expectations
that this will last,

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:30.800
expectations on
Julia's mother's side.

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.170
And then it doesn't
last, et cetera.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:37.570
And then Julia
says, "If my mother

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:39.580
thought it would be the
first visit of many,

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.680
she was mistaken.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.700
Cassie was friendly
enough at school,

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:47.000
as if I didn't have
ice shards in my heart,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.210
as if I couldn't possibly.

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:51.490
But she must have
sensed something.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:55.680
Either that, or she
chose to keep a distance.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.390
I would not, could not make
a significant overture.

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.970
My pride depended on this.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.310
She would have needed to
make the effort enough

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.720
to be openly vulnerable.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.800
She would have had
to risk my revenge.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.890
She would have had
to risk my revenge.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.550
I like to think I wouldn't
have rebuffed her,

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:20.520
but it's possible
that I would have."

00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.000
And at this point,
you also begin--

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.650
this notion of risking my
revenge, at a personal level,

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:33.946
is also about risking something
in the making of the narrative.

00:46:33.946 --> 00:46:35.320
Because I think
one of the things

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.990
you say that you've got to
risk in the narrative is never

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.670
to show the whole thing.

00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:42.700
You only see the phases
of the moon, which

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.040
then allow you to
trace in your mind

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.320
the element that you don't see.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:50.530
It's the old Husserlian
problem of the horizon

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:52.750
being outside of what you see.

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.840
Then that made me feel a
wonderful way of bringing

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.890
together transitional moments
in one's life and childhood

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.670
or otherwise, where you
only see your shadow,

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:05.690
and you can't see the other
side of it, on the one hand.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:11.800
But also the way in which in
love, and in war, in fighting,

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.760
in amity and in animosity,
there is always the risk you

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.402
have to take.

00:47:17.402 --> 00:47:19.670
I take the risk
of interpretation,

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:22.390
but I also take the
risk of identification.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.810
And I thought those came
through rather beautifully

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:27.340
around the question of love.

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:28.120
Well, thank you.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:33.185
I mean, I do in a
sort of simple--

00:47:33.185 --> 00:47:35.810
as I was saying earlier, I read
a certain amount from the book,

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:37.000
except that people don't
really want me to read.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.958
So I've talked a certain
amount about the book.

00:47:38.958 --> 00:47:47.320
And one of the things that I
try to explain is that I had,

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:51.970
at this point, and I know
that a number of my peers

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:55.710
have also in different
ways, experienced

00:47:55.710 --> 00:48:01.810
a certain frustration with
realism as it was handed to me,

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:05.680
or as I experienced it, as I've
experienced it as a reader.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.400
And people have sort of dealt
with that in different ways.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:15.580
Rachel Cusk has sort of followed
a sort of Sebaldian track

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.790
of making herself all but--

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:19.480
her narrators all but invisible.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:22.730
And they tell the
stories of others.

00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:26.320
There's a British novelist
named Andrew Miller who

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.540
wrote a novel-- in an
interview recently--

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.730
that had fantastical elements.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:33.760
And I read an interview in
which he talked about the fact

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.810
that this arose for him out
of frustration with realism.

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:40.960
But I am sort of wedded to
realism in certain ways,

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.120
because I'm actually--
that's just who I am.

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.860
But it was actually--

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.750
I remember speaking
to somebody here

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:53.440
on campus after the
David Grossman event

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:54.580
a couple of years ago.

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.937
And he said-- this
professor said,

00:48:57.937 --> 00:48:59.770
who came from the social
sciences-- he said,

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.730
I love reading fiction.

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:03.040
Because in real
life, nobody tells me

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.260
what characters are like.

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:09.570
But in fiction, I get told.

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:15.600
And you know, back to
the [INAUDIBLE] event,

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.920
where I cited there's a
moment in The English Patient

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.100
where he says a novel is a
mirror walking down a road.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:26.307
If my job as a writer is a
mirror walking down the road,

00:49:26.307 --> 00:49:28.390
I have yet to experience
the moment where somebody

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:31.630
comes up and whispers
in my ear and says,

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:34.810
he is a shy, but kindly, man.

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:38.330
Though he may seem gruff,
his intentions are only good.

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:40.630
Like, I don't have that.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.850
So the book is written--

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:45.879
people have asked is Julia
an unreliable narrator--

00:49:45.879 --> 00:49:47.170
I feel, no more than any of us.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.010
We spend our time creating--

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:52.000
we only ever have
partial information.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.620
We only ever see
part of the moon.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.320
And we construct from
what we see and combined

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.805
with our experience
of life, we construct

00:49:58.805 --> 00:50:01.180
an understanding of other
people, an understanding what's

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.980
going on in a room,
an understanding

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.380
of the subtext in a
conversation, everything,

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.980
everything.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:15.160
So I, as a writer in this
book, am asking readers to,

00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.457
as it were, to have that, if
you will, Husserlian experience.

00:50:19.457 --> 00:50:21.040
And then to make
decisions-- you know,

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.360
what do I think is happening?

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.030
What do I think these
relations really are?

00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.970
What do I think?

00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:30.650
And yes, it is in some way--

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:33.310
I've digressed from your
thing about the risk,

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:37.360
both in war and in love.

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.520
I was thinking about
North Korea for a second.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.380
Anyway--

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.380
You digress.

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.710
I digress, yes.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:48.040
But certainly, that's
true-- that there's always

00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:51.680
the possibility that our
constructions are false.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.890
But you know you said--

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:53.473
Or inaccurate.

00:50:53.473 --> 00:50:55.650
--that in some way,
you're wedded to realism.

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.340
And I thought, you're
wedded to realism

00:50:57.340 --> 00:50:59.590
because you are
married to James Wood.

00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:01.570
[LAUGHS]

00:51:01.570 --> 00:51:02.517
But let me--

00:51:02.517 --> 00:51:04.600
I mean, and I think there's
a serious point there.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.210
But let me get back to
something else here.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:14.720
Which is that I thought in
this book, more than any other,

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:20.520
your particular kind
of realism, which

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.420
is a very figurative kind of
realism and you work that.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:28.230
I mean, it's neither the mirror
nor is it the Balzacian window.

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:30.390
It's a different kind of thing.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:35.310
But by the end of the
book, as I understood it,

00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:40.770
it's not simply that you say
we only have partial knowledge

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:44.790
or we only see the moon,
only see a part of the moon.

00:51:44.790 --> 00:51:50.220
It's more or less saying it's
the uncertainty that we occupy.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.750
That's the important thing.

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:54.210
That's why we can't
be truth tellers.

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:55.660
And you actually put that there.

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:56.790
There is a phrase you used.

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:58.440
I can't find it now.

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.910
We say, it's the uncertainty.

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:04.440
And that's neither
about realism nor is it

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:06.450
about a kind of
modernism [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:11.880
That, to occupy that anxiety,
which your narrator Julia says,

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:16.050
right from the beginning, she
said, I somehow have this--

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.730
I'm in this place of anxiety.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:22.830
And I think that's what
really, in a profound way,

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:25.860
questions the
epistemology of realism.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.710
It's neither that it's
fantasy or it's real,

00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:30.179
but that you are hovering.

00:52:30.179 --> 00:52:31.470
And that hovering is important.

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:32.130
Yes.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:33.360
And it seems to me--

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.890
and I come now to
my final point--

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:36.406
and I'm very keen to open up--

00:52:36.406 --> 00:52:38.405
which is in a way about
the ethics of narrative.

00:52:38.405 --> 00:52:39.910
May I just interject one thing?

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:40.670
Yes, of course.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:48.480
I feel very profoundly that if
we were all as a society more

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.530
accepting of uncertainty, we
would be in a better place.

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:52.900
I couldn't agree more with you.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:53.970
And I think that--

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:57.630
even in the classroom, I
often say to my seminar

00:52:57.630 --> 00:53:00.840
the pedagogy, the real pedagogy
of anxiety, is so important.

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.810
If there isn't anxiety,
you will not learn.

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:06.990
This does not mean that it's
anxiety which is all-consuming.

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:09.720
But it's an anxiety
which opens you up,

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.160
rather than closes you down.

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.480
And I think that's
the trick of writing--

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:15.510
whether it's writing
theory or writing fiction--

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:20.170
is to hold that anxiety
in a productive way.

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:22.590
And it seems to me
then that I want

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:30.420
to end with a passage right
towards the end, where

00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.871
you talk about seeing.

00:53:32.871 --> 00:53:35.740
And in a sense, the
subtext, as we've

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.990
been talking about first
person narrators, in my mind,

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:41.010
has also been Conrad
to a great extent.

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.710
Because historicizing
Conrad never

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:47.430
lets you see the deep
anxiety in Conrad.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:51.190
Or politicizing Conrad has
to be done through that.

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:53.660
And of course,
Conrad famously said

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:57.420
that it was his desire
to make people see.

00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:00.630
And you say, "My curse
is to see things,

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:03.610
to know stories,
how they unfold,

00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:05.590
and people, what they're like.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:08.860
I don't seek to
know these things.

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.150
I just do it.

00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:12.340
It tires me to be honest.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:14.920
Cassie got the
prophetic name, but I

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.280
got the curse, the Cassandra.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.180
Or the gift, depending
on how you look at it.

00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:25.000
What I'd like is for someone
to take the burden from me,

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.190
or at least to share it.

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:30.790
If I didn't see, I
wouldn't try to know.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:32.710
And of course, you
can't ever really know

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:35.260
what happens to
another person or what

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.270
they think happens
to them, which

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.160
amounts to the same thing.

00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:42.310
I can't know what the poisoned
cloak felt like burning

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:44.430
into Cassie's skin.

00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:47.550
I cannot even
really imagine it."

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:52.314
So here we come back to the half
moon that makes you narrate.

00:54:52.314 --> 00:54:53.730
Because if you saw
it, there would

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:56.040
be nothing to narrate for.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.370
And on the other hand, we
come back to the anxiety

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.560
and the anxiety of
the undecidable,

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:05.130
which you have brought
through I think so well here.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:07.170
But then what is seeing?

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.340
What is seeing?

00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:11.030
What is seeing in
the way in which you

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:12.280
talk-- what are you seeing?

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.740
Is it-- there's
much in this book

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:17.430
about myth and the prophetic.

00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:21.290
But what is it to
see as a burden?

00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:22.760
Or what is the burden of seeing?

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:29.890
I feel that maybe in a way
the answer I might give

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:32.500
will disappoint.

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:37.750
Because I'll bring it back down
to the level of the everyday.

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:42.705
And it seems to me that the--

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:54.960
people are on a
spectrum from those

00:55:54.960 --> 00:56:01.650
who are most chameleon-like
who see to those who are least

00:56:01.650 --> 00:56:06.600
mutable and see less.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.850
And that-- you
were saying earlier

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:14.640
about the vampiric nature of
the first person narrative.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:22.770
The characters at
the least mutable end

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:27.560
are not interesting narrators.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:33.690
They are interesting for people
to observe and write about.

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:39.150
But you can't imagine Brideshead
narrated by Sebastian Flyte.

00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:42.010
I mean it just wouldn't happen.

00:56:42.010 --> 00:56:49.960
It's a recurring sort of duality
or whatever throughout I think

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:51.870
certainly 20th century fiction.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.320
And I mean it in life.

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:59.970
Like I can see from earliest
days with my kids' friends

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:00.870
and my kids.

00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:05.960
My kids have the gift and
the curse to walk into a room

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.710
and read it, and understand
the power dynamics,

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:12.980
and understand how everybody
relates to each other.

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:16.660
And what they then do
or don't do with it

00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:18.590
is a whole other story.

00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:23.750
But I could see that they had
friends who walked into rooms

00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:28.430
and were entirely themselves,
and unchangingly themselves,

00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:30.560
and couldn't do anything about--

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.710
like maybe it would help
to change your outfit,

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:37.370
or make your voice
a little quieter.

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:40.310
And those kids just couldn't
do it because that's--

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:47.570
because who they were didn't
involve that, if you will,

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:51.000
sort of subjugation of self.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.950
And so I think I
meant for Julia--

00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:57.080
it's actually just
articulating something

00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:00.560
that I have observed as a
way of being in the world.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.690
That she's someone who--

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:09.080
I mean it's like the difference
between Obama and Trump.

00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:11.660
Obama can walk into a
room and find something

00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:18.440
in common with anybody from
anywhere and can make--

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:21.379
and that involves showing some
different facet of himself

00:58:21.379 --> 00:58:23.420
or changing some aspect
of himself, which doesn't

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.890
mean he's a different person.

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:27.260
It's just that there's
some way of reading

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:31.230
other people in the way
he engages with the world.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:33.590
Trump, not at all.

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:40.360
But when you said that,
that autobiographical note,

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.490
it made me think--

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:46.960
if I can be indulgent and
digress for a minute--

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:50.305
that for some of
us who came even

00:58:50.305 --> 00:58:57.130
from very privileged backgrounds
in post-colonial societies,

00:58:57.130 --> 00:59:00.210
we had to learn this.

00:59:00.210 --> 00:59:01.820
And we learned it.

00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:07.050
So it was not just a facet
of our de-sovereignizing

00:59:07.050 --> 00:59:08.670
ourselves.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:11.400
But it was we had to learn this.

00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.730
It didn't matter
you went to Oxford.

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:18.990
And your scout in
the college thought

00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:21.620
he should tell you what to do.

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:29.090
And he would-- or you went-- or
you had a tutor who would say,

00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:29.810
I don't think--

00:59:29.810 --> 00:59:31.694
I remember this happened to me.

00:59:31.694 --> 00:59:33.860
I said, you know, I wonder
whether I should now work

00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:39.030
on W.H. Auden, who is one of
the great passions of my life,

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:41.135
or on--

00:59:41.135 --> 00:59:42.260
and I was at Christ Church.

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:44.426
And I chose to go to Christ
Church because of Auden.

00:59:44.426 --> 00:59:46.790
It was the stupidest thing
to do, sitting in Bombay.

00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:49.282
It just shows you my kind
of imperial cast of mind.

00:59:49.282 --> 00:59:50.240
But I couldn't help it.

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.220
I did it.

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.496
And I got in.

00:59:52.496 --> 00:59:53.870
And so I said,
you know, should I

00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:56.540
work on Auden and [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:57.980
I really wanted
to work on poetry.

00:59:57.980 --> 00:59:59.480
Or should I work on Naipaul.

00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.950
And he said, no, no, I think
you should work on Naipaul.

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:07.130
And I had to immediately
make a virtue of it.

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:10.420
I felt in some way displaced.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:11.910
And yet the
conditions were such--

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:15.930
and I'm now deeply grateful
that I immersed myself

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:17.930
initially in the Caribbean.

01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:20.770
But we had to do
this the whole time.

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:22.110
We had to adjust.

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:24.910
And it was not from
a position of power--

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:28.140
even if we came from wealthy
parents with good education.

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:28.640
Right.

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:33.160
But the position of sort
of listening and adapting

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.850
in that way is never
the position of power

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:39.820
because it's never in
the center of the room.

01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:40.680
Well, it does--

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.170
You're all around the
edges of the room.

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:45.310
I mean that's what it is
to be the narrator is not

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:46.436
to be the star of the show.

01:00:46.436 --> 01:00:46.935
Yeah.

01:00:46.935 --> 01:00:49.170
To be the narrator is not
to be the star of the show.

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:51.550
But there are ways
in which you can

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:58.584
be open to melding because you
have a certain savoir faire.

01:00:58.584 --> 01:01:00.000
And there are many
people who come

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.690
from disadvantaged backgrounds--

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:06.780
even black, white, I
don't care, lilac--

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.540
who are intimidated,
who can't do it.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.790
So I just wanted to put--

01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:13.560
the art of the
chameleon can also

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.932
be the art of a certain kind
of power and disempowerment

01:01:16.932 --> 01:01:17.640
at the same time.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.310
Of course.

01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:18.810
Of course.

01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:22.410
And I think it is
narratively too.

01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:24.110
It is-- I mean you
could say-- back

01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:26.640
to this sort of
vampiric first person,

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:33.150
it's the ultimate revenge of the
wallflower to tell the story.

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:37.500
Because at the end of the day,
Cassie doesn't tell her story.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:38.200
No.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.250
But at the end of the day,
Julia writes the book.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:41.920
Right.

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:42.420
Good.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.330
So she-- so I think this
vampiric issue interests

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:46.090
me greatly.

01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:48.950
And I wanted to float it today
that the first person narrative

01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:51.610
is really a vampiric position.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:55.950
But I said we would talk
about scale, voice, love,

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:56.600
and narrative.

01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.540
We've done that.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.530
So now let's open up.

01:01:58.530 --> 01:01:59.280
Thank you so much.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.256
Thank you so much.

01:02:01.256 --> 01:02:03.571
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:08.200
Questions, please.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.760
Could I have my--

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.450
thank you so much.

01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:16.247
Jill.

01:02:16.247 --> 01:02:17.684
I'm OK.

01:02:17.684 --> 01:02:20.560
Thank you.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.630
My question has
to do with the way

01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:30.060
that the novel
captures the peculiar,

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:34.050
but to me very
familiar, intensity

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:41.100
of adolescent, preadolescent,
into early childhood

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:46.200
obsessive almost friendship
between two girls.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:51.210
And listening to you reading,
in my interior thoughts

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:54.060
I was trying to
think of, is there

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:59.040
a novel that captures
that kind of relationship

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.920
between boys of that age?

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.670
And I thought about A
Separate Peace, which

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:10.680
isn't exactly right, or
Brideshead Revisited, which

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:15.730
both have such overtly
sexualized aspects

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:17.460
to the friendship.

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:22.680
And I guess I'm just interested
in whether, A, either of you

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.510
could think of one,
but whether boys

01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:31.440
have those kinds of
early friendships

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:35.640
that are basically
pre-sexual but have

01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:39.120
the intensity of
this sort of burning,

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.720
fervent love and acute
feelings of rejection,

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.240
et cetera, et cetera.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.070
Do you?

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:54.280
And Claire, I know
you've raised a boy, so--

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.250
Who's-- he won't hear
me say this, right?

01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:59.750
But he definitely had a--

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:00.650
Who?

01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:01.970
My son had a friend--

01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:02.930
Like that?

01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:06.300
Like that until about 11.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:09.260
And I feel that it sort of--

01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:12.230
they were at different
schools at that point.

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:17.330
But part of the difference I
think is that girls are verbal.

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:18.460
There's a lot of talk.

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:22.590
And he was so excited
to see that best friend.

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:25.740
But they would go to a
basketball court or a sports

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:27.950
field and, as far
as I could tell,

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:32.270
be a few hundred yards apart
for the entire afternoon.

01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:36.980
But he was-- so there
was the intensity.

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:41.210
And then I think--

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.560
but it wasn't torture.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.175
There was much less torture.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.963
I [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:48.963 --> 01:04:52.407
Out shooting horses?

01:04:52.407 --> 01:04:52.907
Uh-huh.

01:04:55.865 --> 01:04:57.837
Out Stealing Horses.

01:04:57.837 --> 01:05:05.080
[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:05.580
Right.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:08.280
That tells that story.

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.980
Well, I felt [INAUDIBLE]
the other way.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:25.370
I thought I could completely
identify with Cassie and Julia.

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:31.520
And I had two such
relationships--

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:38.000
very, very close and
very physically close

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.100
without being erotic.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:50.550
And I don't think either of us
has really got over the break.

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:56.230
And we used to in
Bombay spend our days--

01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:58.810
I mean we were on a
prize committee recently.

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:02.410
And he said, do you remember we
used to meet three times a day?

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:03.450
We'd go to college.

01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:05.050
I'd come to your
house for lunch.

01:06:05.050 --> 01:06:06.820
You'd come to my
place for dinner.

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.720
And then we'd go out for a
walk after dinner every day.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.620
I don't think we
ever got over it.

01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:15.060
And today, this person
lives in New York.

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:17.400
And I live in Boston.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.820
And he was the
closest thing in my--

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.400
until I was 18.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.510
Apart from my
relationships with women,

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:27.570
I mean this was
the closest thing.

01:06:27.570 --> 01:06:31.620
And I think the break was
such and I felt it so strongly

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:34.320
that today, we can't
even talk about it.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:37.331
And because we can't
talk about, it cannot--

01:06:37.331 --> 01:06:38.580
it hasn't brought us together.

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:44.480
And I actually felt
that, as you said,

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.090
the verbal nature of
these relationships,

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:50.120
the verbal nature of them,
the sharing of fantasy,

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:55.830
the sharing of making
up stories, that I think

01:06:55.830 --> 01:07:00.150
gets sublimated by sports and
that whole public spectacle.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:01.620
And he and I
couldn't do anything.

01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:05.220
We could play a little cricket,
but neither of us was any good.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:07.350
And so we spent
a lot of our time

01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:11.350
reading and talking and making
up stories, that kind of thing.

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:14.040
But I funnily enough
felt very close

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.050
to the experience in this book.

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:22.310
And I thought, what a strange
thing gendered relationships

01:07:22.310 --> 01:07:25.640
are in different contexts.

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.563
And I am speaking from
the context of Bombay.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:34.850
Something I think
also reminds me--

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:36.620
it's very different
because it's not

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:40.040
a relationship between boys.

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:43.190
But I think the
relationship between Kim

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:48.650
and the lama is actually-- there
are many similarities there

01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:55.130
because in many ways, Kim is the
adult. The lama is the child.

01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:58.610
They have a very close
both physical and social

01:07:58.610 --> 01:07:59.240
relationship.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.080
There's a complete breakdown
of childhood in Kipling.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.550
I think there's a
lot more to that book

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.020
about the nature of childhood.

01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:11.870
And it is interesting
that it's a kind

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:20.569
of Western boy of mixed
and unknown parentage,

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:25.250
now chameleon-like in India.

01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:30.149
It's something about that
relationship that strikes me

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:33.990
as being one
between boys and not

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:39.000
really a mentorial
relationship, although that's

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.910
the way it's formally set up.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.870
So I grew up in the Middle East.

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:57.479
So I've raised two daughters.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:09:03.510
And it has been interesting
to raise children in a culture

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:05.740
other than the one
in which you grew up,

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:09.660
which is a challenge
all to itself.

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:13.229
I was wondering because the
times have changed so much

01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:21.060
since you were 12, how were
you able to inhabit the mind

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:23.399
of a 12-year-old who was--

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:27.859
let's say is on Snapchat or--

01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:28.950
but was this--

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:30.160
I haven't read the book.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.840
I read many, many reviews of it.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.490
I'm interested to read
it and your other books.

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:38.189
But I was wondering
how you did that.

01:09:38.189 --> 01:09:41.580
Because for me, one of the
difficult aspects of parenting

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:45.420
has been to penetrate into
the mind of someone who

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:51.420
is culturally different, or
grew up with different things

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:52.950
that they saw or experienced.

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:54.960
I just was wondering
if some of it

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.940
was based on your experience,
or if it was just--

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:06.120
Well, I think there are
various things I'd say.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:13.660
One is that it's set in
a very particular moment.

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:17.620
And so it's largely
pre Snapchat.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:22.430
But this became a thing
because it corresponded--

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.890
I think the girls are a
year older than my daughter.

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:27.270
But it corresponded to--

01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:33.280
I've driven the car for
a lot of teenage kids

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.420
for a bunch of time.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:37.890
And so certain cultural
references and so on, I--

01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:40.210
but it was also the
moment of the iPod Touch.

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:44.170
The moment when they're in
sort of sixth and seventh grade

01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:45.790
is the moment of
the iPod Touch--

01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:48.580
which I don't know if
you remember that device.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:54.640
But it played music, and it
would text if you had Wi-Fi.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:57.104
But it didn't have
anything beyond that.

01:10:57.104 --> 01:10:58.270
And it didn't take pictures.

01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:02.920
And it didn't-- so
their evolution--

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:06.040
by the time they're in
ninth grade, those things--

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.070
ninth grade corresponds to the
beginning of Instagram and I

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:11.900
think Snapchat in their world.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:16.170
But that's very much
towards the end of the book.

01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:18.190
So there is the
strangeness right now

01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:21.520
that even from one
year to another,

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:23.280
teenagers' experiences change.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.840
So my daughter, for example,
has explained to me,

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.210
we don't do Facebook.

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:30.280
Those kids are two
years older than me.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.900
We Instagram and Snapchat.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:36.064
And there were Vines, but Vine
has gone the way of all things.

01:11:36.064 --> 01:11:38.230
But it's a very specific--
and that's very different

01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:40.660
because there was a whole
generation of people for whom

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:43.750
Facebook was the--

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:46.730
has been and still continues
to be the sort of focus

01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:49.480
of a great deal of life.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:55.250
But in her generation,
no, literally by a year.

01:11:55.250 --> 01:11:58.420
I also think one of
the things about--

01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:03.800
and I know-- so my parents,
my mother's Canadian,

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.420
and my father's French.

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:11.340
I was raised around and about,
but ultimately in the end here.

01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:16.710
And I'm realizing that
your upbringing is weird.

01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:19.580
I realized at some point
that my upbringing was,

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:22.280
compared to other
people's, pretty weird.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:25.070
And I realized in
the editing process

01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:30.650
that my kids' upbringings
have been weird.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:33.140
There were-- I had references--

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:36.590
I think I was allowed to keep
one, but-- to Marilyn Monroe.

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:38.510
And I was told, nope, no.

01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:40.996
Young people don't know
who Marilyn Monroe is.

01:12:40.996 --> 01:12:42.620
And I said, well, at
my house, the kids

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.790
know who Marilyn Monroe is.

01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:45.290
I mean there were just
all of these things

01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:47.225
that I realized that we
clearly have imparted.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.250
So the oddity of our household
has imparted stuff to the--

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:57.935
I mean Marilyn
Monroe is hardly odd.

01:12:57.935 --> 01:12:59.870
But we could find other things.

01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:04.490
But anyway, the point being
that the question in my mind

01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:07.880
becomes not is this a
representative adolescent?,

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.540
but do I believe this
adolescent could exist

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.460
in this country in this time?

01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:19.700
And I feel pretty certain
that I do believe that.

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:23.080
And indeed, my poor daughter,
I made her read the manuscript

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.125
and make--

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:27.500
which I had never done before
and hope never to do again.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.620
It's not-- she has
to live with me.

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.290
But she said, this, no.

01:13:32.290 --> 01:13:32.880
This, no.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.380
Change this.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.000
Thank you to you both.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.500
I was very interested,
Homi, in what

01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.500
you were saying
about the narrator

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.620
not being a fixed, static one.

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:55.220
And I was thinking about
Judith Butler's Giving

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.160
an Account of Oneself
and how narration

01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.960
can change when we
narrate ourselves

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.310
in the face of another.

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:04.250
And there's even sort of
a vulnerability to that.

01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:08.510
And I'm wondering if that
played into your mind

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:12.090
at all in terms of what made the
voice of the narration change

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:16.076
vis-a-vis her
relationships in the text.

01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:19.250
Are you asking Homi that?

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:23.910
Well, let me tell
you what struck

01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:27.715
me was the inadequacy
both of what

01:14:27.715 --> 01:14:34.470
Claire called the taxonomy,
the kind of binary taxonomy,

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.900
while reading this
book, but also

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:42.930
about the kind of
moral and critical ways

01:14:42.930 --> 01:14:45.380
in which we talk
about the consistency

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:48.210
or authenticity of--
first person narrative

01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:50.190
is what I'm talking about.

01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:55.810
Now the issue about
first person narrative

01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:59.990
is that it's somewhat
different, I think,

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:04.420
than the idea of the notion of
performativity in narrative,

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:10.610
where it is assumed that there
is another of a certain kind.

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:11.380
Yeah.

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:13.990
Now the interesting thing
with first person narrative

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:22.560
is that the person who narrates
is constructing the narrative

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:29.070
on the basis of a projected,
or cited, otherness.

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:30.580
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:35.190
So there is-- so in
creating the dialogue,

01:15:35.190 --> 01:15:40.140
you are creating at the same
time your own authority,

01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:41.220
your own authority.

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:47.280
Now what's interesting here
is that the mise-en-scene,

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.340
the continual-- as I found
it, the shift in location--

01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:55.710
not just the shift in relational
persons, but the shift in

01:15:55.710 --> 01:16:01.945
locations elicited a different
kind of narrative persona,

01:16:01.945 --> 01:16:06.210
and a narrative place,
and a narrative position.

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:08.370
And in technical
terms, I would say this

01:16:08.370 --> 01:16:10.950
is less about Judy Butler--

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:13.620
and not only, but of course
through that whole tradition

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:15.210
of the performance--

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:19.530
and more about the
notion of enunciation.

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:22.800
That in any particular
moment institutionally,

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.280
structurally, spatially,
and temporally, you

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:30.510
are continually using a kind
of GPS, whatever it's called,

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.640
global positioning system.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.900
And that keeps changing.

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:37.200
So to demand-- at
the end of the day,

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.950
is this reliable or unreliable?

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:42.350
Is this authentic
or unauthentic?

01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:46.830
It doesn't really give you
the measure of transition

01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:49.470
as you're getting it, as
I see it in this book.

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:55.110
Because the transitional
doesn't move in that way.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.600
It has a-- you see
what I'm saying.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.850
It has a particular location,
and that location can change.

01:16:59.850 --> 01:17:05.490
So it's as much about place
as it is about the continuity

01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:08.160
or discontinuity of person.

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:11.220
It's that more
phenomenological relationship

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:13.430
that I thought that
this book played out--

01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:17.100
where in the early chapters,
going to the asylum

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:22.350
was both a place of refuge,
but also a large metaphor

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:24.930
of paranoia, of hiding.

01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:26.460
In fact, there's a line here.

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.810
I couldn't find it when I tried
to, when I needed it again.

01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:30.720
But there was a--

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:32.490
she always felt
that in her anxiety,

01:17:32.490 --> 01:17:34.319
she was tinged with
a certain paranoia.

01:17:34.319 --> 01:17:36.610
There's a-- I don't know if
that's the word, but some--

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:38.010
or fear or--

01:17:38.010 --> 01:17:42.420
so that's what interested me,
the way in which a location can

01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:47.600
create an affect for
a particular voice

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:52.310
or a particular relationship
to a place, to a time.

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:58.927
And that's very different
from this endlessly iterative

01:17:58.927 --> 01:18:00.883
performativity circus--

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:06.462
in my view, with respect.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.552
No offense.

01:18:11.552 --> 01:18:12.260
No offense meant.

01:18:16.026 --> 01:18:16.526
Maybe?

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:18.741
Maybe that's--

01:18:18.741 --> 01:18:19.240
OK.

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.915
Well, thank you so much.

01:18:20.915 --> 01:18:21.540
Thank you, all.

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:22.140
Thank you, Homi.

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:22.640
Thank you.

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.290
