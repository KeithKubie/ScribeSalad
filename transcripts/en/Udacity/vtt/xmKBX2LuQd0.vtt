00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.175
We just saw that the expression 6x squared minus 7x minus 5 factors to 2x plus

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:11.591
1 times 3x minus 5. Now, check out the colors that I've used here for the

00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:15.540
different terms. And notice how the terms that are the same colors in the top

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.846
expression and the one below it are related. The negative 5 here, comes

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:24.578
straight from the positive 1 and the negative 5. And the 6 here, comes from the

00:00:24.578 --> 00:00:31.128
2 and 3. 2 and 3 are factors of 6 and -5 and 1 are both factors of -5. Now, can

00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:36.282
you tell me based on our factorization, what are the zeros of this function? As

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:39.673
always, please separate your answers in this box by commas.
