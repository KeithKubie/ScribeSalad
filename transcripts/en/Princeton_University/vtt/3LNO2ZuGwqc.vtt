Marjorie Young:
Community House is an organization that was founded back in 1969, and it was founded by

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.080 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
a group of students who were very interested in making a difference in the local community.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.300 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
So -- if you can imagine a group of Princeton students back in '69 going into the community

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.390 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
and actually living there and establishing relationships with parents and grandparents

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.329 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
and children and actually going into the school system and meeting people -- so, it was really sort of

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.800 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
a very nice sort of grassroots situation where people really made real connections with the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.660
Marjorie Young:
people they worked with.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.870 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
So, that's something that Community House has retained. We are still very much in the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.470 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
community. We work with the local schools. We work with churches. We work with summer camp

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.130 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
programs. So, we continue to have great relationships with the community partners, as well as the parents.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.899 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
But since '69 a lot of things have changed. So, in the beginning the students provided

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.009 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
just basic tutoring help and some recreational activities. Now, we have a whole range of programs,

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.359 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
ranging from our sustainability summer camp, we have science programs, we have engineering

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:20.560 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
programs where kids are using Legos and building and thinking about the different aspects of engineering.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.109 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
People ask me the question, "How does Community House impact undergraduate students?" I've

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.289 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
had a lot of students who started out in one career path, and then end up with Teach for

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.209 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
America or our program here, the Program in Teacher Preparation, so all of a sudden you

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:41.219 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
see this curve, because they're like, "Wow, this really matters to me, and I want to do

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.420
Marjorie Young:
something to make a difference."

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.620 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
We have a Generation One Program, which is a high school program. This program started

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.310 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
in 2000, and we have students who have graduated from the Gen One Program, and they're

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.009 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
now in college. Now, I'm always cautious about saying that Community House is the reason,

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.270 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
but we know that we have impacted them in their desire to go to school, either because

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.950 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
we provided an SAT prep class or because we took them on college tours.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.610 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
We really are striving to impact the minority achievement gap in a very tangible way. It's

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.689 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
the issue where minority students tend not to do as well in school as the majority population.

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:26.879 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
And so at Community House, we really focus ourselves on thinking about what are the issues involved

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.250 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
with this problem, how can we utilize Princeton resources, how can we utilize undergraduate

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.279 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
students, alumni, community partners? How we can leverage all the resources to make

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:41.079 position:80%
Marjorie Young:
a big difference and make a change in this problem?

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.750 position:98%
Marjorie Young:
The minority achievement gap isn't going to be changed overnight, but it certainly will

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.980 position:97%
Marjorie Young:
be changed one student at a time and that's our mission at Community House, is to make

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.750
Marjorie Young:
a difference one student at a time.
