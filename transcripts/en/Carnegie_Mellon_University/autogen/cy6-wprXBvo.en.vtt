you bet you look at first solar or sun

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920
you bet you look at first solar or sun
 

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.190

powers projected costs they're going to
 

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.620
powers projected costs they're going to
come down real fast for PV or even in

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:30.630
come down real fast for PV or even in
 

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.730

the solar thermal business which

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740
the solar thermal business which
 

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.370
the solar thermal business which
probably has more of a floor but but

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:34.380
probably has more of a floor but but
 

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.130
probably has more of a floor but but
those PV costs are coming down very very

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140
those PV costs are coming down very very
 

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.529
those PV costs are coming down very very
fast it probably this new york has

00:39:39.529 --> 00:39:39.539
fast it probably this new york has
 

00:39:39.539 --> 00:39:42.230

California or New Mexico can get which

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160
California or New Mexico can get which
 

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.620

gets us back to transmission lines

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:48.630
gets us back to transmission lines
 

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.960
gets us back to transmission lines
that's getting the power because you can

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:50.970
that's getting the power because you can
 

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.120
that's getting the power because you can
ship electricity a long way with a ten

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:53.130
ship electricity a long way with a ten
 

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.740

percent degradation so we need to

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:54.750
percent degradation so we need to
 

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:56.930
percent degradation so we need to
generate the power in the West get it to

00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940
generate the power in the West get it to
 

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.180
generate the power in the West get it to
the east so there's the electric on

00:39:59.180 --> 00:39:59.190
the east so there's the electric on
 

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:02.240

a lot of potential you large hydro big

00:40:06.859 --> 00:40:06.869
a lot of potential you large hydro big

that can get it done and indeed New York

00:40:24.499 --> 00:40:24.509
that can get it done and indeed New York
 

00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:27.259
that can get it done and indeed New York
gets thirty percent of this sorry twenty

00:40:27.259 --> 00:40:27.269
gets thirty percent of this sorry twenty

percent of its power the second question

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680
percent of its power the second question

was a bit you know it was kind of it was

00:40:33.019 --> 00:40:33.029
was a bit you know it was kind of it was

really a globalization where a question

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:34.890
really a globalization where a question
 

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.170
really a globalization where a question
and how globalization what color

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:36.180
and how globalization what color
 

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.519
and how globalization what color
expressionist no no yeah I and you know

00:40:40.519 --> 00:40:40.529
expressionist no no yeah I and you know
 

00:40:40.529 --> 00:40:43.549
expressionist no no yeah I and you know
the thing with the globalization issue

00:40:43.549 --> 00:40:43.559
the thing with the globalization issue
 

00:40:43.559 --> 00:40:46.160
the thing with the globalization issue
you know it's unfortunate it is

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.170
you know it's unfortunate it is
 

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:47.240
you know it's unfortunate it is
absolutely

some industries are going to be losers

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380
some industries are going to be losers
 

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.280
some industries are going to be losers
but the truth about globalization is it

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:52.290
but the truth about globalization is it
 

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.200
but the truth about globalization is it
makes the pie totally bigger for

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:54.210
makes the pie totally bigger for
 

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.180
makes the pie totally bigger for
everybody in the world and if you try to

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:56.190
everybody in the world and if you try to
 

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.340
everybody in the world and if you try to
stop globalization you make the pie

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:58.350
stop globalization you make the pie
 

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:00.470
stop globalization you make the pie
smaller now while you're making that pie

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480
smaller now while you're making that pie
 

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.880
smaller now while you're making that pie
bigger and it work has work to make the

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:01.890
bigger and it work has work to make the
 

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:03.950
bigger and it work has work to make the
pie bigger here in general there are

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960
pie bigger here in general there are
 

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.880

people who will suffer you can't stop it

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:07.890
people who will suffer you can't stop it
 

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:08.900
people who will suffer you can't stop it
it's one of those you know this

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:08.910
it's one of those you know this
 

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.580
it's one of those you know this
volatility question from before it's

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:10.590
volatility question from before it's
 

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.800
volatility question from before it's
just can't stop and so it is an

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:12.810
just can't stop and so it is an
 

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.720
just can't stop and so it is an
unfortunate thing and policy in some

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:14.730
unfortunate thing and policy in some
 

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.400
unfortunate thing and policy in some
ways government policy is supposed to

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:16.410
ways government policy is supposed to
 

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:18.830
ways government policy is supposed to
help some of those people when that pie

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:18.840
help some of those people when that pie
 

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.610
help some of those people when that pie
gets smaller but long term you know the

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:22.620
gets smaller but long term you know the
 

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:24.890
gets smaller but long term you know the
will be people that will do certain jobs

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900
will be people that will do certain jobs
 

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.770
will be people that will do certain jobs
that we do here we will do other jobs

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780
that we do here we will do other jobs
 

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.410
that we do here we will do other jobs
here and the question is you just have

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420
here and the question is you just have
 

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.070
here and the question is you just have
to let that take course and the

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.080
to let that take course and the
 

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.960
to let that take course and the
government probably has to kind of

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:35.970
government probably has to kind of
 

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.310
government probably has to kind of
smooth that over the different

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:37.320
smooth that over the different

don't know if that answers your question

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:40.350
don't know if that answers your question
 

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:42.140
don't know if that answers your question
but there's there's no limit to

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:42.150
but there's there's no limit to
 

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.540
but there's there's no limit to
innovation so if more innovation is done

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:44.550
innovation so if more innovation is done
 

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.850
innovation so if more innovation is done
in gently right that's fine and will do

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:46.860
in gently right that's fine and will do
 

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.150
in gently right that's fine and will do
more innovation here um talent is what's

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160
more innovation here um talent is what's
 

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.240
more innovation here um talent is what's
going to drive though our capability so

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:53.250
going to drive though our capability so
 

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.160
going to drive though our capability so
