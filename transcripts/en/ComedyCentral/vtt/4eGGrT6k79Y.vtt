but to have a reality show
as successful as the Kardashians

or the Duggars
or the Honey Boo Boos

00:00:07.473 --> 00:00:08.775
you need that special twist.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.777
Could be a handsy brother
or racist grandpa

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.379
or just being obsessed with fame
at any cost. Who knows?

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.181
So, comedians, I'm gonna show
you some famous families,

00:00:15.214 --> 00:00:17.316

an adult Asian man, too.

but it's gonna be
groundbreaking.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:55.989
Yeah.

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:01.027
