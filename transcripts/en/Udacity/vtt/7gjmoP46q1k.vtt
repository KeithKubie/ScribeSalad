00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.552
&gt;&gt; You've gotten feedback
based on your responses and

00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:04.720
we hope you take it seriously.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.640
There are two options for what happened.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.638
In option one, one or more of those
feedback messages said that now isn't

00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:14.000
the right time for
you to begin this NIM degree.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.485
Maybe you don't have some background
knowledge, but you can get it.

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:19.455
&gt;&gt; And once you get it,
you will be ready.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:21.990
And remember, even once you
are ready to start the program,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.700
there still will be
challenges along the way.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.459
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:28.610
And option two is that you are ready.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.308
And if you decide to make this
commitment, there's a good chance that

00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:34.800
in a matter of months, your career
will be drastically different.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.472
But even if you're ready and
you do make the commitment,

00:00:37.472 --> 00:00:39.040
this will still be challenging.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.840
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.280
It's perfectly possible that over the
next several months, you'll have times

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.671
where things feel challenging or you
feel frustrated, you feel overwhelmed or

00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.900
maybe you even feel like you
don't belong in this program.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.820
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't even say
perfectly possible.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.880
I would say, very probable.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.349
And those things are going to
happen when your code won't run and

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:59.549
you don't know why or

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.297
you feel lost in intimidating
jargon that you don't understand.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:06.630
Or when you're trying to install
software and it won't run or

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.380
someone in the forum
is way ahead of you.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.872
&gt;&gt; When these things happen, understand
that they happen to everybody.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:12.506
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:16.510
And some of that struggle is
unavoidable and actually productive.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.045
It's just what learning feels like.

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:18.612
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:20.443
And in those moments
when you're struggling,

00:01:20.443 --> 00:01:23.419
it's important to remember too that you
have a whole community of your fellow

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:25.040
students out there to help you.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.054
As well as your team of
Udacity coaches here.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:27.822
&gt;&gt; And Google.

00:01:27.822 --> 00:01:28.689
&gt;&gt; Yes, Google.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:29.730
Amazing resource.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.026
Definitely figure out how to
answer your own questions.

00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:35.470
&gt;&gt; But not all of the struggle
with the productive kind.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.264
Sometimes, it will be
because we made a mistake.

00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:37.999
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.610
&gt;&gt; And we're constantly learning and
improving too.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.358
So maybe our instructions
weren't clear or

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:44.305
maybe we assumed something
we shouldn't have.

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:44.941
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:46.870
When you're struggling,
be sure to let us know.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.410
So like Andy said,
we can learn from your feedback.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.010
Because that's,
that's how we learn how to improve.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.820
&gt;&gt; Right.
The,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.840
the bottom line is there will
be times when this is hard.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.321
But if you persevere, you will succeed.

00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:03.354
&gt;&gt; Whatever you choose to learn next and
however you choose to learn it,

00:02:03.354 --> 00:02:05.552
remember that for
every obstacle you encounter,

00:02:05.552 --> 00:02:08.080
you'll be able to do amazing
new things as a result of it.
