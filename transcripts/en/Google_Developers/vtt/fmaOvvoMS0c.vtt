00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.380
Google I/O 2015 had
so much going on

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.270
that even if you were
there or tuned in,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.830
you probably missed something.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.614
I'm Mano Marks, a Developer
Advocate at Google.

00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:11.030
I'm going to
highlight what's most

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.110
exciting for mobile developers.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.040
Of course we have to start
with the Android M Developer

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.040
Preview.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.920
M has changes to lots of
stuff, including permissions,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.160
better battery usage,
and improved support

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.260
for removable media.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.750
To help you develop
with Android,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.190
we've released Android
Studio 1.3 Preview.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.370
It gives you faster Gradle build
speeds, a new memory profiler,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.670
and full editing and
debugging for C and C++.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.200
Once you've written
an app, you want

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.160
to be smart about
how you earn money.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.300
Using Google
Analytics and AdMob,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.850
you can hide ads from
certain segments of users,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.800
such as those who spend
a lot in your app,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.290
and show ads to
your other users.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.990
We also learned that
Google Play Services rock!

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.890
This was a big year for iOS.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.810
Google Cloud
Messaging, which allows

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.360
you to easily push messages
to individual devices,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.470
is now available for iOS.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.630
You can now use a single
message transport mechanism

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.260
to reach your users in a battery
and network efficient way.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.130
Also, we'll be using CocoaPods
as the default distribution

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.280
method for our iOS SDKs.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.040
And if you're a
Cardboard developer,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.210
the Cardboard SDK is
now available for iOS.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.964
Oh, and let's not forget that
Google Play Services rocks!

00:01:24.964 --> 00:01:26.880
The best way to let
people know about your app

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.100
is through word of mouth.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.350
That's why we released the beta
version of App Invites, which

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.900
makes it easy for you to
let your users invite others

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.950
to your app.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.177
And it's available for
both Android and iOS.

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:42.010
There are a lot of
mobile devices out there,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.880
and it's hard to
test on all of them.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.920
To help with that,
Cloud Test Lab

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.120
gives you automated
testing, and you don't

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.970
have to do anything to use it.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.514
Coming Soon will
automatically test

00:01:51.514 --> 00:01:53.180
apps that are uploaded
to the Play Store

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.630
across 20 of the
most common devices.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.840
For the web, we released Polymer
1.0, making it easier than ever

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.720
to create fast, beautiful,
and interoperable web

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.120
components with a
host of new elements

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.380
to bring Google Services
into your mobile web apps.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.230
And finally, we had a
great time teaching people

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.870
how to code with our SDKs.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.740
If you want to get in on
that, check out the 25

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.680
self-guided I/O code labs.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.820
There's too much going
on at I/O to be contained

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.140
in one video or even two days.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.600
So we're going to keep
going all summer long,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.950
with 100 days of Google Data.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.660
Subscribe to Google
Developers Channel

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.490
and don't miss a single thing.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.900
Also, check out our I/O
site for more videos

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.340
from the live sessions.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.840
Or don't.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.320
I'm an engineer not a cop.
