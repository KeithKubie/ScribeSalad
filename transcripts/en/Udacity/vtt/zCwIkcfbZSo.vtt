00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.780
If you are designing a AI agent
that can take an intelligence test.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.630
That raises the question,
if we succeed is the AI intelligent.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.490
What do you think, David?

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.480
&gt;&gt; So, I would say no, even if the
agents that we design successfully solve

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.920
the intelligence test,
they aren't themselves intelligent,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.260
they are just processing signals and
inputs in the correct way.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.760
&gt;&gt; What do you think?
