00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:09.616
&gt;&gt;Falling.

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:10.726
&gt;&gt;All the way.

00:00:12.656 --> 00:00:14.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Learning to
support and be supported

00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:18.226
by their classmates is a key
lesson for incoming freshman

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:20.346
at East High School
in Anchorage, Alaska.

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:21.256
&gt;&gt;I trust you guys.

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:21.776
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's your name?

00:00:21.776 --> 00:00:22.166
&gt;&gt;Dustin.

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A lesson they
will be tested on every day.

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:25.156
&gt;&gt;All right, I'm falling.

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:25.756
&gt;&gt;Okay, Dustin.

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:29.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Led by seniors,
this day-long series of games,

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:33.336
trust exercises and truth
telling sessions is called,

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:34.986
"Change of Heart."

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:38.356
&gt;&gt;Some people think that I'm
gay because I like to dress up.

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:41.816
But I didn't-- being
in middle school,

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:44.746
I didn't knew how to handle it.

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:46.226
But I learned how to
deal with people.

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:48.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Designed to
forge a caring community

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:52.866
from the diverse group of 2,400
students and staff at East,

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.676
this day is just part of a concerted
effort to address the social

00:00:56.876 --> 00:00:59.556
and emotional needs of every
student in the district.

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:02.156
&gt;&gt;Teacher: If you've been
hurt, move into the circle.

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:03.836
&gt;&gt;Narrator: An effort
that began with schools

00:01:03.836 --> 00:01:06.086
in turmoil just a few years ago.

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:08.206
&gt;&gt;Alivia: You know, you
hear the horror stories

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:10.586
about like thugs showing
up at school, and like,

00:01:10.586 --> 00:01:12.566
you having to look
behind your shoulder.

00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:13.936
And that's how it was.

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:16.566
There was a lock-down at lunch.

00:01:16.746 --> 00:01:19.066
&gt;&gt;Carol: Alaska, unfortunately,
has the highest rate

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.946
of domestic violence,
sexual and child abuse

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:23.476
in the nation, per capita.

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:27.386
And so a lot of our kids, they're
watching violence in their homes,

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.646
sometimes they're the ones
being attacked and abused.

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:33.156
And for them to be able to come
into school, which is, frankly,

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:37.056
for many of them their safe haven,
and to automatically switch that off

00:01:37.156 --> 00:01:39.256
and say, "Oh, yes, I'm
going to really focus

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:41.746
on algebra," it isn't even realistic.

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:46.216
And so we've got a lot of young
people in very great distress.

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:49.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After nearly a
decade of studying best practices

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:54.276
from around the country, the district
adopted concrete standards for social

00:01:54.276 --> 00:01:55.536
and emotional knowledge

00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:58.036
and appropriate behavior
at every grade level.

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:02.496
They designed classes
to teach specific skills

00:02:02.496 --> 00:02:05.016
and develop guidelines
for assessment.

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:07.046
&gt;&gt;Victoria: Any district you
go to probably will have sort

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:08.886
of a left-side of the
report card that has sort

00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:10.106
of a checklist of behaviors.

00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:14.176
Like responsibility,
citizenship, that sort of thing.

00:02:14.286 --> 00:02:17.156
But in a way, that turns into
sort of a meaningless checklist.

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.566
How can you offer grades
for something

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:20.526
that you've never addressed?

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:23.036
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We've asked you to
come up with some attitudes

00:02:23.036 --> 00:02:25.126
that support your success.

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:29.536
&gt;&gt;Victoria: So we're placing those
with the social/emotional standards,

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.166
and giving people ways to
say, "This is the behavior

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:33.716
that you should see
at this grade level."

00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:36.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Former classroom
teacher, Vicki Blakeney was hired

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:39.336
to coordinate the district's
social/emotional learning

00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:40.246
and objectives.

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:42.226
&gt;&gt;Victoria: And asked if
I would use some lessons

00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:43.756
and model what they're doing here.

00:02:43.856 --> 00:02:43.996
&gt;&gt;Carol: Good.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:45.466
&gt;&gt;Victoria: I'm a Curriculum
Coordinator.

00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:49.656
So I am seen in the same office
as the Language Arts Coordinator,

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:51.946
the Math Coordinator, the
Health Coordinator, etcetera.

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:54.966
To show just visually, politically,
everything else, that we are going

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.256
to value this like we value
any of our other curriculum.

00:02:57.426 --> 00:03:02.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: In this bag are
slips of paper that have things

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:04.886
that kids come to school
with, baggage.

00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:08.216
Okay? And what I want you to do
is write about some suggestions

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:11.436
that you have so that kids can
let go of some of the baggage

00:03:11.436 --> 00:03:12.796
that they're coming to school with.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.436
&gt;&gt;Victoria: A lot of my job as a
Curriculum Coordinator is to look

00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:17.606
at the already adopted curriculum.

00:03:17.606 --> 00:03:18.846
&gt;&gt;I thought "physical bullying."

00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:21.466
&gt;&gt;Victoria: And so,
"Okay, here's a place

00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:23.996
where if I was teaching
this reading lesson,

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:26.176
I could also hit this
social/emotional learning center

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:27.036
at the same time."

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:29.676
&gt;&gt;Teacher: "Two roads
diverged in a wood, And I,

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:33.266
I took the one less traveled by, and
that has made all the difference."

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:34.766
What do you think he's saying there?

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:39.346
&gt;&gt;I think he took the one
that not everybody was doing.

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:43.396
Like maybe everybody was doing a
different thing, and he thought

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.826
that it was wrong, so
he did the other thing.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:47.886
And maybe he was right.

00:03:47.886 --> 00:03:49.256
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Doesn't have
to be right or wrong.

00:03:49.256 --> 00:03:50.066
Just follow your heart.

00:03:50.526 --> 00:03:51.536
Be true to yourself.

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:55.796
Look at the poster back there, "What
is popular is not always right;

00:03:55.796 --> 00:03:57.346
what is right is not always popular."

00:03:57.406 --> 00:04:01.816
&gt;&gt;So Mike has eight
doll-- is this Mike?

00:04:02.546 --> 00:04:04.276
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this
fifth grade math class,

00:04:04.456 --> 00:04:06.796
solving problems is
a social activity.

00:04:06.826 --> 00:04:08.206
&gt;&gt;Mike started with eight.

00:04:08.926 --> 00:04:13.006
Kelly had twice as much
as Mike, and Joe had half

00:04:13.006 --> 00:04:14.266
as much as Kelly, which is...

00:04:14.266 --> 00:04:16.666
&gt;&gt;Chris: Every teacher out there has
probably said at some point in time,

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:18.276
"Turn to your neighbor
and talk about this idea.

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:20.526
Look at your teammates
and talk about this idea."

00:04:20.856 --> 00:04:22.396
&gt;&gt;Why did you do those shapes there?

00:04:22.796 --> 00:04:24.526
&gt;&gt;Because it looks cool.

00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:25.896
&lt;laughter&gt;

00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:30.236
&gt;&gt;Chris: And really watch, if
they are talking about "the topic"

00:04:30.316 --> 00:04:33.236
that you've asked them to talk
about, if they're actually listening

00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:36.156
to each other and using that
language and those social skills,

00:04:36.246 --> 00:04:38.056
then all of a sudden,
you have an environment

00:04:38.336 --> 00:04:41.686
where 30 kids are all
learning at the same time.

00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:45.426
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Today, Lucia intentionally
bumps into Jackson in the lunchroom

00:04:45.426 --> 00:04:47.156
and makes him spill his food.

00:04:47.456 --> 00:04:50.616
Then Lucia and her friends
stood back and laughed.

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:54.526
Okay, what are some impulsive
hot-headed thoughts Jackson may

00:04:54.926 --> 00:04:55.866
be having?

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:56.816
&gt;&gt;He could have hit her.

00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:58.796
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, he
could have hit her.

00:04:58.906 --> 00:05:02.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Aggressors,
Victims and Bystanders,

00:05:02.006 --> 00:05:05.256
or AVB curriculum has
been adopted by all

00:05:05.256 --> 00:05:06.726
of the middle schools
in the district.

00:05:06.946 --> 00:05:10.996
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What are some of the
cool-headed thoughts he could have?

00:05:11.496 --> 00:05:13.656
&gt;&gt;He might think that she likes him,

00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:16.336
and that's why she's
being so mean to him.

00:05:16.336 --> 00:05:16.826
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Exactly.

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:19.256
I hate to say it, but
sometimes at middle school,

00:05:19.256 --> 00:05:21.896
kids do some really weird
things to the kids they like.

00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:26.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The AVB curriculum
is also taught in special classes

00:05:26.176 --> 00:05:29.406
for the large population
of Native Alaskan students.

00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:30.856
&gt;&gt;Tina: Do you start
sweating when you're nervous?

00:05:31.476 --> 00:05:32.686
I do.

00:05:33.036 --> 00:05:33.426
&gt;&gt;Sometimes.

00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:34.756
&gt;&gt;Tina: Sometimes?

00:05:34.856 --> 00:05:37.506
Okay. That's your body's
natural reaction.

00:05:37.616 --> 00:05:43.176
And if somebody's bullying you, "Hey
Taylor, your name is pretty funny!"

00:05:43.336 --> 00:05:46.416
Or, "I saw you looking at that
girl on the bus this morning!"

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:48.056
Okay, he's getting embarrassed.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:50.346
His face is turning red.

00:05:50.346 --> 00:05:51.386
He's a good sport.

00:05:51.926 --> 00:05:53.056
He's a good sport.

00:05:53.056 --> 00:05:54.416
So there are a lot of...

00:05:54.566 --> 00:05:56.086
&gt;&gt;Tina: I'm from rural Alaska myself.

00:05:56.086 --> 00:05:59.416
I'm Inupiat Eskimo and so
I can relate to these kids

00:05:59.996 --> 00:06:01.036
on a whole different level.

00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:04.086
&gt;&gt;Tina: In middle school, we
call it the "think first" model.

00:06:04.816 --> 00:06:08.506
When you are getting provoked, or
you feel like provoking somebody,

00:06:09.006 --> 00:06:11.466
it's important to stop, and do what?

00:06:12.316 --> 00:06:14.546
&gt;&gt;Size up the situation.

00:06:15.196 --> 00:06:15.416
&gt;&gt;Good.

00:06:15.856 --> 00:06:19.796
&gt;&gt;Tina: The wonderful thing about our
program is we're able to infuse a lot

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.786
of the things that they
are already familiar with.

00:06:21.996 --> 00:06:23.526
You know, traditional
ways of knowing.

00:06:23.986 --> 00:06:26.836
The way that we teach
is very individualized.

00:06:26.976 --> 00:06:30.436
&gt;&gt;Victoria: In the Inupiat language
there are 25 words for "snow."

00:06:30.436 --> 00:06:32.386
So they can see 25
different kinds of snow,

00:06:32.386 --> 00:06:33.606
because they have vocabulary for it.

00:06:33.606 --> 00:06:36.746
And I have one word for
"snow" so I see "snow."

00:06:37.136 --> 00:06:38.676
It's the same with emotions.

00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:41.696
If all you know is anger, and
it's really just an annoyance

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:43.716
or a frustration, but
what you know is anger,

00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:45.556
you're going to respond
in anger every time.

00:06:45.556 --> 00:06:47.146
Because that's what you know.

00:06:47.226 --> 00:06:50.746
So it's important for us to take
it back a step, and say, "Okay,

00:06:50.746 --> 00:06:52.806
let's look at what that
feeling really is."

00:06:53.116 --> 00:06:56.126
&gt;&gt;Trudy: Today, you're going
to be interviewing one person.

00:06:56.126 --> 00:07:00.056
And that one person is also
going to be interviewing you.

00:07:00.056 --> 00:07:03.286
And you're going to write
not only facts about them,

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:05.246
but also some perceptions.

00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:07.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Freshman English
teacher, Trudy Keller,

00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:10.476
incorporates social/emotional
learning standards

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:11.856
in her daily lessons.

00:07:12.016 --> 00:07:14.586
&gt;&gt;Trudy: "Scrutinized" is a word
that will be on your next quiz.

00:07:14.586 --> 00:07:17.226
I want you to really
scrutinize them and think

00:07:17.226 --> 00:07:21.076
about your impressions
beyond just what they say.

00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:23.366
So it's what they're
like, what they're feeling

00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:24.966
that type of thing, okay?

00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:29.596
&gt;&gt;Trudy: One of the students
wrote about his partner

00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:34.836
that he interviewed, because this
student's parent was a drug addict,

00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:39.366
and actually caused a great
deal of turmoil in the family.

00:07:39.936 --> 00:07:43.956
And it was actually a student
that he had sort of looked

00:07:43.956 --> 00:07:45.416
down on, I think, before.

00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:48.006
And at the end he wrote, "I
have a great deal of respect

00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:50.586
for what this student
has been through."

00:07:51.086 --> 00:07:55.126
&gt;&gt;Do you have a job,
or what's your home...

00:07:55.306 --> 00:07:57.386
&gt;&gt;Well, I have a disabled brother,

00:07:57.386 --> 00:07:59.496
and I usually take
care of him myself.

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:04.026
&gt;&gt;Trudy: I just think that you need
to be in touch with their feelings,

00:08:04.076 --> 00:08:06.856
their emotions, in
order to teach well.

00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:10.566
&gt;&gt;I'm usually out skateboarding
if it's not raining.

00:08:10.646 --> 00:08:12.106
&gt;&gt;Trudy: When I know what's going on,

00:08:12.296 --> 00:08:14.326
and I acknowledge that,
and we deal with it.

00:08:14.626 --> 00:08:17.346
Then we can get on to
the job of learning.

00:08:17.536 --> 00:08:17.746
&gt;&gt;Janey: Two, three,
[chorus singing].

00:08:17.746 --> 00:08:22.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Music teacher,
Janey Lidey wrote this song

00:08:22.316 --> 00:08:28.046
after participating in the
"Change of Heart" program

00:08:28.046 --> 00:08:30.446
with some of her students.

00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:35.826
&gt;&gt;Janey: Because we've sung the
"Change of Heart" song as sort

00:08:35.916 --> 00:08:41.406
of our theme song for years now, my
kids, I think, really buy into it,

00:08:41.406 --> 00:08:46.336
because you know, they're selling
it, and they-- you just embody it.

00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:50.606
All of us just need to be
reminded that it's okay to be kind.

00:08:50.606 --> 00:08:53.816
And actually, it's becoming
the cool thing to be that way.

00:08:55.006 --> 00:08:59.036
&gt;&gt;Michael: We're all under the gun

00:08:59.136 --> 00:09:01.376
to improve our test
results, the academics.

00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:05.386
But I tell you what, it's a whole
lot more fun to start focusing

00:09:05.986 --> 00:09:07.346
on that connection with kids,

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:09.506
and helping people feel
good about where they are.

00:09:09.816 --> 00:09:10.606
The other will follow.

00:09:10.606 --> 00:09:12.866
Our teachers, I think,
are much happier.

00:09:13.236 --> 00:09:13.976
They like their kids.

00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:14.866
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good job, kiddo!

00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:15.556
Excellent.

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:18.356
Practice being cool-headed
this weekend!

00:09:19.026 --> 00:09:22.056
&gt;&gt;Victoria: The advantage of spending
time doing this is the payoff

00:09:22.106 --> 00:09:22.736
in academics.

00:09:23.186 --> 00:09:25.526
There's research out now that shows

00:09:25.526 --> 00:09:28.396
that kids involved intentional
social/emotional learning programs

00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:31.426
like we're trying to do right here,
scored on average, ten percent higher

00:09:31.426 --> 00:09:32.886
on their standardized tests.

00:09:33.246 --> 00:09:34.836
So what are we giving up?

00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:37.466
We're giving up, you
know, higher referrals,

00:09:37.616 --> 00:09:39.286
we're giving up violence
in our schools.

00:09:39.656 --> 00:09:40.376
What are we getting?

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:42.656
Kids who come to school, because
they want to come to school.

00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:45.556
And kids who know how to act
when they get into the schools.

00:09:45.676 --> 00:09:48.356
And hopefully, kids who
will go into their futures

00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:53.996
with a better chance at success. [choir sings]
