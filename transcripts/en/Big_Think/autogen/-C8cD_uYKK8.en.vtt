00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:05.720
I think the way to look at literature is as
an instrument that sensitizes us to different

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.720
things.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.120
We all know that if five different people
are asked to describe one scene, they will

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.040
all describe it differently.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.380
Some will describe the light, others will
focus on what people's feet were doing, others

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.640
will look at the, you know, material, shape
of the room or whatever.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.600
A great writer picks up on those things that
matter.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.970
It's almost like their radar is attuned to
the most significant moments.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.340
What literature is about is a record of people
with very sophisticated radars who are picking

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.520
up on the really important stuff.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.660
The interesting thing is that, for me, that
radar is not something we should simply passively

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.510
accept while we read the book.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.379
It's something we should learn from.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.469
We should shut the book and then say, "Okay,
I've read Jane Austin or Proust or Shakespeare

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.540
and now I'm going to see my mother or I'm
going to have a chat with my aunt or I'm going

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.559
to go and, you know, talk to some friends
in a coffee shop, and rather than just doing

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.820
it the normal way, I'm going to look at them
and I'm going to ask myself that basic question,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.690
'how would Jane Austin see them?

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:11.930
How would Proust see them?

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.190
How would Shakespeare see them?'"

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.660
In other words, I'm not just going to look
at the world of Shakespeare or Jane Austin

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.770
through my eyes, I'm going to look at my world
through their eyes.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.220
That is the benefit that is the intelligence
giving power of great literature.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.380
We are sensitized by the books we read.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.920
And the more books we read and the deeper
their lessons sink into us, the more pairs

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.450
of glasses we have.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.950
And those glasses will enable us to see things
that we would otherwise have missed.
