Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.910
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.640
It's my privilege and my
great pleasure to be talking

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.880
with the Juilliard
String Quartet today.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.490
Joseph Lin, Ronald Copes, Roger
Tapping and Joel Krosnick.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.860
Thank you so much
for being here today.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.160
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick: Thank
you for having us.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.220
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: We are,
we have the privilege

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.270
of a unique perspective
on the Juilliard

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.210
because the library
has witnessed the birth

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.520
of this magnificent institution
and its growth and change

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.340
over many decades from the very
first performance here December

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.220
10th, 1948.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.310
All the incarnations of
this extraordinary quartet

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.900
like a jewel with many
facets and I'm so pleased

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.630
that we're able to
present the quartet today

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.170
because this is their 70th
anniversary this season.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.920
And amazingly they have
performed at the Library

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.260
of Congress for an astonishing
67 of those 70 years.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.360
Seventy of the library's
90 years in the business

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.510
of being a concert
presenter, wow.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.660
[ Applause ]

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.300
Oh we're very excited to present
you and I wanted to start

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.290
by saying that for
us at the library,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.490
the many profound connections
between the Juilliard

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.900
and the library make this
especially meaningful.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.870
Perhaps strongest of all is
a shared goal, a very strong

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.270
and enduring commitment
to the creation

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.270
and performance of new music.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.650
It's great that they'll be
performing Elliott Carter's

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.090
First Quartet today along with
other masterworks by Schubert

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.740
and Beethoven and we'd like to
talk with you a little bit later

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.670
about your 50 year relationship
with Elliott Carter.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.360
But to start with I wanted
to ask you about something

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.330
that is an example of how the
Juilliard continually has a

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.700
tremendous energy and excitement
that brings in new audiences.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.750
And that is the new app
you have for Schubert's

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.050
"Death and The Maiden."

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.160
How did you come up with
that and when did you,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.510
what's been the reaction so far?

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.300
[ Background Sounds ]

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.950
&gt;&gt; Joseph Lin: Well the idea
of the app was one initiated

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.990
by the Juilliard School
where we are in residents

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.420
in all teaching faculty.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.030
In the Juilliard School
in various initiatives

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:51.570
to extend its reach to new
audiences and one of the ways

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.570
in which it's exploring
is through digital media.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.750
And in collaboration
with a company based

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.070
in London called Touch
Press, which is a company

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.210
that creates many very
fine educational apps

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.090
for Apple products.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:19.190
The Juilliard School saw an
opportunity to put itself

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.470
with the Juilliard Quartet
into the digital realm

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.790
in a very exciting new medium.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.950
A medium that combines
many media

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.820
that would have been
separate in the past.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.930
So certainly audio, but also
video and not only video,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.890
but a kind of interactive
video full of possibilities.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.630
In fact the possibilities
are endless and only limited

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.820
by the amount of memory that
you could reasonably expect a

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.700
product like this to take up
in order to be downloadable

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.720
for those using these devices.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.710
I'll let some of my colleagues
speak about some of the features

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.270
of this app and the
experience of making it.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.920
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick: Well I
mean part of the reason

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:20.170
for this app is to give not only
students of the sort of music

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.080
that we play, but audiences
a chance to hear and think

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.190
about music in different
ways than they would

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.680
if they were just sitting
there at a concert.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.330
Among other things for example
you listen to a quartet play

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.320
and you hear the balances
and sound that we.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.490
And highlighting of
materials that we have thought

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.210
about in preparing
the performance.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.720
Now if you listen to this
app you can decide to dial

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.690
up the viola for example
and ask to hear the viola

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.100
at a somewhat more highlighted
version of the piece.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.150
And follow the viola
part throughout or shift

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.440
and decide you want
to hear the 2nd violin

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.340
or the cello or the 1st violin.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.460
In something that you
couldn't really do in public,

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.540
although depending upon
where you're sitting,

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.030
that may happen naturally
you know.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:29.990
But the idea also is that you in
public probably don't really get

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.400
to follow and study the score
while you were doing it.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.660
Well if you want in this medium
you can sit and follow the score

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:47.600
and a highlighted score you
can hear voiceovers if you wish

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.750
by the members of the
quartet on areas of the score

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.510
about which we are thinking.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:02.330
It's possible also that various
historical information can also

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.130
be accessed while
you're listening

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.240
or when you're not listening,
just studying the piece.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.880
So the idea was to give
both audience members

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.090
and non-musicians, as well as
musicians a chance to go further

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.090
into depth of a great masterwork
like "Death and The Maiden."

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.980
&gt;&gt; Roger Tapping: "Death
and The Maiden," is this on?

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.280
Can you hear me?

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.390
Yep, "Death and The Maiden"
seemed an ideal piece we just

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.270
happen to be playing
in that season,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.260
but it's such an iconic work.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.080
And happen to have the
extra bonus that it's based

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.650
on a beautiful song, "Death
and The Maiden" by Schubert.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.450
And so also on this app you can
hear a beautiful performance

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.760
of the song.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.360
So it's just a nice extra touch.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.010
&gt;&gt; Ronald Copes: There is
in our commentary and also

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.730
in the analysis there's a book
that goes along with this,

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.960
electronic book that as part
of the app, which talks sort

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.210
of in depth about
Schubert's state of mind

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.510
when he was composing this.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.170
And some of the historical
happenings that were

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.730
at that time and some of
the long standing traditions

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.640
or parts of the "Death and
The Maiden" myth if you will.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.940
It's quite fascinating a book.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.020
And there is a lot of attention
to the different elements

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.160
that we bring to it as
well as to the book,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.650
to the different elements
that move through the music

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.090
and are insistent
through the music.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.030
And I think one of the
experiences that I know people

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.590
who have seen this app
have is that they be start

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.090
to become aware of how
insistent these things are

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.350
and really listen for the
underlying dramatic elements

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.680
coming from these
repeated motives.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.980
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: That's
wonderful,

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.280
as I say this is example,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.020
you have an incredible
energy throughout the years

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.320
that I've known the quartet

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.620
and each year there's
some new project.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.270
I was thinking just
off the top of my head

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.480
of the wonderful cello and
piano new music festival

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.570
that you did Joel with Gilbert
Kalish [assumed spelling].

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.500
That was a whole introduction
to the contemporary music

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.210
for the instrument and
many recordings, dozens,

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.770
dozens and dozens
of world premieres.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.200
And as we were saying
about Marlborough,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.930
we're looking back this
year in the rearview mirror

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.630
for the library's
history for so many major

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.450
and meaningful associations.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.130
And regarding of the founders
of Marlborough who came here,

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.430
wrote off Serfin
[assumed spelling]

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.730
and Adolf Bush [assumed
spelling] and so forth.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.370
With the Juilliard we
look at you as family

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.420
and not only legendary
artists, but as family.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.270
But in terms of the
work you've done here

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.610
if in there's been
incredible list of commissions,

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.310
the Martino Coolidge
Foundation Commission,

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.610
Richard Wernick [assumed
spelling],

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.290
Irving Fine [assumed spelling]
and dozens of premieres.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.340
So maybe let's talk a little
bit about your memories

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.760
of new music here and how you
were, what are you doing today

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.010
that is exciting for the next
coming 90 years, 70 years?

[ Laughter ]

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.150
[ Background Sounds ]

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.460
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick:
Well we played a work

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:14.760
of a young American composer
Jesse Jones last year

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.400
and we carried that
through the year.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.610
Next season the quartet
will premiere work

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:27.120
by the great Mario Davidovsky
and the quartet continues to,

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.370
is not a new music group.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:38.200
And we continue to play
classics and the great classic

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.150
and romantic literature.

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.390
And we play the music of
our time where we have to go

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.560
through as we have with Richard
Wernick's 9th Quartet this

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:57.610
season and understand somehow
what he's put on the page

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.310
and make it come
out in our voices

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:06.250
of recreation of his creation.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:11.370
And we continue to do
that and we discovered

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.790
that when we give it the care,

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.150
the same care we
would give Mozart,

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.390
Hyde and Beethoven
and everything else.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:25.490
That it turns around
and informs us perhaps

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.630
about curiosities we might have
about what's on the page in Hyde

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.820
and Beethoven and Mozart.

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:39.320
And so it works both ways,
to play the works of our time

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.950
with the care that one
would devote to classics.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:49.950
And to perhaps in so
doing, play the classics

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.750
as though they were new.

[ Background Sounds ]

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.530
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: I remember Joel
Smirnoff saying that in regard

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.620
to new music one element of the
Juilliard's deep involvement

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.690
with this world of contemporary
music is that several

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.250
of your members over the years
have been serious composers

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.550
and I hadn't thought of that.

What was that like?

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.570

did several of his quintets.

and Milton Babbitt
[assumed spelling].

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:33.510
And the quintet is of
absolutely beautiful work.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.040
[ Background Sounds ]

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.610
Sounding like a young man

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.920
who very much admired
Sessions [assumed spelling]

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.360
and Babbitt [assumed
spelling], but at the same time,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:50.000
at the same time very much what
became Sam's voice as an artist.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.870
And again was quite
an involvement.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.620
It's a very hard piece,
it's a [inaudible].

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.330
&gt;&gt; Roger Tapping: I think
there's been a rule, am I right,

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.190
in the quartet's history
that you don't play works

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:09.470
of the members as composers,
but Sam was retiring

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.670
and so he had us
at a loophole here.

00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:16.240
And it was an opportunity for
me as the person who was going

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.670
to succeed him as we
are a way to come in

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.250
and have that sort of overlap.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:23.820
And do some concerts to play as
the other viola in his quintet,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.300
which was a fantastic
experience for me.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.630
And it's one of the hardest
things I've ever played,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.720
but I loved it.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.380
&gt;&gt; Ronald Copes: My experience
in working on Sam's piece

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.880
and playing and performing
it was most of the time

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.740
when you talk about a composer
and you say there's nobody else

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.040
who could've written that.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.360
It's because that voice
is so well established

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.290
through their compositions.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.380
And my reaction to Sam's quintet
was nobody else could've written

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.350
that even though I had not ever
heard another work of Sam's,

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.130
which so often heard his
voice playing the viola.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.160
And so there was
something very idiosyncratic

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.990
and at wonderfully Sam.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.830
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Wonderful,
you know I've,

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.700
I came across a comment by Tim
Page [assumed spelling] saying

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.570
that it's hard to think
of another quartet

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.050
that takes a listener so deeply
inside a chosen composition.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.080
Wonderful thing to say

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.300
and I know that's something
you inculcate in your students.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.600
And Joel you've talking
very interestingly

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.840
about this experience about
watching your students come

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.010
into a composition and
discovering it and so on.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.780
And I wondered if
you guys could talk

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:35.220
about how we could
experience the Carter today

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.570
with all the wealth
of experience you have

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:39.330
with Mr. Carter's work.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.840
You take us inside it.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:48.470
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick: Well
one of things I and we,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:54.400
we're very empathetic

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.510
with listeners hearing
something for the first time.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:05.510
And we regard ourselves as
having the responsibility to be

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:10.530
as clear and as communicative
about the elements

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.310
of the work we would
like you to hear.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.090
And I guess I wish
you would listen today

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:24.670
and let the piece be what it
is to you as it's going by.

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.330
And recognize what
you can recognize

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.470
and just let it go by you.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:35.220
And be there with every moment
of the piece as it goes by.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.780
For you to try to sit there and
figure out the brilliant mind

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.570
of Elliott Carter
as it's going by.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.600
I don't know, I can't do that

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.670
and I've played a whole
lot of pieces of his.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:56.640
But you can allow the music
to go by and to realize

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:03.970
that there were things in
a New York composer's life

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:08.660
at that moment young man who
then chose to spend a year

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.890
in the Sonoran Desert
writing a work.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:22.900
And certain of those things
help you reach in to the piece,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:31.480
but he intends to communicate
with us and through us to you.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:37.480
And I would just allow
it to happen naturally.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.060
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You know
there's so many things

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.290
that we could talk about and
we really could do this on,

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.330
in a long oral history session.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.480
We should do that sometime, but
to move toward something else

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.440
that has a great connection
between the Juilliard

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.730
and the library are the
instruments sitting here

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.030
in the cases.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:00.260
And the many years of experience
you have had with them

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.870
and I wanted to ask you all
what does the experience

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.640
of playing a magnificent
instrument do for you

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.970
in performance and even in your
understanding of a work perhaps?

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:20.190
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick: Well I mean
among other things I guess I

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.560
probably played the cello more
than anyone else played any

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:31.520
of the other instruments and the
Castelbarco cello is a basso.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.730
It's a basso de Keizai
[assumed spelling] so called

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.910
and that is a cello
that was designed

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.840
with a slightly larger
bottom part of the instrument

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:51.560
to produce sounds from middle C
down to the two octaves below.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.130
Sort of if you wish as
a continuo instrument,

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.870
as a lower instrument.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.520
Perhaps as the lower
instrument of a quartet

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.080
or in this case the
lower instrument

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.840
of a trio sonata or a cantata.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.600
It has a fantastic
lower register.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.770
I often wondered
while I was playing it

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.320
and I loved that cello.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.550
I mean that cello was
really a fantastic cello

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:21.150
and I often wondered when I
played pieces where I was high

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:24.840
up on the cello, whether Strad
would've been a little surprised

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.260
to see me meandering up to
the top of this instrument.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:36.620
That was actually made for
its lower register and yet all

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.380
of it sounds really fantastic.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:46.720
And I was from the first time
I came some weeks before I

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.740
actually began to
play it and the staff

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.010
of the library kindly
provided me a room.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:58.890
And the cello and I spent
the day practicing it

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.420
and playing scales on it.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.270
And playing various
pieces on it.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:15.160
And it was love at first touch
and I loved that instrument.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:21.090
And it's very particularly
suited for playing in a quartet

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:29.390
because of the lower register
and it's hard to describe,

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:35.330
but I played it for many many
years and loved it always.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.130
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You
know I've, I saw a quote

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.310
from you were describing
a performance

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.520
that I actually remember very
well at the Smitten Quartet

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.100
and you said to a
reviewer afterwards

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.690
that the Castelbarco
almost played by itself.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:51.600
And this with you,
you were just,

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.260
the reviewer described this
as a molten performance

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.690
by Joel Krosnick and you said
that afterwards you looked

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.830
at the cello and
said, "Who are you?"

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.810
I know Bobby Mann used to say

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.650
that the Strads [assumed
spelling] were like race horses.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.310
That you had to, you couldn't
just expect to tame them.

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.150
You had to be careful
and get to know them.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.670
And so for they could
run away with you

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.970
and ruin your performance

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:20.280
if you didn't really
know what you were doing.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.980
&gt;&gt; Ronald Copes: I think in
one way the experience is

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:30.280
that they aren't completely
under your will as it were.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.750
There's an element of a great
instrument which suggests things

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.620
to you and so it's not just

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.140
that they do exactly
what you're thinking.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.680
They do maybe something even a
little bit better, I mean it's,

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.590
but they're a really great
instrument does suggest a lot

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.430
of things.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.310
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: And do
following up on that,

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:55.130
Joel we had a young person here
recently who said he was trying

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.960
out this cello and you had
told him about the cello.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.310
I'm trying to think of the
person now, it'll come to me

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.130
in a second, but he
said that you told him

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.510
to try the instrument
and see what he thought.

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:09.100
And that afterwards you
heard him play in Wile Hall

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.950
and you went up to him and said,

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.450
"You see what a great
instrument can teach you."

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:16.150
And that was a fascinating
comment to me

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:18.390
as you were saying Ron
you learned so much

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.400
from the instruments themselves.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.830
How does that work
in your teaching?

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.500
Do you, are you able to
work with rare instruments

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.780
at Juilliard as well sometimes?

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.080
&gt;&gt;

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.380
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick: Well there
are some very fine instruments

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.110
in the Juilliard collection.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.210
I remember one particularly
significant experience

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:43.040
where I was trying to illustrate
something for a student

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.450
of mine who's a wonderful
wonderful brilliant cellist

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:51.350
and played with a
lovely smooth open sound

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.650
and it was very beautiful.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:59.870
And for some reason I think I
had my cello as being my cello

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.700
that I own was being repaired
and I had another instrument.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:09.070
And I wanted him to try that
instrument, which he did

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:13.310
and so part of the lesson I
was playing his instrument.

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:19.980
And I couldn't get anything
out of that instrument.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.820
You know and he'd been
producing this gorgeous sound.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.780
And I'd been teaching the
fellow for several years

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.170
and I never had any idea
he had an instrument

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.670
that was difficult to play.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:37.890
And I was open in my admiration
I said, "Young, I had no idea.

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:39.190
My god this is."

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:40.800
Oh it's very hard.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.390
You know well, but
you learn things

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.690
from playing an instrument.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.970
And he had a sound
in his ear and sound

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:56.490
which he learned physically
to produce something

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.420
that was analogous to
what he was hearing.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:03.140
And so one transcends
the instrument,

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.570
but one learns from it.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:11.070
And playing that Strad cello
would teach you something

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:18.220
about the, about how to love
the lower part of an instrument

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.580
or how you know you couldn't
push that cello exactly.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.910
You had to wait for it and
it was really wonderful.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.070
And the students at Juilliard
who have an opportunity

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.750
to play something
beautiful, that's the idea

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:39.170
that they will learn from an
instrument that will lead them

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.810
in the direction of sounds that
they might not have imagined.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.430
&gt;&gt; Ronald Copes: On the same
sort of a flip side of that,

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.050
not every instrument or
there is no instrument

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.590
that is really right for
everyone and to illustrate

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.370
that perhaps the most
famous instrument

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:57.090
in the collection here
is the Betts Stradivari.

00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:01.880
And Bobby Mann did not like
playing that instrument at all

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.860
and used one of the
other instruments.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:08.330
Whereas Joel Smirnoff loved
playing it and I think some

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.320
of it has to do with the
different styles that we have

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.880
of playing, the different
ways that we produce sound.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.750
The different mounts of weight
and bow speed that we use

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:21.510
and certain instruments are,
will emphasize one or the other.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:25.330
And I don't, you probably knew
that very often I didn't use one

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:29.380
of the Strads, but rather
used the Kreisler Del Gesu

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.170
which is also in the collection

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.120
because it produces
sound very differently

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.580
and it was more suited

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.670
to the way I was used
to producing sound.

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.660
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: You know we have

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:46.190
so many interesting musical
comments to think about,

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.690
about what you've done
here at Straus [phonetic]

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:48.990
as we talk about and so forth.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:52.260
And I'm just sitting here
thinking how the work

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.660
that Juilliard Quartet has done

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.630
at the library is not
only a significant part

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.440
of our history, but
of music history.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.330
In terms of all the things
that have been done here.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.850
For example you brought
the Bartok Quartets here

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.670
when that was still a new
thing to play them in a group,

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.480
you know, a cycle of them.

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.490
And you early on did premiere
Vialobocean [assumed spelling]

00:24:15.490 --> 00:24:16.790
Hiostero [assumed
spelling] Quartets

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.730
when no one really
knew those and so on.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:23.210
And a lot of very
unusual works large.

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.720
We had the Strad
Quartet, sorry, octet.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.680
We did a whole octet evening
with the Concord String Quartet.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.980
That was cool.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.540
We had the instruments from
the Smithsonian's collection

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.760
with ours, but I was thinking
too it might be interesting

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.830
to see what some of your
personal history moments

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.130
might be.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.430
For example from me

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.180
and my colleague Michelle Glenf
[assumed spelling] who's sitting

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.920
in the audience, we watched
you watch the World Series

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.220
in the back room.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.510
Any fun things like that
that pop up in your mind?

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:01.060
[ Background Sounds ]

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.360
I'd have to say that that was,

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.110
it's interesting to
think about that.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:07.260
We have this tiny studio in the
back behind the concert hall

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.360
and we sometimes have
used it for rehearsals.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.080
And I understand that the
Budapest Quartet, then you think

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.350
of is these very austere and
you know extraordinary gentlemen

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.600
from Central Europe and Russia
and so forth, that they too used

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.310
to tune in to the World Series.

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.800
So what makes the Juilliard,
now that you, it's interesting

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.400
for me to have observed
the incarnations

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.140
of the Juilliard
as I've been here.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.870
And my former boss John Newsom
[assumed spelling] knew a much

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:41.680
earlier incarnation and so you
are experiencing this again.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.020
You have recently and
now you will again.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.620
We had Astrid Schween
here recently

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.150
and it was very interesting hear
her talking about her career.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.710
And her looking forward
to joining the Juilliard

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:56.160
and the mentorship that she's
been receiving from the school.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.640
And from the quartet
and from you Joel.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.710
But I wanted to ask you
what is your definition

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.510
of the Juilliard Quartet now?

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:09.700
[ Background Sounds ]

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.000
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick: You know

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.860
that over the 70 years the
quartet has probably changed

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:25.620
in sound in different
ways you know.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:30.900
In a purposeful specific way
we've never discussed it.

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:37.480
We deal phrase by
phrase, style by style.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.390
We talk about all the things
significantly involved

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.620
in playing whether it's
the Carter First Quartet

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:52.390
or the Quartets out to Schubert
or the 135 Beethoven done today.

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:55.250
And all the different
things that one talks about

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:58.200
and reaches for and
thinks about.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:05.520
No doubt the priorities of
those things have changed

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:12.200
over the years, but I
can't remember any time

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.350
where we said well okay
we're going to change this.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.370
This is not you know the way
we're going to do it any longer.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:24.110
And when people ask
us how has it changed?

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.470
To tell you the truth, we've
got the worst seat in the house.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:33.640
We're inside, we're inside
the workings of Beethoven

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.720
and Schubert and Carter.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:41.340
And using our instruments and
our minds and our imaginations

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:47.170
to do what we believe in.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.040
And we haven't changed
on purpose.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.900
&gt;&gt; Joseph Lin: You just
mentioned that the activities

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.620
of the quartet have not
only been significant

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:04.420
to the library's history, but
also to the history of music.

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:11.120
What has taken place over the
last 70 years and I don't think

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:17.650
at any point along the way the
quartet set out to do anything

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:22.570
that would be significant
historically in the moment

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.520
of doing any of these things.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.670
Of playing all the Bartok's,

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:31.310
of bringing Ginastera [assumed
spelling] et cetera, et cetera.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:37.900
But it's a spirit
of as Joel says,

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.960
doing what is important to us.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.550
What we care about.

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:48.780
Often in the face of
contemporary trends,

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.800
but we feeling that
there's some value to it.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:59.950
And at a certain risk that we
don't know what will happen

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:06.250
when we premiere the work of
a 35 year old, as was the case

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.870
with Jesse Jones'
piece a few years ago.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:16.010
But it in a way the value,
part of the value certainly is

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:18.990
in that willingness
to take the risk

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.260
and in some cases it
may prove well worth it.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:27.180
In other cases, maybe not as
much, but the spirit remains.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.550
And maybe that's more important
than whether that you know

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.920
in retrospect gets viewed
as a historical moment

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:39.410
or a particularly significant
in the larger scheme,

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.620
but it's that moment
by moment attitude.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:45.880
&gt;&gt; Roger Tapping: And I guess in
as much as there is a continuity

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.340
over it all the years,
which continued

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.020
to make the Juilliard String
Quartet, it is just the sort

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:55.450
of basic underlying ethos of
four people coming together.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.980
Extremely open to each
other's thoughts and passions

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:03.280
and opinions with a level
of trust that the idea's

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.580
that somebody's going
to come up with,

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.690
which may well not be what
you thought of yourself,

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.230
are really worth considering.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.900
And so there's this sort
of openness to each other

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.310
and there's, that leads
to a sense of exploration

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.010
which keeps the music alive.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:20.380
And which keeps you very engaged
in the process of rehearsing

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.260
and very much in the
process of performing.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.440
And I think that's probably been
a constant which leads to a sort

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:30.510
of passion and curiosity
and seriousness.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.740
&gt;&gt; Ronald Copes: I
think one of the things

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:37.700
that is quite conscious in the
quartet's evolution in a way is

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.810
that we do, we want
it to evolve.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:42.700
So that at every
step along the way

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.620
when there's a personnel change,

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.660
we very consciously
are interested not only

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:54.060
in someone whose ethos embraces
that or whose ideas embrace

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.110
that ethos, but also
someone who's going

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:59.460
to bring different ideas and
different ways of thinking

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.750
about things into the mix.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:08.200
So there's a conscious
desire to feel

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:12.350
like what we're doing is
letting the quartet move

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.340
in slightly different
directions and

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:19.400
yet remain with that same ethos.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.010
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Wonderful to
hear your answers on this.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.070
Any, I know that we need

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:27.380
to let them get ready
to perform and so on.

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.110
Just want to say, maybe
we should open up for,

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.040
can you take couple
questions, are you okay with?

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.820
Okay great, anyone have
a particular question?

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.620
Yeah.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.160
[ Background Sounds ]

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.970
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to ask if
anyone, if any of the current,

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.430
any of the members here played
the broken string concert

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:51.650
at the National Academy of
Sciences and what was that like?

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.550
I mean I think three strings
broke or did four strings break?

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.850
&gt;&gt; Ronald Copes: Broken Strings.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.150
&gt;&gt; Roger Tapping:
Oh Broken Strings.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.450
Do you remember an event?

00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.750
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Oh that's right,

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.050
I remember that there
was [multiple speakers].

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.350
&gt;&gt; Roger Tapping: Where
lots of strings broken.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.650
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: An
occasion when you were,

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:04.950
the quartet was playing

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.250
at the National Academy
of Sciences and.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.550
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick: Yes.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:08.850
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Incredibly
one after the other.

00:32:08.850 --> 00:32:13.810
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick: It was the 3rd
Carter Quartet and I don't know

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:19.840
who went first, but I think
Mr. Mann broke his string.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.090
And so in about the 60th
measure or something,

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:29.250
it we'd been playing
for about a minute or so

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:32.690
and so we started again.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:36.220
He went off and changed his
string and we started again.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:44.880
And then I think I was
next and I broke a string.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.870
And we started to
laugh, we went off stage

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.460
and I think we got a
little further that time.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:55.420
And then unbelievably
I heard to my left,

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.620
Mr. [inaudible] his string snap.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.000
&gt;&gt; Joel Krosnick: This not
possible and I remember it well.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.770
And remember Mr. Mann
turning to the audiences

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:10.970
and you will know the
opening a hundred bars

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.680
of Elliott Carter's 3rd
Quartet better than any audience

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.010
in history [laughter].

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:20.150
&gt;&gt; Roger Tapping: I remember
once being very grateful

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:23.090
for a broken string
as a very young man

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.110
at a music festival I
played my first performance

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.680
of Bartok's 3rd Quartet,

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.550
which is pretty scary the first
several times you play it.

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.990
And it had started
to go a little wrong

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:33.800
and then somebody's
string broke.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.260
So we had the chance
to start again

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.950
and it was much better
the second time.

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.050
It led me to the
slightly bad thought

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:42.560
that maybe we should
have a little invention,

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.140
some little sort of thing
