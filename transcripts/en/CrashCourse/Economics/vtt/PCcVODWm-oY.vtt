Jacob: Welcome to Crash Course Economics,
I’m Jacob Clifford

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.340
Adriene: and I’m Adriene Hill, and today
we’re talking about competition and game theory.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.549
Jacob: Games? Like board games or video games?
I can beat my seven year old at Call of Duty.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.949
Adriene: No, not quite like that. In this
kind of game, if you lose, you’re bankrupt.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:24.840
[Theme Music]

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.220
Jacob: So when we talk about markets, there are
basically four different types, or market structures.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820
They vary based on things like
number of producers, control over prices,

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.129
and barriers to entry -- how hard it is for
new businesses to jump in the market.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.380
Most agricultural products, like strawberries,
are in a type of market called perfect competition.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.080
There are thousands of farmers all growing
identical strawberries and it's pretty easy

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.180
to get in the market. You just plant strawberries.
Individual businesses don't have control over prices.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.520
One farmer can’t convince you to pay $10,
if you can it buy from other farmers for $4.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.170
A monopoly is on the other end of the spectrum.
There is one large company that produces a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.150
product with few substitutes. And
because high barriers prevent competition,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.120
a monopoly has a lot of control over price.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.200
There are two types of markets in between
these extremes. Monopolistic competition is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.950
a market with many producers and relatively
low barriers; their products are very similar

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.100
but not identical. This could be something
like furniture stores or fast food. McDonald's

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.480
and Burger King do have noticeably different
products.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.130
One might be able to charge a slightly higher
price if, for whatever reason, consumers prefer

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.300
that type of burger. But, if either tried
to increase their prices a lot, everyone would

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.480
just go to their competitor. And, if McDonalds
and Burger King both tried to raise prices

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.340
at the same time, some other company would
enter the market since the barriers are relatively

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.640
low. Taco Bell would start selling hamburguesas.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.750
The last type are Oligopolies and that's what
we're gonna focus on today. Oligopolies are

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.230
markets that have high barriers to entry and
are controlled by a few large companies.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.640
Oligopolies are all over the place. In fact
their products are likely in front of you

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.120
right now. The laptop computer market is dominated
by companies like HP, Dell, and Apple. And

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.330
the majority of mobile phones are produced
by Apple, Samsung, and LG.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.840
You also see this type of thing in markets for cars,
air travel, movies, candy, and game consoles.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.159
Adriene: Like monopolistic competition, oligopolies
often sell products that are similar but not

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.569
identical and this gives them some control
over their prices. But how much? You might

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.320
love your iPhone, but if Apple raised the price of
a phone to $3,000 you might switch to Android.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.860
But the price of an iPhone is pretty close to the
price of a high-end Android. So how do they compete?

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.680
The answer is non-price competition and, as you might
guess, it's competing without changing the price.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.880
This happens in a lot of industries. Companies
focus on things like style, quality, location, or service.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.000
The goal is to distinguish
their product from their competitors.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.879
Like, the jeans that one company sells might
be virtually identical to everyone else’s

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.639
in terms of quality, but if they can convince
consumers that having a designer label on

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:52.529
their butt is cool, buyers might pay much
much more. The same logic holds true if a

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:56.809
company has better customer service or has
more convenient locations.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:03:02.419
The most recognizable form of non-price competition
is advertising. Companies spend billions of

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:07.129
dollars each year introducing new products
or services and differentiating themselves

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.700
from their competitors. And despite all that
spending, most of the time, advertising just

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.240
kind of fades into the background. Can you remember the ad that ran before this video? No? Me neither.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.000
Don Draper might tell you, “half the money
spent on advertising is wasted; the trouble

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.980
is, you don't know which half.” It’s clear
that not every advertisement sticks, but advertising

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.049
can work to help a brand stand out.

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.150
Jacob: So, those ads that run before YouTube
videos? Some are for products sold in monopolistically

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.829
competitive markets, but the majority are
probably from oligopolies. I mean, think of

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.340
car companies -- they advertise A LOT.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.370
Generally, monopolies don’t bother advertising
because they have no competition, and firms

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.190
in perfectly competitive markets don’t run
ads because their products are identical.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.280
Advertising just increases their costs and drives up the prices, which means customers go to their competitors.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.980
So oligopolies sound like they operate pretty
much like monopolistic competition but the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.659
big difference between the two is that oligopolies
are made up of a few large companies. This

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.499
means that each company makes decisions with
the actions of their competitors in mind.

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:06.059
They use game theory -- the study of strategic
decision making. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.199
Adriene: Let’s start with a classic of game
theory, something called the “prisoner’s dilemma.”

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.080
Suppose Stan and I are arrested for scrawling
in wet cement outside the YouTube studios.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.959
We’re being interviewed separately.
If we both confess, we’ll both have to pay

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.860
a $10,000 fine. If neither of us confesses,
we’ll get off scot free. And If I take a

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.020
deal and confess, but Stan doesn’t -- I’ll walk away
and Stan will owe $20,000. And vice versa.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.800
So what do we do? Because we can’t discuss
it, we both confess, and both end up owing

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.680
$10,000. This is Game Theory: even if people
or companies rationally follow their own self-interest,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.699
the best outcome is hard to reach when they
can’t or don’t cooperate.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.699
Game theory helps explain why you get drug
stores and coffee shops next to each other.

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:55.710
Let’s say that Craig and Phil both start
selling tchotchkes on the Coney Island Boardwalk.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.310
At first they start on opposite sides of the
strip -- sharing customers equally. Phil realizes

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.830
that if he gets closer to Craig, he’ll retain
all of his old customers...and snag some of

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.580
Craig’s. But Craig’s no dummy; he moves
his cart closer to Phil’s.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.870
This continues until they both wind up right
in the middle of the boardwalk, sharing customers

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.039
equally--and unable to improve their position.

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.490
This also plays out with pricing. If Craig
lowers his price on Crash Course nesting dolls,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.800
Phil will likely compete by dropping his prices
as well. In the end they’re gonna continue

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.939
to share customers equally, and earn less
money.

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:36.710
If Craig understands game theory, he knows
there’s no reason to change his price. Instead

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.370
he focuses on providing knick-knacks that
differentiate his kiosk from Phil’s. This

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.810
can help explain why prices in oligopolies
tend to get stuck and why companies focus

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.470
so much on non-price competition.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.840
Thanks Thought Bubble. So, What if Craig and
Phil don’t compete at all? What if instead,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.360
they agree to charge the same high price,
conspiring to form what economists call a cartel?

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.220
Again they split the customers 50/50,
but now they make even more profit --

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.720
benefiting at the expense of consumers.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.379
This is called COLLUSION, and it’s illegal
in the US. There are strict antitrust laws

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:19.079
designed to prevent it. But that doesn’t mean companies don’t figure out other ways to raise prices.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.860
Price leadership is when one company changes
its prices, and its competitors have to decide

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.400
if they’re going to follow suit. Since they're
not actively colluding, it’s technically legal.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.039
But it can be hard to tell the difference.
Look at airline baggage fees.

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:38.099
When some airlines started charging fees for
checked bags, other airlines quickly joined them.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:44.200
And when one big airline changes their baggage fee,
the others tend move to the same price point.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.560
Are they colluding, or is this
a case of price leadership?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.700
Well, the Justice Department’s looking into it.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.560
Other countries’ laws differ, and cartels
do exist. The best example is OPEC -- The

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:59.900
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
It’s an international cartel made up of

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.990
12 oil-producing countries that manipulate
oil supplies to control prices. They control

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:12.050
80% of the world’s known oil reserves and
nearly half of the world’s crude oil production.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.880
Jacob: Economists like to explain oligopolies and game theory by creating something called a payoff matrix.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.340
Let’s say Stan and Brandon have competing companies.
Each can set prices high or low.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:26.540
The numbers in the boxes represent the amount of profit each company will earn in different situations.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.860
The profit on the left in each cell is for Stan and
the numbers on the right are for Brandon.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:36.300
So if Stan has a low price and Brandon has a high price, Stan earns $300 and Brandon earns $50.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:40.789
Now, payoff scenarios for companies are never
this transparent, but the matrix says a lot

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:47.140
about oligopolies. The optimal outcome is for each business to charge high prices so they both get $200.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.199
Stan knows this, but he also recognizes that
there could be even more profit by charging

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:56.129
a lower price. Brandon comes to the same conclusion,
so they both price low and they end up in

00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:59.229
the worst combined outcome with each only
making $80 profit.

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:04.029
Even if they collude and agree to price high, they
both have an incentive to cheat on that agreement.

00:08:04.029 --> 00:08:09.709
So collusion and cartels are often unstable. They can only last if the agreement is monitored and strictly enforced.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.430
A lot of times, it's possible to predict the
final outcome based on the information in

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:19.020
the payoff matrix. The best outcome for Stan, when Brandon makes a move, is called Stan’s best response.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.900
So, if Brandon prices high, Stan’s best
response is to price low and if Brandon prices

00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:28.759
low than Stan’s best response is, again,
to price low. That’s called having a dominant

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:32.770
strategy: it always gives the best available
outcome, no matter what the other guy does.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:37.080
For Brandon, pricing low is his dominant strategy
too: regardless of what Stan does, pricing

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.870
low always results in a better outcome.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.940
Adriene: Game theory helps companies make
decisions, but, potential payoffs are never

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.920
easy to predict and there are many situations
where there's no clear dominant strategy.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.160
Sometimes, the best response changes depending
on what competitors do.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.580
Those that don’t keep up or are slow to
adapt are pushed aside. It’s called Game

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:01.580
Theory, but to former industry leaders like
Pan American Airways, Atari, and Research

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:06.240
In Motion -- that made Blackberry phones,
the end of the game was not that fun.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.400
In any game, there are winners and losers,
unless it’s some lame co-op thing. But at

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.400
its best, healthy competition promotes innovation
which, in the end, makes us all better off.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.570
Jacob: And ideally we get cheaper air fares,
constantly improving cell phones, and amazing

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.880
video game consoles. Thanks for watching,
