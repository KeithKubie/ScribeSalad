It's surprisingly easy to make your own
butter,

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.180
and it is a brilliant way to get
children to think about the science

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.490
of how one substance

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.190
can be changed into another.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.880
Tonight, Brownies, we've got lots and lots of scones, but we don't

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.040
anything to put on them, but I have lots
of cream

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.120
and I have heard that we can change
cream

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.280
into butter and whipped cream for our
yummy scones for later.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.250
We make the butter by putting in to the
jar and shaking it really really hard.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.410
And we make the whipped cream by putting it into the bowl

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.900
and whisking it really hard, and
while do we do this

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.839
I want you to think about changes that
happen to the cream

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.370
when we make it into butter and make it
into whipped cream.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.890
Do you want to pour your cream into your
jar?

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.869
And are you going to start whipping? Whip it really hard.

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.320
Whip whip whip, is your arm getting sore?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.080
Do you want to pass it on to Suzanna?

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.869
You have a go now, whisk really really hard.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.250
Whisking the cream ads air to it,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.100
and breaks apart the fact globules
in it. The fat forms protective

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.000
bubbles around

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.530
tiny pockets of air and changes the
cream from a liquid

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.610
into foam which is what we call whipped
cream.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.660
Hold the jar like that, and shake it really hard, as hard as you can shake it!

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.930
Keep shaking, and I want you to think, can you feel anything changing inside yet?

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.320
Or does it still feel like a liquid?

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.060
Milk and cream are composed mainly of
water and fat.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.210
The fat is in the form of microscopic
globules,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.830
which are like tiny balloons filled with
fat molecules.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.350
Cream has more of these fat globules than milk, which is why it's thicker.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.260
When we shake the cream in a jar the
globules bash against each other.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.440
This makes their skins brick so the fat
molecules spill out.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.360
As we keep shaking the freed
fat globules join together making one

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.970
big lump of fat,

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.050
which separates out from the water. Lucy
can you feel anything happen to it when you shake it?

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.630
A bit? Does it still sound like liquid?

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.630
Ooh! That looks really cool!

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.989
We just pour that off.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.900
There's so much. And what are we left with? We're left with... butter! 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.120
There we go, scones for everyone. I think what we did was we were whipping 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.320
really really really hard and we may
have to turned our cream into

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.080
butter as well.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.420
So we types of butter, butter we made by whipping,

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.420
and butter we made by shaking.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.370

We'd love to see your photographs and
videos of you doing the activity, and subscribe
