hundreds and hundreds of years people
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.500
hundreds and hundreds of years people
studied science really just to try to

studied science really just to try to
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.510

conception of science and so I think

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
conception of science and so I think
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.939
conception of science and so I think
what's interesting is that even then

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
what's interesting is that even then
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.220

when we thought science was useless we
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.529
when we thought science was useless we
studied it useless in a practical sense

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
studied it useless in a practical sense
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.520

today my argument will be you know think

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
today my argument will be you know think
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320
today my argument will be you know think
about that length and breadth of history

and what they've done is they've tried
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.780
and what they've done is they've tried
to reimagine what a liberal education
