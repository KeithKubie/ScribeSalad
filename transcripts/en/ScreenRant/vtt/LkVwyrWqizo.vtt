00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.840
Have you ever wondered, why an actor didn't return for a sequel ?

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.780
Have you been disappointed when your favorite actor quit his starring role in a TV show?

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.540
Have you ever heard rumors about a movie production coming to a halt because an actor walked off the set?

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.880
Sometimes actors quit their jobs for pretty boring reasons,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.060
But usually there is a juicy industry story behind it all.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.380

"Hot damn almighty, I bet you're right"

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.560
But before we start, can you guess the movie from these emojis?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.680
Stay tuned for the answer at the end of our video!

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.120
Keanu Reeves in Speed 2

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.140
A younger Keanu Reeves scored his first blockbuster hit in the 1995 action movie, Speed.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.540
Playing a SWAT officer stuck on a Los Angeles bus that will explode if it goes below fifty miles an hour

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.100
If you are wondering how a sequel could be spun out of that idea, you're not the only one

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.760
*bus crash, explosions*

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.300
Both co-star Sandra Bullock and director Jean de Bont returned for the 1997 sequel

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.520
Speed 2 : Cruise Control

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.040
"This isn't happening."

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.000
Which essentially has the same plot but trades the bus for a boat

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.280
Reeves turned down the movie and his role was replaced by a new character played by Jason Patric.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.020
"It's time to have a look at your face."

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.220
"Take off your mask."

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.300
"No."

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.020
James Purefoy in V for Vendetta

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.740
For their follow up to the Matrix series,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.680
the Wachowskis recruited classically trained

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.440
English actor James Purefoy for the role of V,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.860
a mass revolutionary in dystopian England

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.600
Six weeks into production, however, Purefoy dropped out with many scenes already filmed.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.560
The Wachowskis and director James McTeigue quickly replaced him with Hugo Weaving

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.600
who they worked with on the Matrix.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.700
"I wish there had been an easier way, but-"

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.200
Despite recasting the part, Purefoy can still be seen in much of the movie

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.840
but you won't be able to see his face or hear his voice

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.260
as he's wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and Weaving's voice is dubbed over his.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.660
(Very robotic voice) "Hello there, children"

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.140
"How would you like some Salisbury steak?"

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.120
Isaac Hayes in South Park

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.160
In 2005 South Park released an episode in which they criticize the Church of Scientology

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.700
Isaac Hayes, a prominent Scientologist, criticized the episode and quit the series at the end of the season

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.880
For the premiere of the tenth season, Trey Parker and Matt Stone use old audio of Hayes

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.080
to bring back the character one last time...

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.620
Only to kill him in gruesome detail.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.900
It may not have been the nicest way to go for a beloved character but

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.040
it certainly fit in with Parker and Stone's irreverent sense of humor

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.300
Michael Keaton in Batman Forever

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.330
After the smash success of Batman in

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.580
1989 Michael Keaton and director Tim

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.620
Burton returned for another go-around in

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.560
1992 s Batman Returns while successful

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.569
the darkly gothic returns didn't quite

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.250
reached the heights of its predecessor

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.810
so Warner Brothers decided to take the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.459
franchise in a different direction and

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.920
brought on Joel Schumacher for 1995 s

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.790
Batman Forever

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.860
Keaton loyal to his friend Burton wanted

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.750
nothing to do with this film and turned

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.330
down a reported 15 million dollar payday

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.519
for the role this allowed Val Kilmer to

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.230
take over the role until he dropped out

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.140
of 1997 Batman and Robin and replaced by

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.440
George Clooney this Dog Show Dave

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.819
Chappelle Chappelle's Show

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.829
after years of toiling as a stand-up

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.450
comedian and supporting actor Dave

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.400
Chappelle finally hit the big time with

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.260
his own monster hit show on Comedy

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.849
Central the sketches on Chappelle's Show

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.160
steward topics like race gender politics

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.930
and the entertainment industry at large

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.150
after signing a 50 million dollar deal

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.950
for a third season however Chappelle

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.780
walked away after filming just three

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.819
episodes Chappelle cited the stress of

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.620
producing the series and return to stand

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.510
up after leaving the show after a few

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.160
down years Chappelle has recently teamed

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.989
up with Netflix for a series of stand-up

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.790
comedy specials jean-claude van damme

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.790
and creditor in 1987 the muscles from

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.040
Brussels jean-claude Van Damme was set

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.720
to star opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.910
in the iconic film redditor but you

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.049
wouldn't have been able to see his face

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.530
- you see Van Damme was supposed to play

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.270
the predator himself wearing a costume

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.760
and a man apparently Van Damme didn't

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.740
like this idea so he dropped out of the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.510
project leaving the role open for the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.430
seven-foot - Kevin Peter Hall

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.470
I wouldn't prep too much Van Damme went

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.030
on to have a long and fruitful career

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.950
starring in movies like Timecop and

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.100
Universal Soldier so that's just alone

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.380
in Beverly Hills Cop - Eddie Murphy's

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.540
most iconic role is that of Detroit cop

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.550
actual Foley in the Beverly Hills Cop

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.670
series but believe it or not that role

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.380
is supposed to go to sylvester stallone

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.570
and you guys believe that when sly was

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.070
attached to the film it was more of a

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.630
straight-up action film but stallone

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.700
dropped out two weeks before filming was

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.470
set to begin and the producers needed a

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.600
replacement and fat they found that

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.100
replacement and up-and-coming comedian

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.320
Eddie Murphy who was hot off the success

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.110
of 48 hours in Trading Places and so the

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.880
script was rewritten as a comedy and

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.650
everything went forward without the

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.840
Italian stallion it don't matter who

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.470

xxx State of the Union in 2001 Vin

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.300
Diesel broke into the a-list with a

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.669
charismatic role as Dominic Toretto in

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.770
the street-racing thriller The Fast and

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.480
the Furious but instead of signing up

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.340
for the sequel diesel and director Rob

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.500

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.510

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.850

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.770
sequel leaving his role of the Tyrese

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.810
Gibson and Ice Cube nevertheless

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.480
Diesel's career took a downward turn and

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.190
he found himself back in the Fast and

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.900
Furious fold for the fourth film of the

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.820

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.419
began to clash the showrunner Dan Harmon

after three seasons Sony fired Harman

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.100
disappointing fans of the series unique

that wasn't enough to keep chase happy

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.530
as he walked off the set at the end of

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.180
the season this could be like scrub

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.640
season 9 a revamp do-over this allowed

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.470

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.230
watching the rest of this entry because

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.270
we're getting into spoilers for Star

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.250
Wars The Force awakens

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.380
Harrison Ford didn't walk off the set or

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.820
rip a contract didn't leave people

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.860
hanging or turned down a huge payday he

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.620
just wanted to die or more accurately he

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.150
wanted his character to die that's why

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.830
it Harrison Ford actually thought Han

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.570
Solo should have died in Return of the

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.800
Jedi but George Lucas

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.750
he wouldn't oblige him so he brought the

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.940
same request to JJ Abrams before making

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.430
the force awakens and this time he got

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.230
his wish that's where the heartbreaking

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.450
scene of Han Solo facing off against

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.030
kylo Ren came from and now we will never

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.220
see Han Solo in another Star Wars film

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.180
ever again

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.000
probably well that's our list for the

day but you're probably wondering the

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.560
answer to the emoji challenge is the

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.450
