00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We know that Galileo was an amazing experimentalist.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So let's go back to Pisa and repeat his experiment.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:29.000
[♪♪]

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We're back at the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and we're going to carry out one of Galileo's famous motion experiments.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So we've already bought the equipment. We set up the experiment.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, what's left to do is to carry it out.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What I'm going to be doing is rolling this hollow cylinder down this inclined plane.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I've divided this plane into four sections, equally spaced,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and I'm going to be timing how long it takes the cylinder to roll through each section.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So that will require four separate measurements.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Instead of dripping water to measure time, I'm going to be using a piece of equipment Galileo

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:31.000
did not have access to, an app on my cellphone.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We've got our data.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now, we'll have to repeat this experiment several times

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so that we can ensure accuracy then we can analyze.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now, you're going to do the experiment yourself.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
To do this experiment, you're going to need a proper equipment.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So first, you will need something flat and that could be a piece of wood like you just saw me use

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
or it can even be something as simple as a book.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You're also going to need a measuring device.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This could be a meter stick or a tape measure or anything else that measures distance.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You'll need something to roll, and it should be either spherical or cylindrical,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and you'll need a timing device, something that measures in seconds,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and you can download this or find it in the internet very easily.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Finally, you'll need something to prop your flat object up.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This could just be a book that you stick underneath your flat object

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
or maybe a piece of wood, it doesn't matter.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Just the purpose is to make this into an incline.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
To actually do this experiment, first you're going to need to measure four equally spaced intervals

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
on your flat object, and actually, it doesn't matter what unit to use.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This could be 1 m or it could be 2 cm as long as you're consistent,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
as long as the spacing is the same each time, and you're going to start taking time measurements.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So for each of these four distances, you want to time how long it takes the ball to roll

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
from the starting point to the end point and actually it's not enough to do this just once for each distance.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You want to repeat each experiment multiple times.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
How many? It's up to you. I would suggest four or five.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
What you'll then enter into this data table is your average time

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and the average deviation of those time measurements.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You'll enter those numbers here since you know now how to compute

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
averages and average deviations, and then later in the class, we'll do some data analysis

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
with class the data on these distance measurements.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Note one thing, this experiment is done slightly differently than Galileo did it.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
We're not letting the ball roll for a fixed period of time and then measuring the distance.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We're letting the ball roll for a fixed distance up to one or up to two and then measuring the time.

00:03:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But this isn't equally good way to do this experiment. Good luck!
