00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.550
CYP2C9 is important in the pharmacokinetic pathway of

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.720
Warfarin. So let's learn a bit more about

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.930
how it goes from gene, to protein. CYP2C9

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.050
can be found on chromosome ten of the human

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.160
genome. Chromosome ten is about 135 million base

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.190
pairs long. And the CYP2C9 gene can be found

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.460
towards the end of the chromosome. The CYP2C9

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.520
gene itself contains nine exons spanning more than 50,000

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.180
base pairs of DNA. After transcription and

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.270
splicing, the resulting MRNA contains 1473 nucleotide

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.590
decoding region between the start and stop

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.510
codons. And then after translation, you end up

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.790
with a protein that has 490 amino acids. There's one allele of the CYP2C9

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.730
gene that's associated with enhanced Warfarin efficacy

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.550
and potential toxicity, and you can see that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.980
allele here, the change from an adenine to a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.650
cytosine at position 1,075. Now, using the genetic code we

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.630
learned about in lesson three, and which you can

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.960
find in the instructor's notes on this page. I want

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.620
you to determine the change expected in amino acid

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.160
sequence here. And then select the type of mutation that

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.830
best categorizes the cytosine allele. If you have trouble

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.990
answering this. Go back and review mutations from lesson six.
