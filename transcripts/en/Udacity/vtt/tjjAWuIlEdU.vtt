00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, let's see. Here another car just has potential energy.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Over here, it will also have potential energy because at the top of the loop,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the car is still some distance off the ground.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And so, what I'm doing here implicitly is using the ground as my zero point of potential energy.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, if this is a circular loop, this height is going to be 2R,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but it will also have some kinetic energy here.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So from an energy point of view, the potential energy up here is getting converted

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to both potential energy and kinetic energy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let's set up that equation. Well, here is my equation expressing the conservation energy.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Potential energy goes to potential plus kinetic.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The mass is cancelled and remember I'm solving for the minimum height.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm going to set this velocity equal to the minimum possible velocity

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that the car could have as it goes to this loop.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
When I worked this out, I get a minimum height of 25 m.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If I make the first hill any lower than that, the car will not have enough energy

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to make it safely run this loop and you might have some people falling out of the car,

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which isn't the best idea when designing a roller coaster.
