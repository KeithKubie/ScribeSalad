00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.470
Computer generated images have revolutionized
the way movies get made.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.200
Of course, there are still a few directors
who prefer practical effects, but by and large

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.339
the industry has embraced CGI in a big way.

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.130
For all the good it’s done, it’s tempting
to think that a little post-production manipulation

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.660
is always a good thing.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.060
But the next ten examples prove unequivocally
that isn’t true.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.780
But before we get to the 10 Performances Ruined
By Laughable CGI, we wanted to say thanks

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:27.780
for watching.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.800

YouTube channel for more videos like this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:49.920

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.780
Suicide Squad
2016’s Suicide Squad has certainly received

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.510
its fair share of criticism.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.250
For some, underdeveloped characters, unnecessarily
tangled storylines, and studio meddling were

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.250
all to blame.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.910
While others just sat back and enjoyed the
ride.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.720
There’s another critique that appears occasionally,
and it has everything to do with the film’s

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.920
climactic battle.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.930
Opponents argue the heavy reliance on CGI
actually takes away from the scene.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.850
The action is barely visible and because of
the framing, it’s impossible to establish

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580
any kind of perspective.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.361
Audiences are led to believe it’s a huge
battle, and it’s built up as such, but for

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:30.740
many, the scene just didn’t deliver.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.660
X-Men: Apocalypse
Oscar Isaac is everywhere these days, but

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.890
unless you checked his IMDb page beforehand,
you might watch X-Men: Apocalypse and miss

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.400
his performance entirely.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.280
Apocalypse is an insanely strong mutant and
a fixture to be feared in the X-Men canon.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.700
Both digital and practical effects were used
to achieve the character’s appearance.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.689
And as a result of the layering, some people
argue that the actor’s performance was totally

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.080
lost in a sea of blue prosthetics.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.009
Considering all the talent Isaac brings to
the table, that sounds like a darn shame.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.009
World War Z
When it comes to comparing the World War Z

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.920
movie to the book of the same name, it’s
obvious that the only thing they share is

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920
a title.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.620
The entire narrative structure, geography,
and major plot points are completely different.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.610
And when it comes to the zombies themselves,
the big screen adaptation fails.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.610
Hard.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.540
The swirling, computer-generated mass of phony
walkers scaling the Jerusalem wall is particularly

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.550
hard to watch.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.370
With the graphics quality of a late 90’s
video game, the scene falls totally flat,

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.060
taking all the suspense with it.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.440
If only we could just blow on the cartridge
and try again.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.300
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi
There’s an old saying that goes “if it

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.700
ain’t broke, don’t fix it”.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.510
And when George Lucas was fiddling around
with the Star Wars special editions, he would

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.050
have done well to remember that.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.360
Lucas made all sorts of changes behind the
scenes, and dedicated fans can spot every

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.510
single one of them.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.090
But one that’s easy for everyone to recognize
happens in Return of the Jedi.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.550
In the middle of the Jedi Rock’s scene two
very obvious CG characters appear that don’t

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.090
blend with the background at all.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.569
In fact, there’s even a few closeups.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.239
Let this be a lesson to us all: don’t mess
with perfection.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.379
Guardians of the Galaxy
On paper, Thanos is one of the most intimidating

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.210
big-bad’s in comic book history.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.000
Yeah, he was born deformed, but it’s what’s
on the inside that counts.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.810
He’s crazy smart, extra extra super-powered,
and has a gauntlet full of gems that literally

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.409
let him control everything everywhere all
the time.

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.910
How are you supposed to beat something like
that?

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.800
While fans who are in-the-know can appreciate
how spine-chilling the character is supposed

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.409
to be, anyone basing their opinion off of
his big screen appearance might come away

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.629
with a different impression.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:54.420
He’s not very intimidating, and it’s kind
of hard to take him seriously.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.250
Jurassic World
As we’ve heard once or twice before, with

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.680
great power comes great responsibility.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.470
And adding on to an iconic property like Jurassic
Park is not a task to be taken lightly.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.830
There are precious, childhood memories at
risk — reminders of a simpler time.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.259
So when the highly-anticipated Jurassic World
was released in 2015, we all held our collective

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:18.259
breath.

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:22.300
It opened to mixed reviews and one of the
biggest complaints was about the CGI.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.270
For many filmmakers, the age of animatronics
is over and digital effects reign supreme.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.440
Being released 22 years after the original,
audiences anticipated visuals even more convincing

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.289
than they’d already seen, and a lot of them
were let down by the spectacle.

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:43.249
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2
It’s a moviemaking fact that those who sign

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.930
up to work alongside young children are almost
guaranteed to have a bad time.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.729
If a baby wants to cry, it’s gonna cry.

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.180
But thanks to advances in technology, the
Twilight team was able to take a shortcut.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.159
Instead of using a real one, they just CG’d
one of those suckers in there and prayed for

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.159
the best.

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:03.150
Renesmee is strange looking, even for a vampire
hybrid.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.039
But still, even though she was entirely digital,
the infant actually gave the best performance

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:15.050
in the entire movie.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.949
X-Men Origins: Wolverine
If nothing else, Wolverine is supposed to

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.229
be badass.

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.860
Everyone knows that mutants who fight with
blades are just cooler than ones who don’t

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.039
— it’s science.

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.559
And with the exception of a few scenes from
2009’s X-Men Origins: Wolverine, his claws

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.439
generally live up to their pants-wetting reputation.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.710
In this movie, they’re more than “a little”
off.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.360
They’re a perfect example of cartoonish
CGI interfering with an otherwise pretty-okay

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.150
performance from Hugh Jackman.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.199
Thankfully, this installment in the franchise’s
history has been largely overshadowed by some

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.800
other memorable moments.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.289
So if you forgot about this movie entirely,
you’re probably not alone.

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:01.879
I Am Legend
I Am Legend does a great job of building tension.

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:05.930
Revealing the story in bits and pieces is
a great way to keep the audience engaged.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.169
If only the big surprise lived up to its epic
foreshadowing.

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:12.940
The antagonists are terrifying… until you
actually see what they look like.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.919
Their rubbery faces were funnier than they
were scary, and effectively undid all the

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:19.199
hard work from the first half of the movie.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.960
The scenario is unsettling: imagine you were
the last person alive, surrounded by infected

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.830
who used to be your loved ones.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.740
Some really awesome special effects makeup
would have done wonders here, but instead

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.629
the filmmakers just had to show off.

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:42.060
The Green Lantern
When executed poorly, CGI spoils the whole

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.619
moviegoing experience- regardless of who is
in front of the camera.

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:48.839
Take, for instance, the universally-loved
Ryan Reynolds.

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:53.339
No conversation about ill-fated CGI decisions
would be complete without mentioning 2011’s

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:55.569
The Green Lantern.

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:00.659
Computer-generated from tip to toe, Hal Jordan’s
suit was 100% fake, and 200% ridiculous.

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:05.259
It was so bad that when the actor super-suited
up for last year’s Deadpool the filmmakers

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.020
threw in a couple of jabs at his past work.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.749
Obviously Reynolds was a good sport about
it, and has even said that nobody hates Green

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:18.220
Lantern’s suit more than he does.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.969
So what do you think of our list?

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:26.379
Did we skip over any other CGI-ruined performances?
