00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.126
It's one thing to animate characters by hand, however there's a huge variety of

00:00:03.126 --> 00:00:07.080
phenomena that are governed by the laws of physics. For simple tasks such as

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.187
bouncing ball, keyframing can suffice. Here's a keyframing timeline in 3D

00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:15.688
Studio Max, and the process of setting up an animation like this. What if we

00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:18.711
wanted to have the bouncing ball keep bouncing? Keyframing by hand becomes a

00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:22.745
challenge since there's no simple repetition. For these phenomena we turn to

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:26.710
simulation to generate the animations. Here's another example. A set of bodies

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.055
attracted to each other by gravitational forces. For the bouncing ball, we

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:32.935
could have perhaps written a little program that would create the key frames

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:36.554
for us. Here the motions are complex and are calculated frame to frame on the

00:00:36.554 --> 00:00:41.588
fly. Many other phenomena can be simulated in real time. Here's an example of a

00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:45.114
spring system. These three demos were all created in GlowScript, a system

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:49.141
that's even higher level than Three.js. Simulating friction is a scenario that

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:52.276
can be challenging, but critical if you want to get anywhere. A blowing wind

00:00:52.276 --> 00:00:56.015
has drag and lift constraints, cloth has stretch constraints. This is a

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:59.830
relatively simple system that can be solved in real time as you can see.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.625
Simulations can be affected by the user's actions. As a simple example, in this

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:07.883
demo, you can turn the wind on and off, add a ball, and so on. These are not

00:01:07.883 --> 00:01:10.694
pre-stored canned animations, but are interactive.
