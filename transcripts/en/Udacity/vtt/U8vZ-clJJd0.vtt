00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.589
Hi all.

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.560
Today we are going to talk about
a subject that usually does not

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.320
get the attention it deserves.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.460
Money!

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.189
Why?

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.020
Because if you wish your startup
to last, it must be profitable.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.041
There is no other way.

00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.200
&gt;&gt; And, you should think of
your business funds as air,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.560
as long as you have enough of it you
don't have to think about it at all.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.670
But the minute you run out of it,
it's game over.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.130
&gt;&gt; I'm Ido Green and in the past 20
years I've started six companies.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.280
Two companies were acquired,
one became profitable, and

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.100
three flew into a wall
just like Buzz Lightyear.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.400
Currently I'm having fun at Google as a
developer advocate helping startups and

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.710
developers get the most
out of monetization.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.070
&gt;&gt; And I'm Jess, a program manager and
course developer here at Udacity.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.198
My role in this course
is to ask questions.

00:00:45.198 --> 00:00:47.540
Questions of Ido on how we monetize.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.870
And questions of you, to help you start
thinking about how you'll apply what you

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.870
learn here in your own product.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.720
&gt;&gt; In this course, you'll learn
basic monetization principles for

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.550
a variety of product types,
how to implement these strategies, and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.100
how to track their effectiveness.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.280
Let's take a little look
at how we'll do this.
