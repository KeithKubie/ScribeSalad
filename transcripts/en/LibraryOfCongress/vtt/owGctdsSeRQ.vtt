00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.500
&gt;&gt; First I should just say
that, directly outside,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.420
if you've been here for the last
two hours, there's like a lot

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.600
of ambulance and police activity.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.270
So, there may be continued
sirens that you will hear.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.040
That's just part of the
Hill Center experience.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.140
Anyway, welcome to the
[Inaudible] Life of a Poet

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.300
where we are celebrating
the work of Mary Jo Bang.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.750
The Life of a Poet is one

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.360
of our just most precious
programs here at Hill Center.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.820 position:56%
It is the partnership of the Library
of Congress, the Washington Post,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.510
and it's a real treasure
in this city.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.610
And, I could not, we
could not do this

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.750
without Rob Casper and Ron Charles.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.460
Ron, as I'm sure you all know,
has contributed book credit

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.910
but he is also the editor of
the Washington Post Book World

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:30.110
and is our moderator and is just
is exceptional at what he does.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.070
And, Rob Casper actually
makes the program possible.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.950
He [inaudible] curates the series.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.610 position:56%
Rob is the, to make sure I get this
absolutely right, Head of the Poetry

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.040
and Literature Center of
the Library of Congress.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.840
And, I'm going to let him
introduce [inaudible].

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.170
[ Applause ]

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.470
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Hey everybody.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.980
Can you hear me?

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.420
Thanks for coming out.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.890 position:56%
We're thrilled to have Mary Jo here.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.270
And, [inaudible], hopefully stays
throughout the conversation.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.250
Thanks to Mary Ann
and to the Hill Center

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.870
for making this very possible.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.530
I also want to say thanks to
the host who is Ron Charles.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.510
This is actually the 12th
program in this series.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.550
And, I'm thrilled to see Ron
become more and more of a champion

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.060
and expert in, whether he
believes it or not, our poetry.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.640
Before I talk about tonight's
event and introduce Mary Jo,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.190
let me say a little bit about
the Poetry and Literature Center

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.940
at the Library of Congress.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.540
We are home to the Poet Laureate
Consultant in Poetry and we put

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.540
on programs of this
throughout the year.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.210
We mostly do that at the
library just down the street.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.230
And, if you want to
come [inaudible].

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.790 position:56%
Okay. If you want to check out those
programs, you can go to our website,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.530
www.loc.gov/poetry
and find out more.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.420
We also handed out surveys for you.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.370
We do surveys at all our
programs to get a sense

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.000
of how successful our programs
our, to get suggestions of how

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.400 position:56%
to do more programs, and to find out
where you heard about this program.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.640 position:56%
So, if you wouldn't mind filling it
out, you can leave it on your chair,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:36.410
you can hand it to me, you
can give it to the gods

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.190
and we'll find it and [inaudible].

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.490
Here we go.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.350
Now, I'd like to introduce Mary
Jo Bang [inaudible] our 2016

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.650
spring season.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.950
Mary Jo's the author of
seven poetry collections,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.250
most recently the Last Two Seconds.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.380
Her others include Elegy

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:58.440
which received the 2007
National Critics Circle Award

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.400
and was the 2008 New York Times
Notable Book and Apology for Want,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.840
awarded the 1996 Bakeless Prize

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.470
and the 1998 Great Lakes Colleges
Association New Writer's Award.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.190
In 2010, Mary Jo also published
a translation of Dante's Inferno

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.690
which is a notable book about
American Library Association.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.740 position:56%
She's received the Hodder
Fellowship from Princeton University

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.370 position:56%
and Berlin Prize Fellowship from the
American Academy of Berlin as well

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.480
as Fellowships from Guggenheim
and Bellagio Foundations.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:37.350
So, Poetry Coeditor at the
Boston Review from 1995 to 2005,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.750
Mary Jo is a professor of
English at Washington University

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.300
in Saint Louis, actually, where
Ron Charles did his graduate work.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.980
On a personal note, I have far too
many stories to tell about Mary Jo

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.030
to fit into my introduction.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.760 position:56%
So, let me stick with the beginning.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.970
Fifteen years ago, when
I moved to Brooklyn,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.350 position:56%
I fell in with my then
girlfriend's social circle of poets.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.320
[Inaudible] for the Midwest though,
and my sweetheart described her

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.010
as a friend who had a
heavy, brainy, playful

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.820
and profound conversationalist,
a conversation that would be

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.850
as far reaching in such a
standing as I can imagine.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.680
I did, eventually, meet Mary Jo and
have just such a back and forth.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.120
But, I did not imagine
then that it would continue

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.210
with brief interruptions
of time and space

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.810
and with her singular slant
take on just about everything

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.740
so gloriously informed
by her thinking.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.730
What I think now of Mary Jo's
work, I think in these terms

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.780
and include the quote gorgeous
phrasing in matters that leaps,

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.480
unquote, what the Washington
Post described,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.350 position:56%
in their large Best New Poetry Books
review of the Last Two Seconds.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.080
I'm so grateful that we have
the next hour plus to listen

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.810
in while my friend and
confidant gets the chance

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.500
to experience the magic of
this ongoing conversation.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.510
Please join me in welcoming
Ron Charles and Mary Jo Bang.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.490
[ Applause ]

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I'm
so glad you're here.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.640
Thank you very much for coming.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.060
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Thank you
for inviting me and thanks

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.830
to the Hill Center, to Mary Ann

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.020
and to my friend Rob whose
introduction was extremely kind.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
didn't start your life

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.570
as a poet, your professional life.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.310
You started as a physician's
assistant.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.110
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: I
started as a baby.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.590
[ Laughter ]

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's going
to be one of those hours!

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.970
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: But yes.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:46.150
In fact, I did graduate
work in sociology.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.350
I then trained in the
order of these things.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah but you
worked as a photographer.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.440
So, I knew that.

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.740
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: That's right.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But, it was
the physician's assistant

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.340
that caught me off guard.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.640
I started to think
what did that teach you

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.940
about looking, about listening?

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.930
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, try
looking at a microscope slide.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.210
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: That teaches
you, or Grey's Anatomy.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.830
I mean, I think that a lot of
people have asked me that question

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.410
about how did these various
occupations inform poetry.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.860
But, I think it more has to do
with the things that drew me,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.860
the subjects to which I was drawn.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.240
So, I'm drawn to things where
there's a kind of exactitude.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.980 position:56%
And so, photography is one of those
things, particularly in the old days

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.900
when you had to set the, you know
the aperture or shutter speed

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.520
and you [inaudible] what
kind of film you had

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.660
and then you would
go to the dark room.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.090
And then, you would
time the exposure

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.260
and how long you would keep
it in that chemical bath.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.550
And, all these things, I obviously
have a compulsive personality,

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.730
and that served me well.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.310
And the same was true of medicine.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.270
You have to be, to be
a good practitioner,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.070
it pays obsessively
attentive to [inaudible].

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In one
of your poems you write,

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.800 position:56%
called Open Heart Surgery, I watched
while one man's heart filled the

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.980
hand of another.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.570
I noted the inviolate pulsing,
envied the sheer tenacity.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.750
You feel that.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.210
You saw that yourself?

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:21.510
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: I did.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:27.840
For a while, as a PA, I assisted
a group of open heart surgeons.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.910 position:56%
And, I didn't, I wasn't the surgical
assistant, but, I'd go into the

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.420
OR when they were doing
the procedure

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:40.730
and I would give them
updates on the clinic schedule

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.430
or whatever was upcoming
and I was an observer.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:48.310
And, indeed, there was
a heart in the hand.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
something hardly anyone sees.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.470
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Exactly and more
than I ever dreamed of seeing.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.130 position:56%
But, there was, and it kept beating.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.350
So yes, it becomes a
metaphor for tenacity.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.340
But, there's the literal
and there's the figurative.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.750
And, it works both ways.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: When did you start
to conceive of yourself as a poet?

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.530
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Maybe tomorrow.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:12.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Two
Seconds from now?

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.130
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.730
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: The
Last Two Seconds.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Was this a career
your parents would have suggest or?

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.340
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: No.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thought of for you?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.940
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: No, no.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.130
In fact, my mother
made me take typing.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That
has been handy though.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: It has indeed.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.680
But, it was because she wanted me

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.110
to be a secretary instead
of a waitress.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Ambitious.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:34.710
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:39.910
She was. And, I'm really glad
that I took that typing class.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In
one of your poems,

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.160
you write I've been a
coward most of my life.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.050
And then another one, if only the
terror of the next step were not

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.890
so absorbing, we might see more.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.730
What do fear and perception have to
do with each other and with poetry?

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.940
There's a lot of terror
and fear in your poems.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.360
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes, there is.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.070
I think that has to do with being
human being and not a poet per say.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:12.450
But, when one becomes a poet the
page becomes a place where you play

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:16.190
out your preoccupations
and your obsessions.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.600
And so, those subjects find you,

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.680
you don't necessarily go
looking for those subjects.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:29.810
But, within that social space of
the page, you are talking to others

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.970
who might, in fact, experience
the world the same way,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.650
and those become your readers.

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:39.930
So, that's how it has to do
with poetry is through talking.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:41.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And confessing
your own cowardliness.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.230
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Finds a
response in all of us.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:46.470
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Exactly.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.070
What did draw you to photography?

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.400
You wrote in one-line image

gets away with the breathless ajar,
image is invincible, defies gravity,

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.460
gets away with the
breathless life of ajar.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.700
What did, what excited
you about photography?

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: That's
a hard question.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:17.270
I think looking has been a part of
my life from the very beginning.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:21.190
I grew up in very modest
circumstances,

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:27.460
what you call working class, and I
didn't have a lot of stimulation.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.580
We didn't have books in our
house, we didn't have paintings.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:34.450
We had television of course.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.590
But, when I'd go outside, I would
see things and I was charmed,

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:44.480
I think, by say the leaves or
the different colors of leaves.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:49.490
And, I followed my older sister,
who's older by three years, around.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.220
And, that opened up a world to me

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.000
because she could go
further than I could go.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.570
And, I think that I was
entranced by everything I saw.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:06.180
And, I would see little flowers,
clovers, all those kinds of things.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.340
And, I think it was a relief
from both interior working

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:16.960
and a very boring kind of
interior life inside the house.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Agreed
upon, so High Art.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:29.780
This is from your, we'll talk
about what this books about later.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.790
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And you
know there's a movie right.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.390
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Called High Art.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:39.480
So that this movie, this poem's
in dialogue with this film.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:46.390
High art, there's a city
outside the mind, another inside,

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:51.220
a mind full of something
becoming because, a face too small

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:57.820 position:56%
for this red mouth look how the line
isn't a street anymore but a track.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.170
Like that.

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:01.600
The graveled shroud of a train.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.210
I'm not usually like this.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:08.050
A linkable Like arrives
without its What.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.560
Parks the car.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.700
I remember the camera,
The clear click.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.360
The clean cutting off
of the instant.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.200
Good-bye, good-bye.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.030
The slide in the sleeve.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.710
This opening eye.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:25.700
Wanting to take everything
in, sequence after sequence.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.340
The framed now that never ends
ending; the blue suit pulled

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.940
from a pool of aqua dreaming.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.800
Not knowing why aside from theory.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.050
Sexual, sexual configurations
of glamour.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.350
What is the scene?

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:43.650
What is the cover?

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.720
The frozen waiting
for focus and drive.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.650
Look, look, look.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.590
Art is what looking takes you to.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:56.700
A red mouth opening to
say, Don't look away.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.020
I'm not usually like this.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.630
The camera sliding by
with its aperture open.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:08.310
Form, repetition, constructs,
content, it happens.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:12.190
Here is the needle that
speeds the plot to the ambush.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.490
It happens.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.290
The Whole Truth shading desire.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.770
Atmospherics predominating
over drama.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.330
Chiaroscuro focused on
a point of desperation.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.900
The recurrent dream of a
catalog of surprise revelations.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:36.770
Having makes wanting continue a
darkness both familiar and strange.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:38.070
What have you got there?

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.740
A translation of a
story of a dream world.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.300
The sequence of events exist.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.950
Here one; here two;
here buckle; here shoe.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.700
Now let there be sound.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.540
Now let there be light.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.510
Once there was this now.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:15:01.020
[ Applause ]

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And I love the way
this phone talks about the camera.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.640
I remember the camera, the
click, the clean cutting off

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.670
of the instant, goodbye, goodbye.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.250
Talk about that.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:15.500
What are you saying goodbye to?

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: You know,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.440
[inaudible] talks about
the frozen moment.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:27.770
And, I think that there is
both a kind of tragedy in that

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.310
because we freeze the
moment and then it's over.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.340
But, there's also this continuation
of it because we have it

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.340
and we think we can hold onto it.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.270
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And, there is
a kind of consolation in that.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.900
But, it also goes back and forth,
so, seesaw between the tragic

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.660
and the re-embracing [inaudible].

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:55.580
So, I think that, if you know this
film, which is about a drug addict

00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:02.580
and about a woman who wants to
be a photographer and a woman

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.080
who was a photographer and
so that there's all of this

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.230
and there's a lot of sexual
desire going on between all

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:17.850
of these characters, that the
powerful kind of bedrock behind all

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:22.440
of that is desire and how
seeing both triggers the desire,

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:28.100
satisfies desire, but, it's
an intimate part of it.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:32.920
So, and of course, desire,
at it's worse, is addiction.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.370
And so, there's an extremity,
when you think about addiction.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:43.040
But, desire is kind of
the positive part of that,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:48.070
is we start out wanting something
and we end up needing it.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, yes.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:56.510
Talking about another poem, this
is called A Screen Door Slams.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.540
[ Background noise ]

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:03.610
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: This is in
my first book, I should say.

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.460
A screen door slams.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:11.520 position:56%
We leave my brother's red toy
tractor parked on the scorched lawn,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.540
climb the hill, peer through
the brush at the forbidden:

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.050
railroad tracks and hobo jungle.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.150
We lose sight of the ravine,
the fat black snake that falls

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.470
to the bottom of every yard.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.950
It's Friday night fish-fry
at the Fire Department.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.410
Grown-ups drink beer
from tiny metal buckets.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:36.230
My sister pulls a tin
fish from a metal washtub.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:39.260
Off to one side, a girl
with Down's Syndrome,

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.770
six years old, lists
in a wheelchair.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:48.040
The mother's gay hair is drawn away
from her tight, misfortuned face.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.700
She bends over the daughter,

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.630
murmuring into a lap of
robe, wiping a drool.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:59.510
Rolling head, slack jaw, protruding
tongue, an immaculate blue dress,

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.380
pristine collar edged
with a row of white lace.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.780
Don't stare, my mother says.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:11.860
And I the same age, air tinged
with the scent of fish and Crisco,

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.270
press my face into the
ironed-cotton smell

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:18.700
of my mother's skirt,
whisper, I wasn't.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes you were.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.720
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Obviously.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.660
You were so looking.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.600 position:56%
Everything in that poem is so alive.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.460
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well,
and it's also desired.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.760
I want that dress that
that little girl has on.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: All the
colors of the poem explode.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.610
I want that pristine white collar.

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.950
And, you know, the
difference between her

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:50.240
and me is it's [inaudible] and
I would probably have on rags,

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.550
because I'm the little,
you know, poor little girl.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:58.130
So, it's all about
looking as a poem designer.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.580
In one of your poems, you say,
can replication ever be pure?

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.970
Can't replication ever be pure?

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.370
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, no, we go
to [inaudible], this is not a pipe,

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.280
you know, and the painting
of the pipe, where,

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.890 position:56%
underneath it in French is written
the translation, this is not a pipe.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.390
And, it's playing with the
idea that this is not a pipe

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.990
because it's a representation
of a pipe.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.490
But, of course, when
we look at a picture

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.550
of a pipe, we think that's a pipe.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.480
So, there's all kinds
of layers in that.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:39.250
And so, yeah, the replication is
never pure because it can't be,

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.650
there's only this moment
and then the moment's gone.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:43.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This is one

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.710
of the tensions your poems
constantly play with.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.940

Renunciation of Dreams and Such,

another poem from your first book.

&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Renunciation
of Dreams and Such.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.760
The night you wandered in
the wrong direction and woke

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.500
up among strand bedfellows odd
man out in houndstooth blazer

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:18.230
and khaki pants, you called me
for advice but I had none to give.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:22.410
That night I dreamed: a
shower, a rat, an idle knife.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.660
There is no sense subjecting
dreams to light:

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.390
the truth is they live underwater

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:34.270
and even there give only a
passing glimpse of what we need.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.940
Last night I dreamed of
macaroons, those small delectables.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:44.410
I tried one but found it overmuch,
returned it to its silver plate

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:47.080
where a rim of tortured dogwood,

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:52.070
branch and unfelled bloom,
held the cakes in place.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.300
I once loved a man who
studied the quiet splendor

00:20:55.300 --> 00:21:01.480
of cut glass tinted pink with
rose, amber with Grand Marnier.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.070
In those days, I didn't dream.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.640
Not even the night a
hurricane unsuckeled trees

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.430
and laid them side by side.

January that year began and
ended as a wave of gray intensity

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.910
that converted the world
to ice and froze water

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.190
where it hid behind the wall.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:27.580
In the realm of hard, cold and done
for, it's best to rely on nothing

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:32.760
but touch and temperature in
a system where zero stands

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.510
for the treason of warmth.

was preparing for this,

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.200
I thought these people are never
going to go follow these poems

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.670
because they're too
difficult, they're not going

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.110
to be able to understand them.

they really come alive.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're a
superb reader of your own work.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:58.150
The poem is a by saying it's best
to rely on nothing but touch.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:03.040
You don't believe that.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.410
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Obviously,
everything's a metaphor.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.270
So, to rely on touch
and temperature,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.020
you could say why you
touched something

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:12.620
to see if it's warm or cold.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.650
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And you
could say that's a metaphor

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.050
for a relationship.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:21.710 position:56%
You touch the other person and find
whether they're warm or cold to you.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're much more
visual and tactile in your poems.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:26.560
Don't you think?

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.980
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, I
don't know how tactile I am.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.350
I know I'm very visual.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:33.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:39.290
Your second book Louise
in Love, it's remarkable,

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.770
if I recall a novella in
lyrics, people struggle trying

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:44.880
to describe this book because
there's nothing like this.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.100
It's about a silent film star.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well no.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.710 position:56%
It's about a character named Louise.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.010
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.840
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And she happens
to look like Louise Brooks.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:56.440
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: The
silent film star.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Who's on the cover.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.090
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: That's right.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.990
And she shares some
biographical details.

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:05.290
Okay, okay I'll go along with that.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.120
And, how'd this book come about?

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.180
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, it came
about because there was a new,

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:13.990
I was living in New York
and it was the early 90s.

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.480
And there was this
brand new coffee shop

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.520
that everybody was talking about.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.820
And, it was adorable.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.830
And, it had these little
tables and little chairs.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.790
And, as soon as it
open, I went there.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.660
And, my intent was to
sit there and write.

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:30.020
It was called Starbucks.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:35.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did you buy
stock in this little store?

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Unfortunately, not.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.890
But, sitting there at a table,
there were two empty chairs

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.810
and there was the chair
in which I was sitting.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.880
And, I had this idea to
create imaginary friends.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.450
And I did.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:51.810 position:56%
And, one was named Louise and one
was a man named Ham, which was short

00:23:51.810 --> 00:23:54.640
for Hamilton, and he was British.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.470
And then, I thought
okay then, who am I?

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.560
and, I couldn't decide.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:03.800
I might be another man and we'd
be buying for Louise's attention.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.460
I might be another woman and I
might be buying for Ham's attention

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.160
or for Louise's attention.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.940
And, I thought, well, why don't
we just settle that I'm the other.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.710
And there's always that
sense, in a relationship,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:22.970
that there is an other even
if the other is the blood.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:28.500
So, I then had a character sitting
in my chair called the other.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.960 position:56%
And, all these people talked to each
other and I made a poem out of it.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.240
And, it was so much fun, the
next day I came back again

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.230
and wrote two more poems.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.530 position:56%
And then, I showed them to a friend.

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:45.970
And, the friend said, those are fun
let's, you know, keep having fun.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.220
And, I said would you like to
know what Louise looks like?

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:54.120
And, I held up a shoebox in which
I kept different [inaudible]

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.060
from the years when
I lived in London.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:03.050
And, I knew what this woman
looked like, and it was that card.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.410
And so, I went to the
shoebox and got this.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.610
And, I looked at the back because
I didn't know who the woman was.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:12.010
And, and it said Louise Brooks.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.440
And, I had already named
my character Louise.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.990
And so, I thought,
this is Louise Brooks.

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:23.050
And, I thought I think
she's a film star,

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:27.450
no I think she's a writer,
no film star, no writer.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.820
So, the next day I went to
the library and, of course,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.350 position:56%
she was a silent film star who wrote
a book called Lulu in Hollywood.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:39.100
And so, I took out her
biography and Lulu in Hollywood

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.790 position:56%
and I aligned them for details, and.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That is surprising.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.450
So, it really was you
backed into this.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.750
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.490
So, she's, Louise is her
own person but she probably,

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.910
and I wanted to experiment

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.780
with creating a character
the way that novelists do.

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.080
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.380
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And
this allowed me to do it.

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.870
And, I wanted the character
to be not me.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.310
So, she's not me in
many dramatic ways.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:11.660
She's an alcoholic, she's
promiscuous, she, you know,

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.440
is kind of devil may care.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Lives
decades earlier.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.450
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well no
because my didn't, so.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.930
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: When
does this take place.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.090
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well,
anytime in the United Nations.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.250
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: But,
I became jealous

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.780 position:56%
because I couldn't get in the poems.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.220
So, I had to invent somebody else

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.160
and it's her sister
and her name's Lidia.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.940
And so then, I could
put my own personality

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.910
into Lidia's personality.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's fascinating.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:41.570
That's a great introduction.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:46.420
This is, we can only read a couple
of these so I just picked two

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.260 position:56%
that spoke to me on this slide here.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.120
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, I'll
just add something, that,

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.680
while I was writing some of
these, I was taking a course,

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.770
I had a fellowship at Princeton.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:03.390
And, I all I had to do
was live in Princeton.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.140
But I needed some structure
in my life.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.970
So, I sat in on a course
that was being offered

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:09.950
on late romantic poets.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:15.670
And so, there is a line in here.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.180
No, I'm sorry this is not the
one, I thought this was going

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.860
to have a line in here from Keats.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.180
But, it doesn't.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.550
Instead the line in here
is from Mrs. Dalloway.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:32.690
Sorry. That Was All,
Louise Said, Except For.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.430
The dalliance of spring-boards,

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.620
the lingering impression
of an off-black blouse.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.140
Facts, said Ham, too
often confide an edifice

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.960
with no hint of what hides behind.

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.570
They had just come from
seeing the clairvoyant.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.320
She told them that
like Clint Eastwood,

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.010
Louise had been born on an eclipse.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.400
Since her moon was in
Sagittarius, she could live

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:58.410
in a foreign country
if ever she chose.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:03.370
In the cafe, the service was slow;
the waitress had taken up smoking

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.350
and a bald man was asking for more.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:10.530
Across the street, a building
stood facing its final demise.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.220
A mud-spattered window in
a double-hung door was all

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.890
that divided outside from in.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:20.780
to Louise, the conversation
seemed all too familiar.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:24.940
I feel, she said to the
other, like a sheet grown soft

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:27.440
with the deadweight
of difficult sleep.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.560
She turned her head,
she was like a poplar,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.960
she was like a river,
she was like a hyacinth.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.840
What you are, said Ham, is beauty.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.410
Empty she said.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:44.010
No inbreath, no eyeblink.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.160
So, you see, Clint Eastwood
was proof [inaudible].

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Definitely
more contemporary.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.220
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And
then you wanted me --

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I did,
there's another one.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Okay.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:59.260
This one's hard, I just
have to see where it goes.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.560
Okay.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.320
Etched, Tetched, Touched.

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.080
It was perhaps Hollandish.

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:12.210
A tinted print of functional
waterway tearing a town apart.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:16.690
Aproned ladies and
ladies in breeches.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.720
A dog baited by a strip of bacon.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.570
Louise didn't care for such scenes.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.080
Static antics, she said.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.240 position:56%
Sterile takes on quotidian twilight.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.340
Give me rapture and
bliss, she told Ham.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:36.280
Hieronymus Bosch and Mister S.
Dali, her sister Lydia claimed

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.200
to have seen the latter her
second summer in Montmartre.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:46.910 position:56%
The epiphany of Yves Tanguy
walking a panther seaside in Cannes.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:50.020
Such sights call up the
shades, Louise said.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.150
Only they know how to last.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:53.970
Meaning, forever.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:58.310
All else shifts the way the print
has now tilted with no one near.

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:01.040
Ham crossed the carpet to right it.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.050
Of course, Louise too could be a
pretty picture: a woman riveted

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.640
to earth in raiments right for
the season, hilarity on her face,

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:12.020
the boat balanced behind her.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:16.400
From another angle, a perilous
island of plenty volcanic,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:21.660
tigers hidden in treetops, leopards
masking the faces of mountains,

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:28.530
an irresistible silence on the
edge of ruin, warm at the wrist.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What fascinated
me about that poem, was,

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.190
you got her looking
at all these images

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:38.870
and then becoming conscious
of herself as an image.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.040
And how.

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: How does that work?

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, how
mysterious that is because we.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.660
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well it is.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.320
And, it's third person.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:51.070
So, I think that the
person commenting,

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.610
Louise too could be
a pretty picture,

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:59.040
is the omniscient narrator
judging Louise by her behavior.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.360
I thought that Louise
would describe herself

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:05.050
as being on the edge of a ruin.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:09.500
She doesn't have a
lot of self-awareness.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.610
So, she gets into a
ruin without knowing.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:13.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:15.210
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did you ever
write any short stories?

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.720
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well,
that's how I began,

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.020
wanting to be a fiction writer.

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.170
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And, I
couldn't quite manage it.

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:29.340
Every time I would write a
story and I have a writing group

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.820
and I would submit the story

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.720
and people would point
out the shortcomings.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:38.010
And I immediately saw them but I
didn't know how to correct them.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.330
That was all, I had written,
that was the all the inspiration

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:43.550
and I couldn't revisit it.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:47.830
But, when I began to write poems,
someone could point out something

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:51.730 position:56%
that might not be working and I
would have six or seven other ideas.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.790
And, I'd just have to
decide between one of them.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.560
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That makes
no sense to me at all.

00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.750
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: No, nor to
me, it's a great illustration.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:03.080
So, this is my term, my revisiting,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.080
the idea can I learn something
now from my character.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Can
you write narrative;

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.680
can you write a story of sorts?

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:10.980
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Right, right.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.620
Just, I didn't try the
narrative, just the characters.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:14.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.220
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And then yeah.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's
a story though.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.820 position:56%
These are moments, but they pile up.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.120
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Right.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.420
If you have a character
around long enough.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.020
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: It coheres.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.620
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: To an extent.

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:27.920
But that's why it's a first
novel instead of poems.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.520
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You wrote
a book called the Eye

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:33.670
Like a Strange Balloon.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:34.970
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: I did.

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:36.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I can't say that.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.570
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: It'll [inaudible].

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:38.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:42.450 position:56%
It's a collection of poems inspired
by paintings, films and photographs.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.560
How would you describe
that book's dependence

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.920
on those films, photos,
and photographs?

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.220
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Right.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:53.830 position:56%
Well, the artwork acts as a trigger.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:33:02.950
And, for the most part, the speaker
then is in whatever scene is there.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.240
So, if there's a day at the beach,
[inaudible] day at the beach,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:10.970
which is not in there, but you
would, the speaker then would be

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.160
at the beach and would
speak out of that setting.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:16.760
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: So they
became stage settings.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.360
But, sometimes they were abstract.

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:22.720
And then, I would look at
them the way you look at a cow

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.170
and see a lion or giraffe.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.250
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: I would
use those particulars

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:32.310
to suggest a narrative instead
of having full blown stage scene.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:34.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Some of them are
quite famous others I thought

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.610
were pure.

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:36.910
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: That's right.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.690
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: None of
them appears in the book.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:39.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: No.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.290
That would be very expensive.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:42.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:43.890
Yes.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:45.190
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Plus, it
would limit the reading.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Now tell
me about that, why that?

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.180
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well because
then it, you'd look at the.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:50.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: If you were
able to look, why can't we?

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, you can.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.900
And, most of them are online.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.320
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: So, or, all of
them, I'm sure, are in catalogs

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.180
or they're films you could see.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.000
But, the, I didn't want
people to look at the painting

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.780
and say what I don't
see that, because,

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:06.000
of course, they wouldn't see that.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.630
Only I see that.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:10.720
But, that, it's just a trigger.

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.320
Here's one called the Bridge.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.510
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: The
Bridge or Ophelia.

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:27.720
She should have brought a book to
read, a trim volume, a novella,

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.270
a stack of stunned swallows
pressed into paragraphs

00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.990
on nifty rice-paper pages.

00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:37.790
Instead, she was left watching
a man feed a silver coin

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.060
to an open-mouthed meter.

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:43.230
She had ordered pasta
with pesto and waited.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.460
There had been pee smell
in the subway apse,

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.510
ankle straps on a pair
of patent pumps.

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.180
On that particular Tuesday,

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.430
she couldn't take her eyes
off the wonderful wool

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:58.990
in the window opposite a
bleached blue so light it might

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.510
as well not be blue but
for picking up a whisp

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.770
of a slant sky hue and holding it.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:08.820
Someone had been unkind last night.

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.000
Someone had said, get
thee and Get thee.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.720
Clearly she had mistaken
fire for some galling ember.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.130
Will he ever come again?

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:24.100
No never. Rue for you, rue for me.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.160
The small street ended in a
cul-de-sac beneath the bridge.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.450
Above, the noise of
some ecstatic blastment,

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:37.080
a battalion of Comemycoach
and Goodnightladies.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.560
This mixed with the softish,
silken swish of an overhead fan.

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:47.850
In a rotting wooden box, Parma
violets grew heavy in scent.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.460
Hey nonny no.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.450
a group of fresh-faced
acolytes from the Convent

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:56.390
of the Sacred Heart passed
in front of the glass.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.230
A faint breeze, a rippling, shadow.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:04.900
Her eye caught the corner of the
Queen's orchid cape as it swept by.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:09.080
A fountain threw its
dilly drops of water down.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.350
Will he never come again?

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:13.150
Yes, never.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:17.900
Against that backscrape of
sound and the hue of illusion

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:24.040 position:56%
of the vegetable glass of nature and
of lush grass, the hair of graves,

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:28.380
and of some hinted
and heaven-weft scent,

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.510
dressed in black taffeta,
the daffodil waited.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:38.450
[ Applause ]

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:41.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Now, what's
the difference for the reader

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:43.920
who knows the Victor
Burgin photograph

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:46.220
and the reader who doesn't?

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: I don't think that,

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.410
in that case it matters
because we have Ophelia.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:56.410
And so, we have all of
those views of Ophelia lying

00:36:56.410 --> 00:37:00.410
in the water holding
her little violets.

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:04.120
And, even if we don't have
that image, we have the play.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.720
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And so, the
bridge or Ophelia and we have some

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:16.710
of the language of Ophelia, and so,
and we have that sense of get thee

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:20.870
to a nunnery and we
have this rejection,

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.560
the speaker's been rejected.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:25.160
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: By someone
who will not come back.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.760
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And
Ophelia won't come back.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:33.480 position:56%
And so, there's this layering of the
beloved being told to get thee away.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.020
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: The beloved
being gone and the compilation

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:42.910
between being told to
go away and going away.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:46.530
So, it's a language
game as all poems do.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:52.570
And the game privilege of having
a language which creates sound

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.920
and the, it exploits
the ability of language

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:58.200
to mean more than one thing.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.000
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And so, I double
exploit that sometimes in my work.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.010
All poems are connected
to other art forms

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:08.580
and other poems and
other images but.

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:09.880
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well there's that.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:15.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This poem is more
easier to make those lines, I guess.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.210
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:22.390 position:56%
If that's the level, we want to
stay at of making those connections.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.690
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.480
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: But there's
something else going on that goes

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:30.040
on in the play as well
which is subjectivity.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.340
And, there is [inaudible].

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:38.360
And so, that's there for anyone
who's never seen the play.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.500
I do think it's much
richer if you know the play.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.800
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Indeed.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And
it's meant to be yeah.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And if you know,
you can't see this of course, but,

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.110
this is the [inaudible] it's
the Golden Gate Bridge, Ophelia,

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:53.130
you know, what does
it remind you of,

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.460
Ophelia's who's beloved
is there, dead.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.380
And then you've got, you know,

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.210
Alfred Hitchcock's
Vertigo also going on.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:05.160
I mean all kinds of things
are going on in this poem.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:09.960
Let's do another one that's even
more abstract, Mickey Mouse.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.550
Minnie, not Mickey.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.850
Minnie Mouse.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.430
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Minnie Mouse.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:27.490
But would you love me just as
much if I had nothing at all?

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:29.870
Sure, Minnie more than ever.

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:37.560
Of course, love is a
malleable matter of culture.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.610
And a wife is a wife.

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.050
And what about number eight?

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:48.970
Do you too see the world as formal
decisions, technique and touch?

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:53.930
The frenetic as typical of lines
formed quote with sticks or the end

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:57.480
of the paintbrush suggesting
the primacy

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:01.040
of the drawn or painted
mark unquote.

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:04.560
If you do, we'll still be friends.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.040
Theory reduces all
that to a sentence.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:12.940
A picture is little more than its
parts plus the marriage of time

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.370
to its nothing, less now.

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:20.190
I'm trying to think past the
edge of my own rickrack slip.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.470
On the hill are three trees.

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:25.700
Let's pretend it's a picture
illustrating the notion

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.740
that beauty is a bridge
trembling under today.

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.290
The insane questions
that one cannot solve.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:37.760
The sleuthounds bark,
horns fanfare the familiar.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.070
The herald announces
the weather is rainy,

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.620
a drizzle conceals the castle.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:50.040
A cut ribbon divides the beginning
from some already ever after.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:55.300
I'm after proof that I am more
than what can be dismantled

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.800
into small bits of ideas,
then pressed and rebuilt

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.100
as the essence of innocence.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.810
Now, I have to tell you.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.750
I've never read this out loud.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.960
And the reason is that I do
think it's very challenging

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.220
when you can't see it on the page.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:21.460
So, if I were in the performance
of my work, I usually pick things

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.660
that have more of a through line.

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:29.150
This has many concerns here,
there's concerns about innocence

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:36.170
and Minnie Mouse as a signifier of
innocence, has to do with museums

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:40.830
and wall plaques which is
where that quote comes from

00:41:40.830 --> 00:41:42.560
and all kinds of other things.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:43.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.160
It's an amazing poem.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:50.460
And it's not, it's, back up here,
it's inspired by De Kooning.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.110
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes, it's a De
Kooning's painting of Minnie Mouse.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:54.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: De Kooning's
painting of Minnie Mouse.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.540
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Actually, I saw,

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.590
at the national gallery,
here at Washington DC.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:00.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:02.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: On a
trip to Washington DC.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.530
So, it's odd that I'm
reading that here.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So, De Kooning's
impression of Walt Disney's drawing

00:42:08.650 --> 00:42:12.990
of Minnie Mouse and his layering
of tremendous transformations.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:16.910
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, and his
whole thing about women as well,

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:18.210
this man thing [inaudible].

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: De Kooning now.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:20.810
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah De Kooning.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.410
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And reducing
women to only some of their parts.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:24.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.540
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Which are
the genitals [inaudible].

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right, the violent.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:29.470
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Dismantling.

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:30.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Dismantling.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:34.490 position:56%
And then Disney, of course, does his
own violence to women and his own.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:35.790
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.210
Yes. You should see those
early cartoons Steamboat Willy

00:42:38.210 --> 00:42:40.850
and how poor Minnie is treated.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:43.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Or the mother's
always killed off, all that.

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:47.030
And then, and then this
passage from a catalogue

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:49.000
from the Milwaukee Art Museum.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.750
There are many things in here

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.660
that any particular reader
would be hard-pressed

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.570
to know listening to this poem.

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:58.490
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Right.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:59.790
Yes.

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.510
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Defend yourself.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.610
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well,
again, there are lots

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:04.990
of things for lots of people.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yep.

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:10.330
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And
some people will be drawn

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:16.510
to interpret the comments
another way.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.680
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Some about
Mickey Mouse, some about art,

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.960
some about the relationship
of the theory to the real.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.470
Some are drawn to a
speaker who doesn't exist

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:36.310
on reducing an argument to a single
linear statement and breaking it

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:41.070
up over line breaks but is eager
to do some of the work knowing

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:45.580
that they will, perhaps, come
to different conclusions.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
that it'll pay off.

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:48.530
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah.

00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:49.830
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because
there's so much there.

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:51.130
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah,
hopefully it will.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:52.680
And if not, you're not
the reader for that poem.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.910
That's, and I don't
mind that as well.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:44:00.610 position:56%
I'm really very, I'm a pluralist,
I'm, there are many kinds of poetry.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:04.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You wrote a
book called the Bride of E

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:08.200
which is a [inaudible] special
concedes the poems follow along

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.500
the alphabet.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.670
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: That's right.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:16.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How did,
this is a, what is it?

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:17.570
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Opposite
[inaudible].

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you for
not making me try to say that.

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.700
That, of course, [inaudible]
of poems was that constraining

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.930
or freeing or how did
you relate to that?

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:32.090
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: It is very freeing
because there's, I don't remember

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:35.870
who first said it, but, someone
used the [inaudible] staring

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:37.250
at the blank page.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:40.600
And, it's really accurate
because you sit there

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.320
and what are you going to write.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:45.640
So the alphabet I could write
some poems and think okay

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.140
which letters haven't
I written down.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:52.030
And then, I would think, okay,
Q, let me think about that.

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:53.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Q, that's
what you thought of was Q?

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.160
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: No,
I mean that's a point.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:00.190
At one point I had to think Q
and what words would come to me.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.280
And one of them was quit.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:07.230
And then, I'd go off on [inaudible]
which is what the poem is.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:12.250
But, it's started because
I was looking at an article

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:16.260
in People Magazine while I
was in the dentist office.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.470
And it was about Cher.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:20.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: This is in the book?

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.700
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.300
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And so, I
wrote a poem C is for Cher.

00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:28.150
And then, after that, I started
thinking, okay, what's B for?

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:29.540
And what's D for then?

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:31.880
And that's what gave me this idea.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.180
And then, when I exhausted,
I thought, well, you know,

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.790
I can't have a book with
only 26 letters, poems in it.

00:45:39.790 --> 00:45:42.430
So then, what will I do?

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:46.160
And then, some of my friends said
well why don't you do the numbers?

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.460
No, I don't think so.

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:52.790
So then, I did alliterative titles
using each letter and played

00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:56.440
with that until I had enough
poems to publish the book.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:57.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's fascinating.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.340
N as in Nevermore.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:04.500
I think you already attached
the reference to another poem.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:11.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: N as in Never More.

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:14.390
The Raven is stuck
now into the shape

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:17.330
of a principle taxadermic moment.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:21.520
The snapshot shows it as it
falls in the line of staring

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:27.800
down from the door frame and onto
what we are and all but defeated.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.470
To define is to make
material so says the raven.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:38.030
Below it is the eerie highway known
as the ever death ravaged by war

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:43.560
and wars and enigmatic attacks by
a rocket who struck the hardest

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.060 position:56%
and blended into an incendiary pole.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.290
One way to see the birds
to look at them as a frame

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:53.410
and a violence mixing its
message with the cold war

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:58.620
of constant utterance, quote
the raven, give me more.

00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:03.060
Mis means mistakes as
shall mean catastrophe.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.360
The arm, the line that
points to the start,

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:10.420
a bar or six at the
window and dying again.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:15.270
And, on the small screen, the bird
turns back into the lining operatic

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:20.420
into the story of key elements
accident and defined with an ending

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:23.590 position:56%
that ties up the plot rather nicely.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:26.580
Although outside the box
there's mockery spilling

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:33.380
over on the unwitting wish to
be and to be and to be better.

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:37.770
And over that, lush
layer of poppy shellac.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:43.520 position:56%
Only when I'm posing do I feel
real, this from the invisible crowd,

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.350
this from the death's head,
this from a bird looking

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:52.300
down on the square where a
woman is brushing back her hair.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:56.010
Her name is Lenore Nevermore.

00:47:56.010 --> 00:48:02.160
[ Applause ]

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Only when
I'm posing do I feel real.

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:09.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: That was taken from
some actress on a late night show.

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:10.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah?

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.180
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.480 position:56%
I don't remember who, but I used it.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Because
it's an irony

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.290
that occurs throughout your work.

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:17.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Right.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Having to do
with photograph, capturing

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.770
but at the same time rendering
artificial what's being imagined.

00:48:23.770 --> 00:48:27.250
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well also
because the speaker is a construct.

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:28.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:29.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And I
come to understand that.

00:48:29.850 --> 00:48:34.470
That, I'm able to [inaudible]
the truth and fill

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:37.900
in a constant and stand
on stage set.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:43.300 position:56%
And so, I realize paintings give me
a stage set sometimes or a character

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:47.080
so I can keep going out
on stages for [inaudible]

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:51.800
or for [inaudible] I can
hide behind a letter.

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Read another one?

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.310
In the Present and Probable Future.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.410
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: This
is a hard one too.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:07.890
You're picking my hardest poems.

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:09.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I want you
to listen to the questions,

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.400
the questions that are
asked in this poem.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.000
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: This
was actually published.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.880
This poem was written
because I was asked,

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.720
by the New York times,
to write a poem.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:27.210 position:56%
So, we followed the election in 2008
not knowing who would be president.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:31.210
And, they were going to,
they asked seven poets.

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:34.420
And, they were going publish
them the day before the election.

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:37.650
And then, at some point, they
decided they would wait until,

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:40.860
because they had so much election
coverage, they couldn't devote,

00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:43.020
this was going to be
on opinion page.

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.290
So, the day after the election in
2008, the opinion page was filled

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:50.880
with seven poems and
this was one of them.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:56.520
In the Present and Probable Future.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:50:01.330
Here we are viewing the land:
waves of grave and grain.

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:02.830
That slight tremor?

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:04.300
A house settling.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.180
A violent past walking through.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.540
And over there, the burning deck.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.370
The political machine.

00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:13.110
The inanimate come to life.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:16.110
The conventional flag wave.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:18.900
Cormorants on pitched
roofs watch the ship

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.540
of state mandate folded twice over.

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.880
Many ingenious lovely
things are gone.

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.280
This turbulence.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:32.010
This coming one-two march
through a landscape.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:35.750
The dark relative against the
brilliance of the last act

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.140
of some staged production.

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.600
The cast bows.

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.520
A tape player click, click, clicks.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.980
Some kind of clock.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.920
A unit of measurement.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.500
We wish ourselves back on the boat.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.780
Wish for the answer to the
question: When should we walk

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.470
out of the theater into the night?

00:50:55.470 --> 00:50:59.760
When should we accept that life
is only an exaggerated form

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.890
of special pleading,
romanticized beyond saying

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:07.530
into moon, stone, flock and trees.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:10.000
What in the picture
would you get rid of?

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.800
The land that stretches
back to prehistoric times?

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.480
Myriad islands?

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.640
Icecaps and etcetera?

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.130
The atmosphere?

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:20.530
The human body?

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.180
All of the above?

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.220
All but the latter?

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:28.250
You'd like to keep human as an
aspect of the formula but rid it

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:32.070
of its grappling ambition
to destroy?

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:34.010
Good luck with that.

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:36.710
What does it mean to
have a point of view?

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.740
What does it mean to have
a notable achievement?

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:44.920
To succeed in representing the
nuances of a determinate activity?

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:49.990
Listen: however, events turn out,
if we want to we can continue

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:55.250
to see the moon as an outburst
of lyric, a vision of John Keats

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:59.570
and his friends, but still
we have the battle to fight.

00:51:59.570 --> 00:52:02.410
How many more days will be there?

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:06.330
The unperceptive will be busy
believing in magic: crop circles,

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:12.420
the unmanipulated image,
definitions that defy definition.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:16.300
Others will take at face value
the less favorable consequences

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:20.410
of both cynicism and
commercialization.

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:24.130
The latter will say the flock
is simply an assemblage,

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.630
an obsessive presence
looking down on the building

00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:31.570
where someone sits
predicting the landslide rate.

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:34.900
Long after we are gone
we can say we were here.

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:39.830
We were working, wittingly or
not, towards the eventual erosion

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:42.980
of places ground down
and fought over,

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:48.550
especially in the literal sense
exploitation and industrial damage.

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.140
Nothing is lost.

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:53.220
If anything, we gain experience.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.610
There will be that unsullied
moment, down to the last detail,

00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:01.150
when the acquired interview
and other quaint signs

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:06.770
of demise will speak to
us, will speak about us

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:10.510
to the flood and the fire.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:14.870
[ Applause ]

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:16.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: When
should we accept

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:18.750
that life is only an exaggerated
form of special pleading?

00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:24.680
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: I don't
think we can ever accept that.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What does it
mean to have a point of view?

00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:30.590
What does it mean to have a
notable achievement to succeed

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:33.700
in representing nuances
of a determined activity?

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:38.220
The poem is full of these really
great provocative questions

00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:43.580
that makes it so, you just want
to go back and read it again.

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.900
Listen: however, events turn out,
if we want to we can continue

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:51.350
to see the moon as an outburst
of lyric, a vision of John Keats.

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:52.650
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And his friends.

00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:53.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And his friends.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:54:00.200
Yes, the lit poem turns back on
romantic poetry itself, on romance

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.290
and the way it represents
them it's real.

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:05.210
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well thank you.

00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:06.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Let's take
a break let's just stand up,

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.680
turn around, sit back down.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.940
Can we talk about your son?

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:14.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: We can
talk about the book.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:17.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Your son was
37 when he died in New York?

00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.140
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:20.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How did that happen?

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.330
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: We can
talk about the book.

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:25.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The book
is a response to his death.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:30.910
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: The speaker
in the book has suffered a loss

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:35.300
and something I know a lot about.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:41.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I appreciate your
willingness to go through this.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.740
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Okay.

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Could
you read the first poem?

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:49.570
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Okay.

00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.920
A Sonata for Four Hands.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.290
Causes and consequences line
up, Ready for the next dawn

00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:04.330
with its blight of glass bulbs.

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:08.230
In the welled nothingness
of definitely,

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:11.160
there is another Sad sobbing day.

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:14.360
Someone has seen you and
says you were just fine,

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.640
hours before you weren't.

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.360
I say Come Back and you
do Not do what I want.

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:25.460
The train unrolls its track
and sends its sound forward.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:30.350
The siren unrolls its sound
and sends itself Forward.

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.710
The first day of the
last goes forward

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:35.890
as the last summer you'll see.

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:39.040
The dirge is all wrong
for the season.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.930
Death remains Wedded to mystery.

00:55:41.930 --> 00:55:44.100
How Does the heart stop?

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.330
On what Moment's turning?

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:47.630
Which tick?

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:51.050
And why? Only where Is settled.

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:52.360
Behind an address.

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.010
Some block Building.

00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:57.510
Some barricade brick That
hides bracketed hours

00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:01.560
Until the doom door
opens and my I sees.

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.750
Police seal peeled back.

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:05.850
Everything as you left it.

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:08.580
On and over and under.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:10.380
Why are you not where you belong?

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.960
A black hat on a hook says nothing.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.760
Ashes mirror ashes in
a mirroring window.

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.530
And now how Do we resolve
this predicament?

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:24.510
The body becomes the
art of identity.

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:26.060
A face in a photograph.

00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:29.510
The bas relief Around
the morgue door.

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:31.860
You, singularly you.

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:33.660
And gone Invisible.

before we talk about them,

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:49.100
another one toward the center of a
book Intractable and Irreversible.

&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Intractable,
and Irreversible.

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:56.480
The overcast sky, the, I'm sorry.

00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:01.450
The overcast cast of the
sky is the secondary drama.

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:04.020
On the screen at the
back of the mind.

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:07.690
Far from the vigilant eye,
A dictionary definition

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:11.820
of death is written Over the
grid of a calendar sequence.

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:15.500
Death is the date when
the output is over.

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:20.670
An irreversible heartbeat hiatus
That goes by the name of no more.

00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:24.180
At home in his ash box,
he was going nowhere Else.

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:29.010
He was living with her now
In a land of low clouds

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.850
Where weather was the
only possible change.

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:34.250
The clouds see nothing.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:39.140
The clouds are nothing
but ice changes and water.

00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:41.650
Water changes and morning's
cold sets

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:45.520
in motion The proximate,
the visible, day.

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:47.370
There will be no more of time

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:51.020
and time's corruption
For the ash in the box.

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:53.120
The love of her life.

00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.980
She notices how quiet
he is in there.

00:57:55.980 --> 00:58:00.550
Out here, she talks, I
talk but always to a mirror

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:04.420
Where a face looks out like a
clock that says night Is coming

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:08.830
and then it comes like
a coat of silted black.

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:12.010
Thank you, she says,
as she slips into bed.

00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:14.180
One more alarm silenced.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:16.520
One more Closet door closed.

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:21.240
One more Shoe sole set to the
floor of checkered linoleum.

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.650
The castle is quiet,
the castle is snug.

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:27.000
A dream bell begins to toll,

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.510
to tell of the intolerable
end that keeps going on.

&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: These
poems give voice

00:58:39.900 --> 00:58:42.780
to what you call the
hair tearing grief

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:48.970
of the mother whose child has been
swept away by the needle broom

00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:52.030
of her own mindless errors.

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:57.820
That does not seem fair to blame.

00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:59.120
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: The mother?

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The mother.

00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:02.080
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, the speaker

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:09.530
in these poems, has
that point of view.

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:17.780 position:56%
So, I don't think we can convince
her that she shouldn't feel that way

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:19.300
because feelings just are.

00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.820
Right.

00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.310
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And, it is
the nature of grief, I think,

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:30.940
that it's unchanging
and unchangeable.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:36.870
So, I think that the, this book
which has meant a lot to a lot

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:42.270
of people, I've been told, is
probably gives voice to things

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:44.240
that are very difficult
to give voice to

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:50.950
and that politest prevents
us from somehow going

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:52.480
to talk about the extremity.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.330
And there are poets like Dickinson,

00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:58.460
after great pain a
formal feeling comes.

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.520
And there it just sits ceremonious.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:06.960 position:56%
I think that the reason she's so
timeless is that she has given voice

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.720
to those things that
are very difficult

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.870
to talk to each other about.

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:15.760
And so, in some ways
the poet's very lucky

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.190
because she can write
these things down

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:19.840
and then trigger them [inaudible].

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.130
And then, the other
people can read them

01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:28.670
and she has time to
be interrogated by --

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.490
But, we don't ask Dickinson,
what did you mean?

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:42.880
Who died? And that's how I want
these poems to be in the world is

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:46.230
that they exist because
they give voice to a state

01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:49.230
of subjectivity that is extreme.

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:50.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:53.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And that many
people have lost someone to death.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:56.420
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And,
the circumstances

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.050
of the death don't matter.

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:02.100
The grief echoes similarly.

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:06.230
I find death absolutely
unfathomable.

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:07.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:08.830
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: That
someone can be.

01:01:08.830 --> 01:01:10.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:11.430
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And
then stop being, it's,

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:17.250
I will never get my
mind around that.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:18.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:01:18.550 --> 01:01:19.910
How did you decide?

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:21.820
You said in your poem
you're going to condense

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:25.410 position:56%
to seven stanzas a particular world.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: I, actually
that poem's from, again,

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:42.580
an interview I read with
a film director who said

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:47.990
that you can create a whole
world in seven scenes.

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:52.550
And so, the translation of
that would be seven stances.

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:53.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.150
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And
so, as you can see

01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:58.510 position:56%
from what I'm telling you I'm
getting something from a wall plaque

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:02.410
in a museum, I'm getting something
from late night TV, I'm just,

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:08.390
I always have my antenna
out for appropriating life

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:13.110 position:56%
because when I put that in the poems
I'm hoping the poems will give voice

01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:15.310
to something that feels freedom.

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:16.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They definitely do.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.170
You describe the problems
in one part

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:22.560
as a transient distraction
of ink on cloth.

01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:28.760
Nothing more can be said
about that, it's so profound.

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:31.530
The decision to write these
poems, to me, seems to state

01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.730
from the decision to publish them.

01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:35.030
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:36.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Could you
talk about that decision?

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:37.630
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: I can.

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:45.300
I wrote the poems and I, they
were a way of distracting myself

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.370
from that grief which
was a dangerous form

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:50.870
of grief and needed distraction.

01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:53.440
And, it was interesting
after a while

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.670
because I would critique
what I was doing

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:01.740
and say you should not be writing
these poems because you are,

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:10.510
you know, you are exploiting
your own tragedy for making art.

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:14.020
And then, I would think to
myself, well, not really.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:19.090
I'm playing that old word
game that I know how to play.

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:20.910
And, by playing that game, just

01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:24.200
like playing solitaire,
I'm distracting myself.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.550
But then, I would write something
and sit back and read it.

01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:35.130
And, what I had written was so
sad because it was my [inaudible]

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:36.700
that that would take
me back into it.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.420
And then, to get out of
it I would write again.

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.160
And then, I would distract
myself by deciding

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:46.510
where to break the
line or what word to.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:47.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
technical aspect.

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.710
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: The
technical aspects.

01:03:49.710 --> 01:03:53.960
I couldn't be bothered with
titles, that was too much.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.400
And so, they're, almost all of
them, at least the early ones,

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.300
were one word titles which
then later I would go back

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.720
and try to do something with.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:10.370
And, at some point, I realized,
oh my goodness, people,

01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:12.430
poets have been doing this forever.

01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:13.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
the oldest form.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:15.030
Isn't it?

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:16.330
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: It's
called an Elegy.

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:20.970
And then, suddenly I realized
that's what I was writing elegies.

01:04:20.970 --> 01:04:25.230
And I began to think about
what an elegy is and one,

01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:29.510
it reconjures the beloved
so that the beloved is back

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:33.590
and there's a consolation in
that until you realize that no,

01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:38.830
this is not the real beloved
and I mean that's painful again.

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:43.910
It also is a way to
memorialize the phenomena.

01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:49.170 position:56%
And, but most importantly I realized
it was that distraction from grief.

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:52.500
And so, then, I started
writing a poem

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.600
which is Elegy which
I know read apart.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:58.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:02.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: As a way to
think through what I was doing.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:07.330
And, I never intended
to publish poems.

01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:11.270
But, after you've written
a number of books,

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:15.680
editors will sometimes approach
you and ask you for poems.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.390
And so, I would write that
that I didn't have any

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:24.540
and that what I was writing now
wasn't anything they would want

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.840
to publish.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.200
And, they would insist that
they would like to see it.

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:31.400
And, if it was someone I knew,
I would send a few poems.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:36.160
And, I was quite surprised that
not only did they want those

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:37.460
but sometimes they'd ask for more.

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:40.550
And, I'd never had that experience.

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:44.660 position:56%
And, I thought how could these
poems mean something to someone else

01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:46.860
because they're so personal?

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.750
They, it perplexed me.

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:53.840
But, when people received
them then they were talking

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.350
about how much they meant to them.

01:05:56.350 --> 01:06:00.180
And so, it wasn't until a
few years later, I think,

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:05.510
I totally understood what the book
means to people or how they read it

01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:08.020
because it was just confusing.

01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:14.470
It would be, I don't know I
can't find a metaphor for.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Emotionally
confusing.

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:17.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah.

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:20.930
To say it, I love that poem.

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:22.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:23.530
That is odd.

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:24.830
Isn't it?

01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:26.130
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yeah.

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:27.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I was think
as I read this the poem,

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:28.730
the book was quite
celebrated, you won a big prize.

01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:33.640 position:56%
That must have been just disoriented
for you to be celebrated,

01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:36.640
to receive praise, to
go to awards ceremonies

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.030
about this horrible event.

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:43.860
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, the last
thing was, that I began to feel,

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:50.470
excuse me, I began to feel
like we were doing it together,

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:56.860
my son and I, and this was a
way to continue being together.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:01.850
And, I knew how [inaudible] was
with me as a poet, he kept my books

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:07.500
on his desk and would loan
them to his coworkers.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:12.870
And he always celebrated
whatever prizes I had.

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:17.750
And so, I knew he'd be very
proud that we were doing this.

01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:28.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And in another
poem you write, now she is sickened

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.740
by the essence of recollection.

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.150
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Essence of what?

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:33.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Recollection.

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:37.130
Now she is sickened by the
essence of recollection.

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:42.580
In another you write memory is
deeply not alive, it is a mock up

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:44.150
and this renders it hateful.

01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:51.470 position:56%
This is the language you used to
talk about this strange both healing

01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:56.240
and agonizing process of elegy.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.540
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Right.

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:00.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's these
always desperately haunting sad

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.580
images here.

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:04.100
You write in one poem,
it's as if the windows

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:07.620 position:56%
of night have been sewn to her eyes.

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:12.660
Then there's this shocking
element of surprise

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:15.940
that runs through the poem.

01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:20.830
In the vacancy the
world went on revolving.

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:25.550
How could life go on
when this has happened?

01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:28.390
I'm sorry.

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:30.840
He still looked like
he was, but he wasn't.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.810
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Right.

01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:35.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How
can I be and you not?

01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:40.560
You're constantly surprised
again and again.

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Well, I think that,

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:47.550
I think that [inaudible]
something about writing poetry.

01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:58.180 position:56%
And, I think that, because I was
honest about my feelings and I think

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:08.510
that it forever, it somehow
made me more confident in terms

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:11.740
of putting subject
to the inner poem.

01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:16.720
And, I think that that's been
very useful to me in sessions,

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:22.130
not useful in terms of getting
the fame for doing that,

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:26.340
but useful in terms of
satisfying my own desire,

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:30.380
realizing my ambition
toward a particular poem.

01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:34.940
So that, I'm allowing
myself to be more earnest.

01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:38.080
I'm still wearing a costume, but,

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.940
the actress can speak
a little more directly.

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:47.060
So, I think, that's, when you asked
me to read some of these poems

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:49.980
that enact the complexity
of my thoughts.

01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:51.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.250
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: I think
I've found, since then,

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:58.170
ways to be a little more
direct about the subjectivity.

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would you read
the poem you mentioned the Rule

01:10:00.490 --> 01:10:01.790
of Elegy?

01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:04.090
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:11.560 position:56%
I just want to add, because, my fear
has always been that I didn't want

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:15.310
to be reductive about
complicated things.

01:10:15.310 --> 01:10:20.290
So, I think I tried to
complicate the language in order

01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:24.240 position:56%
to communicate complicated thoughts.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.240
But, I think that there are other
ways or I think I've achieved ways

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.600
of talking about complicated
thoughts

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:35.010
with a little more direction.

01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:39.910
And, I think that the
gravity I was wanting

01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:44.160
in the poems is more apparent
in the more recent work,

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.430
like the Last Two Seconds.

01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:49.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:50.570
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Most recent work.

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:54.290
And, the book coming after that
which has already been finished.

01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:56.500
The Role of the Elegy.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:00.330
The role of the elegy
is to put a death mask

01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:03.540
on tragedy, A drape on the mirror.

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:08.730
To bow to the cultural Debate over
the anesthetization of sorrow,

01:11:08.730 --> 01:11:13.610
Of loss, of the unbearable
Afterimage of the once material.

01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:17.130
To look for an imagined
Consolidation of grief

01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:22.000
So we can all be finished Once
and for all and genuinely shut

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.600
up The cabinet of genuine
particulars.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.280
Instead there's the endless refrain
One hears replayed repeatedly

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.550
Through the just ajar door: Some
terrible mistake has been made.

01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:38.920
What is elegy but the
attempt to rebreathe life

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:43.970
into what the gone one once
was Before he grew to enormity.

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:47.300
Come on stage and be yourself,
the elegist says to the dead.

01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:52.010
Show them Now after the fact
What you were meant to be:

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:54.310
The performer of a live song.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.540
A shoe. Now bow.

01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:00.400
What is left but this:
The compulsion to tell.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.560
The transient distraction
of ink on cloth One scrubbed

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.540 position:56%
and scrubbed but couldn't make less.

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:10.150
Not then, not soon.

01:12:10.150 --> 01:12:11.610
Each day, a new caption

01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:15.280
on the cartoon Ending
that simply cannot be.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.510
One hears repeatedly,
the role of elegy is.

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:26.870
[ Applause ]

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:28.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: What's so
remarkable about that poem is

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:31.840
that it's an elegy
and it deconstructs

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.610
and elegy at the same moment.

01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:36.870 position:56%
It critiques it in a very aggressive
way, sometimes in a very bitter way

01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:46.400
as though you're enacting an elegy
and realizing how inadequate it is.

01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:49.970
Yes.

01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:52.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: And voice,
giving voice to the suspicion

01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:59.860
of why one is doing this and how
one is using the particulars.

01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:04.820
The anxiety over doing that.

01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:07.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:11.770
In one of your earliest poems
you wrote loss is now what you

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:15.000
live with.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:20.090
This is years, years ago.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:26.550
Does it get easier?

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:28.240
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Never.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:32.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: No I think, I mean,

01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:38.360
wisdom is the advantage
of aging, right.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:39.660
So, it's like.

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:40.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.260
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: So, it's
like, and I think it's true.

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:46.450
I think that one, having thought
about things one's whole live,

01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:54.690
one's able to find
ways to conceptualize

01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:57.790
like struggle, grief,
all those things.

01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:03.730
And, I think that's
useful to the self.

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:05.030
Yeah.

01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:07.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's a poem
in here called Gone that begins

01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:12.300
with the lines the ordeal
comes to its periodic end,

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.650
which usually means
the ahead is again.

01:14:17.930 --> 01:14:21.680
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: That was one
of the last poems in the Elegy

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.460
because I gave myself a year.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.910
I, realized that there
were then poets who,

01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:33.050 position:56%
they felt like they made a commodity
of a tragedy that they experienced.

01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:40.910
And, I often felt that it's
hard to maintain, as a reader,

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:44.220
my interest in their exploration

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:48.770
of that personal tragedy
past a certain point.

01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:54.830
But, to them, they
clearly have age in them.

01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:58.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And so,
I felt that I didn't want

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.090
to create six more books
about this particular death.

01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:04.860
I didn't think it was
good for poetry.

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.290
I didn't think it was good for me.

01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:10.210
And so, I gave myself a year.

01:15:10.210 --> 01:15:14.670
And I decided that at the end of
that year, I would never write

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:17.340
about this subject again.

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:22.890
Now, of course, I write
about my feelings about.

01:15:22.890 --> 01:15:24.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:25.490
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: This.

01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:26.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:28.090
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: This
particular [inaudible].

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:30.410
But, I don't pronounce it as such.

01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:35.330
And so, at the end of the year,
I think I was also rather stunned

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:40.630
by the fact that there had been
no resolution to those feelings.

01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:46.150
That, we think of a year as being
a long time, and, in some settings,

01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:49.120
it's not at all long,
it's an eye blink.

01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:55.010
And so, I realized that I had
given myself arbitrarily a year

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:57.550
because a year's a
quantity it's a measurement.

01:15:57.550 --> 01:15:58.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:02.030
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: But, at the end
of that year, nothing had changed.

01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:06.010
And so, there was that
sense of that,

01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:10.890
it just continuous
[inaudible] or the speaker.

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:12.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:16.990
To end with a poem
from your latest book.

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:21.170
Will you choose, you
choose, because I've used up,

01:16:21.170 --> 01:16:23.940
I've used up too much of our time.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:25.240
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Okay.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
don't have to pick one

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:27.840
on Mark although I like those.

01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:33.090
I like many of them.

01:16:34.730 --> 01:16:36.030
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Okay.

01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:39.000
Well I'll do this one
and you did choose it.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.120
A Structure of Repeating Units.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.070
A lamp is a great gift, I think.

01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:49.560
The brass tack ouch of a hand
to a hot bulb takes you straight

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.800
to the top of the threshold
of feeling.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.250
A small plastic object held to
the cheek is also quite nice.

01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:00.990
I love poly socks,
dishtowels with rick-rack,

01:17:00.990 --> 01:17:05.040
a surfboard anointed
with one aqua stripe.

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:09.060
Idle want seems to dog me along
a long cord that's plugged

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.860
into the boot in the mouth
of the near recent past.

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:16.350
The plastic, we both know,
is nothing but a patchwork

01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:22.980
of particles, a mash-up of atoms,
petroleum before or after its oil

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.720
but still, it means so much more.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.020
Something finer than fine.

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:30.060
Like pearls bred from
time and insouciance.

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:34.960
Or something like that.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.100
I turn out the light,
lock the door, lie down,

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.950
brush my hair from my forehead,
and listen for the cinematographer

01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:46.740
to say to the dark, just wait
and the world will come back.

01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:49.770
The terror I have, I keep hidden.

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:53.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Good stuff.

01:17:53.600 --> 01:18:00.030
[ Applause ]

01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:02.750
I love the way that poem creates
metaphors and turns things

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:06.200
into metaphors and makes us
realize that things are metaphors.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:07.500
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Yes.

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Things are plastic.

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:11.330
You've been extremely
generous and brilliant tonight.

01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:12.660
I'm so glad you came.

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:13.960
Thank you very, very much.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.260
&gt;&gt; Mary Jo Bang: Thank
you Ron Charles.

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.560
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank all of you.
