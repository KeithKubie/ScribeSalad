00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
Ohohohohoh!!

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.420
It actually worked! Hey, what's up guys, welcome back

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.940
I need to start off this video today by telling you a little story about when my wife and I were camping with our kids

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.150
In the woods. Now apparently we had enough reception because I got a notification that my friend Mark Rober

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.559
Posted a video on the worlds largest Super Soaker. So I went over to check out his video

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.060
And it absolutely blew my mind. Not only did he make a monster Super Soaker,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.939
He made one that actually works. But that's not even the funny part.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.979
I literally laughed out loud when he said he put links in the description for anyone who wanted to try making something similar.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.540
"I'll put a link to the CAD files we made along with a build list of all of the components we used in the video

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.719
description if you want to make something similar. if you want to make something similar.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.760
(Slowed down) If you want to make something similar." Who in their right mind would actually make one?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.680
Well, we did!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.700
[Music]

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.460
Welcome to the "Nitro Pressure Random Blaster 5000". This thing is over 4 feet tall, 7 feet long, and slings water at 2,400 PSI.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.350
Rather than taking six months to build, we were able to put it together in six days.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.710
Let me show you some of its features.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.169
We made the handle grips for the gun out of diamond plated floor matting, the rest is built out of foam, all hand-carved foam,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.599
Painted with house paint and then sprayed with black and yellow paint to match the King of Random colors. The trigger

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.190
Here is mainly for decoration, the button

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.559
That actually shoots the water is right up top here, and when you press that it shoots out a burst at 2400 PSI.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.549
That's a lot of pressure.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.699
It's like explosive pressure. Piggybacking off Mark's design we use a pressure washer nozzle, so we could get a long thin stream

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.570
That would last longer, or you can change out the nozzle to something wider that dumps all the water very quickly,

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.470
Making it a true Super Soaker.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.149
The Barrel is just made of a cardboard tube filled with great stuff and one-inch PVC

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.279
Where we can run the pressure washer line to the end.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.169
We did a little quick graphic design and we used a vinyl cutter to make the King of Random super logo as well as the

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.030
"Nitro Pressure Random Blaster 5000" on the side here which I think looks really cool, and down here

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.830
We did our best to imitate the original Super Soaker,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.830
but changing the name to "Random Corp.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.869
2017". The water system on the inside functions on the same

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.070
Principles as Mark's design we have two oxygen tanks, one that's filled with High-pressure nitrogen,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.120
and the other that's filled with water. The

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.899
Only difference is rather than using a regulator and an actuator to get the stream water flowing we found a little device that does it

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.600
All for us. That makes everything a little more simple, a little more compact.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.130
One of the things that surprised us when we went to build this is the instructions that we're posted in the description

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.820
Weren't actually very clear. So really, we just referenced the videos, used some artistic and creative license, and tried to replicate it as best

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.049
We could. Now theoretically we could have built this bigger, and made THE world's largest Super Soaker,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.329
But instead we decided to build ours an inch smaller than mark so he could still retain the world record however

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.530
We did make the tank a little bit bigger

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.630
So it'll hold more water this thing is already locked loaded and ready to fire watch. What happens when I pull the trigger

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.599
or press up on the trigger as the case may be

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.040
We should water the plant

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.160
Ohh.. Rainbow

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.400
Rainbow maker that's cool

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.269
And not only that we actually made a little tripod stand to set it down on

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.319
So we have to hold it all day because this thing is heavy as we were putting this thing together

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.719
I went back and watched Marc's video and he tried shooting things like watermelons Hotdogs soda cans things of that nature to

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.059
Demonstrate the power of the water shooting up the nozzle so we went down to the store and picked up the same items ourselves

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.699
So we can put them to the test and see how our results compare

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.080
Alright now that you've seen our super Soaker king of random style. Let's pressure it up and see what it can do

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.940
Click Connect

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.800
All right next up High-powered watermelon blast

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.620
(Laughing) We need something to back that

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.200
We got watermelon guts everywhere looking at that tube. All right next up soda can

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.260
Just blew that right over. Soda can is going down.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.500
Oh, It got me!

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.660
Oh, it got me good!

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:45.900
Wow, that was awesome!

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.750
You see the way it took out those soda cans like I had to place it on that one for like maybe two seconds then

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.919
It ruptured all over my face

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.780
You can see the remnants on my glasses right now

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.289
So I went for the second can it explode as well the third can exploded we still had enough water pressure

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.679
To slice halfway through a watermelon that was pretty cool

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.640
Okay, we'll do the hotdogs next then

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.660
(Laughing)

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.740
It actually worked. It sliced in ice every single one of them, did you see that?
It like rolled out of my hand in privity

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.950
That is incredible

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.520
I literally dropped those from like one inch high

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.440
and they went through the beam which was apparently so strong it just ripped them all in half.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.319
So yeah, hot dogs big win that was a lot of fun all at one and

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.220
They smell delicious. I think I'm going to take these home and cook them up for dinner because

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.179
Those are amazing the stuff still looks half edible

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.650
It's a really interesting texture on the top where it was cut it almost tastes like it's burned

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.809
If it's possible, but it tastes really good inside

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.110
So there you have a guy's based on this set of experiments

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.000
I'd say the Random Blaster 5000

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.080
has proven itself to be a major player by the way if you want to go check out Mark's original video.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.800
I will put his link down in the description you go say hi, and tell him Grant sent you

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.639
We shot watermelons blasted through the Ryan's we punctured soda cans

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.460
And we chopped hot dogs clean in half and now that Mark Rober and I both have two of the world's largest water guns

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.920
What do you guys think we should do with them post your comments and suggestions down below?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.920
Hey, thanks for joining me for this video. I'll be looking for you in the next one. Talk to you then.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.670
My sweat tastes like root beer

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.469
Hey guys, this was a huge team effort. I certainly did not make this by myself

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:37.239
I had a lot of people working in the background to make this project possible first of all I want to say thank you to

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.020
Nate he was the guy who actually put all the foam together and made this look as good as it did

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:46.869
Ben Watkins helped collect all the materials for the inside the pressure tanks the pressure hoses and made that possible and a big shout out

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.340
To my friends at Kuma films who came by with their phantom and provided some of those super slow-motion shots

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.860
You can check out Kuma films in the description below

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.990
