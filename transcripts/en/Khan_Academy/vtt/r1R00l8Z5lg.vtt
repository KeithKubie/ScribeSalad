00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.790
- [Instructor] We're told
that David hosts a podcast

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.580
and he is curious how much
his listeners like his show.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.470
He decides to start with an online poll.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.873
He asks his listeners to visit his website

00:00:08.873 --> 00:00:10.393
and participate in the poll.

00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:14.511
The poll shows that 89% of
about 200 respondents "love"

00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:15.534
his show.

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:19.725
What is the most concerning
source of bias in this scenario?

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:21.723
And well, like always,
pause this video and see

00:00:21.723 --> 00:00:23.358
if you can figure it out on your own

00:00:23.358 --> 00:00:25.109
and then we'll work through it together.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.295
Let's think about what's going on.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:28.845
He has this population
of listeners, right?

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:31.409
I'll assume that the number
of listeners is more than 200.

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:33.956
And he says, "Hey I want to find a sample,

00:00:33.956 --> 00:00:36.679
"and I can't ask all of my listeners."

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.076
Who knows, maybe he has 10,000 listeners,

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:39.983
they don't tell us that, but let's say

00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:41.244
there's 10,000 listeners here.

00:00:41.244 --> 00:00:42.427
And he says, "Well I
want to get an indication

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:44.196
"of what percentage like my show.

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:46.031
"So I need a sample."

00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:48.115
But instead of taking
a truly random sample,

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:50.235
he asks them to volunteer.

00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:52.593
He asks his listeners
to visit his website.

00:00:52.593 --> 00:00:56.073
So that's classic volunteer
response sampling.

00:00:56.073 --> 00:00:58.610
This is not random because who decides

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.556
to go to his website and
listen to what he just said,

00:01:00.556 --> 00:01:02.257
and maybe even has access to a computer.

00:01:02.257 --> 00:01:03.663
That's not random.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.219
In fact, the people
more likely to do that,

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.965
so these are the people out of the 10,000,

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:12.929
these are the 200 responders
here who decided to do it.

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:16.272
These are more likely to be
the people who already like

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:18.493
David or like to listen to
what he tells them to do.

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:21.312
The people, the listeners
who are not into David

00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:25.062
or don't want to do what
he tells them to do,

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:29.057
they're unlikely to say, "Oh,
I'm not really into David

00:01:29.057 --> 00:01:30.781
"and I don't like him
telling me what to do,

00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:32.050
"but hey, I'm gonna go
to his website anyway,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.186
"I'm gonna fill out that poll."

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:34.545
That's less likely.

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:36.351
Or you might get extremes,
people who really don't like him,

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:37.927
might say, "I'm gonna
definitely go there."

00:01:37.927 --> 00:01:40.354
But in this case, I would
say that it's more likely

00:01:40.354 --> 00:01:42.641
your fans are gonna do
what you ask them to do

00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:45.911
and go to your website and
spend time on your website.

00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:50.078
And because of that, that 89%
is probably an overestimate.

00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:54.976
89% is probably an overestimate
of the number of listeners

00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:57.059
who really love his show.

00:01:57.955 --> 00:01:59.955
Cause you're more likely to
get the ones who love him

00:01:59.955 --> 00:02:02.182
to show up and fill
out that actual survey.

00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:04.115
Now these other forms of bias.

00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:06.853
Response bias, this is when
you're asking something

00:02:06.853 --> 00:02:09.340
that people don't necessarily
want to answer truthfully,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.752
or the way that it's phrased,
it might make someone

00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:15.833
respond, you see, in a biased way.

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:17.874
Classic examples of this are like,

00:02:17.874 --> 00:02:22.195
"Have you lied to your
parents in the past week?"

00:02:22.195 --> 00:02:25.695
Or "have you ever cheated on your spouse."

00:02:27.193 --> 00:02:28.858
Something, "do you smoke?"

00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:30.943
Any of these things that
people might not want

00:02:30.943 --> 00:02:33.313
to answer completely truthfully
or they might be hiding

00:02:33.313 --> 00:02:34.965
from the world, they might
not just want to answer

00:02:34.965 --> 00:02:36.417
that truthfully on a survey.

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:38.372
And so you're going to have response bias.

00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:40.535
But that's not the case right over here.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:43.800
And undercoverage is when
the way that you're sampling,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.181
you're definitely missing out
on an important constituency.

00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:49.590
Voluntary response
we're likely missing out

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.903
on some important
constituencies, on some people

00:02:51.903 --> 00:02:53.473
who might not be into
going to your website,

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:56.016
but undercoverage is where
it's a little bit more clear

00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:57.631
that that is happening.

00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:59.830
Let's do another case,
let's do another case,

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.124
maybe an alternate reality
where David's trying

00:03:02.124 --> 00:03:04.370
to figure this out again,
he's still hosting a podcast,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.124
he's still curious how much
his listeners like his show,

00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:09.266
but he tries to take a different sample.

00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:12.698
He decides in this case, to
poll the next 100 listeners

00:03:12.698 --> 00:03:15.198
who send him fan emails.

00:03:15.198 --> 00:03:17.889
They don't all respond, but 94 out

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.037
of the 97 listeners polled
said they "loved his show."

00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:24.041
What is the most concerning
source of bias in this scenario?

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.193
Well this is a classic,
"Hey I have a group,

00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:28.971
"I have a sample sitting in front of me,

00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:30.805
"it's in my inbox in my email,
let me just go to them."

00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:32.624
Isn't that convenient?

00:03:32.624 --> 00:03:35.222
So this is classic convenience sample.

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:36.689
And this isn't just like,

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.136
hey, these are the first 100
people to walk through the door

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.629
and there's, a lot of times you can argue

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.078
why that might be not so random,

00:03:43.078 --> 00:03:45.864
but these're the next 100
listeners who sent him fan emails.

00:03:45.864 --> 00:03:47.701
(laughing)

00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:49.851
So this is convenience
sampling and the sample

00:03:49.851 --> 00:03:52.381
that you happen to use out of convenience

00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:55.399
is one that's going to be
very skewed to liking you.

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.861
So once again, this is overestimating,

00:03:57.861 --> 00:04:00.368
overestimating the percent,

00:04:00.368 --> 00:04:02.951
the percent that love his show.

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:07.318
Now nonresponse is when you
ask a certain number of people

00:04:07.318 --> 00:04:10.767
to fill out a survey or
to answer a questionnaire,

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:14.379
and for some reason, some
percent do not fill it out.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:15.688
And you're like, "Wow,
who are those people?

00:04:15.688 --> 00:04:17.017
"Maybe they would have
said something important

00:04:17.017 --> 00:04:18.425
"and maybe their viewpoint

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:20.361
"is not properly represented
in the overall number

00:04:20.361 --> 00:04:22.616
"that actually did fill it out."

00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:24.845
And there is some
nonresponse going on here.

00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:28.411
He asks 100 people who
sent fan emails to fill out

00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:31.338
the survey to say whether
they love it or not,

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:33.318
97 fill it out.

00:04:33.318 --> 00:04:36.195
So there are three people who
did not fill out the survey.

00:04:36.195 --> 00:04:38.092
So there is some nonresponse going on

00:04:38.092 --> 00:04:39.984
that would be a source of bias,

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:41.581
but it's not the most concerning.

00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:43.305
Right over here they're
asking us, fill out

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:46.823
the most concerning source of bias,

00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:48.704
and the convenience sampling is definitely

00:04:48.704 --> 00:04:49.863
the biggest deal here.

00:04:49.863 --> 00:04:51.311
There were three people
who didn't respond,

00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:52.697
but that's not as big of a deal.

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:54.930
Voluntary response sampling.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.855
Well, he didn't ask people,
like in the last example,

00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:03.355
"Hey, if you can go here and fill it out?"

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:07.332
I guess, I take that back,
there is a little bit

00:05:07.332 --> 00:05:08.897
of voluntary response here,

00:05:08.897 --> 00:05:11.468
where he goes to these 100 people

00:05:11.468 --> 00:05:13.909
and he asks them to respond.

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.052
And so you have the 97
people who chose to respond.

00:05:18.052 --> 00:05:21.986
But once again, that
could be a source of bias,

00:05:21.986 --> 00:05:23.907
but most of the 97 of
the 100 are responding,

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.883
and once again, the most concerning thing

00:05:25.883 --> 00:05:28.189
is the convenience sampling,
which will once again,

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.539
based on this sample that
he's happening to use

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.794
out of convenience, is going to be a very,

00:05:33.794 --> 00:05:36.531
a significant overestimate in terms of

00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:40.698
representing the entire
population of his listeners.
