00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.880
Hey guys, Backyard Scientist here. I've come up with a fun new game.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.800
I like to call it, "Don't try this at home".

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.440
It's simple. Just set up a string of lighters in a circle so each flame is below the next one.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.960
The flames will eventually melt through the plastic, causing a small explosion.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.560
In order to win the game you just need to choose the first color to explode.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.960
You can play too. Go down to the comments section and tell me what color you think's going to explode first.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.640
What do you choose?
: Blue

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.320
: I choose yellow.
: You can't choose yellow! There's two yellows.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.920
Whoo! &lt;exclamation&gt;
Oh no! &lt;laughter&gt; Whoo!

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.000
&lt;laughter&gt;

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.140
&lt;hiss&gt;
Whuh

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.920
No, wha, that was yellow &lt;hiss&gt; but it didn't explode.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.780
That was...

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.280
&lt;explosion&gt;
WHAAAOOO!

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.480
Wha hooo!

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.560
: That one exploded.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.740
Technically yellow was the first one to explode, but the fireball came from green.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.440
: This is definitely not an indoor game.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.520
: I agree.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.520
: &lt;clap&gt; Let's play again.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.660
: Alriiight

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.100
So I asked a bunch of people on my Facebook page what they thought would happen...

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100
...and if you got the right answer, congratulations.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.380
Some people thought the order that I lit them would matter and it turns out it did matter.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.780
The first lighter I lit was actually the last one to explode 'cause it was the last one to have flame touching it.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.420
I'm going to eliminate that variable because I've built a device that triggers all the flames automatically with electricity.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.080
Right, I wanted to make a simple, easy, stupid video then you gotta go and throw this science... in it....

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.280
: Science in it. Thanks a lot guys. Now I have to work.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.100
Let's get started.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.160
&lt;loud buzz&gt;

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.100
&lt;small buzz&gt;

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.260
Alright

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.060
&lt;clap&gt;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.100
&lt;hiss&gt;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.300
&lt;hiss&gt; &lt;woof&gt;

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.420
Whoo hooo!

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.160
&lt;hiss&gt; &lt;woof&gt;

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.760
&lt;woof&gt;

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.140
&lt;blowing&gt;

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.660
: Well that one had a few fireballs.
: Yeah.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.580
: That one had more.
: That one got... that was more intense.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.100
Uh, uh, there it goes.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.760
&lt;hiss&gt;

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.700
Oooo

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.080
&lt;hiss&gt;

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.720
Nope!

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.700
&lt;hiss&gt; &lt;hiss&gt; &lt;whoosh&gt; &lt;whoosh&gt; &lt;whoosh&gt;

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.860
Whaaaaa!

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.180
Let's see if they've got any juice left in 'em.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.460
&lt;buzz&gt;

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.520
: Yeah

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.280
There's gonna have drippy melted glass like...
&lt;click&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.980
&lt;blow&gt; &lt;laughter&gt;

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.520
&lt;cough&gt;

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.800
Alright, if your parents haven't blocked my channel yet, don't let them see the next part of the video.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.000
I've made an expansion pack for the game that's got five big lighters instead of the smaller ones.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.640
It's fun for the whole family and it's a great time to cash in on your homeowner's insurance.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.620
But on second thought, maybe I should take this outside.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
&lt;click&gt;

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.760
&lt;background&gt; Well I guess not all the...

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.640
&lt;hisss&gt;

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.680
The explosions weren't as big as I thought, and I guess that's because these big lighters only hold a small amount of fuel concealed in a big package.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.800
Oh well, I've got one more trick up my sleeve.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.020
Alright, let me show you one more cool trick.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.420
So now you have all these lighters left over and nothing to do with them. But...

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.300
There's a cool little trick you can do.
If you take off this metal case...

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.440
...and then remove this wheel...

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.640
...there should be a little flint inside like this and a spring.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.840
So take out the flint. Take out the spring.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.800
And then untwist the spring a little bit so it looks like that.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.660
Take the flint... and... wrap it up like that.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.240
Alright so heat up the flint till it's red hot with the lighter and I'm gonna throw it on the ground. Check it out.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.020
&lt;hiss&gt; &lt;crackle&gt;

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.580
Alright guys, that's it for this video.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.300
If you want to keep watching, go check out that styrofoam rocket plane video

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.600
It's super fun - most fun I've had making a video, probably.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.400
You can also follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter so you can be a part of any other polls I have...

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.780
...and it's a great way to reach me if you have a comment.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.280
Please, I get so many on my YouTube channel it's hard to see everybody.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.280
Alright, see ya. Bye.
