00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.940
The late 1800s and early 1900s saw a revolution
in the very basics of what-is-stuff.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.900
This story features killer rays and a family
of geniuses: it’s the discovery of radioactivity,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.810
the birth of particle physics, and the life
and enduring legacy of Marie Skłodowska Curie.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.570
Now, Nobel Prizes—which started being given
out in Marie’s time—aren’t everything.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.960
But she was the first woman to win one, the
first person to win two of them, the only

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.850
woman and one of only four people to win in
two different fields…

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.900
And she remains the only person, ever, to
win Nobels in multiple natural sciences.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:49.360
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.940
Before we get to Marie, let’s review physics

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.920
so far.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.960
Scientists around the world had worked out
the physics of Newton’s universe—in which

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.929
large, visible stuff collides due to the invisible
but lawlike action of gravity—as well as

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.400
the strange world of thermodynamics and electromagnetism.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.820
Heat is energy!

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.230
Radio waves can carry signals around the world!

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.550
All weird—and about to get weirder.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.690
In 1895, German engineer Wilhelm Röntgen

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.400
was experimenting with making
cathode rays, or rays of electrons.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.760
His device was blacked out.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.060
But he noticed that a piece of cardboard painted
with barium platinocyanide fluoresced, or

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.140
glowed, when it was placed near the cathode
ray tube.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.000
This made no sense.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.460
No light meant no glowing… and yet, my dude’s
cardboard glowed.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.970
So Röntgen set up another experiment.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.460
He blacked out the machine, turned the lab’s
lights out…

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.100
And saw that the painted board was already
glowing in the dark.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.470
Faintly, sure, but glowing.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.530
The machine wasn’t on.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.070
No known source of energy could have been
producing that spooky light.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.290
So Röntgen threw himself into investigating
what he called “spooky rays” after his

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.810
friend, Count Fritz von Spooky.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.090
I'm kidding, he called them X-rays, after the letter
mathematicians use to symbolize unknown variables.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.000
And this phenomenon got spookier when, testing
the rays on different materials and arriving

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.560
at lead, Röntgen saw a projection of his
own skeleton!

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.620
So he experimented with creating images of
what he was seeing, and at this point made

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.080
the now-typical scientist move: he asked his
wife for help.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.920
Because the couple that sciences together,
stays together!

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.600
So Anna Bertha Röntgen let her husband make
an image of the bones in her hand using X-rays.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.760
And then Röntgen wrote up his experiments
in a paper called, wait for it, “On a New

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.950
Kind of Rays.”

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.770
This paper earned him an honorary medical
doctorate, the very first Nobel Prize in Physics,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.981
in 1901, and a place in the hall of fame of
radiology—or using radiation to see the

00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:52.190
inside of the body.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.910
In fact, in his day, X-rays were sometimes
called “Röntgen rays.”

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.870
In early 1896, at the Academie des sciences,
French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel heard

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.650
about the discovery of X-rays.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.370
Becquerel had been experimenting on phosphorescence,
or hitting materials with light to make them

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.370
glow new colors.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.130
He reasoned that maybe some phosphorescence
was related to Röntgen’s X-rays.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.220
So he busted out his inherited supply of his
father’s uranium—yes! seriously, this was a thing.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.220
Thanks, Dad!

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.280
Becquerel soon realized using photography
that some materials naturally gave off spooky

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.280
rays.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.990
Like, uranium left an impression in a photographic
plate just by being near it.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.790
Some sort of energy was hitting the plate.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.490
This was radiation: energy that comes out
of matter as it decays, or breaks down into

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.700
other, smaller forms of matter.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.590
Curie would later name this process of decay
“radioactivity.”

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.760
Becquerel dove into research on radioactivity.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.430
He figured out that uranium emits rays that
can be deflected,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.090
or pushed around, by electromagnetism, so
they’re a different form of radiation from

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.530
X-rays, which are not affected by electromagnetism
at all.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.170
Becquerel also researched what happens when
you mix radiation and magnetic fields, showing

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.180
that radiation can have electrically negative,
positive, or neutral charge.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.799
And he did important work on electrons, which
we’ll get to next time.

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.079
Becquerel’s contributions to radiation studies
were wide ranging, from basics to potential

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.079
applications.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:28.110
When he accidentally burned himself by carrying
around a piece of radium, he and other researchers

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.430
concluded that radioactive substances might
be able to burn bad stuff like tumors,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.539
so they might have a medical use in fighting
cancer.

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.139
This continued the tradition of using radiation
as a medical technique that Röntgen had started

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.960
and the Curies would build on.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.520
Becquerel died in 1908, likely due to his
work with radioactive substances.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.819
He was only 55.

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.330
He left behind a clear research question:
what happens when matter radiates spooky energy?

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.259
Enter Maria Curie, born Marie Skłodowska in Warsaw, at
the time part of the Russian Empire.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.530
Born—to science.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.050
But the Russians outlawed lab science in schools,
and the University of Warsaw didn’t admit

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.050
women.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.830
So she went to a secret school called the
Flying University which is totally real and

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.259
you should Google.

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.509
Then in 1891, she joined her older sister,
Bronisława, in Paris.

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.699
They made a pact to help each other finish
degrees.

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.639
Marie smashed this goal.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:29.610
Despite not being great at French, and with
no formal training in the sciences, she enrolled

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.229
at the University of Paris, one of the best
schools on earth…

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:39.740
And earned a degree with distinction in physics—basically
a master’s—in 1893 and a second, in mathematics,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.740
in 1894.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.569
At first, she was super broke and hungry.

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.629
She tutored all night after her own classes,
and she was barely keeping up.

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.400
But then after her first degree, she was hired
to study the relationship between magnetism

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.759
and steel for the Society for the Encouragement
of National Industry.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.919
She needed a place to work, and in her search
for a lab, she met Pierre Curie, who taught

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.840
at the School of Physics and Chemistry.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.460
And they fell in love over SCIENCE!!!

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.919
Pierre proposed, but Marie was like, yeaaah,
I’m from Poland…

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.599
The place Germany and Russia have been fighting
over for a thousand years?

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:12.599
Cold!?

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:13.599
I’m moving back.

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.029
And you don’t want to do that, right?

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:18.960
But—plot twist—Pierre was like, anything
for you!

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.780
Even leaving La Belle Epoque Paris right as
modern art is being born.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.069
Marie said I’ll think about it.

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.759
On summer break, she returned to Poland and
went up for a job at the prestigious Jagiellonian

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.759
University of Kraków.

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.780
But the Jagiellonians were clear: they would
never grant a professorship to a woman, no

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.050
matter how brilliant.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.819
So Marie returned to Paris and started a Ph.D.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:46.449
She also made Pierre finally finish his own
Ph.D., and he was promoted.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.639
He admitted that Marie was “his biggest
discovery.”

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.160
Which is pretty sweet.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.650
Well, in 1895, they got hitched.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.240
It was a secular affair.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.870
Marie wore the same clothes she wore to the
lab.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.490
Marie found out about Röntgen’s and Becquerel’s
discoveries and, being trained in the study

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.399
of electromagnetism, formulated an experiment.

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:08.580
She used a sensitive electrometer, which measured
electric charge and was developed by Pierre

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.580
years earlier,

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.080
to test how ray-producing uranium affected
electromagnetic fields.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:19.619
She found that uranium gave off rays that
made the very air conduct electricity.

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:24.539
Her work also showed that the only thing that
mattered in terms of this effect was how much

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:26.150
uranium was present.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.150
That’s it.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.389
The uranium didn’t have to interact with
anything in order to give off energy and change

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.849
electromagnetic fields.

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:34.449
What happened next, ThoughtBubble?

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:39.669
Marie created, for the first time, a theory
of radioactivity: in some substances, atoms

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:44.189
themselves must be breaking down slowly, releasing
energy.

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:47.069
This theory became foundational for modern
physics.

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:52.229
From the Presocratic Atomists to the the creator
of the periodic table, Dmitri Mendeleev, a

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:58.259
long tradition of people studying stuff had
built upon an imaginary indivisible unit of

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:03.529
matter—the atom
—that a woman from Warsaw had just divided.

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:10.199
Radioactive decay clearly violated the immutability
of atoms, so atoms could be split.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:11.199
Intense foreshadowing!

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:15.670
Oh, and a lot of this work happened between
her marriage in 1895 and the birth of her

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.650
first daughter in 1897.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.770
And it happened in a shed.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:26.199
She scienced in an unventilated room, unaware
of the dangers of handling radioactive substances.

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:27.889
And when I say “she,” I mean it.

00:08:27.889 --> 00:08:31.772
She recorded her experiments and her ideas
separate from her belovèd husband’s.

00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:38.089
But they increasingly worked together as Pierre
realized that, smart as he was, she wore the

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:39.089
brain pants.

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:40.700
(Err, you know what I mean.)

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.230
Here are some highlights:
In 1898, she showed that thorium is radioactive,

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.149
around the same time as another scientist,
Carl Schmidt.

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:53.180
Also in 1898, Marie and Pierre discovered
the element polonium, naming it after her

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.529
oppressed homeland.

00:08:54.529 --> 00:09:00.080
Also in 1898—most famously—she isolated
the radioactive element radium out of uranium

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.080
ore.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.910
In fact, she developed techniques for isolating
radioactive isotopes, or forms of the same

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.550
element with different properties, which we
now know are due to different amounts of neutrons.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.120
The Curies shared a Nobel Prize with Becquerel
in 1903.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.500
Basically, for discovering that, while most
matter doesn’t decay quickly, some relatively

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.019
rare elements do.

00:09:21.019 --> 00:09:22.819
And Marie applied her theory.

00:09:22.819 --> 00:09:25.600
She used radioactive materials to treat cancer.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:30.620
Pierre had the idea of implanting small seeds
of radioactive material into tumors to shrink

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.620
them.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.699
And when the Great War broke out in 1914,
she set up mobile radiography units, meaning

00:09:35.699 --> 00:09:39.029
X-ray systems, to help field doctors treat
soldiers.

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:40.250
Thanks ThoughtBubble.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.529
Tragically, Marie died in 1934 of cancer.

00:09:43.529 --> 00:09:46.980
She literally gave her life to help others.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:51.649
And belatedly, in 1995, Marie Skłodowska
Curie—the first female professor at the

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:57.800
Sorbonne—became the first woman to be entombed
in Paris’s Panthéon, AKA Science Valhalla,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.050
for her own achievements.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:03.779
But Marie was not the only professional woman
scientist to succeed in the early 1900s.

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:08.319
Other notables include American chemist Alice
Ball, one of the first female chemistry professors

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:11.829
and one of the first professional African-American
women of science.

00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:16.920
She developed the best treatment for Hansen’s
disease, or leprosy, until World War II.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.519
Czech–American biochemist Gerty Cori worked
out the important cycle of how glycogen, a

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:26.870
form of sugar, breaks down in muscles into
lactic acid, and then is reformed as a source

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.870
of energy.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.720
This became known as the Cori cycle, and she
won the Nobel Prize for discovering it in

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.720
1947.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.949
Finally, the Curies’ daughter, Irène Joliot-Curie,
was an outstanding chemist who also won a

00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:38.949
Nobel!

00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:42.540
While Nobels aren’t the only or best way
to tell the story of the history of science,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.819
the fact that we could do whole episodes on
three different members of the Curie family

00:10:46.819 --> 00:10:48.060
is just.

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.060
Dang.
