1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,460
My kids always make fun
of me because I'm bald.

2
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:07,461
So my whole head is covered with sweat
and they come over my head like it's so

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:11,580
gross. And then how old are your kids?
The youngest ones are eight and 10.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,500
And you have, you have, uh,
how many? Three. I have three
daughters, all daughters,

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,790
22 year old, a 10 year old and an eight
year old. Live longer with daughters.

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,830
If you, if you, if you plot, uh,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,920
Dad's survival on the y axis and fraction
of female children on the x axis.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,710
A survival is slightly longer for men
who have higher fraction of daughters

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,180
because boys drive you to your fucking
grave cause they're so goddamn crazy.

10
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:38,640
There's lots of theories as to
why it happens. But I think,

11
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:41,760
and that is in fact one of them,
it's framed a bit more scientifically.

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,410
Well my basic theory, my 10 year old
is a maniac. My 10 year old daughters.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,120
And I would just imagine if she was a boy,

14
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:51,300
I'd be terrified that she knows
just lighting things on fire.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,520
Blowing up buildings. Yes. Yeah.
Boys are a problem. That can be,

16
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,860
I mean, I think, yeah, I mean, I
think, um, you know, I think it's, um,

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,290
I think, um, the, the, well,

18
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,930
I mean we could get onto the whole
gender issue. I'm not sure we want to,

19
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:14,880
but I think, um, boys are responsible.
Let's talk about chimpanzees. It's easier.

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,150
Okay.
Male chimps do most of the violence.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,650
About 95% of the violence and murders
are committed by male chimpanzees.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,360
And most of the victims are males.
And, um, you know, I think it's,

23
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,190
there's no doubt that,
um,

24
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,540
biology plays a very important role in
male proclivity to violence, for example.

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,380
Sure. So let's tear trouble. Yeah. So
boys can be a problem that way. And Yeah.

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,710
And I think the many ways in which a
society are of cultural traits that we

27
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:43,561
invent,

28
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:48,561
their purpose is to shape and
guide those tendencies to violence,

29
00:01:48,811 --> 00:01:51,870
to kind of mitigate them. So
we don't just need, again,

30
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:55,380
going back to the books or observe,
please do. We don't just need, uh,

31
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,950
we don't just use culture
for that purpose there.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,700
There's an argument in the book that we
humans have, have domesticated ourselves.

33
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:05,190
So if you look at,

34
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:10,370
if you compare a dogs to wolves and
domesticated cats to wild cats from which

35
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,594
they descended,

36
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,800
or a Guinea pigs to the wild Guinea
pigs from which they descended or,

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,000
or horses to, uh, to the wild horses to
which they send, if you, again and again,

38
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,310
you compare these couplets,
these pears,

39
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,580
you find that the domesticated version
of these animals that are much more

40
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:30,330
placid, much more peaceful, they
also tend to have floppy ears.

41
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,860
They have piebald for,

42
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,210
so Guinea pigs and dogs and cows
all have splotchy black, white,

43
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:40,440
and Brown for why is that? The animals
from which they evolved didn't have those,

44
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,870
the kind of splotchiness. So, uh,

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,960
and they become much more peaceful
if you compare human beings and,

46
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:51,780
but they had a, uh, the, those
animals were domesticated by humans.

47
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,040
Like I deliberately allowed
the reproduction of this
member of the litter and

48
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,040
not that member because this
member was, was, was nicer.

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,820
And so across time we evolve a more a
domesticated version of the ancestral

50
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:07,750
species. So we get, you know, we get
my miniature Dachsund from a wolf,

51
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:08,584
like the wound,

52
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,320
like the kind of things that were
photographed out in your studio here.

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,130
Crazy transition.
Uh,

54
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,290
now if you look at humans
and you compare us to, uh,

55
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,750
to the [inaudible],

56
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,130
to our ancestors or to other
primates for all the world,

57
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:30,700
it looks like we have been domesticated,
we are more peaceful and placid.

58
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,370
We have sex outside,
non reproductive sex is and other things.

59
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:36,990
So these domesticated
animals, we'll have sex, uh,

60
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,980
even when it's not time to
reproduce. Uh, we, uh, we, um,

61
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,790
uh, we, our tails, we
don't have tails anymore,

62
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:50,290
but our tails gets shortened or all
these features that we have, these,

63
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:54,270
these behavioral qualities and these
physical properties that we have are,

64
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,750
are we get a feminization of our faces.
Our jaws become smaller.

65
00:03:58,751 --> 00:03:59,561
Like if you look at,

66
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:04,180
you compare these domesticated animals
to their non domesticated ancestors,

67
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,250
the domestic version or less violence.

68
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,450
So we lose a lot of the traits
that physical and, and, uh, um,

69
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,520
psychological traits
associated with violence.

70
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,360
But there was no one that domesticated
us. So the theory is, the question is how,

71
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:20,170
how did that happen? And one of the
theories that's discussed in, in, uh,

72
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,680
in blueprint and that's advanced by
other scientists, this is not my work,

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,690
is that we self domesticated.

74
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,130
And that what happened over the centuries,
over the millennia,

75
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,080
over millions of years,

76
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,250
is that weaker individuals
into our groups.

77
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,470
When one individual became too autocratic
and too violent and too powerful,

78
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,050
they banded together and kill that guy.

79
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,480
And so over time we were killing the
more violent members of our species,

80
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,220
weeding out those people, and therefore
the gene pool changed across time.

81
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,960
And we self domesticated.

82
00:04:55,961 --> 00:05:00,961
We are more peaceful today than we
would have been because we domesticated

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,350
ourselves.

84
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,550
And this is one of the arguments that's
also made to help explain the origins of

85
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:09,010
goodness,
actually in the origins of cooperation.

86
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:13,240
Because that would take a few good people
to kill the bad person that's running

87
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,790
everything that's evil.
Correct. That's exactly right.

88
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,740
Recreational sex does occur in Bonobos,
which is really weird,

89
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:23,890
isn't it? Yeah. They're so
similar to regular chimps. Yes,

90
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:27,270
but they're not the same species.
They also have homosexual sex. Uh,

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,720
they use sex to make up, you
know, so, uh, it's, yeah,

92
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:36,580
they're very licentious a species.
That's exactly right. And, and, and,

93
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,950
and Bonobos are felt to be a self
domesticated chimpanzee. So the similar,

94
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,750
so bonobos are to chimps as uh,

95
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:47,980
as let's say dogs are to wolves and,
but there was the dogs.

96
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,650
We domesticated the Banabos
self domesticated is the theory.

97
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,240
Do they know why or how? Well,
the theory is that they did it.

98
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,790
Like we were saying by weeding out
the more of aggressive members it was,

99
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,230
what we know must have happened is that
the nicer guys must've been able to have

100
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,790
more offspring.

101
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,230
So the gene pool changed over time because
of the differential success of the,

102
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,640
of the, of the nicer guys. Now people have
looked at this even in human societies,

103
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,750
they've looked,
for instance,

104
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,400
there's a study I talk about in the book
of different pathways to reproductive

105
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:24,401
success amongst that Sumani which is a
group in Amazonia and other societies are

106
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,144
similar.

107
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,150
So you can either be like big and strong
or you can be charismatic and have

108
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:36,550
useful knowledge. And both ways.
You have more children. Mm.

109
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,280
Um, so there are these competing ways, uh,

110
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:43,940
in our species of enhancing
your reproductive fitness.

111
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,980
Are you aware of support
[inaudible] work with baboons?

112
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,780
[inaudible] that's a fascinating case,
right?

113
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:52,970
Because they were studying
baboons in Africa.

114
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:57,971
They would eat from human garbage and
a bunch of them got sick and died.

115
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,020
And it turns out that the most violent
and ruthless of them got sick and died.

116
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,220
And it changed the entire culture of the
baboons tribe. I don't know that story.

117
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,680
That's an interesting one.

118
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,440
Let's start grooming each other and being
kind to each other. Oh my God. Yeah.

119
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:15,830
That's a good example. But there was
an alleged dental, it was an accident,

120
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,560
an accident, and that it
lasted for generations. Yes.

121
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,180
And when he returned to study them, he
found that they were still this different,

122
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:27,050
kind of talked about this a little
bit. Yeah, I'm doing a shitty job.

123
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,910
I'm sure I'm explaining
it, but I'm, I'm, no,

124
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:32,930
I think you'll have the books fascinate.
Yeah. Work. Yes. He's very impressive.

125
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,310
And a, I know the, I, I'm, uh,
now that you're reminding me,

126
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,110
I'm a little familiar with
that particular study.

127
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:42,590
I didn't know that it started with
garbage, however, that at coincidentally,

128
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,880
x extermination of the more violent
members of the troop. Yes. Yeah.

129
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:50,600
So they were removed from the gene pool
and it changed the entire culture to the

130
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:55,601
point where generations later they were
still using this more peaceful ways.

131
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,770
Full. Yeah. Yeah. More kind. Well,
it didn't just change the culture.

132
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,270
It may have changed the culture,

133
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:05,120
but it appears were arguing
the two of changing gene pool,

134
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,780
second evolutionary pressure that's
been applied. So you have, you know,

135
00:08:08,781 --> 00:08:11,860
big dogs and small dogs.
You don't allow the big ones to reproduce.

136
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,510
You just reproduced the small ones.
You get small dogs in the end.
