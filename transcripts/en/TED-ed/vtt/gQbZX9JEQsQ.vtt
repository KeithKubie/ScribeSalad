00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:12.876
When Homer’s Iliad was first written 
down in the 8th century BCE,

00:00:12.876 --> 00:00:16.192
the story of the Trojan war 
was already an old one.

00:00:16.192 --> 00:00:17.799
From existing oral tradition,

00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:20.718
audiences knew the tales 
of the long siege,

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:23.427
the epic duels outside the city walls,

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:26.156
and the cunning trick 
that finally won the war.

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:29.672
In the end, the magnificent
city was burned to the ground,

00:00:29.672 --> 00:00:31.509
never to rise again.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.001
But had it ever existed?

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:39.153
By the time the field of archaeology 
began to take shape in the 19th century,

00:00:39.153 --> 00:00:43.273
many were skeptical,
considering the epic to be pure fiction,

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:47.084
a founding myth imagining 
a bygone heroic era.

00:00:47.084 --> 00:00:48.413
But some scholars believed

00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:51.887
that behind the superhuman feats 
and divine miracles

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.754
there must have been a grain 
of historical truth -

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.437
a war that was really fought,

00:00:56.437 --> 00:00:58.638
and a place where it happened.

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:01.187
Frank Calvert was one such believer.

00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:05.121
He had spent his youth traveling 
and learning about ancient civilizations

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:07.086
before accompanying his brother Frederick

00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:11.970
on a diplomatic mission to the northwest
Anatolian region of Çanakkale.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.993
It was here that Homer described 
the Greek encampment

00:01:14.993 --> 00:01:17.411
at the mouth of the Scamander river.

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.519
And it was here that fate brought Frank 
into contact

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:24.261
with a journalist and geologist 
named Charles Maclaren.

00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:26.289
Locals and travelers had long speculated

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.862
that Troy might’ve stood on one 
of the surrounding hilltops.

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:32.020
But Maclaren had been one of the first

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.694
to publish a detailed topographical 
study of the area.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:37.651
He believed he had found the site –

00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:41.050
a 32-meter mound known 
by the name Hisarlık,

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.806
derived from the Turkish word 
for “fortress.”

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:46.224
Soon after meeting with him in 1847,

00:01:46.224 --> 00:01:48.708
the Calverts bought 
2,000 acres of farmland

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.062
that included part of the hill.

00:01:51.062 --> 00:01:53.060
Before they could explore any further,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.949
the Crimean War broke out

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:58.712
and forestalled their archaeological 
ambitions for several years.

00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:00.382
After the war’s end,

00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:02.554
Frank Calvert began to survey the site,

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:05.628
but lacked the funds 
for a full excavation.

00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:07.984
This was where the wealthy 
German businessman

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:12.030
and amateur archaeologist 
Heinrich Schliemann came in.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.576
At Calvert’s invitation,

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:18.438
Schliemann visited the grounds in 1868, 
and decided to excavate.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:20.194
Eager to find the ancient city,

00:02:20.194 --> 00:02:24.116
Schliemann tore massive trenches 
all the way to the base of the hill.

00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:27.871
There, he uncovered a hoard 
of precious artifacts,

00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:28.603
jewelry,

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:29.414
and metalwork,

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:32.400
including two diadems 
and a copper shield.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.799
Schliemann took full credit 
for the discovery,

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.698
announcing that he had found Troy

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.949
and the treasure of its king Priam.

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:40.950
But the real treasure was elsewhere.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.277
When later archaeologists 
studied the site,

00:02:43.277 --> 00:02:47.705
they realized that the mound consisted 
of no less than nine cities,

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:50.399
each built atop the ruins of the last.

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:54.166
The layer Schliemann had uncovered 
dated back to the Mycenaean Age,

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:57.324
more than 1,000 years too early 
for Homer.

00:02:57.324 --> 00:02:59.813
But inside the mound was indeed evidence

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:02.809
for a city that had thrived 
during the Bronze Age,

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:03.994
with charred stone,

00:03:03.994 --> 00:03:05.575
broken arrowheads,

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:09.432
and damaged human skeletons 
suggesting a violent end.

00:03:09.432 --> 00:03:12.380
It was Troy VII, 
contained in the middle layers

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.176
and now ravaged for a second time 
by Schliemann’s careless excavation.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:20.814
The settlement, 
spanning some 200,000 square meters

00:03:20.814 --> 00:03:23.333
and home to as many as 10,000 people,

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:26.590
thrived until around 1180 BCE.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.682
Its position at the southern entrance 
of the Dardanelles strait

00:03:29.682 --> 00:03:34.095
would’ve made a formidable strategic 
location for both defense and trade.

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:38.362
Most importantly, there are the remains 
of a massive fortification wall –

00:03:38.362 --> 00:03:40.078
perhaps the very same one

00:03:40.078 --> 00:03:44.306
from which Priam and Hector 
once watched the Greeks approach.

00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:46.412
Of course, it’s difficult to be certain

00:03:46.412 --> 00:03:50.314
that these ruins are the true remains 
of ancient Troy,

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:51.771
and scholars still dispute

00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:55.432
whether the Trojan War 
as described by Homer ever happened.

00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:57.214
Yet the evidence is strong enough

00:03:57.214 --> 00:04:01.615
that UNESCO has labelled Hisarlık
the archeological site of Troy.

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:03.027
Regardless of its identity,

00:04:03.027 --> 00:04:04.680
thanks to persistence,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.755
a bit of faith,

00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:07.162
and a lot of research,

00:04:07.162 --> 00:04:10.229
archaeologists are bringing 
the long-buried secrets

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:12.909
of an ancient, lost city to light.
