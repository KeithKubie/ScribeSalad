00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This unit is about simplifying.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Why is simplifying important?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Think about a plane catching fire as it leaves the runway.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When you think about how could that possibly have occurred,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
you want to figure out what the cost of failure is.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In order to explain how the failure came to be,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you want to come up with the minimum of factors that explain how.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, here is our plane with passengers, luggage on board,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
entertainment system, air condition, and whatnot.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now suppose you had a means to turn back time and repeat history at will.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Or suppose all of this were running in a simulation.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
You could try again and again to see whether the failure occurs or not.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Then you could try to simplify things.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You could, for instance, remove the passengers and see

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
whether the failure still occurs. Oh, it still occurs.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Remove the flight attendant and see whether the failure still occurs.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, the plane still catches fire.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Remove the seats. The plane still catches fire.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Remove the air conditioning system and repeat the whole thing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And remove the entertainment system, remove the luggage,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and you see that none of this actually is important.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Whatever you remove, the plane still catches fire.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You can go and remove the airport, and even with all the airport removed,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
everything happens as before.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But as soon as you remove this little metal strap that's lying on the runway,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
then all of a sudden your plane takes off just as normal.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But if that strap is there, then your plane is on fire.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
What we're going to explore today is how to simplify failures--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that is, finding what is relevant for the failure and what is not--

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and how to do this automatically--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
that is, automatically finding out the cause of the failure.
