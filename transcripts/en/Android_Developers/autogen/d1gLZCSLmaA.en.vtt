is send one configuration in and you get

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840
is send one configuration in and you get
 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.530
is send one configuration in and you get
one frame out this is very very

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540
one frame out this is very very
 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.390
one frame out this is very very
important you send one configuration in

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400
important you send one configuration in
 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.120
important you send one configuration in
one frame out for each frame there is a

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.810
 
so let's zoom into the preview pipeline

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820
so let's zoom into the preview pipeline
 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.289
so let's zoom into the preview pipeline
the one on top as I said each pipeline

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299
the one on top as I said each pipeline
 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.600

shown is a broad use case when it comes
 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.940
shown is a broad use case when it comes
to preview you can think of it as the

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950
to preview you can think of it as the
 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.100
to preview you can think of it as the
viewfinder so whenever somebody is

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110
viewfinder so whenever somebody is
 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.110
viewfinder so whenever somebody is
holding their phone up and you want to

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120
holding their phone up and you want to
 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.870
holding their phone up and you want to
see what the camera sees this is the use

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880
see what the camera sees this is the use
 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.490
see what the camera sees this is the use
case we are talking about

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500
 
 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.170
 
we need to compromise on some things

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180
we need to compromise on some things
 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.910
we need to compromise on some things
obviously the camera can only do so many

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920
obviously the camera can only do so many
 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.470
obviously the camera can only do so many
things at once when it comes to preview

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480
things at once when it comes to preview
 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.690
things at once when it comes to preview
we choose to compromise on quality we

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700
we choose to compromise on quality we
 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.300
we choose to compromise on quality we
care much more about latency we want the

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
care much more about latency we want the
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.160
care much more about latency we want the
user to be able to see what the camera

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170
user to be able to see what the camera
 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.630
user to be able to see what the camera
see is much faster this is just general

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640
see is much faster this is just general
 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.580
see is much faster this is just general
results in better latency because we're

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590
results in better latency because we're
 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.449
results in better latency because we're
able to compromise as I said on quality

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459
able to compromise as I said on quality
 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.740
able to compromise as I said on quality
some of those compromises come in the

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750
some of those compromises come in the

kind of falls away and you don't really
 

00:14:45.029 --> 00:14:47.269
kind of falls away and you don't really
see how long it actually takes but for

API that Oscar mentioned it's the part
you interact with the camera and there's

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:35.460
you interact with the camera and there's
 

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.340
you interact with the camera and there's
a set of api's there's two versions

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:37.350
a set of api's there's two versions
 

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:40.280
a set of api's there's two versions
there's camera one and it's been around

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.290
there's camera one and it's been around
 

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.960
there's camera one and it's been around
for many years and then there's also

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:41.970
for many years and then there's also
 

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.380
for many years and then there's also
camera to a newer API

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:44.390
camera to a newer API
 

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.690
camera to a newer API
although camera one is deprecated you

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:47.700
although camera one is deprecated you
 

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.220
although camera one is deprecated you
know when you have hundreds of millions

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:49.230
know when you have hundreds of millions
 

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.710
know when you have hundreds of millions
of users it's it's big chunk that's

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720
of users it's it's big chunk that's
 

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.930
of users it's it's big chunk that's
still on camera one so you need to

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:53.940
still on camera one so you need to
 

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.390
still on camera one so you need to
support it regardless of what the what

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:56.400
support it regardless of what the what
 

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.760
support it regardless of what the what
the device says the second part is

00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:58.770
the device says the second part is
 

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.590
the device says the second part is
there's different modes for camera two

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600
there's different modes for camera two
 

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.590
there's different modes for camera two
for OEMs to slowly adapt they have a

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600
for OEMs to slowly adapt they have a
 

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.630
for OEMs to slowly adapt they have a
legacy mode which is simply you know

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:05.640
legacy mode which is simply you know
 

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:08.000
legacy mode which is simply you know
we've made our API work but under the

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.010
we've made our API work but under the
 

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.400
we've made our API work but under the
hood it's really camera one and also

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:10.410
hood it's really camera one and also
 

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.470
hood it's really camera one and also
camera two varies by device some devices

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480
camera two varies by device some devices
 

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.320
camera two varies by device some devices
say yep camera two works great here but

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:15.330
say yep camera two works great here but
 

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:17.870
say yep camera two works great here but
in reality deep down it's still camera

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880
in reality deep down it's still camera
 

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.700
in reality deep down it's still camera
one and so the performance you get my

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:19.710
one and so the performance you get my
 

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.740
one and so the performance you get my
very even across devices so you really

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:21.750
very even across devices so you really
 

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.330
very even across devices so you really
need to know each of the different

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:23.340
need to know each of the different
 

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.630
need to know each of the different
products that you want to target and so

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:26.640
products that you want to target and so
 

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.750
products that you want to target and so
what we do is we support both since 2016

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760
what we do is we support both since 2016
 

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.300
what we do is we support both since 2016
we've written both camera one and camera

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:32.310
we've written both camera one and camera
 

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.760
we've written both camera one and camera
two in terms of code and then what we do

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:34.770
two in terms of code and then what we do
 

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.170
two in terms of code and then what we do
is we add a layer on top that's

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180
is we add a layer on top that's
 

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.960
is we add a layer on top that's
basically what our application sees to

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:38.970
basically what our application sees to
 

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:40.760
basically what our application sees to
just unify what it looks like underneath

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:40.770
just unify what it looks like underneath
 

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.710
just unify what it looks like underneath
and then if you have shared code for

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720
and then if you have shared code for
 

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:45.110
and then if you have shared code for
example a picking resolution it doesn't

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120
example a picking resolution it doesn't
 

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.730
example a picking resolution it doesn't
really matter which version you're using

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740
really matter which version you're using
 

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.800
really matter which version you're using
the logic for the full screen that I

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:48.810
the logic for the full screen that I
 

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.690
the logic for the full screen that I
mentioned can be shared by both so

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:50.700
mentioned can be shared by both so
 

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.190
mentioned can be shared by both so
there's some shared code but the

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:52.200
there's some shared code but the
 

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.020
there's some shared code but the
application deals with the top part the

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:54.030
application deals with the top part the
 

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:56.750
application deals with the top part the
next part is there's millions of devices

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:56.760
next part is there's millions of devices
 

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.840
next part is there's millions of devices
a lot of them have bugs they say they

00:16:59.840 --> 00:16:59.850
a lot of them have bugs they say they
 

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.400
a lot of them have bugs they say they
support a certain feature it doesn't

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:01.410
support a certain feature it doesn't
 

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.490
support a certain feature it doesn't
work you zoom in beyond 99% somebod

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.500
work you zoom in beyond 99% somebod
 

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.470
work you zoom in beyond 99% somebod
comes so we have a lot of configuration

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480
comes so we have a lot of configuration
 

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.080
comes so we have a lot of configuration
that allows us to decide on specific

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:09.090
that allows us to decide on specific
 

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:11.540
that allows us to decide on specific
devices and models what behavior what

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:11.550
devices and models what behavior what
 

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.520
devices and models what behavior what
configuration to adopt and so this

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:13.530
configuration to adopt and so this
 

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:14.069
configuration to adopt and so this
remote can

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079
remote can
 

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.049
remote can
aggression is really key and over time

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:16.059
aggression is really key and over time
 

00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:17.490
aggression is really key and over time
you have to groom it you have to

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:17.500
you have to groom it you have to
 

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.649
you have to groom it you have to
maintain it it's a very key part of

00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:19.659
maintain it it's a very key part of
 

00:17:19.659 --> 00:17:23.850
maintain it it's a very key part of
something that's just code now let's

00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:23.860
something that's just code now let's
 

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:25.319
something that's just code now let's
build up this architecture so I've

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:25.329
build up this architecture so I've
 

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:27.289
build up this architecture so I've
talked a bit about sort of the camera

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:27.299
talked a bit about sort of the camera
 

00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:29.490
talked a bit about sort of the camera
interaction the code that talks to the

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:29.500
interaction the code that talks to the
 

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.529
interaction the code that talks to the
camera server which is the Android

00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:31.539
camera server which is the Android
 

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:33.720
camera server which is the Android
system process that manages the camera

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:33.730
system process that manages the camera
 

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.570
system process that manages the camera
and it talks through binder IPC which is

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:36.580
and it talks through binder IPC which is
 

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:38.810
and it talks through binder IPC which is
a form of inter process communication

00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820
a form of inter process communication
 

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.740
a form of inter process communication
but if you expose this to your

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:40.750
but if you expose this to your
 

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:42.840
but if you expose this to your
applications it's a little too raw

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:42.850
applications it's a little too raw
 

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:44.519
applications it's a little too raw
because you might have a video chat

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:44.529
because you might have a video chat
 

00:17:44.529 --> 00:17:47.460
because you might have a video chat
feature a camera and video note and if

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:47.470
feature a camera and video note and if
 

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.019
feature a camera and video note and if
they all try to talk to the camera they

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:49.029
they all try to talk to the camera they
 

00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:50.610
they all try to talk to the camera they
could do things that sort of conflict

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:50.620
could do things that sort of conflict
 

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.470
could do things that sort of conflict
with each other there's life cycling a

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480
with each other there's life cycling a
 

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.669
with each other there's life cycling a
lot of things you need to be aware of

00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679
lot of things you need to be aware of
 

00:17:53.679 --> 00:17:56.430
lot of things you need to be aware of
and so what we do is we have a cue an

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:56.440
and so what we do is we have a cue an
 

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.889
and so what we do is we have a cue an
operation cue that allows us to coalesce

00:17:58.889 --> 00:17:58.899
operation cue that allows us to coalesce
 

00:17:58.899 --> 00:18:01.259
operation cue that allows us to coalesce
things that are redundant allows us to

00:18:01.259 --> 00:18:01.269
things that are redundant allows us to
 

00:18:01.269 --> 00:18:02.759
things that are redundant allows us to
manage sort of invalid

00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:02.769
manage sort of invalid
 

00:18:02.769 --> 00:18:04.860
manage sort of invalid
States and so we avoid a lot of

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:04.870
States and so we avoid a lot of
 

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:06.990
States and so we avoid a lot of
conflicting things across features by

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000
conflicting things across features by
 

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.730
conflicting things across features by
having an operation cue and a thread

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:08.740
having an operation cue and a thread
 

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.970
having an operation cue and a thread
that processes them and the next part is

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:11.980
that processes them and the next part is
 

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.310
that processes them and the next part is
so everything on your right the grey

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320
so everything on your right the grey
 

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.580
so everything on your right the grey
side is really about the UI you know

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:17.590
side is really about the UI you know
 

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.370
side is really about the UI you know
like the the shutter button you see the

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:20.380
like the the shutter button you see the
 

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.769
like the the shutter button you see the
autofocus the animations all that and

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:22.779
autofocus the animations all that and
 

00:18:22.779 --> 00:18:24.720
autofocus the animations all that and
then it has a state machine that says ok

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:24.730
then it has a state machine that says ok
 

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:27.060
then it has a state machine that says ok
the user tap to autofocus let's do the

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:27.070
the user tap to autofocus let's do the
 

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.740
the user tap to autofocus let's do the
animation let's ask the camera to

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:28.750
animation let's ask the camera to
 

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:31.560
animation let's ask the camera to
autofocus the and then it saves your

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:31.570
autofocus the and then it saves your
 

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.930
autofocus the and then it saves your
intent in memory and tries to drive the

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:33.940
intent in memory and tries to drive the
 

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.730
intent in memory and tries to drive the
asynchronous process to get it done and

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:35.740
asynchronous process to get it done and
 

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.960
asynchronous process to get it done and
so the right-hand side and the left-hand

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:36.970
so the right-hand side and the left-hand
 

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.399
so the right-hand side and the left-hand
side have sort of different

00:18:38.399 --> 00:18:38.409
side have sort of different
 

00:18:38.409 --> 00:18:40.710
side have sort of different
responsibilities and then over time your

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720
responsibilities and then over time your
 

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.850
responsibilities and then over time your
surface comes in

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:41.860
surface comes in
 

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.009
surface comes in
that's the preview frames that Oscar was

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:44.019
that's the preview frames that Oscar was
 

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:45.299
that's the preview frames that Oscar was
saying it starts showing up on your

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:45.309
saying it starts showing up on your
 

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:47.759
saying it starts showing up on your
screen if you have interactive features

screen if you have interactive features
enabled like lenses they get composited

00:18:50.159 --> 00:18:50.169
enabled like lenses they get composited
 

00:18:50.169 --> 00:18:52.710
enabled like lenses they get composited
on top of it and this is done in OpenGL

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720
on top of it and this is done in OpenGL
 

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.720
on top of it and this is done in OpenGL
and we try to do it synchronously and

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:54.730
and we try to do it synchronously and
 

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.360
and we try to do it synchronously and
not avoid copying anything large and

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:57.370
not avoid copying anything large and
 

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.639
not avoid copying anything large and
then ultimately your UI is composited on

00:18:59.639 --> 00:18:59.649
then ultimately your UI is composited on
 

00:18:59.649 --> 00:19:01.409
then ultimately your UI is composited on
top and so as far as the user is

00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:01.419
top and so as far as the user is
 

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:03.899
top and so as far as the user is
concerned it all looks integrated but in

00:19:03.899 --> 00:19:03.909
concerned it all looks integrated but in
 

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:05.519
concerned it all looks integrated but in
reality it's multiple layers that are

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:05.529
reality it's multiple layers that are
 

00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:07.889
reality it's multiple layers that are
coming together now if you look at this

00:19:07.889 --> 00:19:07.899
coming together now if you look at this
 

00:19:07.899 --> 00:19:10.169
coming together now if you look at this
architecture what you notice is that the

00:19:10.169 --> 00:19:10.179
architecture what you notice is that the
 

00:19:10.179 --> 00:19:11.310
architecture what you notice is that the
left and the right have sort of

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:11.320
left and the right have sort of
 

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:12.779
left and the right have sort of
different things that you're concerned

00:19:12.779 --> 00:19:12.789
different things that you're concerned
 

00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:15.560
different things that you're concerned
about and one way to think about it is

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:15.570
about and one way to think about it is
 

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.730
about and one way to think about it is
client-server architecture the

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:17.740
client-server architecture the
 

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.100
client-server architecture the
right-hand side is like the client the

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:20.110
right-hand side is like the client the
 

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.919
right-hand side is like the client the
left hand side is your runtime your

00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:22.929
left hand side is your runtime your
 

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:24.779
left hand side is your runtime your
processing and the concerns are

00:19:24.779 --> 00:19:24.789
processing and the concerns are
 

00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:26.279
processing and the concerns are
different so from a performance

00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:26.289
different so from a performance
 

00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:27.600
different so from a performance
perspective

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:27.610
perspective
 

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:29.789
perspective
the left-hand side needs to worry about

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:29.799
the left-hand side needs to worry about
 

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:32.430
the left-hand side needs to worry about
processing frames really fast it needs

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440
processing frames really fast it needs
 

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.320
processing frames really fast it needs
to worry about stability a lot of things

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:34.330
to worry about stability a lot of things
 

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.030
to worry about stability a lot of things
and the right-hand side is really about

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.040
and the right-hand side is really about
 

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.930
and the right-hand side is really about
animations you know new features a lot

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:39.940
animations you know new features a lot
 

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.669
animations you know new features a lot
of the candy in terms of how the user

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679
of the candy in terms of how the user
 

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:44.400
of the candy in terms of how the user
interacts with the camera and so one

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:44.410
interacts with the camera and so one
 

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.049
interacts with the camera and so one
cool thing you can do is if you ever

00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:46.059
cool thing you can do is if you ever
 

00:19:46.059 --> 00:19:48.390
cool thing you can do is if you ever
work with client server is sometimes the

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:48.400
work with client server is sometimes the
 

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.310
work with client server is sometimes the
server slow you know six hundreds of

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320
server slow you know six hundreds of
 

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.350
server slow you know six hundreds of
milliseconds sometimes some issues so

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360
milliseconds sometimes some issues so
 

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.870
milliseconds sometimes some issues so
what we do is we have ways of replacing

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880
what we do is we have ways of replacing
 

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.060
what we do is we have ways of replacing
components you can use dagger you have

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.070
components you can use dagger you have
 

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:58.410
components you can use dagger you have
other approaches where you say okay

00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:58.420
other approaches where you say okay
 

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.780
other approaches where you say okay
let's just abstract out the camera so

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:00.790
let's just abstract out the camera so
 

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.030
let's just abstract out the camera so
that the UI thinks it's talking to the

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:03.040
that the UI thinks it's talking to the
 

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.370
that the UI thinks it's talking to the
real thing and we'll just mock the api's

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:05.380
real thing and we'll just mock the api's
 

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.350
real thing and we'll just mock the api's
to the Android system and maybe do an

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360
to the Android system and maybe do an
 

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.930
to the Android system and maybe do an
OAuth or send black frames whatever we

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:09.940
OAuth or send black frames whatever we
 

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.330
OAuth or send black frames whatever we
want to do and one place where we take

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:12.340
want to do and one place where we take
 

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.610
want to do and one place where we take
advantage of this is performance testing

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:14.620
advantage of this is performance testing
 

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.940
advantage of this is performance testing
so for example if you add new UI logic

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:17.950
so for example if you add new UI logic
 

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.130
so for example if you add new UI logic
and you want to see if it regresses the

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:20.140
and you want to see if it regresses the
 

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.169
and you want to see if it regresses the
camera anyway you don't care how long

00:20:22.169 --> 00:20:22.179
camera anyway you don't care how long
 

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.390
camera anyway you don't care how long
the camera operations take and because

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400
the camera operations take and because
 

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.460
the camera operations take and because
they're variable if let's say takes a

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:26.470
they're variable if let's say takes a
 

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.200
they're variable if let's say takes a
hundred milliseconds to open the camera

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.210
hundred milliseconds to open the camera
 

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:31.980
hundred milliseconds to open the camera
and it's variable because it's a system

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:31.990
and it's variable because it's a system
 

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.470
and it's variable because it's a system
service then over time you might not be

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480
service then over time you might not be
 

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.850
service then over time you might not be
able to catch ten millisecond

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:35.860
able to catch ten millisecond
 

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.980
able to catch ten millisecond
regressions and so in this example here

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:37.990
regressions and so in this example here
 

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.380
regressions and so in this example here
what I'm showing is a startup regression

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:40.390
what I'm showing is a startup regression
 

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.240
what I'm showing is a startup regression
test with a mock camera so the camera

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:42.250
test with a mock camera so the camera
 

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.860
test with a mock camera so the camera
has been mocked out it's starting the

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:43.870
has been mocked out it's starting the
 

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.840
has been mocked out it's starting the
app repeatedly and saying okay let's

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:45.850
app repeatedly and saying okay let's
 

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.909
app repeatedly and saying okay let's
collect the metrics and see how long

00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919
collect the metrics and see how long
 

00:20:47.919 --> 00:20:49.860
collect the metrics and see how long
it's taking to get to a stable point and

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:49.870
it's taking to get to a stable point and
 

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.780
it's taking to get to a stable point and
then we can actually catch regressions

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:51.790
then we can actually catch regressions
 

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.909
then we can actually catch regressions
across several commits to see you know

00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919
across several commits to see you know
 

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:56.549
across several commits to see you know
what change might have caused it another

00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559
what change might have caused it another
 

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:58.860
what change might have caused it another
example is instead of replacing the

00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:58.870
example is instead of replacing the
 

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.510
example is instead of replacing the
whole camera you can replace part of it

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:00.520
whole camera you can replace part of it
 

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.520
whole camera you can replace part of it
you could say the frames that are coming

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:02.530
you could say the frames that are coming
 

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.230
you could say the frames that are coming
out let's just replace them with

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240
out let's just replace them with
 

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.730
out let's just replace them with
something else rather than the whole

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:05.740
something else rather than the whole
 

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.659
something else rather than the whole
camera you could keep other

00:21:06.659 --> 00:21:06.669
camera you could keep other
 

00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:08.789
camera you could keep other
functionality intact and so in this case

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799
functionality intact and so in this case
 

00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:11.460
functionality intact and so in this case
here we could replace the frames with a

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:11.470
here we could replace the frames with a
 

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.730
here we could replace the frames with a
video file and so this is very useful in

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:14.740
video file and so this is very useful in
 

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:16.530
video file and so this is very useful in
situations where let's say you're

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:16.540
situations where let's say you're
 

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.620
situations where let's say you're
automatically testing your face tracking

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:19.630
automatically testing your face tracking
 

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.780
automatically testing your face tracking
in the lab environment where you run

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:21.790
in the lab environment where you run
 

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.890
in the lab environment where you run
integration tests

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:22.900
integration tests
 

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.480
integration tests
there's no faces there's no people in

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:24.490
there's no faces there's no people in
 

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.490
there's no faces there's no people in
the lab to look at the camera and so

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:26.500
the lab to look at the camera and so
 

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.010
the lab to look at the camera and so
what we do is we actually use the video

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:29.020
what we do is we actually use the video
 

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.780
what we do is we actually use the video
files to drive that interaction so

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:30.790
files to drive that interaction so
 

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.250
files to drive that interaction so
here's a picture of me running some

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:32.260
here's a picture of me running some
 

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.650
here's a picture of me running some
lenses testing where the frames have

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:34.660
lenses testing where the frames have
 

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.840
lenses testing where the frames have
been mocked out from a video file and so

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:36.850
been mocked out from a video file and so
 

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:40.270
been mocked out from a video file and so
there's me hello I

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:40.280
there's me hello I
 

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.830
there's me hello I
and you can see the paper showing it's

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840
and you can see the paper showing it's
 

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.200
and you can see the paper showing it's
not the camera it's just a video but

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:44.210
not the camera it's just a video but
 

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.880
not the camera it's just a video but
everything else is really it took a snap

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:45.890
everything else is really it took a snap
 

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.640
everything else is really it took a snap
it edits it it does a lot of things so

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:48.650
it edits it it does a lot of things so
 

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.920
it edits it it does a lot of things so
you can mock out parts of the camera to

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:50.930
you can mock out parts of the camera to
 

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.780
you can mock out parts of the camera to
allow you to add new features and just

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:52.790
allow you to add new features and just
 

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:56.140
allow you to add new features and just
test things in isolation and so this is

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:56.150
test things in isolation and so this is
 

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.180
test things in isolation and so this is
kind of in terms of an architecture it's

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:58.190
kind of in terms of an architecture it's
 

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.010
kind of in terms of an architecture it's
one way to do it there's many ways but

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.020
one way to do it there's many ways but
 

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.000
one way to do it there's many ways but
this gives you the performance

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.010
this gives you the performance
 

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.070
this gives you the performance
considerations on the Left the remote

sometimes the algorithms might
overcompensate and you will see

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:26.790
overcompensate and you will see
 

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.940

disable it even though it can sometimes
 

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.200
disable it even though it can sometimes
result in higher quality especially in

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:36.210
result in higher quality especially in
 

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.940
result in higher quality especially in
low-light conditions so we balance that

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:37.950
low-light conditions so we balance that
 

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:41.090
low-light conditions so we balance that
and so really it's a higher key of

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100
and so really it's a higher key of
 

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.730
and so really it's a higher key of
