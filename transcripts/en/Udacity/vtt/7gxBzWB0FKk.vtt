00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This negative makes me think we may have made a mistake, so let's look at our variables.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Well, we said the initial velocity was 20 meters per second. Yeah, that was absolutely true.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We threw it up at 20 meters per second. We said the final velocity was 0.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We can't really argue that. At the top of the trajectory, it does have to stop for a brief instant.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And we said the acceleration was 10 and that's meters per second squared.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When on earth isn't that always the acceleration? Well, here's where we have to be careful.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
When we said that the initial velocity was +20, we made a choice.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We said, "Hey, in this problem, up is positive."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, we were free to make that choice. We could've said, "Down was positive too."

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But once we make our choice, we're no longer free.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Acceleration. Objects always accelerate downward. They accelerate towards the earth.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
They don't spring up off the earth.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If we've chosen up is positive, we have to choose A as negative since it points downwards.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And if we carry that out, we get a +20 here and so the maximum height is 20 meters.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Remember whenever you make a calculation in physics,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you are calculating something about the real world.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If you're number doesn't make sense in the real world, you did something wrong.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is nice because it's a built-in sanity check.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We can always check to see that our number isn't totally crazy,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and we know if it is totally crazy we made a mistake.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If it's not, we still may have made a mistake but we feel more confident with a better answer.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
One more question before we move on.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And this time you throw a ball again straight up at 20 meters per second.

00:01:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But now I want to know how long does it take to reach the highest point. Enter your answer here.
