&gt;&gt; Everdeen Mason: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.280
I'm Everdeen Mason, and
I'm an audience editor

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.070
and a science fiction
fantasy columnist

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.480
at the Washington Post,
which is a charter sponsor

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.510
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.020
First, a few official words.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.570
First, a thank-you to the
co-chairman of the festival,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.680
David Rubenstein, and the
other generous sponsors

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.320
who have made this
event possible.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.620
If you would like to add
your financial support,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.890
please note that
information in your program.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.650
We'll have some time after this
presentation for your questions.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.910
And I've been asked to
remind you that if you come

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.380
to the microphone, you will
be included in the videotape

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.740
of this event, which may be
broadcast at a later date.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.830
And the author signing will be
at line 18 from 5:30 to 6:30.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.820
So now that we have dispensed
with the formalities,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.940
I am pleased to introduce our
guest today, Justina Ireland.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.550
Justina is an author of middle
grade and young adult books.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.850
And her most recent,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.510
the critically acclaimed Dread
Nation, is a best-seller.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.240
You may also know her as a
strong advocate for diversity

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.110
and inclusion in
publishing industry.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.120
Using her voice in fiction
and essays and on social media

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.940
to hold truth of
power and to make sure

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.680
that marginalized
voices are heard

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.850
and represented fairly
and accurately.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.040
Dread Nation is a continuation
of this work, using action,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.770
wry humor, and yes, zombies,
to explore racism and the power

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.200
of structures built from it.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.730
Now I'll get out of
the way so you can see

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.510
who you actually want
to see, Justina Ireland.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:27.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.550
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: I brought
this really big bottle of water,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.390
and they gave me a little
one, so it's very awkward.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.760
So you guys have to
pretend like it's not there.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.500
Like she said, my name is
Justina Ireland, and I'm going

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.800
to tell you a little
story today.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.100
I'm going to read it.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.060
It's a chapter from
my book Dread Nation,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.400
mostly because I am
woefully unprepared

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.150
at every point in my life.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.280
I got an e-mail from my
publicist a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.430
They're like, oh, how's your
presentation coming along

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.730
for [inaudible]?

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.030
I was like, what?

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.660
So kids, be better at
your life than I am.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.960
Let's see.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.690
The section I'm going to read
for you today has zombies

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.170
and it's a little violent, so if
anybody's sensitive to violence,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.140
it's not terrible,
but it, it's there.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.770
And Dread Nation is
really about a book,

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.930
it's a book about a
girl named Jane McKeene.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.140
And in her world, the
Battle of Gettysburg ends

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.240
in a zombie apocalypse,
which seems legit.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.630
And so what happens
is slavery kind

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.480
of ends, but really doesn't.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.990
Instead, we have a system
in which people of color

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.670
and indigenous peoples are
expected to kind of learn how

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.760
to kill the dead, or in
her world, shamblers,

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.840
so that everybody
who's in power,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.750
white people, can be safe.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.050
And so this is kind

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.390
of her relating the first time
she's ever seen a zombie back

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.790
when she was on her, her family
home of Rose Hill Plantation.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.380
Chapter 3, in which I relate my
first encounter with a shambler.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.690
When I was little, back at
Rose Hill, I used to sneak

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.150
out of the kitchen, away
from Auntie Aggie, while she

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.910
and the other aunties
worked to feed all

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.720
of the hungry mouths
on the plantation.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.160
Once they were distracted,
I'd tiptoe out past the ovens

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.120
and slip away to
freedom in the fields.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.970
Rose Hill mostly grew tobacco,
which Momma and a couple

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.150
of the bigger field hands
would ride into town to trade

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.210
for cloth and other essentials.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.130
Early on, back before
I can remember,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.610
Momma had tried growing
tomatoes and other vegetables.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.290
When it became obvious
that her small bundle

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.910
of tobacco was worth more

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.670
than all the food
combined, she switched.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.640
Momma is savvy like that.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.720
The dead may have risen and
we might have been living

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.820
in the end times of Revelation,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.230
but folks still wanted
their tobacco.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.720
The tobacco plants grew tall,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.880
and the leaves were
broad and green.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.030
In the summer, I could
duck down and run

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.310
through the rows undetected,
which is what I did

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.280
on this particular day.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.370
My goal was always the same.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.070
Find the other kids, the ones
that got to run the fields

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.230
because their mommas weren't
ladies who owned the plantation.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.840
The kids I liked best would
be near the barrier fence

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.720
at the far side of the tobacco
fields, so I made a beeline

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.420
for that patch of trouble.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.290
A barrier fence is the line
of security between shamblers

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.190
and the rest of us, and Rose
Hill had three such fences;

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.850
white painted fence rails

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.370
that had been our original
property line and weren't more

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.480
than pretty decoration, a
dense forest of wooden poles

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.480
with sharpened ends implanted
in the ground at an angle

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.780
that worked like stakes

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.180
to impale any shambler
enterprising enough to get

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.760
to it, and, at the outer edge, a
wall of five-strand bobbed wire

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.490
that was our primary
defense against the dead.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.050
Once or twice a day, the
stronger men would go

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.890
out to the barbed wire and end
any shamblers tangled up in it.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.390
Momma would have them
bring the corpses in

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.290
and burn them for
the compost pile.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.640
If there were any valuables on
the bodies, Momma and a couple

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.130
of the men would
sell them in town,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.020
bringing back something fine.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.090
One time there was a shambler
that must have been a fine lady,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.830
since she was decked
out in gold and jewels.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.170
Momma used the baubles
to buy several hogs,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.300
and that was how Rose Hill came
to have pork chops every Sunday

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.680
after the Scripture was read.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.390
But I didn't much care
for that business.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.520
I was more interested
in the children who hung

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.950
out playing games in
between the fences.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.290
I scrambled over the
white split rail fence

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.670
and carefully picked my way
past the sharpened stakes

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.320
of the interior fence.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.250
And there, between the safety
of Rose Hill and the danger

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.080
of the outside world,
were the plantation kids.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.560
Everyone on the plantation
but Momma was a Negro,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.760
all except for Mr. Isaac.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.960
There had been other white
men once upon a time,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.830
but after the dead rose
they'd either ran off

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.660
or turned shambler.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.300
Mr. Isaac was different.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.730
He came to Rose Hill
after the war.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.290
He lived on the plantation
because he was married

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.710
to Auntie Evelyn and
relations between Negroes

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.800
and whites were frowned upon.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.490
Momma didn't much care
for, as she called it,

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.240
"the spiteful leanings of
biddies with too much time

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.300
on their hands," and welcomed
folks into the house staff

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.690
as long as they didn't
make too much trouble

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.820
and were happy to work hard.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.160
So Mr. Isaac and Auntie Evelyn
lived on Rose Hill with a passel

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.700
of boys, the worst of
which were the twins.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.510
Auntie Aggie said
twins were an ill omen,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.460
and anyone who knew the
Isaac twins would agree.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.040
The boys were light-skinned,
lighter than me,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.960
sandy-hued with unnervingly
blue eyes.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.810
They always had a scam running,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.850
like the time they'd stolen
a watermelon from the garden

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.210
and climbed up a
tree to share it,

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.140
or the time they'd let loose
all the dogs as a distraction

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.980
so they could run off
to fish in the creek

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.200
on the north side of Rose Hill.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.320
The Isaac twins were
always up to no good.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.890
They were my favorite people
in the whole damn world.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.640
"Hey there, Jane," called
Ezekiel, Zeke for short.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.210
"Aww, Jane's here, now we're
gonna get the strap for sure,"

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.870
said his brother Joseph, who
was saltier than Lot's wife.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.050
"I snuck off," I said,
as the other kids began

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.350
to give me dirty looks.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.930
"Ain't no one know I'm gone.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.770
What're you doing?"

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.620
Each of the kids held a
stick, the end sharpened,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.210
and had the look of
someone with a secret.

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.550
"None of your business.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.900
Go back to the kitchens,"
Joe said, picking up a rock

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.690
from the dusty ground
and throwing it at me.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.270
The rock missed by a mile,
but the one I picked up

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.090
and flipped back at Joe didn't.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.190
It hit him right in the
middle of his forehead,

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.970
and as he cried out, I
picked up another rock.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.460
"Next person throws a rock at
me is getting what for right

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.390
between their eyes," I
said, shaking with anger.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.920
"No one's going to
throw any rocks, Jane.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.410
You should come with us.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.070
We're going to kill the dead."

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.210
Zeke smiled wide and
handed me a sharpened stick.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.410
While Joseph was prickly and
hostile, Zeke was all smiles

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.470
and warmth, the kind of person
people liked to be around.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.930
And he had the best ideas.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.650
It was no wonder
Joe was so tetchy.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.950
Who would want to share such a
wonderful brother with everyone?

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.410
I took the stick.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.620
"What do you mean,
kill the dead?"

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.730
"There's a shambler
stuck in the barbed wire.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:04.860
We're going to kill it."

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.200
"That ain't a good idea."

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.730
As soon as the words
were out of my mouth,

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.210
I knew it was the
wrong thing to say.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.970
But I couldn't help it.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.130
I liked trouble as
much as the next kid,

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.880
but this seemed different.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.830
Dangerous.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.970
"We're gonna kill it so that we
can go on patrols with the rest

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.050
of the grown-ups,"
Zeke said with a grin.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.720
"No more chores for us!"

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.560
"You can stay here, Jane.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.790
No one wants you tagging
along, anyway," Joe said.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.490
I set my jaw.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.150
Whatever Joe said, I was going

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.130
to do the opposite,
just to spite him.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:38.920
"I'm coming.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.540
You probably ain't found
a shambler, anyhow."

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.890
"Oh, it's a shambler
all right," Zeke said.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.610
"You'll see."

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.400
We marched in silence, along
the line of the fence rails.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.980
A few of the kids began
to whisper excitedly,

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.410
but a single glance back from
Joe shut them up real quick.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.250
My stomach surged and gurgled,
roiling with hot dread.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.950
I'd heard Momma and the
other farm hands talk

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.160
about how the dead worked, how
they came out of the brush,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.520
overwhelming the
unwary and wary alike.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.010
That was what made
shamblers so scary.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.200
Even when they were predictable,
they could still surprise you.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.170
As we rounded the corner,
a loud moan split the air.

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.780
There, twisted up in the
barbed wire, was a shambler.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.900
We stopped, and all
the celebration

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.370
and shouting died
down real quick.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:30.340
I'd always imagined the dead
as some kind of monster,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.430
mouth gaping as they
came to eat you.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.730
But the shambler caught

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.840
in the barbed wire
looked almost normal.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.040
A white woman with long brown
hair pinned up on her head,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.340
wearing a day dress
of green linen.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.840
The skirt was torn, and her
petticoats showed through.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.860
Her eyes were the yellow of
crookneck squash, and the nails

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.180
of her grasping hands
had been broken down,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.060
her fingers covered with dirt.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.880
Still, I recognized her.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.660
"That's Miss Farmer.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.310
Her family owns Apple
Hill Plantation," I said.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.140
Miss Farmer hadn't cared for me.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.230
She thought Negroes shouldn't
be allowed in the house,

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.260
since we were dirty, but she
loved Momma's blackberry jam

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.410
enough that she came
to call every so often,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.380
when it was safe to travel.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.340
"She ain't nobody no more," Joe
said, poking her with a stick.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.720
The shambler growled
and reached for him.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.070
Joe danced out of the way, much
to the delight of everyone.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.370
Even me.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.670
I ain't sure why we
thought poking the shambler

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.700
with our sharpened
sticks was a good idea,

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.230
but everyone started doing
it, creeping in close enough

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.980
to stab the creature
and then dancing

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.490
out of the way before
her hands could reach us.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.970
The game might have
gone on longer

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.110
if the dead Miss Farmer hadn't
managed to pull herself free.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.400
Barbed wire ain't
a long-term fix

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.530
for a shambler wanting
in on the plantation.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.600
Since they don't have any
kind of survival instinct,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.880
it's no big deal for them to
eventually pull themselves free

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.580
of such an entanglement,
ripping off great big swatches

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.880
of themselves to do so.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.090
And this is exactly what
the undead Miss Farmer did.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.030
One moment, she was jammed
up in the barbed wire,

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.400
the next she was stumbling
toward us, half her dress

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.060
and a good bit of arm skin
left behind on the fence,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.830
which now listed to one side.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.520
Most of the kids, myself
included, screamed and ran.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.180
I took off for the field
of sharpened sticks,

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.510
knowing that would slow
the undead woman down.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.110
But when I looked
over my shoulder,

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.190
I realized that not
everyone was with us.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.280
Joe was standing right
where he'd been, not moving,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.370
frozen in the path of the
dead woman and her gaping maw.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.620
The boy had always been
a bully, and the thing

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.610
about bullies is they
never learn how to run

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.760
like the rest of us do.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.920
So Joe stood his ground,
sharpened stick at the ready,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.210
convinced he was going
to kill the shambler.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.880
At some point in the
woman's lunge toward Joe,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.040
he realized that a stick
wasn't much of a weapon

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.950
against the dead,
but it was too late.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:51.600
Joe was about to be shambler
chow if it hadn't been for Zeke.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.430
It was Zeke that
slammed into Joe,

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.530
pushing him out of
the way of the woman.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.960
It was Zeke the woman bit,

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.380
sinking her teeth
deep into his throat.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:01.970
It was Zeke that cried
out like a wounded animal,

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.650
trying for a few
precious moments

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:05.100
to push the much
heavier woman off him

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.280
as she tore away a
great chunk of flesh.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.390
And it was Zeke that let
out one soft, anguished cry

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.400
as his life bled out into
the dirt of Rose Hill,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.960
the sound almost
indistinguishable over the noise

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.040
of the dead Miss Farmer feeding.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.910
"Joe," I yelled, and the boy
looked at me, expression distant

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.700
and caught somewhere
between grief and horror.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.670
I ran back to where he'd
landed, pulled him to his feet,

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.510
and dragged him by the
hand through the field

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.290
of sharpened sticks, to
the safety of Rose Hill.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.580
As we ran back, we
passed the patrol coming

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.880
to put down the dead.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.400
I didn't stay to watch.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.540
I had seen enough
carnage for one day.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.430
They say when they got there
Miss Farmer had started

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.120
on Zeke's face, and that two

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.800
of the men vomited before they
even got to putting her down

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:52.170
and driving a nail into Zeke's
head so he wouldn't come back.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.930
Momma gave Zeke a proper
burning, and gave Mr. Isaac

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.130
and Auntie Evelyn his ashes.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.680
Joe ran off a few years
later, presumably to one

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.740
of the combat schools, and so
their heartbreak was complete.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.680
Auntie Aggie clucked
her tongue and said,

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.350
"told you them twins
was an ill omen."

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:12.420
It took me a long time
before I left the safety

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.660
of the main house, and I never
ventured into the borders

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.440
of Rose Hill again,
not until I came

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.460
to Miss Preston's years later.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.370
I learned two valuable
lessons that day.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.670
One, the dead will take
everything you love.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.520
You have to end them
before they can end you.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.050
And that's exactly
what I aim to do.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.880
And two, the person poking the
dead ain't always the one paying

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.180
for it.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.960
In fact, most times, it's the
ones minding their own business

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.590
who suffer.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.370
That's a problem I still
don't have an answer for.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.510
Thank you.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:49.570
[ Applause ]

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.240
Now, I have quite a bit of time,

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.970
so we're going to
go to questions.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.270
Does anybody have questions?

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.600
And it doesn't have to be
a question about this book.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.110
Oh, come to the microphone
if you guys have questions.

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.780
I think I can barely see you.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.870
Those microphones, yes?

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.710
Yeah? So yeah, go ahead.

00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.650
&gt;&gt; The best writing advice
you can give to someone.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.950
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: My best
advice, the best writing advice

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.180
for anyone is to
read, and read widely.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.450
So the thing about, the thing
about reading is we tend

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.750
to read the same things.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.880
If you like zombie books, you
read a lot of zombie books.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.940
If you don't like
zombie books, you don't.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.240
And if you like, you know,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.000
like a lot of historical
fiction, you read that.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.640
But the thing about writing is
depending on what you're writing

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.410
and depending on who you
read, the craft is different.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:36.350
So it's really a great idea
to read as broadly as you can.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.190
Read non-fiction.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.790
Read mysteries.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.090
Read romance.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.390
And even if you don't like
romance or [inaudible]

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.470
but there's a lot of like
you can learn about emotion

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.090
and writing emotional
scenes from a romance.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.380
So if you read widely, what's
going to happen is you're going

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.830
to start to understand
how a story works.

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.990
Because depending on what
kind of story you write,

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:55.580
there are different tropes
and different functions

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:57.940
within those stories that
you're going to recognize.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:59.720
And also, you're just
going to learn how

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.050
like to really use words
in a way that's different.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.590
Most authors, there's a point
in a book where I will stop

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.570
and be like, "that
is so awesome!

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.250
I wish I had thought
of that sentence."

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.240
And like that is
really going to help you

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.630
when you go to the
page yourself.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.110
Next question.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:16.410
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:17.710
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: Hi!

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.010
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering, where
do you get your inspiration

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.310
from when you're writing?

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:22.990
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: I'm
really angry, so angry,

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.960
and the world just keeps
giving me more inspiration.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.650
Yeah, for a lot of
things, so, for example,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:31.980
like there were zombies
in Dread Nation,

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.850
but the book isn't
really about zombies.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.870
It's about a lot of other
things that we deal with.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:41.790
It's about things like
extrajudicial justice, and,

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.120
you know, power structures,
and who gets

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.690
to have the American dream
and who doesn't and why,

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.330
and what the stories were
told versus the reality.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.200
Because the thing is is like
you can't sit a person down

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.500
and like, "I'm going
to talk to you

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.110
about racism for four hours."

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:56.690
No one wants that, right?

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.160
That is sad making.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.860
But if you're like,
"I'm going to tell you

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.770
about historical zombies,"

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.070
you're like, okay,
I'm listening.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.370
That's a little different.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.760
And then I can kind of slip
in the important message.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.280
And I think that's
really what you have

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.580
to find your inspiration from.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:10.880
Like what makes you angry?

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.180
What makes you happy?

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.480
What do you think is
important for people

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.780
to think about and talk about?

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.080
Because that's going
to keep you on page.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.380
It is really-- you guys,

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.680
it takes a really long
time to write a book.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.190
So you have to really be
willing to stick with that story

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.590
for that entire time length.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.080
So what-- my inspiration
is what makes me move,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.560
and what makes me move is rage.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.860
Other people, it's love.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:31.650
Other people, it's
just telling a story.

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:35.060
So yeah. Thank you.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:40.480
&gt;&gt; So you write, you wrote
a historical fiction book,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.260
and I wanted to ask
you about your research

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:49.190
and other historical
fiction books that you like.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.080
So first of all, what's
your favorite historical

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.690
fiction book?

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.460
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: Okay,
so everyone is always like,

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.760
what's your favorite book?

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.060
I don't have a favorite book.

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.360
And this is why.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.660
I think whenever
you read a new book,

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:00.960
you find a new favorite
book, right?

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.330
There's always like--
unless I really hate a book,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.500
in which case I-- okay, I don't
finish a book if I hate it

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.610
because I'm not in school
anymore so I don't have to.

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:13.300
And even now, there's like,
you know, the internet exists.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.330
Like when I was in high
school back in the Dark Ages,

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.040
like you had to go to the Barnes
&amp; Noble and buy the CliffsNotes

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.340
if you wanted CliffsNotes.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:20.640
Now you can just Google it.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.940
It's like, what?

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.240
That's amazing.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:26.440
But I didn't usually read
a book for 50 pages, right?

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.740
And then if I don't like it

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.040
after 50 pages, I'm
like, I'm out.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.340
I pull pop smoke and roll out.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.650
Just because it's like I
have-- I don't have time.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:33.950
And life is short.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.250
And at some point, I will die.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.870
And I don't want my last
spot to be like, oh,

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.380
if only I had finished
War and Peace.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.040
So like I don't like read
long books unless they

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.340
like really pull me in.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.100
The best historical fiction
book I just read is--

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.700
Stacey Lee writes a lot of
these historical fiction books.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.990
And I think her last one she
wrote was Outrun the Moon,

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:59.040
which is about a girl in
Chinatown in San Francisco.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.400
And I tend to write-- when
I read historical fiction,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.680
I tend to read it for
perspectives that you don't get

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.060
in the classroom or you
don't get like every time

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.140
like 4th of July comes around.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.440
I'm like, I don't
need another story

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.740
about George Washington, right?

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.350
Like, I know what the dude did.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.120
We get it, George.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:19.010
But I think like I really want
to know like those perspectives

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.240
that we haven't heard
traditionally through history.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.270
I was in college the
first time I realized

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.300
that like history wasn't
all just like white dudes.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.880
I was like, oh, crap, there
are other people there too.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.180
Thanks, Howard Zinn.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.970
So like, I mean, like I think
it's really important to like,

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.430
to read those perspectives.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.010
And so that's what I
tend to read, okay?

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.310
So that was only
your first question.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.610
What was your second question?

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:42.280
&gt;&gt; I was just going to ask
about like how you take the past

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.780
and then you twist it like
into a different narrative.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.660
Like how do you do that?

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.400
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: So
that is the secret to life.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:56.130
Look, historians do
it all the time, man.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.520
Like all your history
books are like the story

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.660
that some dude decided
was the truth, right?

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.420
So like, okay, so like my
undergrad is in history,

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.290
and like I almost finished a--
I almost finished a master's

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:10.670
in history, and then I
went and did an MFA instead

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.190
because that's what
I do with my life.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:14.490
I never finish things.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:19.000
But the thing about history
is it's all about people,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.030
and it's all about
people reacting

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.710
to the events of the time.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.500
And if you know people, and the
people's mindset at that time,

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.770
you can change history to say
whatever you want it to be.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.490
Like I didn't know
until this year

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:35.530
that the Civil War
was not about slavery.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.910
Like that's, that's
amazing, guys!

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.000
Like all this time, I
thought it was about slavery.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.250
It's about economics apparently,

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.170
or states' rights,
one of those two.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.920
So like the idea is when you're
writing historical fiction,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.220
especially if you're writing,

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.520
if you're writing historical
fiction and you're doing

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.390
like something I do where you're
taking like a fantastical aspect

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.170
and introducing it into the
world, all you really need

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.510
to know is these are the
important events that happened,

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.360
and these are why
they happened, right?

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.660
Because people react
in a certain way

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.190
because of their
mindset at the time.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.640
And then you can write a book
where you change all that.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.890
If you're writing historical
fiction, my recommendation is

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:14.280
to read first-person
narratives of the time.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.330
So like I read Twelve Years
a Slave, then I read--

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:20.730
there's a whole bunch
of like first-person--

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.880
Frederick Douglass,
right, talks about that.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.180
I have a friend up here.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:25.830
Sorry. He's like flying around.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.300
And then like you can, like
you can start to read these.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.370
But then also it's important
to read the documents that are

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.670
from that time period.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:34.120
Newspapers are a
great way to figure

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.420
out how people think
about the day, right?

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.270
Like if you go and you pull
up like the Washington Post

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.360
and like the New York Times,
like the Wall Street Journal,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.460
you get a pretty accurate
picture of how messed

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.760
up this country is, right?

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.060
Because you're like, whoa,

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.360
these guys are all
saying the same thing,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.680
and oh, that's brilliant.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.100
And you can do that with
a lot of local papers.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.920
When I went to-- when I did my
undergrad in Savannah, Georgia,

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.390
and it was a bachelor's degree,

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.800
and it was like for
your final project,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.790
you had to like basically pick
like a week of Savannah history

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.560
and tell the story of that week.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.020
Because that's really
what historians do.

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.050
They take facts and
they interpret them

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:08.350
and they tell you a story.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.420
Sometimes those stories
make sense,

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.390
sometimes those stories
are just them trying

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.550
to get their Ph.D.
certification.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.190
But that's what you do.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.240
And so I was reading this story
in the Savannah Morning News,

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.420
which was the paper at the
time, and it was literally

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.640
about how people were
mad at this mailman.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.540
Like the postal carrier had
like embezzled funds, I think,

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.800
because I guess at some point
in history, the post office

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.200
like held people's money.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.700
And people like really
wanted to kill this mailman.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.780
And so there were like
letters to the editor,

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:37.020
there were different
reporters talking about this.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.900
I mean, it was a
postal carrier, dude.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.480
Like they were mad.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.780
They were really
mad at this mailman.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.240
And I was like, this
is brilliant.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.510
Like this tells you, like this
tells you how important the mail

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.810
is today.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.110
I mean, nowadays,
we're just like,

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:49.410
why do we each have
the postal system?

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.710
Let's cancel it, right?

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.010
So like, I mean like, so I think
that's really what you're--

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.890
when you're writing
anything historical fiction,

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.500
the biggest important
part is the people

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.800
and the people's story.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.790
And that's one of the reasons
you have to kind of read widely,

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.390
because a lot of
times the people

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:04.500
who are telling the history are
not the entirety of the people

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.800
who existed at that time.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.840
So you want to find those
hidden stories as well.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:10.440
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: Thanks.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.820
Is there another question?

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.310
Please be another question.

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.610
[ Inaudible ]

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:17.910
&gt;&gt; Hi!

&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: Hi!

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:20.510
Thank you.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.510
&gt;&gt; You're very interesting.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.130
[ Laughter ]

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.200
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland:
Did my mom call you?

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.500
&gt;&gt; I will be honest.

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.800
The reason why I say that is

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.290
because I'm a high
school librarian,

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.400
and I have a book service
through Junior Library Guild

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.700
that comes every month.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.200
And your book, Dread
Nation, came through.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.540
Had never heard of it,
never heard of you.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:47.460
And interestingly, it just
came a week or two ago,

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.420
so I haven't had a chance
to look at it and read it.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.450
And it's on my desk.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.480
And I'll see it on Tuesday
when I go back to work.

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.130
But what's interesting
is for years, off and on,

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:01.440
I've tried to get teens to
understand the importance

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.460
of history and reading.

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.290
And when you first started
talking and reading your story

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.550
about zombies, I'm like,
what does that have to do

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:12.700
with racism, this,
that and the other?

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.560
But listening to you,
I'm going to go back,

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.550
I'm going to read the
book, and then I'm going

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.120
to see how I can come up with
ways to pull in your story

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.270
as a means to cook them.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.590
It's a different way of
presenting information

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:29.230
that they need in a way I
wouldn't have thought of,

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.970
and that's why I said
you were interesting.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.270
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: Thank you.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.570
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:34.870
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: I'm going
to take that as a compliment.

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:36.170
&gt;&gt; It is.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.420
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: The
thing about zombie stories,

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.150
they're never about
the zombies, right?

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.360
The zombies are like this
really gross metaphor

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.460
for everything you hate
in the world, right?

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:49.680
And so George Romero's zombies
are literally about capitalism

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.070
and what capitalism
does to people

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.470
and how it makes people
just kind of awful.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.650
There's a book called The
Reapers are the Angels

00:23:58.650 --> 00:23:59.950
by Alden Bell.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.250
It's a zombie book.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.650
And it's literally a book about
grief and how do you let go

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.910
of those things that
don't exist anymore.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:11.110
And so like when you read
a zombie book, if it's just

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:16.000
about the zombies, the
author did something wrong.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.180
Because like really running away

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.480
from a rotting corpse is
only really interesting

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.070
for about 50 pages, and then I
close the book and put it away.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.280
And so like, like really
zombies, there is a book,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.920
it's an academic book, so,
I mean, it's a little dry,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.370
but it's called Better Off Dead,
and it's literally a series

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.260
of essays about what zombies
represent in the culture.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:38.280
The first introduction
of zombie-lore

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:42.970
into this country was after the
United States occupied Haiti

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.240
in the early 20th century, and
it was kind of these stories

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.330
to try to talk about
how like Haiti was one

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.620
of the few countries
in like the, you know,

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.310
western hemisphere that
was completely independent

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:56.810
of like water rule, right?

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.200
So we all know-- do we all
know the story of Haiti?

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.500
Okay, yeah?

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.800
Yeah. Someone said, "yeah."

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.100
Everyone else was like, "ah!"

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.400
Okay, so Haiti had a revolution.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.040
Woo! Yay! We've having a
revolution in the early 1800s.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.230
Basically, all the people who
were enslaved said, "hell, no,

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:10.810
we're done," and
killed everybody.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:12.730
They killed all the landowners.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.200
A lot of people fled
to New Orleans,

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.370
which is why you have kind of
like that like French and Creole

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.520
and like those very like, you
know, mixy-mixy kind of cities,

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.920
and these different
cultures kind of clashing.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.610
And then like after
they destroyed

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.910
and burned all the plantations

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.210
and took all the
land of [inaudible].

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.250
France came in and said, "hmm,
you cost us a lot of money.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.550
You need to pay us money.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.730
You need to pay us,
because that was wrong."

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.380
And the United States was one
of the countries that was like,

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.740
yeah, you need to pay
them, like, right?

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:41.170
And so these very like,
these very terrible kind

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.900
of like reparations
were put into Haiti,

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.850
and so Haiti became-- that's
why Haiti is still a very poor

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:47.150
country to this day.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:51.630
But the first like incidence
of these zombie-lore was

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.230
because Vodun was
the, like the coming

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.150
of the practicing religions
there, and it's tied to a lot

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.320
of West African beliefs.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.750
And when American soldiers
went and occupied Haiti

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.630
in the early 1900s, they
were like, they're dancing

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.000
in the fields, and they're
dead, and oh my gosh,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.550
these crazy black people!

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:11.430
And literally the evolution of
the zombie myth is oh my gosh,

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.980
crazy black people, which
is kind of funny today

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.440
because it still keeps going on.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.790
And so like that's one
of the things about like

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.430
when you're talking about
history and you're talking

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.730
about myth and you're talking

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.750
about what does a
zombie really mean,

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:25.740
because stories are never
what they say, right?

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.360
A dragon isn't really about
like a fire-breathing lizard,

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.660
you guys.

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.960
Like a dragon sits
on a gold hoard.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.410
It's about people
who control wealth,

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:34.920
much to the detriment
of others, right?

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.350
Like so these fantastical or
fantasy metaphors like exist

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:40.710
in all the books we read.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:43.350
It's just like are
we seeing that?

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:46.180
And that's really I think--
I mean, like my friend,

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.220
Dhonielle Clayton, wrote
a book called The Belles,

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.070
and in this society, nobody
has, nobody has any features.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.430
Everyone was kind of born gray.

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.430
And these magical women who are
beautiful make them beautiful.

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:58.830
But the book isn't
really about that, right?

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.200
The book is about
slavery, and the book is

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.230
about beauty standards, and
it's about all these other

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.740
like very complicated,
hard-to-talk-about subjects,

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.960
because again, no one
wants to hear you talk

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.630
about beauty standards
for four hours, right,

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:11.040
but they will read a book.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.600
And so that's really
like when you're back

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.160
to like getting your kids to
like connect with history,

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.890
like there are kids who
love historical fiction.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.690
I was a kid who loved
historical fiction.

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:21.510
I didn't love like not seeing
myself in historical fiction.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.810
That sucked.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:25.050
But you know what's even
better than historical fiction?

00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.570
Zombies, because you can't
get away from zombies.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.100
And I don't mean that like as
like ooh, zombies chase you.

00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:32.390
I mean that more
like in the culture.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.740
So yeah, so I think like
that's where when we read,

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:37.010
especially in YA, YA, why
you only read things about YA

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.640
as a category is it has
the flexibility to say,

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.950
I'm going to teach you important
things about race, with zombies

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:47.730
and some more history, which
you don't necessarily get a lot

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.880
of in other categories,
each categories.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.180
Adults are too bitter.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.480
Like we're too like,
we're like, whoa,

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.780
what are these zombies doing?

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.360
That would never happen, 50
pages later, so, you know,

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.040
kids have a little
more flexibility.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.340
You've been so patient.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.640
Thank you so much.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.940
&gt;&gt; Oh, no problem.

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.620
What are you reading right now?

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.580
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: So okay, so
right now, my brain is so tired.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:12.170
I'm reading a romance book.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:13.970
What is it called?

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:17.480
[ Inaudible ]

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.860
Yeah, yeah, the one
with the sword maker?

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.460
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: Yeah,
that's what I'm reading.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:23.760
I haven't started it yet.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.060
I just bought it,
and I have like,

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.360
I have a really early
flight tomorrow.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.660
I'm like, tomorrow?

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.960
You with me, guys?

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.340
I love romance.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.510
I think the world is a
burning trash fire right now,

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:33.890
so romance has been
like my go-to.

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:40.540
And so like yeah, so I'm really
excited to read this book.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.910
The last book I read that I
really loved was The Mere Wife

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:48.480
by Maria Dahvana Headley,
which is not a romance.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.990
It's the retelling of Beowulf,

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:56.570
but Grendel's mother is a
PTSD war vet, and it talks

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.120
about the nature of
monsters, and like who gets

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.480
to be a monster and who gets
to be-- live in a castle.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.860
And it's just like--
I'm getting chills.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:04.830
Actually, I want to put an
air conditioner in the book.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.080
But anyway, it's a
really good book,

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.380
and it's not a very long book.

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:10.490
It's like 200 and I
think 70 pages, which,

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.910
to me, is a short novel.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.250
And so it's really
worth it, yeah.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.880
So those are my lysical
[phonetic].

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.180
I love lysical [phonetic] books.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:19.050
They're like, they're
just so nice.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:21.810
And then Maria Dahvana
Headley's Mere Wife.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.300
&gt;&gt; I loved-- oh, sorry.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.550
I loved Dread Nation
so much, and you've put

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:29.740
in such a cliffhanger, I
can't wait for the sequel.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.040
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: Me too!

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.640
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland:
Writing is so hard.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but, you know,

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.400
one of the things I really
loved was how relationships

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.960
like evolve and change, or
the sense of mystery with Jane

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.110
and her mother, and then
with Jane and Katherine.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:47.290
So I was wondering, because it's
not a spoiler, if you could talk

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.820
about Jane and Katherine,
and maybe sort

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.120
of your thought processes
behind that,

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:53.230
the inspiration behind
that, female friendship.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.450
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland: Yeah, okay,
so if you haven't read the book,

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.310
it's like a minor
spoiler, but not really,

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.990
because you knew it
was going to happen.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.170
But in the beginning of the
book, Jane has a girl she hates.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.470
She absolutely hates this girl.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.570
This girl is like her
competition to be best

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.250
at the school, and she's
like, whatever, she sucks.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:08.800
Also, she's light-skinned,
so she's [inaudible]

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.520
because she could pass as white.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.800
And by the end of the
book, they're friends.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.500
Because I really am so
tired of girl hate tropes.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.510
Like really when I sat down to
write it, it was like, oh, yeah,

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.570
she hates it because she's
blonde and she's pretty

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.870
and she's good at everything.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:24.940
And then by the time I got
halfway through the book,

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.500
I was like, man, this sucks,
like this is terrible, Justina,

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.160
you need to fix this, because I
rarely have those conversations

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.460
with myself while I'm writing.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.070
And so I want to talk
about female friendships.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:39.320
So in YA, we have so
many romances, right?

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.090
And I love romance.

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.970
But that is not the most
important relationship

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.270
in your life.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.640
Like, I mean, like
okay, and I say this

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.110
to somebody who's been
married like 20 years,

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.460
but like the female friendships,
like especially for women,

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.180
the friendships you have,
the friendships you develop,

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.200
and why those friendships
work or don't work,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.670
why they fall apart, to me was
like something I really wanted

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:57.970
to talk about and explore.

00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.270
And I also wanted to talk

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.650
about that difficult mother
relationship, which I actually,

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.610
fun fact, talk about
in all my books,

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.520
because all my characters
are angry

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.380
and have these fraught
relationships with their mother.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.360
And not because I have a fraught
relationship with my mother,

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.470
but because that mother/daughter
relationship is really the first

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.690
female relationship
you have in your life.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.130
And I say female,
but like obviously

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.940
that includes anybody who, you
know, considers herself a woman.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.690
I don't want to try to limit
that to just like biology.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.750
But like that is a very fraught
relationship in your life.

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.860
And at some point,
it comes from--

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.380
it goes from being nurturing
to competitive, right?

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.200
In everybody's life, it happens.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.580
It doesn't necessarily happen
between fathers and daughters

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.540
because the competition is
not necessarily the same.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.280
And I want to talk about, I
want to talk about the idea

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.290
of competition between
women, because I think a lot

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:50.530
of times we let ourselves fall
into these really terrible traps

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.720
about we're in competition
with each other,

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.390
but it's like no, we're not.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:59.020
Like don't take this the
wrong way, but men suck.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.130
And they're like, like making
you think you're in competition

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.960
with each other so they can
sell you body cream or sell you,

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.230
you know, pimple cream,
or like make sure you're

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:10.910
so busy fighting with each
other, you don't notice

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.330
that they're taking everything.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.190
And so I wanted to talk
about that, like this idea

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:16.990
of like a female friendship.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.740
And then also kind of like
poke fun at the YA trope

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:25.100
of like the mean girl and the
girl who like, who torments her.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.200
Yeah, I just think, I just think
relationships with women are

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.850
so like-- it took me
a really long time.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.590
So before I was a
writer, a long time ago

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.070
when I was a little
baby, just, you know,

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:37.310
I was in the Army, right?

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.610
And every-- thank you.

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:41.260
And every girl I knew
in the Army was not

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.050
like other girls, right?

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.930
But we were all there
together doing the same thing,

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:46.560
suffering the same
things, right?

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.710
So I really wanted to take
that trope and kind of stab it

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.620
in the eye because we're
all just like other girls,

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.160
which is why we should all try
to figure out some common ground

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.460
and support each other.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.840
So that was my feminist
platform.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.400
Sorry. I'll put my soapbox away.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.700
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:03.000
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland:
You're welcome.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.300
All right, I have two minutes,

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.600
so if anybody has any
one last question.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.680
We have time for
one last question.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.270
Go ahead.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:14.890
&gt;&gt; What's the best way to
convey emotion in your writing?

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:16.600
&gt;&gt; Justina Ireland:
You would have

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.140
to ask somebody who's actually
good at writing emotion.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.260
[ Laughter ]

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.580
You're like, I read your book!

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.880
You're lying!

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.180
Thank you!

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.400
For me, I don't write
emotion in the first draft.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.930
And the first draft
was mostly just events

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:32.510
and people responding
to those events.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.820
Emotion comes later, when I
know where the story is going,

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.080
and where I know where
the character arc is.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:39.030
I would say the best
way to buy emotion is

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.060
to visualize the scene.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.490
What is the character
doing with their hands?

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:43.790
Where are they moving?

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.090
You know, like when I'm nervous,

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.390
you can see I talk
with my hands, right?

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.690
So I'm all up here with my
hands, like [inaudible].

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.400
When I'm sad, I'm probably
looking down at the ground.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.050
So just think about like what
people do with their bodies

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:54.490
when they're feeling
a certain way.

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.580
I mean, you can tell me
you're sad, but if you say

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:59.780
like her eyes were downcast
and her shoulders slumped,

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.920
that conveys the emotion better
than saying, "I'm sad," right?

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.930
So think about that physicality.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.540
So all right, you guys,
that's all I have.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.010
Thank you so much
for staying it out.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.520
