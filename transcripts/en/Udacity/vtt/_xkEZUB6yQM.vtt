00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So let's say we have a slightly more complicated grammar.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
T is our start symbol; it goes to (p Q r)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or (p Q s), so there are two strings in this grammar.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It will 100 percent increase, over the previous grammar--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(p Q r) and (p Q s) are both there--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the input is: (P q r)--wow, that's really lucky!

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That's one of the strings in the grammar.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's almost as if we planned these things in advance.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So now we'll give you a chance to try this out.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I have written down, here,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
five possible facts about the parsing chart

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for this grammar, on this 3-token input.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Chart[1] has this, chart[1] has that.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is an element of chart[1], this is an element of chart[2].

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And what I'd like you to do in this multiple multiple choice quiz

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is check all of the boxes that are correct.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So if we do see: big (Q) goes to little (q) dot,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
from 1 in chart[2], check this box.

00:00:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Check all the boxes that apply.
