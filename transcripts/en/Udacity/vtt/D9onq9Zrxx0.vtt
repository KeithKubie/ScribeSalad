00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.738
Network-only tries to handle
the requests by fetching the URL from

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:05.735
the network.

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:09.025
If the fetch fails, the request fails.

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:13.814
Network-only is ideal for things that
don't have an offline equivalent, for

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:17.252
example, analytics pings,
non-get requests, etc.
