00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.800
First we had an overview 
of the DSC program,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.000
how to create a good core team

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.080
and how to maintain a community you've built.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320
The most memorable for me was

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.360
the session about design thinking

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.960
where we talked about how to find
problems in our surroundings.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.720
So if you want to know how to develop apps

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.000
And the knowledge gained here
I will apply at my university

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.200
and in the communities I will build.
