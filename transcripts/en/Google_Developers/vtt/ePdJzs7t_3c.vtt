SOWMYA SUBRAMANIAN:
And today we have

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.660
a panel on Engineering
Your Career.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.830
And it's going to be led
by Deepti Srivastava,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.160
a technical program manager
at Google, the Storage Group.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.920
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA:
Thank, Sowmya.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.450
Welcome to engineering
your career.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.670
I'm Deepti, and we have a
panel of fantastic women here

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.190
who represent various different
career paths and career

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.040
choices that you can have with
an engineering degree, some

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.110
of which you may not
even know existed.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.450
So since we have a very short
time, let's go right into it.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.010
Let's start with you Shambhavi.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.511
And why don't you tell us about
who you are and what you do.

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:43.718
SHAMBHAVI KADAM: Hi everyone.

00:00:43.718 --> 00:00:44.890
My name is Shambhavi.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.770
I've trained as an aerospace
engineering at MIT.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.510
I worked at Boeing
for a couple of years,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.840
where my job was to put
the internet in space.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.590
I installed wi-fi on the space
station and space shuttle.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.180
After that, went
back to MIT because I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.520
didn't like sleeping very much.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.820
Got my MBA and started
a company while I

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.360
was there with another brilliant
woman named Kim Gordon.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.040
We were both very into the arts,
so we started a company that

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.510
was called Voir, we just
changed our name to Depict.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.860
JAY WONG: Hi everyone,
I'm Jay Wong.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.300
I studied computer
science and design at UNSW

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.340
in Sydney, Australia.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.840
I started my own company doing
software building business

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.130
enterprise software, and now
I'm a UI design and prototyper

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.092
on the Google+ Hangouts team.

00:01:28.092 --> 00:01:29.550
ELLIE POWERS: Hi,
I'm Ellie Powers.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.140
I grew up here in the Bay Area.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.240
I did my computer
science degree at MIT.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.490
But I always found people
to be just a little bit more

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.832
interesting than technology.

00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:39.790
So I was happy to find
a way to bring those two

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.860
things together.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.490
I've been a product manager
for about 10 years working here

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.277
in the Bay Area in
Paris and London.

00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:48.360
I'm currently a product
manager on the Google Play

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.990
team working in
the mobile space.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.150
DEE SPEED: Hi, I'm Dee Speed, a
UX design manager and lead here

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.150
at Google.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.390
My career started in
a very strange place.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.050
I actually have a bachelor of
science or premedical sciences

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.830
in biochemistry and physics
with a double major in art.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.410
I actually began as a medical
and scientific illustrator.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.070
Got out of medicine
and decided I

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.580
wanted to teach myself design.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.680
So I'm completely self-taught
from beginning to end,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.800
have worked at companies
like Google, Yahoo, Amazon,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.680
Microsoft.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.300
You name it, I've probably
been there and worked for them.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.810
And this is where I am today.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.060
Nice to meet all of you.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.370
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: So we
all know my name by now.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.510
It's Deepti, and I'm
a technical program

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.480
manager in Google
infrastructure.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.540
I did my undergrad in
England in computer science

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.190
and then did grad school
at Carnegie Mellon

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.100
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.270
And then when I grew up-- and
born and grew up in India.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.500
So this is the farthest I can
be from home, like, literally.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.820
This is a 24 to 30
hour journey back home.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.150
So yeah, here I am.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.650
And similar to what
Ellie said, I really

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.700
like science and technology
and critical thinking,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.680
but I also like people.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.340
And I wanted to find a
way to bridge that gap.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.720
And I also like sort of
translating between technology

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.370
and not technology and
business and product and design

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.450
and various different things
that you can put together

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.750
to make what is a
technical product.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.690
So I find myself in this role
now as a technical program

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.400
manager, and it's really fun.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.240
So the way we want to
do this is basically

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.540
allow you guys to
ask us questions.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.916
So we have a few volunteers
in the room that have mics,

00:03:36.916 --> 00:03:38.790
so if you could raise
your hand when you have

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.824
a question for us, we can
try and answer it for you.

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:44.865
There's one in the front.

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.970
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.260
My name is Rasha.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.530
I moved to the US
four months ago.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.640
And that was right
after I decided

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.970
to change my career
path from social media

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.530
strategies and event planning
to actually programming.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.420
And I got into that,
and I participated

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.410
in a contest was like
between Udacity and Google.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.960
That was awesome, and
I developed this game.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.710
And I won for the
most innovative game.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.670
And it was like, oh my God,
I'm doing amazing things.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.640
Then I had this bad idea
of applying for jobs.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.060
And the first job I
applied for was for Google,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.650
and it was the worst
experience of my life.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.600
I'm sorry, no
offense for Google,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.150
but that was my first
job interview ever.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.070
I didn't know what to expect.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.660
And I wanted to do front
end based of what I did

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.480
and what I loved.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.190
I didn't know what to
say or do, and I ended up

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.700
saying I'm too stupid
to be in Silicon Valley.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.300
That's it.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.430
That must be the problem.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.990
And I cried myself out.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.660
It took an hour, then I was
back to programming and reading

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.160
again.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.880
Ever since I came
to Silicon Valley,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.880
I have no life whatsoever, no
friends, I just do programming.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.670
And I even have a study buddy
where I do algorithms for fun.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.710
So I know I want
to do with this.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.480
After this Google
experience, I actually

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.440
managed within the last two
months I built two websites,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.300
I'm a mentor at Technovation.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.850
I got someone to
sponsor me, to offer me

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.370
a sponsorship for Hack Pride.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.370
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: Sure.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.092
AUDIENCE: But I still
feel I'm nowhere.

00:05:35.092 --> 00:05:36.550
And I don't know
where to go, and I

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.540
don't know what-- I might have
applied for the wrong job.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.750
How do I know that I'm
applying for the right one?

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.260
I know what I'd
like, but I don't

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.760
know what title is fit for that.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.300
So what should I do?

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.440
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: Let's
start with it's not easy.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.924
Yeah, sure.

00:05:52.924 --> 00:05:54.340
So I think the
question really is,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.930
how you do you find the right
fit, find the right job, right.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.030
And we can throw
it to the panel.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.810
But I think, first
of all, it's not

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.090
easy for anyone or most people.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.460
So you're not alone.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.550
And the second thing
is, don't give up.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.710
It's not about you and
that you don't fit.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.330
If you are passionate about
something, it'll come out.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.470
You'll find the right fit.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.649
So you have to keep trying.

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:19.440
But I was wondering if
any of the panelists

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.240
had a similar experience
and if you can talk to it.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.180
ELLIE POWERS: I can.

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.570
One time, when I was looking for
a job, I applied to 250 jobs.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.620
And then I found a job.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.790
I was actually in a
slightly similar situation,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.380
moving from one country where I
was not from to another country

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.170
where I was not from,
having no connections,

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.240
not even knowing what
job websites to go on.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.159
I know that that can be
incredibly stressful.

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:47.200
It sounds like you're a
really passionate person.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.069
But the great thing about
jobs, you only need one.

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:52.610
Only one of them
has to come through.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.090
Or, even better yet, none
of them will come through.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.290
You'll start your own thing.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:57.956
It'll turn out to be
awesome, and you'll

00:06:57.956 --> 00:06:59.230
be interviewing other people.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.120
So I guess I would just say,
your experience is not alone.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.120
It doesn't mean you're
doing the wrong things.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.840
And try doing some
interviews like fake ones,

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.050
or apply for jobs that
you really don't want.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.880
I actually did this
when I was a student.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.622
I signed up.

00:07:13.622 --> 00:07:16.080
I knew that there were going
to be some interviews I really

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.610
wanted to get through,
and there were other ones

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.607
that I would just stick
my resume to saying,

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:22.190
I definitely don't
want to work there,

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.449
but I just want to see
what this is all about.

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.740
And so maybe finding if you're
already doing mentoring,

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.830
maybe there's someone who
can fake interview you.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.629
Or you can go to an interview
for something just as practice.

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.170
Because I think it
can be really hard

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.380
when you're very
tied to the outcome,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.060
and then it's super
disappointing.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.450
But the first time you try to
do a cartwheel or something

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:40.770
like that, it's
not going to work.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.103
The first time you go to a
job interview, not getting it

00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:45.050
I think is like
par for the course.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.670
So just know that you
have to apply to 250 jobs.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.110
So you've done one.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.830
So that means you have 249 left.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.626
So just check them off.

00:07:52.626 --> 00:07:54.000
And if you get a
job before that,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.090
you're doing really awesome.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:55.902
AUDIENCE: How do
you know you applied

00:07:55.902 --> 00:07:57.120
for the right type of jobs?

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.960
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: So--

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.637
JAY WONG: I guess you
can go ahead, Dee.

00:08:00.637 --> 00:08:01.491
I'm sorry.

00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:02.907
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA:
Oh, Jay, sorry.

00:08:02.907 --> 00:08:07.770
Yeah, I was just thinking that
to Ellie's point right there,

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.970
now there are so many
resources out there.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.350
You can go online,
you can look up

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.830
what the interview
questions are,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:16.170
you can look up what people
think about jobs, like what

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.084
type of job they applied
for, what the outcome was,

00:08:19.084 --> 00:08:21.000
what it that was missing
in their resume, what

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.210
was it that was missing
in their questions.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.120
Practice for anything
is important.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.790
And as Ellie said,
you have to start

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:32.080
with the ones you
don't care about.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.650
The other thing
about job interviews

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.604
is we're all really stressed
out about getting a job.

00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:39.020
But the point of
the job interview

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.460
is not just you
being interviewed,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.859
but you also figuring out
if the people you're talking

00:08:43.859 --> 00:08:45.400
are the people you
want to work with.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.983
What is the kind of
work you're doing?

00:08:46.983 --> 00:08:50.150
So that you understand what
the job role really means

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.080
and whether it's a
fit for you or not.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.840
That's how you figure out if
you're-- the title is almost

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.990
immaterial in some sense.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.410
Let's say there's a title
VP of blah blah blah.

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.980
The point is, what does it mean
for you to work at that job?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.040
What are they
expecting from you?

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.430
And do you want to be
doing those things?

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.710
Like if you got an interview
with Google or Facebook

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.450
or whoever, and you went there
and the job that they described

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.550
that you had to do, you
didn't like, it's OK.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.490
It's OK to say no.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.700
It's OK to be like, this
is not the right fit,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.110
maybe I should try
something else.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.580
So it's a matter
of trial and error

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.770
and also educating
yourself beforehand.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.770
SHAMBHAVI KADAM: Jay,
were you saying something?

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.580
JAY WONG: And also, the role
that you're being hired for,

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.110
you can kind of
make it your own.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:37.050
Even though I was hired as
a user interfaces designer,

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.820
I also have a computer
science background.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.736
And I found that I
really missed doing

00:09:40.736 --> 00:09:41.860
a lot of engineering stuff.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.630
So I kind of have moved into
more of a prototyping role.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.720
And that's not necessarily on
my title still, but day to day,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.640
I'm doing a lot of technical
building things, building apps,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.330
and I guess that you can
kind of make your career

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:00.010
or make your job role
be whatever it is.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:00.950
And you don't have
to just think,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.533
I'm being hired for
this role and this

00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:04.710
is the only thing I'm ever
going to be able to do.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:06.480
Just know you can kind
of move and create

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.970
your own career path.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.887
SHAMBHAVI KADAM: Do we
have another question?

00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:11.470
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA:
Thank you for that.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.550
AUDIENCE: Say you want
to switch into a role

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.420
that you have no experience in.

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.900
For example, you want
to do machine learning

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:27.600
and you complete a machine
learning course on Coursera,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.390
but every time you apply
for that particular job

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.070
in every company
they're like, you

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.480
don't have experience
so we'll not hire you.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.292
What's your advice on that?

00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:39.500
DEE SPEED: It only takes
one hiring manager somewhere

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.130
along the line to
believe in you.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.850
So first of all, don't
stop and give up.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.880
If I had done that,
I would not be here.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:54.640
I drew pictures of bugs and
cellular matrices of plants.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.440
And yet, to say today that I
lead a design team at Google,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.370
it's a big feat.

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.080
Actually, this goes
along with what

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.980
you had spoken about as well.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.070
Be careful who you
compare yourself to.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.190
It's very easy, especially
in Silicon Valley,

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:11.669
to get caught up in
this bubble that I

00:11:11.669 --> 00:11:14.210
need to be as good as this other
person that I've heard about

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.120
or that term rock star,
we had a discussion

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.020
about this earlier,
who's being bandied about

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.440
so much and so often.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.670
Just really be careful who
you compare yourself to,

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.700
and honestly don't give up.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:28.730
Our industry changes so much.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.110
You take four months
off, four to six months,

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.230
and something new is
available yet again.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.320
Just keep at it.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.570
And really, it'll come down
to there's that one hiring

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.140
manager that looks at you and
sees that potential and says,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.714
you know what, that's fine.

00:11:41.714 --> 00:11:43.130
Because at the end
of the day, why

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.876
I would hire you based
on your potential

00:11:44.876 --> 00:11:49.520
is you're probably going to be
a more long term, comfortable

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.590
employee.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.510
I've invested in you, you feel
comfortable, you've grown here,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:54.530
you learned a lot.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.100
You're also more likely to
stay than the hotshot guy who's

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.970
looking for their next fix.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.250
They're more likely to move
on a lot quickly, right.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.530
So there's a lot to be said
for just sticking to your craft

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.194
and being adamant
about it, that that's

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:08.360
the path you want to follow.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:08.970
SHAMBHAVI KADAM: I'm going to--

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:10.820
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: This
is my exact, sorry,

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.220
this is my exact what
happened to me last

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.530
14 months ago for a year before
I became a technical program

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.530
manager in Google
infrastructure.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.710
That I knew I wanted
this job where

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.190
I wanted to lead
a technical team,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.820
I wanted to be part
of the technology,

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.050
but I wanted to do more
than just programming, which

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.100
is what I had been
doing for a long time.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.400
And the thing is, when
somebody sees your resume

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.110
and sees that you have 6
years of systems engineering

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.707
experience, that's what
they want to hire your for,

00:12:41.707 --> 00:12:43.540
because that's where
you've proven yourself.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:47.070
But it takes, as Dee said,
it takes one hiring manager.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.100
And it took me a
year to get that job,

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.120
because I kept saying this
is-- no, I don't want this,

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.450
I want that.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:58.820
So I'm going to keep on asking
for that job until I find it.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.000
I'm not going to settle.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.430
The one thing you have to be
comfortable with in yourself

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.460
is this is really
my passion, this

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.279
is really where I
know I will be good,

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:09.070
and if I haven't proven
myself that's fine.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.900
I've proven myself in
these other things.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.135
I'm a good engineer,
I've managed--

00:13:14.135 --> 00:13:17.180
you have to highlight
how what you want to do

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.240
is something you can
learn on the job for sure.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.180
But you also have to have
the confidence to say,

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.010
I want to do this.

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.470
This is what I'm going to
do, I'm not going to settle.

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.303
So whatever else you
offer me, I don't want.

00:13:27.303 --> 00:13:27.842
I want this.

00:13:27.842 --> 00:13:29.300
SHAMBHAVI KADAM:
And I want to 100%

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.550
agree with everything
that they've said.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.537
At my company, we've
been hiring recently,

00:13:33.537 --> 00:13:35.620
and we really look for
that potential in a person,

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.382
even if they don't necessarily
have the degree in computer

00:13:38.382 --> 00:13:40.090
science or a degree
in what they've done,

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:41.750
we look for your
passion projects.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.270
What are you working
on on the side?

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.690
And if you can show
something really

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.330
cool and interesting
that you've built,

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.130
were very interested
in talking to you.

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:50.088
And I think that's
something that you could do.

00:13:50.088 --> 00:13:52.280
Obviously, you have a
passion for building things

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.770
and you want to
learn new things.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.640
And if you can show that
person who's interviewing you

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.520
that, yeah, I don't
have a degree in this

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.186
but I've built something
cool around it,

00:14:00.186 --> 00:14:04.050
or I'm very passionate about
it and I do it on the side,

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.050
it's going to come out
and it's going to show.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.160
DEE SPEED: If the hiring manager
is very smart and strategic,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.265
they would hire
you, because you're

00:14:11.265 --> 00:14:12.890
putting your passion
into your project.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.780
I would rather hire
you than someone

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.970
who'd been doing the
same job for 10 years

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.080
and they were tired of it.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.574
You're not going to get
the motivation out of them

00:14:21.574 --> 00:14:23.490
in the same way that you
would, because you're

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:24.900
more likely to try harder.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.570
SHAMBHAVI KADAM:
Absolutely, you're

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.210
looking for fresh energy, like
a new perspective on things.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.732
And I think that's
very, very valuable,

00:14:30.732 --> 00:14:32.440
and that's something
you can show people.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.670
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: So
maybe after this, we

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.378
can get a question on
the back, because I

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.590
feel like the peeps over
there are getting neglected,

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:42.840
and we don't want that.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.470
Hi.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:44.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.970
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.740
AUDIENCE: So see, if you were
working as a senior software

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.555
engineer in a small
company and you

00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:52.370
got a really good
opportunity in Google

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:55.530
but that position itself
were a junior, right?

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:59.140
So it's like the emotion
in a kind of a title,

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.850
whereas it's not that emotion.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.550
Maybe you are working with the
really cool people in Google,

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.960
but you have a senior
software engineer

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.570
and sometimes people are
like, no, title matters.

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.700
How can you overcome that?

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.380
And because instead of going
into higher in your career,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.359
you are just climbing
down the hill.

00:15:20.359 --> 00:15:21.900
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA:
So is the question

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.552
that you're getting
a job as a similar--

00:15:24.552 --> 00:15:27.010
AUDIENCE: So you are working
as a senior software engineer,

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:31.670
but although you are
trying for senior position,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.753
but you get the software
engineer position.

00:15:33.753 --> 00:15:34.794
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: I see.

00:15:34.794 --> 00:15:35.730
Mm-hmm, OK.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.470
AUDIENCE: Although that
position has more innovation,

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.692
but the title itself
takes senior out of it.

00:15:41.692 --> 00:15:43.650
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: Yeah,
so the question really

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.750
is what do you do if
you get an opportunity,

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.490
but the title isn't
what you're expecting

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.730
in terms of career
acceleration or career growth.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.820
So do any of you want to
take it, or shall I go?

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.800
SHAMBHAVI KADAM: I
mean, for someone

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.240
who works at a small company,
I can tell you that titles 100%

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.440
don't matter.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.940
It might be different,
I don't know,

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.190
if you're at a bigger company.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.029
But we have people
who we will promote up

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:09.570
if they do a really good job
and prove themselves on the job.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.370
And show them, show
us, that you have

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.750
the passion and
the capability, we

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.040
will give you the
responsibilities that you need.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.080
But as for titles, I would
never let that slow you down.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.070
You can show people what
you can do on the job,

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.445
especially if it's
an opportunity

00:16:22.445 --> 00:16:23.530
that you really want.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.190
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: So I think
another thing to think about

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.850
is that why do you
want that senior title?

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.210
What is it giving you?

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.120
Is that your peers are
giving you validation?

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.090
Is it that you're getting
validation yourself?

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:40.260
Is it that with that title comes
a different compensation layer?

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.310
What is it?

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.330
So for example,
in my team, people

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:50.240
from level two to level six
are all software engineers.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.860
I mean, and all TPMs are TPMs.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.340
I'm not going to tell
you I'm TPM level x.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.695
What does that tell you?

00:16:56.695 --> 00:16:59.870
What does that tell you
about my ability to do X Y Z?

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.530
So that is very
important, I think,

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.569
especially if you want
to have a 30 year career

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:07.760
and you have a long
term trajectory.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.839
What is it?

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.579
Are you tying your
self-worth to your title,

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:15.089
or is the title giving
you something else?

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.460
So if you do a good
job-- so first of all,

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.816
if you're in a company where
the only thing that matters

00:17:19.816 --> 00:17:22.190
is the title and that's the
only reason why people listen

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.400
to you, you might want
to think about why

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.160
you want to be in that company.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.840
And the second thing
is, the real validation

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:32.450
is when you get responsibility
and when your peers respect you

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.240
for your opinion and when
your managers compensate you

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:40.184
in various ways for
being part of that team.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.350
That is the real validation.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.910
There's no point in
being VP and then

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.040
getting the same type of
compensation or validation

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.160
or [INAUDIBLE] as
somebody who's junior.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.650
So you really have to look at
whether you're tying yourself

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.480
to a title, and
whether where you are

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.384
is really respecting your input.

00:17:56.384 --> 00:17:58.550
DEE SPEED: There are times,
and there will be times,

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:02.200
in your career when it actually
is a very strategic move

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.530
to take a step
backwards, or what

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:06.050
may feel like a step backwards.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.630
But you have to
figure out, is it

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.910
because I'm gaining something
for myself out of it?

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.110
Are you learning new
skills that otherwise you

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.369
wouldn't have done?

00:18:14.369 --> 00:18:15.410
Think about it like this.

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.550
Can I learn new skills in a
less high profile environment

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.180
where there's less stress?

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.880
I can focus on that and just get
better at whatever my craft is,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.710
and then this is yet another
tick on my resume of something

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:28.000
great that I've done.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.480
Then you go out and seek
that higher level position.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.850
But by no means please,
please no one in this room

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.840
tie yourself to a title,
because titles come and go.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.320
They change every day.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.680
I mean, ask any UX
person how many times

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.656
we've gone through title
changes, even the last month.

00:18:43.656 --> 00:18:45.280
One day you're a
designer, the next day

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.710
you have no clue what you are.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.690
And you still can't
explain it to your parents

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.430
when you go home
for the holidays.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:52.680
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: Did you
want to add something, Jay?

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.346
JAY WONG: Yeah, and
just as a real world

00:18:54.346 --> 00:18:57.870
kind of example of
what Dee was saying.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:04.000
So I founded my own
company, and I was CEO,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.770
and now I'm a UI designer,
one person in a very, very

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.390
large company.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.820
But the reason why I
did that is because I

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.690
wanted to surround myself with
a lot of really amazing people,

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.590
and I wanted to learn from them.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:19.030
And at Google,
you're not just going

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:21.640
to come straight in as a
senior software engineer.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.020
It's about proving yourself.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.100
And people at level
three or four or five,

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.444
we actually all do very similar
jobs at different levels.

00:19:30.444 --> 00:19:31.610
You're doing the same thing.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.440
And a lot of the time,
all the level really

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.200
is just an indication of
what contribution you've made

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.910
and how you've
proved yourself to be

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.140
more valuable to the company.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.114
And so the title
is very trivial.

00:19:45.114 --> 00:19:47.280
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: I think
I just want to summarize,

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.071
because we've got some
really great points.

00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:52.500
If you're learning, taking
a step back is a good thing.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.170
If you're just
sitting there because

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.180
and you're not learning,
you need to move.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.950
So do we have a
question in the back?

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah, hi.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.630
Dee Speed, I have
a question for you.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.990
As you mentioned that a
strategic manager would surely

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:08.990
consider someone who wants
to make a role change,

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.650
like from an analyst
to product manager.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.820
What is the best
approach to even make

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.950
a contact with that
strategic manager?

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.120
Sometimes, some of our
resumes get filtered

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.220
at the recruiter level.

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.700
Could be it will
be your best match

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.940
or you'll have great ideas.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.360
How is the best way
to develop a network,

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.405
or how can we reach out
to that right manager who

00:20:31.405 --> 00:20:33.164
would even look at your resume?

00:20:33.164 --> 00:20:34.580
DEE SPEED: So your
question is how

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.950
can you-- what's the best way
to reach out to someone already

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.160
possibly in the role that
you're looking to move to?

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.850
Is that when you're asking?

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.600
AUDIENCE: Or in the
role that will be more

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.429
of an informative
section that you

00:20:46.429 --> 00:20:48.720
can have an informative
interviews most of them already

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.570
for.

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:54.429
It's more of a job that your
typical manager would have.

00:20:54.429 --> 00:20:55.970
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA:
So you were saying

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:00.190
that there's a good manager will
seek you out and actually hire

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.820
you or at least understand
that you have potential.

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.480
DEE SPEED: Definitely make
yourself feel known first.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.910
Approach that manager
and explain to them.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:11.180
I've actually added
two people to my team

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.080
recently who had very
little background in design.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.920
But what they did have that
I found our team was lacking

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.965
was really good skills in
observation and analysis.

00:21:20.965 --> 00:21:23.090
And considering our work
on Google Analytics, which

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:25.282
is a measurement
tool and a product,

00:21:25.282 --> 00:21:27.240
there were skills that
they brought to the team

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.823
that I hadn't otherwise
really thought

00:21:28.823 --> 00:21:30.620
about until they brought it up.

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.970
So for sure, definitely
seek out those managers.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.740
Like I said, if
they're a good manager,

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.100
they will sit down with
you and take the time

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:39.290
to try to understand
your skills set.

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:41.930
And don't be afraid
to talk about yourself

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.330
and sell yourself up.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:45.450
It's really difficult
for a lot of us to do.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.130
I still find it difficult
for myself come time to say,

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:51.890
should I go up for
promotion or should I not.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.320
There's a lot of that.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.354
So again, if you feel
you're lacking a skill set

00:21:56.354 --> 00:21:58.770
that's one thing, but don't
be afraid to chase it and talk

00:21:58.770 --> 00:21:59.800
to those people.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.470
Talk to also the people that are
in the level that you think you

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.520
may be arriving to
that position in.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.210
So say you're coming
from sales and you

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.700
do want to go into
something like design.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.660
Talk to a designer who just got
hired, because they're probably

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.700
on that same entry
level path as you.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.764
Talk to them about
their career history

00:22:15.764 --> 00:22:17.430
and the basic
requirements or the skills

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.237
that they've gathered
up until that point.

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:21.737
But really, it's a conversation
that actually just happened.

00:22:21.737 --> 00:22:23.170
AUDIENCE: [SNEEZE] Sorry.

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:24.360
JAY WONG: Bless you.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.120
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: You
make yourself known.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.945
DEE SPEED: Hired.

00:22:28.945 --> 00:22:31.570
ELLIE POWERS: So the way I think
about making career changes is

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.820
that usually when
you're making a change,

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.230
you're changing something,
but you're probably

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.474
pivoting and keeping
other things the same.

00:22:38.474 --> 00:22:40.140
So that could be, for
example, maybe I'm

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:42.550
working as a software
engineer on one product

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:46.120
and I'm going to go and become
a tester on the same product.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.346
Or maybe I'm moving from
one company to another,

00:22:49.346 --> 00:22:50.720
but I'm keeping
my role the same.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:51.870
So I think
understanding what are

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.510
the things that you
want to keep the same

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.968
and what are the
things that you're

00:22:54.968 --> 00:22:57.900
willing to do differently
will be helpful.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.704
And I think if you're
trying to, let's say,

00:22:59.704 --> 00:23:02.120
I'm a product manager so I'll
just use that as an example.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.661
If you're an analyst
now and you want

00:23:03.661 --> 00:23:05.520
to become a product
manager, is there

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.230
some background that you have
as an analyst that would now

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.000
actually make you a very
attractive product manager?

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.850
So, for example,
what Dee was saying,

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.730
if you have the
skills of observation

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:16.584
or you're a good
analytical background,

00:23:16.584 --> 00:23:18.250
maybe you'd make a
great product manager

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:20.670
on an analytical
product, or a product

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.605
that you used to
be a customer for.

00:23:22.605 --> 00:23:26.450
If I send a lot of Gmails,
even if I don't know anything

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.200
about being a product
manager, maybe I

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.450
have opinions on how
Gmail should work.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.910
So trying to create a case
both in your mind and the mind

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:35.940
of the hiring manager
about well, look,

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.273
I realize that a few things
are going to be a little bit

00:23:38.273 --> 00:23:40.580
different, but actually
here are the things

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.740
that I can use to transfer
my previous experience,

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.870
whether that's an industry, a
company, a product or so on.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.050
And then also find ways to start
doing your new job already.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:53.550
And that could be taking
on a separate project,

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:57.000
like being the product
manager for a side project

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.860
that you're doing, or for
a charity, or one thing

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.850
we do at Google is these
20% percent projects.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.170
So going and helping
another team.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:04.670
I've had a lot of
people approach me

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.154
and say, well I've essentially
taken on a new project

00:24:08.154 --> 00:24:09.820
where I'm acting as
the product manager.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.410
So even though
that's not my title,

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.100
I actually have
a bunch of people

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.249
that I've been acting
as product manager for,

00:24:15.249 --> 00:24:17.290
and they could talk to
you about my skills there.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:20.110
So just focus on how you
can create that continuity

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:21.635
in the mind of the
hiring manager.

00:24:21.635 --> 00:24:24.910
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: So I just
want to add to what Ellie said

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.136
about how you can make it
easier, how many things you

00:24:28.136 --> 00:24:30.010
want to change at the
same time while keeping

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.090
certain things the same.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.470
Very important.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.145
You could also take
the really hard road

00:24:35.145 --> 00:24:39.130
that I took where I changed
my job, my company, my team,

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.620
my house, and everything
at the same time.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.840
Not a great idea.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.480
Of course, it builds
character I guess,

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.590
but you don't want
to necessarily do

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.360
that each time you change.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.810
The other thing is, I
think girls or all of us

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.720
think that people
can read our minds.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.800
They can't.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.675
If you see some guy, some
manager, some person, guy,

00:25:01.675 --> 00:25:04.739
girl, whatever, and you
want to be in their team

00:25:04.739 --> 00:25:06.530
because they seem like
really cool managers

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.280
or they're doing
things that you want

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.620
to do but you don't know how
to approach them, talk to them.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.550
More often than not--
this is a secret

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:17.720
I learned like now, 10 years
after I started my career--

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.564
that people are usually
happy to talk to you.

00:25:20.564 --> 00:25:21.980
They actually want
to talk to you.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.679
They're probably getting
away from a meeting

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:25.970
because they're talking to you.

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.280
So they want to do that.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.480
So approach them
and don't be afraid.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.700
I mean, OK, so you
sounded silly once.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:34.770
That refines you to sound
better the next time.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.572
See what sticks,
what doesn't stick.

00:25:37.572 --> 00:25:39.030
JAY WONG: Yeah,
and always remember

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:42.020
that it's not just
that's looking for a job.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.940
We're all looking for
great people, too.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.660
So it's in their best
interest to talk to you.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.330
I actually think a really
good technique is just

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.392
to reach out to, I
think as Dee said,

00:25:51.392 --> 00:25:52.600
reach out to other designers.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.766
And that's not even necessarily
within your company.

00:25:54.766 --> 00:25:57.170
Like if you go to
events where there

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.850
are people that are doing the
things that you want and you

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.470
reach out to them, I'm sure
that any number of them

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.940
would be happy to talk to you
and happy to give you advice.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.650
And there are people
always looking.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.662
So I think that technique
works really well.

00:26:13.662 --> 00:26:15.120
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA:
Yeah, so I think

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.250
we're all touching on
networking and fearlessness.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.082
So I think the
next one will have

00:26:20.082 --> 00:26:21.540
to be our last
question, because we

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.730
have almost three
and a half minutes.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.070
OK, so we have one over there.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.570
Sorry, sorry guys.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.880
AUDIENCE: OK, so
what advice would

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.570
you give, if possible
all of you one each,

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.160
to somebody who's
basically struggling?

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.760
And that's me in this case.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.800
I'm working with a
start up for four years,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.860
and I feel it's a pretty stable
stipend, everything is good.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.720
But moving up in the
ladder is difficult.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.260
So I'm trying to switch and
move to other companies.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.620
I have really good interviews
lined up at big companies.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.470
But I want to move to
a product management

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.800
from my engineering role.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.090
But I feel if I go to
some other company,

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.867
I'm going to stay
at the same level

00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:03.200
or doing the same thing for
the next four or five years.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.250
So what kind of
advice you would give?

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.690
Stick here, try to
get the role you want,

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.540
or move and maybe
in the new company,

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.370
take the risk of moving up to
the other position you wanted.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:16.370
DEEPTI SRIVASTAVA: Sure.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.046
So the question is,
how do you decide

00:27:18.046 --> 00:27:19.920
whether you want to stay
in a particular role

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.960
after you've been
there for a while,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.550
or do you want to switch
to a different role?

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.130
I think what I
suggest is we all just

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:25.730
talk about it really quickly.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.660
So I'll just start and then
we'll end with Shambhavi.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.960
So here's the thing.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.787
You have to think
about where you are at

00:27:32.787 --> 00:27:34.120
and how you're feeling about it.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.100
If you've been in a role--
because I was in this situation

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:36.820
also.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.500
I was in a role for
five or six years--

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.970
yeah, I've been in
every situation,

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.380
haven't I. I was in a
role for the five years

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.800
and I was like, if
I just stick it out.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.990
I'm one of those people
that doesn't quit.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.926
Like bulldog, you chew
on it and like, yeah.

00:27:50.926 --> 00:27:52.800
That's sometimes a good
thing, sometimes not.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.440
So if people haven't noticed
you and haven't given you

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.157
the kind of things you
want in five years,

00:27:59.157 --> 00:28:01.490
chances are they're not going
to give it to you anymore.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:04.660
The second thing is, you have
to be aware of what you want.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.632
So when you're talking
to the next interview

00:28:06.632 --> 00:28:08.840
that you're doing, next
roles that you're looking at,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.740
you have to be clear
and confident that this

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.720
is what I want, can you
give it to me or not.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.930
If not, why not?

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:17.110
What am I missing?

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.960
But you can't settle then,
which is what I said earlier.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:23.035
So you have to be clear on
what you want and go for it.

00:28:23.035 --> 00:28:23.535
Sorry.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:24.035
Dee.

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:26.480
DEE SPEED: If you are
feeling frustrated,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.170
the frustration has a source.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:30.580
The frustration could be
anything from I've been here,

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.050
I'm not being recognized,
to I'm just bored.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.820
So first recognize
the frustration.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:37.769
And then I think a
lot of us forget,

00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:39.310
when we're interviewing
at companies,

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.580
we forget to ask the company
what can you do for me.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.600
So you should be asking
that next company,

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.110
if it matters to you that
I'm in an environment where

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.155
I can continue to learn, I want
to work around people that yes

00:28:51.155 --> 00:28:53.530
are smarter than me and frankly
scare the crap out of me,

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:54.560
they're so brilliant.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.830
That only makes you better, and
don't be afraid to chase that.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.910
But be really clear what your
motivations are, and don't

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.600
feel like you're ever stuck.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.500
I mean obviously, if this were
my mom saying this, she'd say,

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.930
honey, don't leave that
job just yet until you've

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.540
got something else lined up.

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.840
And I'd say OK yeah,
that's a smart move.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.010
There's so much work
right now in so many areas

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.810
of our industry,
just don't be afraid.

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:20.340
Be completely fearless and
seek out what you want.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.930
Because you don't want to look
back after another two years,

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.471
and you're still at
the same company,

00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:26.740
and you're only slightly
more miserable wondering

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:28.390
why you didn't take a chance.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.180
Go ahead and take the chance.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.840
ELLIE POWERS: I
guess super quick.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.440
I stayed in my first
job almost five years

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.946
and I've never seen another
job that long since then.

00:29:38.946 --> 00:29:40.570
It sounds like you
need to shake it up.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.170
I would definitely
encourage you to go

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.330
to something that makes
you feel passionate again.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.244
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:29:46.244 --> 00:29:47.660
JAY WONG: Yeah, I
would say always

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.670
think about what is
it that you want.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.770
And think about where
you see yourself

00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:53.400
or what you want to
be in five years.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.254
And really take a
hard look at do I

00:29:55.254 --> 00:29:57.170
think that the company
that I am at right now,

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:58.360
are they really going
to offer me that?

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.100
And be really
realistic about that.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.144
And don't be afraid to take the
risk, because the reality is,

00:30:03.144 --> 00:30:04.810
always think of the
worst case scenario.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.518
There are so many
people that are looking

00:30:06.518 --> 00:30:09.100
right now for people with
our skill set, especially

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.050
in this industry.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:15.790
And the worst case is you can
always just kind of go back

00:30:15.790 --> 00:30:17.680
to the job you were
doing before or maybe not

00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:18.930
always, but something similar.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:23.190
And you really don't have that
much to lose but a lot to gain.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.560
SHAMBHAVI KADAM: I would
say start your own company.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.393
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.700
Yeah.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.290
No, but I mean, if
you have an idea,

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:33.120
definitely you
should consider that.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.005
But I think what
everyone has said so far

00:30:36.005 --> 00:30:36.880
makes a lot of sense.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:39.080
I went through the same
thing when I was at Boeing.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.564
I was a little bit
bored at my job,

00:30:40.564 --> 00:30:41.980
and I really liked
it but I wanted

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.430
to pursue something else,
so I just moved to Japan

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:45.640
and started working there.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.916
I think it's always very
important to go and do

00:30:47.916 --> 00:30:49.540
something that you're
passionate about.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.456
Life will always give
you great opportunities,

00:30:51.456 --> 00:30:53.075
you just have to reach for them.

00:30:53.075 --> 00:30:54.930

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.800
