00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.130
At this point in the course, you've
probably realized that sometimes when

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.420
you try something in code,
it just doesn't work the first time.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.420
These errors are called bugs, and
Carl has thought a lot about bugs, and

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.630
how to get rid of them.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.970
&gt;&gt; You know, Andy, writers spend
a lot of time proofreading, and

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.350
scientists spend a lot of
time checking their results.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.510
But it was a surprise to early
programmers that debugging was

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.990
going to be a thing.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.370
Maurice Wilkes, the Cambridge physicist
who built one of the first computers,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.610
had something to say
about this discovery.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.530
By June 1949, people had begun
to realize that it was not so

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.550
easy to get a program right,
as had it at one time appeared.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.390
The realization came over me with full
force that a good part of the remainder

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.590
of my life was going to be spent
finding errors in my own programs.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.620
&gt;&gt; That is so true, and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680
it's something I didn't understand
when I was learning to code.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.520
I thought that every bug I was
introducing into my own programs was

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.160
some failure on my part as a programmer,
but

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.400
I realize now that bugs are inevitable.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.300
They're going to happen, and so
the important thing isn't to avoid them

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.900
entirely, it's to develop a strategy for
systematically getting rid of them.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.880
It's not so much about spotting typos or
logic errors as it is about

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.360
building a correct mental model
of how that system works so

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.870
that you can find out
what isn't working.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.030
In this lesson I'll show you some
techniques that can help you make

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.800
debugging part of your learning process.
