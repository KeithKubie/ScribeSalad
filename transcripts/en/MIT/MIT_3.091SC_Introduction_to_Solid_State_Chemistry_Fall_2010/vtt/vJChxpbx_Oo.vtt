00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.820
Hi, I'm Jocelyn, and we're going
to go over Fall 2009,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.590
Exam 1, problem number 2.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.640
So as with every problem,
we want to first

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.230
read the full question.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.590
In box notation, give the
complete electron

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.590
configuration of each of the
following gas-phase species:

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.780
calcium 2 minus and
magnesium 4 plus.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.340
So the first thing to note here,
is you need to know what

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.520
electronic configuration is.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.140
If you don't, you might want
to go back and review that

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.520
material, but it is basically
assigning

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.840
electrons to orbitals.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.430
The next thing you need to know
is what box notation is.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.070
And Professor Sadoway introduced
that in class, and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.100
you'll see, as I go through
this, a refresher of that, if

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.350
you forgot.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.710
So to assign electrons to
orbitals, we first need to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.820
know how many electrons we have.
So let's start with the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.680
first part of this problem,
which is calcium 2 minus.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.140
We will look at our periodic
table, and see that neutral

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:47.030
calcium has 20 electrons.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.260
So calcium with no charge
has 20 electrons.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.970
The 2 minus tells us that it
has 2 extra electrons.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.880
Right?

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.150
Because electrons have
a negative charge.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.770
So we have a total of 22
electrons that we need to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.120
assign into orbitals.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.160
In order to actually do the
assigning, we need to follow

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.030
the three rules that Professor
Sadoway introduced in class.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.508
So I will put that over here.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.170
The first rule is that you need
to fill them, at least

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.650
for a ground state species, in
order of increasing energy.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.310
That is, you want to fill up
the lowest energy orbitals

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.650
first, and then move to the
higher energy orbitals.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.960
This makes sense because ground
state species want to

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.770
have the lowest total
energy possible.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.020
So the first is--

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.020
Now, how do we figure
that out?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.470
Well, there's a few ways.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.890
One way is a nice trick that you
can do on the side of your

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.780
page or something.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.310
And it goes like this.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.330
So we have our s, p,
d, and f orbitals.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.500
Right?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.360
We know that s can be in the
first energy level up.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:43.020
We know that p starts at the
second energy level, d starts

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.400
at the third, and f starts
at the fourth.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.970
The tricky part is that you
don't just fill up 1s, 2s, 2p,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.020
3s, 3p, 3d.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.070
There's a little bit of mixing
up of the energy levels versus

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.480
the actual energy
of the orbital.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.836
So a nice side of the page
trick is to draw diagonal

00:04:10.836 --> 00:04:18.104
lines down through
these numbers.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.100
And if you follow these arrows,
you'll fill up in

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.040
order of increasing energy.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.710
For example, after you fill up
the 2p, you're going to fill

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:42.380
up the 3s then the 3p, the 4s,
and then you'll go to the 3d.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.140
If that doesn't make sense,
you might want to go and

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:51.340
review a little bit about the
orbitals in your textbook, or

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.180
other resources.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.250
The other way you can think
about the ordering of the

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.610
energy of the orbitals,
is to be familiar with

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.330
the periodic table.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.610
So we're just going to have
an aside over here.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:19.570
And a general, very rough sketch
of the periodic table

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.260
would look something
like this.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.030
OK?

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.640
You have your alkali, alkali
earth metals over here.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.880
You have aluminum, oxygen.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.780
Your halides, your noble
gases over there.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.170
But the way I drew it here is
in what we call blocks.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:48.050
So this is your s block, and
then we have our p block over

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:57.470
here, d block, and the the
f block is down here.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.320
So once you get more familiar
with electron configurations,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.780
you can actually looks towards
the periodic table, and know,

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.160
depending upon where your
element is in the periodic

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.210
table, what its electron
configuration is.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.710
Or at least the electron
configuration

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.350
of the valence electrons.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.710
OK.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.300
So moving back to our trick,
which we'll use now, we know

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.630
that we have 22 electrons, and
we know the order that we need

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.700
to fill the orbitals.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.810
So let's start writing out our
boxes, which is how Professor

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.320
Sadoway wanted us to answer
this problem.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:49.070
So we have 1s, our 2s, 2p.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.870
If you're unsure why I'm only
drawing 1 orbital for s and 3

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.920
orbitals for p, again, you might
want to go review that

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.010
beginning orbital material.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:07.160
So we filled, we have 1s, 2s,
2p, 3s, then we're going to do

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.110
the 3s here, we're going
to do the 3p.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:23.430
And after the 3p, we do
the 4s, and after the

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:29.500
4s, we do the 3d.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.570
Which has 5 boxes, right?

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.870
So now that we know which
orbitals we're going to fill,

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:48.850
we need to know some more rules
about filling them.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:55.420
So the second rule, over here,
is the Pauli exclusion

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:07.450
principle, which says that no
two electrons can have the

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.780
same quantum numbers.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.790
For us, that means that we
basically can only have two

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.760
electrons per orbital,
and of opposite spin.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.160
So that's something we need
to remember for this.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.040
The third is Hund's Rule.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.870
And that is, we want to
have as many unpaired

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.090
electrons as possible.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.650
So that will come into play
when we're filling up our

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.700
boxes in just a second.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.700
If these are confusing,
again, we want to look

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:47.950
at the lecture material.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:55.630
So I forgot my boxes here.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.160
Now let's start the fun part of
filling up the elections.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.440
So we fill up 1s, spin
up and down, the

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.660
2s, spin up and down.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:16.380
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:22.880
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and
we have 2 more.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:28.000
So in the 3d, we're going
to do 21, 22.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.050
And I separate them out because
of Hund's rule.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.000
We want to maximize the number
of unpaired spins.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.180
They both spin down, or both
spin up, but they will be the

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.030
same spin, and they will be
in different orbitals.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.260
So this was the answer for
this part of the problem.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.010
Now let's move to
the second part.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.760
And maybe you can try by
yourself, and then

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.590
we can do it here.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.020
All right.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.690
Now we're going to do the second
part of this first part

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.870
of the problem number 2.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.540
So it asks us for the electron
configuration in box notation

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.050
of magnesium 4 plus.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.310
So again, we're going to
determine how many electrons

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:20.520
we have. Which, neutral
magnesium has 12 electrons.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:25.160
But the 4 plus signifies that we
have 4 less electrons than

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:31.480
neutrality, and so we subtract
4, and we have 8.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.790
With 8 electrons to work with,
we again want to write down

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:51.740
our boxes using the energy level
tricks that we have. And

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.130
now we can fill them up.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.680
The Pauli Exclusion Principle
tells us 1 spin up and 1 spin

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:06.100
down per orbital, and Hund's
rule tells us that when we

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.400
fill up this 3p, we're going to
try to maximize the number

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.770
of unpaired electrons, and then,
when we have to, we pair

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.670
up the spins.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:23.300
So that's another main mistake
that people make, is they pair

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.930
up too many spins, violate the
Pauli exclusion principle,

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.870
putting 2 electrons of the same
spin in one orbital, or

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.400
something of that nature.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.790
So this again is the correct
answer, and would-- oh!

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.320
I'm sorry.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.310
This is 2p.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.040
I'm sure you guys caught that.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.910
And would have awarded you
full points in this part.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.390
All right.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.430
Now we're going to start
the second part of this

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.840
problem, part B.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.280
So first we want to read what
the question is asking.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.030
Give the chemical identities
of the species with these

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.410
ground state electron
configurations.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.890
So now we're working in the
opposite direction.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:09.420
In part A, we were given a
chemical species and asked for

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.160
the electron configuration.

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.760
Now we are given the electron
configuration, and asked for

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.480
the chemical species.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:24.940
So the first one has
the electron

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.100
configuration of xenon.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:33.150
So this is a noble gas
configuration, plus what turns

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.530
out to be 27 electrons.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.490
One way you can do this, is to
go to xenon, which is in the

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:48.310
fifth row of the Periodic Table,
and count through 27

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:59.550
electrons, remembering that when
you get to the d on the

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:05.620
sixth and seventh row, you need
to go to the f block,

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.210
which is signified in
this problem by

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.690
having f block electrons.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:13.430
Count through the f block,
the d block,

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:19.090
and end up at thallium.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.350
Or if you are familiar with the
Periodic Table enough that

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:30.620
you can recognize the valence
electrons are in 6p.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.090
And the 6p only has one
electron in it.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.450
So that tells me, xenon
is in row 5.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.710
This element is going
to be in row 6.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:48.390
I go to the first column of the
p block, which signifies

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.680
that there's one electron in
that 6p orbital, and I see

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.980
that it's thallium.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.260
That's the quicker
way to do it.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:59.040
On an exam, you might want to
be that familiar with the

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.810
periodic table to be able to
do that, because you're

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.090
certainly time-crunched,
a lot of times.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:09.130
So because that's a neutral
atom, that method will work

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.780
very easily.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:17.890
The second part is a little
trickier, because it has a

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.780
charged species.

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.250
So we have a net charge
of 4 plus, an electron

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:32.265
configuration of
argon and 3d5.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.260
This may seem a little confusing
at first glance,

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:47.090
because we always fill
the 4s before the 3d.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:51.970
But when you're ionizing an
atom, it turns out you take

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.450
electrons from the 4s
first, even though

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.730
it's of lower energy.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:59.300
So that's a little subtlety
that's not too important to

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.340
this problem, but it may have
tripped you up when you were

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.790
looking at this, and certainly
caused some problems for the

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.040
people in this class.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:10.390
Again, we go to the periodic
table and we see where argon

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.200
is, and then we go
to the next row.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.520
The way I like to think about
this, is this is the electron

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:25.070
configuration, missing
4 electrons.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:30.380
To find the element that has
this charge, I'm just going to

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.590
add back in the electrons, go
to that position in the

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:38.070
periodic table, and that is
my elemental species.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:42.670
So we want argon plus, instead
of 5 electrons--

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.000
I'm sorry, the problem
says this is a 3--

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.660
instead plus 3 electrons, we are
going to go to argon plus

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.480
7 electrons.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.450
And going through the periodic
table, you'll see that that

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.700
leaves you with manganese.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:07.400
Adding the 4 plus, because that
is part of this chemical

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.480
identity, we get the answer
of the problem.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.410
So again, the charged species
make this a little more

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:16.520
complicated.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.650
The easiest way is to go back
and add in the missing

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:25.300
electrons, because that is your
chemical species, and

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:31.030
then remember to signify that
there actually is that charge

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.120
for your answer.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:45.240
So moving on to part C, it asks
us, write the quantum

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.240
numbers of one of the
3d and one of the 4s

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.110
electrons in iron.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:53.660
So this requires a knowledge of
what quantum numbers are,

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.040
and what values they can have.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.280
So let's start with the 4s,
because that's a little more

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.850
straightforward.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.400
He tells us that we have an n
quantum number, l quantum

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.730
number, m and s.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.580
And, hopefully, we all know
that n is the principal

00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.630
quantum number.

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.090
It's basically your
energy level.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.130
l gives you what type of
orbital you're in.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.400
Right?

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.520
If you're in the s,
the p, the d.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.870
So it just tells you your
orbital shape, basically.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.010
m gives you the angular
identity of the

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.250
orbital you're in.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.570
We didn't really talk
about that in depth.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:47.330
We just need to know, it tells
you which of the p orbitals

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.680
you're in, or which of the
d orbitals you're in.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.334
So I'll say, which orbital.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.910
And the s is your spin.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:02.510
Right?

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.740
So for a 4s electron, it doesn't
actually matter what

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:09.210
the identity of our
species is.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.160
So that he tells us is iron is
kind of extra information.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.300
A 4s electron already has 3 of
its quantum numbers set.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:27.680
So we know that n equals 4,
for s, l equals 0, and m,

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.220
which orbital, s only
has 1 orbital.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:36.780
So m always equals 0 for
s, and your spin.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.950
And I'm going to make that a
script, just so it's less

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:49.400
confusing, is plus
or minus 1/2.

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:56.860
So the answer to this problem
could have been 4, 0, 0, 1/2,

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.170
or 4, 0, 0, minus 1/2.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.950
Three of them are set
by the fact that

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.730
this is the 4s orbital.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.280
The spin can either be
plus or minus 1/2.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.260
If you're unsure of where I
got these numbers, and why

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.380
they have to be such, you
may want to review

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:18.820
the lecture on that.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:30.220
So moving onto the 3d quantum
numbers, we know that n is 3,

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:45.610
l for d is 2, m is negative 2,
negative 1, 0, 1, or 2, right?

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:50.750
Because there's 5 different
orbitals in a d set.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:57.010
And then again, s can be
plus or minus 1/2.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:04.070
So picking one set of those,
you could have said 3, 2,

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:11.290
minus 2, plus 1/2, or any
combination of 3, 2, and

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.940
the m and the s.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.860
You don't have to get the exact
same answer as your

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:18.090
neighbor or someone else
you're-- well, you shouldn't

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.740
be looking your neighbor's
paper, or a classmate, but

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.640
these do signify that you're
in a 3d electron.
