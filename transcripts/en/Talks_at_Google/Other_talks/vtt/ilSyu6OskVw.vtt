00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:04.409
[applause]

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:07.740
&gt;&gt;Brendan: So, everyone, you know these two
people.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.580
Mike Birbiglia is a famous stand-up comedian
who has turned filmmaker.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.540
This movie is based on his one-man show of
the same name-- "Sleepwalk With Me."

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.250
And Ira Glass is a producer and host of "This
American Life."

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.070
Please welcome to the stage, Mike Birbiglia
and Ira Glass.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.070
[applause]

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.789
&gt;&gt;Ira: Thanks.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.420
Wow, thanks you guys.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.150
&gt;&gt;Brendan: No problem.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.869
How are you?

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.590
&gt;&gt;Mike: Thanks, Brendan.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.410
Yeah, no.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.940
We didn't decide in advance who's gonna sit
closer to Brendan

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.690
&gt;&gt;Ira: Well, you're the filmmaker, writer,
star director.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.013
I felt you naturally would get closer--.

00:00:42.013 --> 00:00:44.320
&gt;&gt;Mike: But you have a popular radio show
that everyone loves.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.320
[laughter]

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.320
I'm the unknown comedian.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.370
&gt;&gt;Ira: I know, but I'm the side man in this
project.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.370
&gt;&gt;Mike: OK.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.370
I guess so.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.370
&gt;&gt;Brendan: But you're both here and featured.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.370
So, it's OK.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.710
&gt;&gt;Mike: Thanks for having us here.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.010
It feels so evil.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.010
[laughter]

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.449
It just, I don't know what it is.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.050
Like, the word "evil" just pops to my mind
when I'm here.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.050
[laughter]

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.259
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Oh, man.

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.430
There are no lawyers here, right?

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.430
[laughter]

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.430
OK.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.430
I see a few in the back.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.430
They're not listening.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.470
So, guys.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.470
Thanks for coming again.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.470
&gt;&gt;Mike: Thanks.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.700
&gt;&gt;Brendan: We're talking about the movie "Sleepwalk
With Me," which I watched last night.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.700
It's a great movie.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.700
&gt;&gt;Mike: Thanks.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.880
&gt;&gt;Brendan: It's, as I mentioned, is Mike's
one-man show.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.140
Was, ran to rave reviews, sold out Bleecker
Street Theater--.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.450
&gt;&gt;Mike: I just want to point out she's videoing
the show like this with her phone going like

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.450
this.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.450
She's over in the fourth row.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.200
That is a funny tripod.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.200
[laughter]

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.000
It was just, it's a very unreliable tripod.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.590
Is your hands in the "stick the landing" gymnast
pose.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.259
&gt;&gt;Brendan: It's more of a bi-pod than a tripod.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.340
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah, it's a bi-pod. [laughs]

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.640
&gt;&gt;Brendan: But the show ran for eight months.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.620
Sold out Bleecker Street Theater Was produced
by Nathan Lane.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.050
And then you turned it into a book.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.320
&gt;&gt;Mike: That's right.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.200
&gt;&gt;Brendan: And, would you mind just giving
us the Cliff Notes of how the movie came into

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.340
being--transformed from this one-man show
to a book?

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.820
&gt;&gt;Mike: I'm gonna, I would answer this, but
whenever I answer anything and Ira's around,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.040
he just starts steam-rolling whatever I'm
saying mid-sentence.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.500
He's goes, "No, this is how to explain it."

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.470
And then he just starts going, so I'm just
gonna throw it to you out of the gate.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.550
How did it happen, Ira?

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.710
[laughter]

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.770
&gt;&gt;Ira: I don't remember.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.130
&gt;&gt;Mike: Me neither.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.500
Here's what happened.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.500
[laughter]

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.571
When you have Broadway or off Broadway show
that is extended a bunch, like it's extended

00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:47.910
a bunch of times, inevitably everyone you
know says, "You should make this a movie."

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.000
This is apparently something I didn't know
beforehand.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.780
I've been writing screenplays since I was
in college, like that's what I studied in

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.780
school.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.390
And I'd always wanted to make films, but I
essentially couldn't afford it.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.510
There's the short version.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.630
And then, around this time that the show was
really successful and I had the opportunity

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.890
to write the film for this company that we
didn't end up making the film with but we

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.880
amicably parted ways eventually.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.750
But that's when I started writing the film.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.440
And I asked Ira, "Would you want to be a producer?"

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.360
And along the way, he worked on it so much
that in the process he became one of the writers

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.360
as well.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.800
And so, it took a lot longer than we thought.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800
&gt;&gt;Ira: Yeah.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.319
&gt;&gt;Mike: That process started in 2008.

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.860
And we shot the film in 2011.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.100
&gt;&gt;Ira: We started working on the movie in
2008?

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.920
&gt;&gt;Mike: No, no, no.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.920
Sorry.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.920
2009.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.040
The play opened in 2008 and then 2009 we started
the script.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.480
So I guess two years later we shot the film.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.900
&gt;&gt;Brendan: And just sort of a back story,
Mike--

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.290
&gt;&gt;Ira: Awesome.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.290
[laughter]

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.970
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Mike had appeared on "This American
Life" a few times leading up to when you guys

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.360
started making the movie.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.130
How did you guys meet each other originally,
or start working with each other?

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.870
&gt;&gt;Ira: I mean, we met each other because Mike
had actually told this story at The Moth,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.190
a story-telling open mic--it's not really
an open mic.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.700
A story-telling show.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.620
And I heard a recording and thought it would
be great on the radio.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.440
Called him up and that's the first time we
met.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.850
And then since then, we collaborated on a
bunch of stories together and that we put

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.850
on the radio.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.290
And when we do it, you'll have an idea for
a story and we'll sketch something out.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.410
And then we have a process of working on it
that's very different from other writers on

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.740
the show where Mike will go on stage and perform
a version of the story and make a little MP3

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.990
and email it to me.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.130
And then that night or the next morning, we'll
go over it.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.130
OK, what worked?

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.130
What didn't work?

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.320
Where should we fill stuff out?

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.480
Where could we have another joke?

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.630
What jokes aren't working?

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.970
And we'll do that five or six or seven times.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.250
And then at the end, have a piece that we'll
then record full-fidelity and very prettily

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.250
and put on the radio.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.250
&gt;&gt;Brendan: So, Mike.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.270
You said you were, went for college and you
studied screen-writing.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.560
Ira, have you been a film buff?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.920
I mean, you've been in radio more or less.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.920
&gt;&gt;Ira: I'm not a film buff at all.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:02.920
Like, I go to the movies.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.920
I enjoy it.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.840
I'm a completely civilian movie consumer in
every way.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.840
[laughter]

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.840
&gt;&gt;Brendan: You have an IMDB entry now.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.990
So now you're a filmmaker.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.919
Does that weird you out?

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.610
&gt;&gt;Ira: No, that seems awesome.

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.770
[laughter]

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.120
Actually, that seems really awesome.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.970
And we have, like the radio show has had,
since 2002, various projects that people tried

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.280
to make into movies that have been in development
with various directors.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.260
And one of them actually got made.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.610
Paul Feig, who did "Freaks and Geeks" and
"Bridesmaids," made one of them into a film

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.990
years ago.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.420
But I wasn't so, we weren't so popular then.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.980
He just like, took an idea and made it into
a film--a film called "Unaccompanied Minors,"

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.330
a kid's Christmas movie.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.230
And, which I felt I had no expertise to bring
to that.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.840
And so, this is the first film that I've really
been so super involved in.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.370
&gt;&gt;Mike: You know what I noticed looking at
the audience of Google employees?

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.410
No one's old.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.410
[laughter]

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.990
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I'm old.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.120
&gt;&gt;Mike: You're not old.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.120
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I'm old.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.120
&gt;&gt;Mike: You're not old.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.949
&gt;&gt;Ira: How old, I'm older than you.

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:07.949
&gt;&gt;Female #1: 46.

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:10.070
&gt;&gt;Ira: I'm way, way older than you.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.070
[laughter]

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.070
&gt;&gt;Mike: Beat your ass.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.710
Solid, hardcore 50 right here.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.570
&gt;&gt;Ira: More than that.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.570
[laughter]

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.920
&gt;&gt;Mike: No one's older than you, right?

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.670
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I doubt it.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.729
&gt;&gt;Mike: You're 46.

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:21.729
Anybody older than 46?

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:22.729
Do we have a 47?

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.410
Do I see a 48?

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.960
&gt;&gt;Ira: 49.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.870
See, but this isn't news to them.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.110
&gt;&gt;Mike: It's news to me.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.110
[laughter]

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.110
Breaking news-al.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.650
&gt;&gt;Ira: You thought it was gonna be a lot of
old people?

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.350
&gt;&gt;Mike: I thought it was gonna be an elderly
technology company.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.350
[laughter]

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:50.080
Sort of a home for hobbyists, technology hobbyists,
who wanna compete with Apple.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.040
&gt;&gt;Ira: What's the internet service like in
this building?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.050
&gt;&gt;Mike: Is it decent?

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.710
You guys get a good signal?

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.419
You guys get a T3 around here?

00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.419
[laughter]

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.820
&gt;&gt;Ira: Like, is it like so unbelievably fast
that when you go home, it's not even worth

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.910
going on the internet?

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.910
[laughter]

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.830
&gt;&gt;Mike: You just have to touch someone in
this building and you're on the internet.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.169
&gt;&gt;Ira: No one's answering the question.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:12.169
Is it super fast?

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:13.169
[laughter]

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.169
Is it like super fast?

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.540
&gt;&gt;Mike: I'm Googling you right now.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.650
I'm Googling my mom as we speak.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.910
There's like 150 thousand results.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:25.220
[laughter]

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.620
Oh, my God, Mom.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.430
Who knew?

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.430
[laughter]

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.800
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Yeah, the web's pretty quick here.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800
But--.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.590
&gt;&gt;Ira: You were getting bored with my answer,
weren't you?

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.690
&gt;&gt;Mike: I hate your answer.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.400
Your answer's, 'cause we do this, we've been
doing a lot of Q and As.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.100
As a matter of fact, this--.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.690
&gt;&gt;Ira: [ indistinct ] so many Q and A's.

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:51.000
&gt;&gt;Mike: This Friday and Saturday, we're at
the IFC Center.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.650
We agreed and there's this video where we
proclaim it on YouTube that we're gonna be

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:00.650
at every single screening Friday and Saturday
night opening at the IFC Center in New York

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.650
City.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.100
And it was, that seven screenings a day.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.190
We sold out, yeah, it's 14 screenings.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:07.520
We sold out eight of them.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.440
They added another screen.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.810
So now, we're doing 14 screenings per day.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:21.460
That's, for all you Google employees who don't
know math, that's 28 screenings in two days.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.990
&gt;&gt;Ira: So that's a lot of Q and A's.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.220
&gt;&gt;Mike: It's a lot of A's.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.350
&gt;&gt;Ira: Yeah.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.350
[laughter]

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.710
&gt;&gt;Brendan: The same Qs.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.710
Lots of different As.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.820
You just gotta mix it up each time.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:30.820
&gt;&gt;Ira: I know.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.820
I know.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.820
We're gonna be like Bob Dylan.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.820
We're gonna start to just make up answers
to stuff.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.820
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Yeah.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.909
After a week, people just won't want to see
you live anymore.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.969
&gt;&gt;Mike: Just wait till we go electric.

00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:38.969
[laughter]

00:08:38.969 --> 00:08:42.529
&gt;&gt;Ira: Alright, ask us a question.

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:43.529
We're gonna lie.

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:45.290
We're gonna lie on this answer.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:46.899
&gt;&gt;Mike: Like Bob Dylan in his early work.

00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:48.339
We're just gonna make up a lore.

00:08:48.339 --> 00:08:49.339
&gt;&gt;Ira: OK.

00:08:49.339 --> 00:08:50.339
Let's try it.

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:51.339
Let's try it.

00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:52.339
&gt;&gt;Brendan: OK.

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:53.339
&gt;&gt;Ira: We've never done this.

00:08:53.339 --> 00:08:54.339
&gt;&gt;Mike: [babbling ].

00:08:54.339 --> 00:08:56.879
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Mike, you mentioned the one-man
show was very successful.

00:08:56.879 --> 00:08:57.879
&gt;&gt;Ira: What is this?

00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:58.879
Bob Dylan?

00:08:58.879 --> 00:08:59.879
Are you stoned?

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:00.879
[laughter]

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:01.879
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah, I'm stoned.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:02.879
I'm playing the part.

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:03.879
We're doing a bit.

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:04.879
&gt;&gt;Ira: He's not stoned.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:05.879
Have you seen--?

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:06.879
&gt;&gt;Mike: No, no.

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:07.879
But I mean, like he just doesn't care.

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:08.879
Like give me a cigarette.

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:09.879
Does anyone have a cigarette?

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:10.879
Does anyone smoke at Google?

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:12.550
Does anyone have a cigarette for real?

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.550
&gt;&gt;Ira: Come on.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:14.550
There must be one--.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.550
&gt;&gt;Mike: Somebody has a cigarette.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:16.550
Come on.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.920
Secretly I know that you'll get fired the
moment that people discover that you smoke

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920
cigarettes.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.181
&gt;&gt;Ira: There's like a hundred, how many people
are in this room?

00:09:23.181 --> 00:09:24.181
&gt;&gt;Mike: Somebody smokes.

00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:25.181
Raise your hand if you have a cigarette.

00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:26.181
Be honest.

00:09:26.181 --> 00:09:27.181
Just say that it was for a friend.

00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:28.181
&gt;&gt;Ira: There we go.

00:09:28.181 --> 00:09:29.181
Here we go.

00:09:29.181 --> 00:09:30.181
&gt;&gt;Mike: Can we borrow a cigarette?

00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:34.410
[audience member responds inaudibly]
[laughter]

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.990
Wait, you might be 47.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.990
[laughter]

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:42.220
Can we get a camera on this guy?

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.069
Can we get a camera on this guy?

00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:45.439
That'll be a good cutaway.

00:09:45.439 --> 00:09:46.630
Thank you very much.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.730
&gt;&gt;Ira: God bless you.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:50.730
[laughter]

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.060
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Alright.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.899
So Mike, you mentioned when the one-man show
was a success.

00:09:54.899 --> 00:09:55.899
&gt;&gt;Mike: Uh-huh.

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:58.220
&gt;&gt;Brendan: And people were pressuring you
saying, "Hey, this could be a movie."

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.220
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.399
&gt;&gt;Brendan: When did it occur to you to say,
"Hey, this might actually work as a movie"

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:03.649
instead of my friends just saying, "Hey, you
should make a movie?"

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:08.670
&gt;&gt;Mike: [slurring] Just let Ira answer this
one.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.670
[laughter]

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:10.879
&gt;&gt;Ira: He actually had a, he had a dream.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.100
&gt;&gt;Mike: I can't do Bob Dylan any longer.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.100
&gt;&gt;Ira: There was a talking dog.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.949
&gt;&gt;Mike: I had a dream there was a talking
dog and it was--.

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.660
&gt;&gt;Ira: Wait.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:21.459
What was the question?

00:10:21.459 --> 00:10:24.730
The question was when did we think it could
be a movie?

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.189
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Yeah, versus people just saying,
"Hey, you have a show.

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:28.189
It could be a movie."

00:10:28.189 --> 00:10:30.740
&gt;&gt;Ira: I actually know, I actually know when
I thought it could be a movie.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:31.740
I could answer for me.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.220
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Mike, is that OK?

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.220
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah, go ahead.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.220
Yeah.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.170
&gt;&gt;Ira: Well, somebody suggested that the film
had a very traditional structure where what

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:44.420
you've got in the film is a guy who has increasing
anxiety over--.

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:45.420
He's in this relationship.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.069
He isn't sure if he should stay with his girlfriend.

00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:48.589
They've been together for years.

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:51.490
He's not sure what to do--super relate-able
situation.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.410
And also, he's trying, he's in his 20s.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.420
He's trying to be a comedian.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.739
It's not going so great.

00:10:56.739 --> 00:11:00.269
And he's not doing anything much about either
of these things.

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:03.749
And somebody suggested, "Well, you could just
kick the thing off at his sister's engagement

00:11:03.749 --> 00:11:04.749
party."

00:11:04.749 --> 00:11:05.749
His sister gets engaged.

00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:07.660
People start asking him, "So, what are you
doing with your girlfriend?

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.660
Like, what's going on with your life?"

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.309
So, creating anxiety so he could have the
first sleepwalking incident.

00:11:11.309 --> 00:11:14.079
That would kick the thing off in a very normal
movie sort of way.

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:15.420
And when I heard it, I was like, "Great.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.420
You could do that."

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.989
And you could build just to, to basically,
finally he--.

00:11:18.989 --> 00:11:22.529
I mean, this isn't such a spoiler because
it's on the poster and all.

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:24.360
Ends up jumping out a window.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.929
He jumps through, like there's a series of
increasingly spectacular sleepwalk incidents

00:11:29.929 --> 00:11:31.839
as he doesn't deal with the stuff in his life.

00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:36.490
His anxiety gets expressed through these funny
and spectacular sleepwalk incidents culminating

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:39.899
with him nearly dying, jumping through a window
and nearly dying.

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:43.339
And then he'll have to decide like, what to
do about the girl, basically.

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:44.790
And it seemed like once I saw that, it's like,
OK.

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.839
It's a very traditional structure.

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:51.939
And it could be a film because the way I think
about these things is so math-based in a way.

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:55.029
Like, if I can see the structure, but I feel
like, OK, then it can be real.

00:11:55.029 --> 00:11:56.300
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Yeah.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.300
Like a sentence diagram.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.300
You can see the little parts where--.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.300
&gt;&gt;Ira: That's exactly right.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.300
Like, I need that.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.779
And when I'm making stories for the radio
show, in fact, like there's a lot of like,

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:03.779
there's diagramming.

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:04.779
So.

00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:08.470
&gt;&gt;Brendan: And speaking of the physicality
of the movie, Mike, there's a lot of--.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.170
I mean, you're primarily a stage performer.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.519
This movie, you got a chance to just be chased
around and run through fields and jump out

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:17.980
of windows and crash off of furniture.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:23.360
Was it weird being a physical specimen in
front of the camera versus where your stage

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.360
show, you're much more subdued?

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.449
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah.

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:30.579
It was a lot more physically rigorous than
my everyday life.

00:12:30.579 --> 00:12:31.579
[laughter]

00:12:31.579 --> 00:12:33.350
I had to sprint through that field.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.519
&gt;&gt;Ira: So many times.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:36.910
&gt;&gt;Mike: Over and over and over again.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:42.360
And then what was worse is that I had to do
it, fall, 'cause as you can see in the scene,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.129
I fall in a field that's not a set on Paramount's
lot.

00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:49.129
[laughter]

00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:50.129
With a field.

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:53.240
It's an actual field that I fall into.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:13:01.839
I jump up and then I jog over to where there's
playback and I watch what I just did.

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:05.160
And I say, "It's good," or "It's not good."

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.239
And then, usually it's not good.

00:13:07.239 --> 00:13:08.239
[laughter]

00:13:08.239 --> 00:13:09.329
And then we do it again.

00:13:09.329 --> 00:13:13.369
&gt;&gt;Ira: There was a lot, I was amazed at the
amount of falling, yeah.

00:13:13.369 --> 00:13:14.369
[laughter]

00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:16.009
&gt;&gt;Mike: There was so much falling.

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:18.259
It was, and running.

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:20.709
Just so much physical ru--.

00:13:20.709 --> 00:13:25.459
And the other thing is that I make my topless
debut in this film.

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:26.459
[laughter]

00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:31.709
This is something rarely talked about, but
I feel comfortable talking with you Google

00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:36.189
folks about it because you guys Google the
word "topless" all the time.

00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:37.189
[laughter]

00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:38.189
I don't know.

00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:40.619
It was a good Google joke.

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:43.629
It was much better than it was received.

00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:44.629
[laughter]

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:47.459
Shame on you, Google.

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:49.369
No, it's, Mike Birbiglia.

00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:55.339
If you Google Mike Birbiglia topless, this
movie comes up because we were shooting that

00:13:55.339 --> 00:14:00.639
scene where I sleepwalk down the hallway after
I have this certain dream.

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:09.079
And I was like, "You know, it's just funnier
and grittier and more real if I don't have

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:10.079
my shirt on."

00:14:10.079 --> 00:14:11.880
And I swear.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.170
This is gonna sound ridiculous and not real,
but like, I swore to myself internally when

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.739
I started acting like in college that I would
never do a topless scene.

00:14:21.739 --> 00:14:22.739
[laughter]

00:14:22.739 --> 00:14:23.959
I swear to God.

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:25.300
I'm not even making that up.

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.300
&gt;&gt;Ira: Really?

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.189
&gt;&gt;Mike: I think that's a decision that every
actor makes.

00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:29.189
&gt;&gt;Ira: Why?

00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:30.189
Wait, why?

00:14:30.189 --> 00:14:31.189
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Is it when you're a writer for
a different contract?

00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:34.999
&gt;&gt;Mike: Usually it's actresses who make that
decision, but in this case, I'm just so self-conscious

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:41.569
that I was like, "Oh, I could be an actor,
but I would never take my shirt off and certainly

00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:45.129
not my pants off."

00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:48.999
But I did just because I got so swept up in
what's good for the movie.

00:14:48.999 --> 00:14:51.379
&gt;&gt;Brendan: The other thing is like you're
the director of the movie.

00:14:51.379 --> 00:14:54.869
So, you would have to tell yourself to get
over this mental hump that you have to take

00:14:54.869 --> 00:14:55.869
your shirt off.

00:14:55.869 --> 00:14:56.869
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah.

00:14:56.869 --> 00:15:00.259
I had to say to myself, "Hey, Mike.

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:01.999
It's cool.

00:15:01.999 --> 00:15:03.749
Be cool."

00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:04.749
[laughter]

00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:05.771
And I was like, "Alright.

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:06.771
I don't know."

00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:07.980
And then Mike would say, "No, baby.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.980
Be cool."

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:09.980
I was like, "I don't know."

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:14.249
And then the crew was just staring at me having
this conversation with myself.

00:15:14.249 --> 00:15:18.040
&gt;&gt;Ira: But you can tell when you watch the
film that the directing was done by a black

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.559
man from the '70s.

00:15:19.559 --> 00:15:20.790
[laughter]

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.639
&gt;&gt;Mike: That wasn't a black voice.

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:25.639
[laughter]

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:28.089
That was not a black man's voice.

00:15:28.089 --> 00:15:29.089
&gt;&gt;Ira: Whatever.

00:15:29.089 --> 00:15:31.309
&gt;&gt;Mike: That was just a cool, high school
guy's voice.

00:15:31.309 --> 00:15:32.309
&gt;&gt;Ira: OK.

00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:33.309
Alright.

00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:34.309
Point taken.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.309
Point taken.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.309
&gt;&gt;Mike: I sound like a guy I went to high
school with.

00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:39.199
&gt;&gt;Brendan: You both, you both started your
careers before the web and social media really

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:40.199
took off.

00:15:40.199 --> 00:15:44.350
And Ira in particular, shows a pretty good
example of how traditional media can leverage

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.709
the web to expand your audiences.

00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:46.709
&gt;&gt;Ira: Yes.

00:15:46.709 --> 00:15:47.709
Yes.

00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:48.720
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Do you even, I read an interview
of you a few years ago.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.689
You said that when you started the podcast,
your weekly audience didn't change.

00:15:53.689 --> 00:15:55.549
It stayed around one point eight million or
so?

00:15:55.549 --> 00:15:56.939
&gt;&gt;Ira: One point eight million on the radio
each week.

00:15:56.939 --> 00:15:58.929
&gt;&gt;Brendan: But the podcast added another half
million.

00:15:58.929 --> 00:16:00.639
&gt;&gt;Ira: Right now, it's like 700 thousand.

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:01.639
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Seven hundred thousand.

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:05.150
And that skews overwhelmingly towards younger
people who may not even listen to the radio

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.150
at all.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.150
&gt;&gt;Ira: Yes.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.150
Yeah.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.779
&gt;&gt;Mike: The only people who don't listen to
his show are that lady and that guy.

00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:11.779
[laughter]

00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:13.970
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I've been listening to that show.

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.899
&gt;&gt;Brendan: I was gonna say, do you have a
preference for how people listen to your show,

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:18.899
or is it all good?

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:20.359
&gt;&gt;Ira: Oh, I don't care.

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:22.299
I mean, I mean, the thing--.

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:25.470
&gt;&gt;Mike: The correct answer is, it's all good,
bro.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:26.470
[laughter]

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.639
&gt;&gt;Ira: It's all good, bro.

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:29.639
[laughter]

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:30.639
Was that good?

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:31.639
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah, it was good.

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:32.639
You killed.

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:33.639
&gt;&gt;Ira: Yeah?

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:34.639
Yeah.

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:35.639
I mean, I mean, yeah.

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:36.639
I don't care.

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:37.639
&gt;&gt;Brendan: That's good.

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:39.360
It's, you saying "It's all good, bro," is
gonna be an internet meme in about 30 minutes

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.360
or so.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:41.360
[laughter]

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.360
&gt;&gt;Ira: I feel like such a--.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.360
[clapping]

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:44.360
I think that's such a corny meme, though,
that's like, but anyway.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.360
Alright.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.989
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Yeah.

00:16:46.989 --> 00:16:49.699
&gt;&gt;Mike: It's all good, bro.

00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:50.709
&gt;&gt;Ira: Yeah.

00:16:50.709 --> 00:16:53.220
&gt;&gt;Mike: He won't repeat it.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.079
Now that you know what these Google people
can do to you.

00:16:57.079 --> 00:16:58.079
[laughter]

00:16:58.079 --> 00:16:59.759
You're like, "A meme?

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:02.019
I gotta find out what that is."

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:03.029
[laughter]

00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:10.170
&gt;&gt;Brendan: But Mike, the flip-side of that
is a lot of comedians now build their entire

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.690
careers on sorry, Mike, Bob Dylan.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:18.230
They build their whole careers on the web
and social media.

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.230
But you're--.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.621
&gt;&gt;Ira: You're the only person I've ever seen
who gets less sexy when you put a cigarette

00:17:21.621 --> 00:17:22.621
in your mouth.

00:17:22.621 --> 00:17:23.621
Just do that again.

00:17:23.621 --> 00:17:24.621
[laughter]

00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:25.670
Like, you have no air of menace.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.030
Do it again.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.030
It's crazy.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.850
Like, anybody else looks cooler.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.850
What are you doing wrong?

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.050
[laughs] Exactly.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.050
[laughter]

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.770
&gt;&gt;Mike: What do you mean?

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:43.050
Doesn't that look cool?

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:45.730
They're never gonna put this in 'cause it's
Google has a cigarette and cigarettes are

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.130
evil.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:54.300
&gt;&gt;Brendan: [laughs] I was saying that in a
lot of ways, the one-man show is the antithesis

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:59.280
of the 140-character joke structure that a
lot of comedians build their careers on now.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.280
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.810
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Do you feel strongly about how
the web or social media is affecting comedy

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:03.950
in the comedy world?

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:10.870
&gt;&gt;Mike: It's certainly affecting it whether
it's positive or negative, there's really

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.360
no way to know like for a long time.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.360
[laughter]

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.820
&gt;&gt;Ira: That's not it.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:16.820
[laughs]

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.820
&gt;&gt;Mike: What?

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.240
&gt;&gt;Ira: It's affecting it, whether it's good
or bad there's no way to know?

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:25.290
That is the most non-committal answer I've
ever heard to anything.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.840
That could be the answer to any question.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840
[laughter]

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.750
What do you think of the oil situation and
the price of gas and is it gonna be going

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:33.750
up?

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:34.750
&gt;Mike: There's no way to know.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:35.750
[laughter]

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.750
It could be good.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.750
It could be bad.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.990
No way to know.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.760
&gt;&gt;Ira: I just think like just for Rob Delaney's
tweets alone it's worth having an internet.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.760
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.760
It's worth it.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.630
&gt;&gt;Ira: Like, have you ever seen his show?

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.440
&gt;&gt;Mike: I follow him on Twitter constantly.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.550
&gt;&gt;Ira: Everyone follows him.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.360
No, he's amazing on Twitter, but yeah.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.250
Like, who knows how he is in stand-up?

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:04.380
&gt;&gt;Mike: Twitter's good for comedy in the sense
that comedians are able to find their audience,

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.180
which is good.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.240
And I don't know.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.670
Like, it seems good.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.670
I honestly--.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:14.530
&gt;&gt;Ira: You've been marketing to an audience
over the internet.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.530
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.530
&gt;&gt;Ira: You put up a journal.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.450
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah, I have my blog, My Secret Public
Journal.

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.360
And I've been writing on that since, it is.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.920
It's called My Secret Public Journal.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.920
[laughter]

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920
Dot com.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.290
And I was, I mean, yeah.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.550
I guess so.

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:30.920
I think the answer is yes.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.830
I mean, like I started doing comedy when I
was 19 and I'm 34 now.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:38.130
So, I guess I've been doing it for like 15
years.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.130
And when I--.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.330
&gt;&gt;Ira: You are totally pulling out the math
for these engineers.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.530
It's amazing how you're catering the whole
thing to this crowd.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:45.530
[laughter]

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:51.790
&gt;&gt;Mike: Just doing it to process it for myself.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:53.430
[laughter]

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:59.720
But I've been doing it for a number of years.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.060
[laughter]

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.320
And yeah.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:16.480
Even when I started out in '97 or '98, I was,
I would keep an email list from after my shows.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.281
&gt;&gt;Ira: And did you have like, how many people
did you have on that list?

00:20:18.281 --> 00:20:22.130
&gt;&gt;Mike: Well, there was only like ten people
had email addresses.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:23.270
[laughter]

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:24.270
It was a very few.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.150
But no, it was a small group.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.350
Honestly, it was like, I was so delusional
starting out.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.300
First of all, I was terrible.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.010
So it was like, who would wanna be on my email
list?

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:40.820
Second of all, I mean, after like two or three
years, I had like probably 300 people on my

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.360
email list spread across the United States.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:51.710
So, if I had a show in like, Pierre, there's
probably one person on the list.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.620
So, there's not, it wasn't that effective
in that sense.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:05.120
But then, as that list grew and I, it became
this thing where people started to come out

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:09.090
to see me on purpose as opposed to going to
see the "comedy show,"--

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:10.090
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Yeah.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:20.250
&gt;&gt;Mike: which was always my goal 'cause I
wasn't, I was not immediately a comedian who

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:27.280
you'd want to see because I was soft-spoken
and I was like, kind of strange.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.650
I wasn't that mean.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:33.360
I feel like mean comedy was always selling
really well when I started out.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.580
People would get up on stage and they're like,
"You're fat.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:36.580
You're gay.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.580
I'm out of here."

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:38.580
[laughter]

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.280
And they would be like, "This guy's a genius."

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.720
I'd be like, I don't think he's a genius.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.900
I don't know.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.490
I don't get it.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:49.410
But that's never my, that was never my sense
of humor.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.310
Like, I was always a little fat and a little
gay.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.310
[laughter]

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.910
I, but, and so like--.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.040
&gt;&gt;Brendan: That could be title of your next
one-man show.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.040
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.660
A Little Fat and a Little Gay.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.210
And, but neither at the same time.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.220
Alright.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.850
Did you just stop my joke?

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:08.120
I think that's what just happened.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.400
I was gonna say, OK.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400
&gt;&gt;Brendan: We have--.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.030
&gt;&gt;Mike: No, but I actually have an answer.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.590
I have an answer for the question.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.680
&gt;&gt;Ira: The question was how did the internet
affect comedy?

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680
&gt;&gt;Mike: So, the internet, the internet thing.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.680
Yeah.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:18.680
&gt;&gt;Ira: We're still on that?

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:19.680
&gt;&gt;Mike: I guess so.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.330
We got sidetracked, but I think we're gonna
end strong.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.330
&gt;&gt;Ira: Bring it.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.330
Bring it.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.330
Bring it.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.330
Bring it.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:32.550
&gt;&gt;Mike: So, cut to now and I have like 150
thousand Twitter followers.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.890
And I think some of the first people who signed
up for my email list are probably Twitter

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:37.910
followers now.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:44.200
And that audience has evolved as, and liked
me on Facebook and all that stuff.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.620
And so, I get, in terms of getting an audience
that likes what you do if what you do is really

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.960
specific, I think the internet is really good.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:57.270
The same way that like, people are always
like, "Oh, they make fun of people for going

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.270
on dating sites”.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.850
And I'm like, "Well, why would you make fun
of, you're just saying things that you might

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:07.800
be compatible with and then those people are
saying what they might be compatible with

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.540
and then that might work out."

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.690
You know what I mean?

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.280
Like, it's actually very logical.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.780
It's like being set up by a friend, except
the friend is a computer 'cause that's our

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.430
new friend in this era that we're in.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.430
[laughter]

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.430
But yeah.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:30.040
And so, I feel like with artists, it's like
a dating, the internet is like a dating site

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.740
for artists with their fans.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.740
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Nice.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.610
Well, we have a few, two audience mics here.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.560
We can take a few questions.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.230
So if you wanna ask a question of either person
here you can feel free to just line up.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.970
&gt;&gt;Ira: Have we sold the movie hard enough
while we're waiting?

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:42.970
&gt;&gt;Mike: Oh, yeah.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:43.970
We love the movie.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:44.970
[laughter]

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:45.970
&gt;&gt;Ira: The movie's really funny.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:46.970
&gt;&gt;Brendan: It's great.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.970
I watched it last night.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:52.760
&gt;&gt;Mike: Do you guys feel sold on the movie
based on what's happened so far?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.400
[applause]

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.640
That felt light.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.640
[laughter]

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.640
&gt;&gt;Ira: So?

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.000
&gt;&gt;Mike: That felt light.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.840
So, let me sell you on the movie.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.680
The movie's really funny.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.380
&gt;&gt;Ira: The movie is really funny.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.710
&gt;&gt;Mike: And we, it's a real labor of love.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:18.800
And it's something that you can bring your
teenagers to or your parents.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.500
There's one curse word in the whole movie.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.150
There's nothing in it that's like excessively
violent or shocking, but I think it's a pretty

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.520
compelling story that we're telling and with
consistent laughs in it.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:37.390
And it's, we showed it at Sundance and South
By Southwest and the response from audiences

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:42.550
has been really consistently lovely and warm.

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:47.930
And I feel like that's why Ira and I are here
at Google today and it's why we're going on

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.850
talk shows and why we're talking about it
a lot, because when Ira and I don't like stuff

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:56.260
that we do, we don't tell people about it.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.260
&gt;&gt;Ira: We don't promote it.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.560
&gt;&gt;Mike: We're just like, "Let's pretend that
never happened."

00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.960
[laughter]

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.300
And so, yeah.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.430
We really urge you to go see it.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.910
&gt;&gt;Ira: Like my goal was that, like I hope
that we can make a movie that would have the

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:14.280
feeling of the best stories on the radio show
where you just get pulled into it and funny

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.160
parts and be emotional.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:22.290
And truthfully, through a lot of the process
of making the film, it did not have that quality.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:26.620
And only in the course of editing it, showing
it to audiences, and remaking it, did it start

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:28.570
to feel like something from the radio show.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.990
And I feel like it really does.

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.990
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Great.

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:34.930
And we have our first question over here.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:35.930
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Hi.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.990
I listened to the original "Sleepwalk With
Me," one of the original iterations of it

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.770
and it's just such a--.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.480
&gt;&gt;Mike: Can you come closer to the thing?

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.720
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Hi. [laughs]

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.270
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah, that's gonna help.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.430
&gt;&gt;Female #3: It's such a dear story to you
and it involves a lot of people you're really

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.050
close with and you go into a lot of detail
about them.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.520
I was wondering about the casting process
and how surreal that must have been to try

00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.300
and find your family and your ex-girlfriend
in this sea of actors.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.910
I'd love to hear more about that, how you
went about finding these people.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:08.090
&gt;&gt;Mike: Well, Lauren was the first person
who we asked to--.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:10.930
&gt;&gt;Ira: This is Lauren Ambrose who plays his
girlfriend.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.060
&gt;&gt;Mike: And yeah.

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.490
My, that was my wife's idea.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:22.640
My wife, Jennie, who's very close to like
every part of the process of all my projects

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.630
since we've met.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:29.870
We were always talking about like it's really,
how it's really important that whoever plays

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:36.830
the girlfriend in this film, that plays Abby,
has to be, has to emanate strength and humor

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:42.270
because if she doesn't, then we'll feel bad
for her at the end, inevitably.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.800
And we don't wanna feel bad for her.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:49.640
We wanna feel happy for both of these characters
that things are gonna be better for them both.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:55.750
And so, my wife is a big fan of "Six Feet
Under" and I never had seen it 'cause I couldn't

00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:59.070
afford cable when it was on.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.200
And so, I caught up with it a little bit.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.990
And I was like, "Oh, yeah.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.990
She's perfect."

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:08.180
And so I invited her to a show that I was
doing at Town Hall.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:14.340
And her and her husband came and we struck
up a conversation and she came to some of

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:15.340
the readings.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.540
She did about four or five readings of it
over the course of a year.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.440
So, she was, that was done.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.640
She was always great in the readings.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.960
And then, Carol was similar.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.870
Carol was someone I had met in the casting
process of a pilot I did for CBS on 2008,

00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:36.820
where we were talking about casting her.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.620
And it didn't work out for like a variety
of reasons.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:43.320
There were a lot of chefs in that process.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.320
But Carol and I--.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.360
&gt;&gt;Ira: It's so crazy that you can meet Carol
Kane.

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.740
Like, the fact that we know Carol Kane to
me is really--.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:49.740
&gt;&gt;Mike: I know.

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.260
It's really wild 'cause like, when we were
in the casting process for that pilot, they

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.680
were like, "What about Carol Kane?"

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.700
And I said just that.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.050
I was like, "We could ask Carol Kane to do
this?"

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.400
And they were like, "Well, you can ask anybody."

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.400
And I was like, "OK."

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.150
And we sent her the script and she really
liked it.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:11.490
And then she and I became friends and had
just kept saying, "Let's do something together,"

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:16.630
because I just think she, her sense of comedy
is so unique.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.300
And what she brings to it is so special.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.130
It's like, what we wrote on the page is like
this.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.400
And then what she does is like this.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.000
And so, we'll be indebted for her, to her
forever.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.860
&gt;&gt;Ira: The thing is, like with all the casting,
we didn't try to make them be like the real

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.860
people.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:34.860
Like, they don't physically look like them--

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:35.860
&gt;&gt;Mike: True.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.480
&gt;&gt;Ira: and the parents especially are very
different than Mike's real parents.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:45.320
&gt;&gt;Mike: And that's why we had them, part of
the reason we had fake names--Matt Pandamiglio,

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.580
not Mike Birbiglia.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:51.690
Linda Pandamiglio and all that 'cause we wanted
to nod to the fact that it's autobiographical,

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.800
but not to say that it is a documentary.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.430
&gt;&gt;Ira: It's funny 'cause I think the weird,
the person through the whole thing was the

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.730
weirdest for was Mike's girlfriend, who the
movie is about.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.120
&gt;&gt;Mike: My ex-girlfriend, yeah.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.270
&gt;&gt;Ira: His ex-girlfriend who came and saw
the film.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:05.090
After it was done, she saw it at BAM.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:06.090
We did this screening.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:10.350
And so it's like when the BAM opera house
and it's 15 hundred people or two thousand

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.060
people or whatever that thing holds and afterwards,
she came.

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.970
I said he was there and she like came up to
you and like, I think she had the weirdest

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:23.250
experience, much weirder than yours 'cause
you had like gone through every stage of filming

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.250
it.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:29.390
But can you image like your ex-boyfriend makes
a movie about your relationship, depicting

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:30.760
actual things that happened.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.340
And then, you're at a movie theater and there
it is.

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:38.270
It's like a period of your life depicted by
incredibly skilled actors, shot by a great

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.270
cinematographer.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.780
It's like for her it was so weird and she
was so teary, like so moved.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.450
It was really an amazing thing I think for
her.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.870
I mean, hearing her talk about it afterwards
was really interesting.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:55.410
&gt;&gt;Mike: And then the rest of the casting was
by Jennifer Houston, who is a brilliant casting

00:29:55.410 --> 00:30:00.120
director who casts "Girls" on HBO and who
I've known for a long time and I've auditioned

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.970
for successfully for years.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:02.970
[laughter]

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:03.970
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Thanks.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:05.380
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Thank you very much.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.440
&gt;&gt;Brendan: I have another one.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hi.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:16.231
You're both doing tons of Q and As, press
junkets, and screenings.

00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:17.231
What do you do to relax or cool off once you've
finished your 14 screenings a day?

00:30:17.231 --> 00:30:18.231
&gt;&gt;Ira: We don't actually.

00:30:18.231 --> 00:30:21.230
I mean, I'm gonna go back and go back to writing
this week's radio show because it's not clear.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:27.600
We've recorded two different versions of the
top of the show and one should be, by nature,

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.700
three minutes and one should be, by nature,
like, neither one is gonna work basically.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.170
[chuckles]
So, I'm gonna just go back to my job.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.990
And then you haven't really been working.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.040
You haven't had any time off at all.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.040
[laughter]

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.890
You seem so burned out.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.120
&gt;&gt;Mike: You seem burned out.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.120
[laughter]

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.640
Nice glasses, loser.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.640
[laughter]

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.940
&gt;&gt;Ira: Are you asking that because you can
take us out and get us Ecstasy or something?

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.940
[laughter]

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.940
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I can't comment.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.940
&gt;&gt;Mike: Memed.

00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.510
You're gonna get memed on that, because you
can take us out and get us Ecstasy?

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.090
You don't think they're gonna meme that?

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.310
You don't know what memes even are.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:05.310
[laughter]

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.830
&gt;&gt;Ira: I was semiotics student.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.830
I know what memes are.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.400
I knew memes before they were on the internet.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.400
[laughter]

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.820
&gt;&gt;Mike: That's gonna be memed.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.470
[laughter]

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.030
So, the question is what?

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.030
&gt;&gt;Ira: He wants to know--.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:23.030
[laughter]

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:30.000
&gt;&gt;Mike: The question is like what do we do
for fun.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.360
We just party, you know what I mean?

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.830
Like, we have a Hollywood lifestyle.

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:42.330
We're guys, we're guys that like, five nights
a week we are trolling the bars.

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.460
We are out on the town.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.300
We see Broadway musicals.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.300
[laughter]

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.420
&gt;&gt;Ira: You think that's the party lifestyle?

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.420
[laughter]

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.420
Who told you that?

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.960
&gt;&gt;Mike: I turned it gay at the end.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.080
I started out being like an "Entourage" thing.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.850
And then I made it like a "Glee" thing.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:00.850
[laughter]

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:08.060
No, we don't do anything for fun except hang
out with my wife and our cat, Ivan.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.060
That's like the best thing we do.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.060
We watch movies.

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:11.060
&gt;&gt;Ira: It's actually the truth.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.060
&gt;&gt;Mike: No, like that's all we do.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.240
My wife and I go see movies.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.090
This weekend we saw "Ruby Sparks," which is
really good.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.360
We saw "Beasts of the Southern Wild."

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.440
Saw "Hello, I Must be Going."

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.620
There's a lot of really good indie films out
right now.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.630
We saw "Compliance."

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:24.240
I see a ton of movies and I hang out with
my wife and our cat.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.240
Thanks very much.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.290
&gt;&gt;Female #4: OK, so this is for Mike.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:30.750
I know that your brother Joe Bags is in a
lot of your stand-up.

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:32.840
Is he in the actual movie, like making a cameo?

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.840
'Cause that would be awesome.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.840
&gt;&gt;Mike: No.

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.340
And there's a reason he didn't, which is,
and he's one of the co-writers on the film

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.780
and has a lot of hilarious lines in the film.

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:47.960
He, we were gonna use him in the wedding scene
where it's like my family, but so many people

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:54.550
come up to him thinking that he's me because
we look very similar, that then it's even

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:55.880
worse on the big screen.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.929
It's like, even if you catch a glimpse of
him, you go, "Wait, is that the protagonist?"

00:32:58.929 --> 00:33:00.790
And then, it takes you out of it.

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.200
And so, that was why he wasn't in there.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.200
&gt;&gt;Brendan: Thanks.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.750
&gt;&gt;Mike: Well, look out for Joe Bags in future
films.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:07.750
[laughter]

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.330
Joey Bag O' Donuts.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:15.190
By the way, for people who have no idea what
she's talking about, there's a track on my

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:20.761
album, My Secret Public Journal Live, which
I think is called Joey Bag O' Donuts, or Joe

00:33:20.761 --> 00:33:23.530
Bags, Joey Bags, about my brother Joe.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:28.040
And it's a funny story and you can listen
to it.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.040
[laughter]

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:32.060
You can rip it for free off the internet 'cause
you guys are good at that.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.060
[laughter]

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.060
&gt;&gt;Brendan: The last question.

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.060
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thanks.

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.060
Hi.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.300
This is a question for both of you.

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:44.429
How have you found your story-telling styles
changing as you've grown and been in the industry

00:33:44.429 --> 00:33:45.429
more and more?

00:33:45.429 --> 00:33:48.100
&gt;&gt;Mike: Well, Ira's grown a lot longer than
I have.

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.100
[laughter]

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.190
&gt;&gt;Ira: Well, that's true.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:51.980
That's not even a joke.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.500
But I also started later than you did.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.870
Like, I feel like you're much more precocious
than I am.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.280
Like, you were more successful in your 20s.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.640
Like, you were hugely successful in your 20s,
whereas I was a late bloomer.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:11.700
But anyway, like for me, I feel like when
I listen to earlier work, I can hear myself

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:16.089
trying so hard to make the stories have significance.

00:34:16.089 --> 00:34:20.389
And listening to recordings of myself, listening
to old pieces where I'm just trying so hard

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:26.169
to make the stories have like, meaning and
importance has made me back way the hell off

00:34:26.169 --> 00:34:33.059
on that and just say less about them and let
them talk for themselves more.

00:34:33.059 --> 00:34:37.379
I mean, on the radio, like when you're telling
a story, like you wanna move the plot forward,

00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:39.909
but then also periodically someone in the
story has to say like, "Here's what I'm trying

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:40.909
to say with this story.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.559
Here's what the story means.

00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:44.460
Here's the point."

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.409
And early on, I was so worried that the stories
didn't have a point.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.599
I would just totally, it was like pouring
syrup on the stories.

00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:54.570
When I listen to some of the early episodes
of the show, I feel kind of embarrassed.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:35:00.089
&gt;&gt;Mike: And now, you're so indifferent when
you speak on the radio--

00:35:00.089 --> 00:35:01.089
[laughter]

00:35:01.089 --> 00:35:03.109
that it's comical.

00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:06.880
People are just, people hear you go, "Act
One, Holocaust."

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.880
[laughter]

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.749
"Act Two, Somalia."

00:35:09.749 --> 00:35:14.069
&gt;&gt;Ira: Yeah, that's a good point.

00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:17.680
&gt;&gt;Mike: "Act Three, East Africa."

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.319
And people like, isn't it more important than
that?

00:35:20.319 --> 00:35:25.369
Like, isn't it more dramatic than the way
that you're just throwing those lines away?

00:35:25.369 --> 00:35:27.619
You're like, "Well, I guess so."

00:35:27.619 --> 00:35:30.130
&gt;&gt;Ira: Wait, is that your imitation?

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:37.730
&gt;&gt;Mike: It fell away at the end and it just
blended into me speaking with a high voice.

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:42.640
&gt;&gt;Ira: I feel like your whole, your whole
situation has gotten so big in your story-telling

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.779
in the last four, five years.

00:35:43.779 --> 00:35:46.160
&gt;&gt;Mike: By my situation, you mean--?

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.509
&gt;&gt;Ira: Your skills, your massive skills.

00:35:47.509 --> 00:35:49.650
Are we fighting?

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:50.650
[laughter]

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:53.029
&gt;&gt;Mike: We're having comical repartee.

00:35:53.029 --> 00:35:54.029
&gt;&gt;Ira: OK.

00:35:54.029 --> 00:35:56.329
Feels a little like fighting.

00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:57.329
[laughter]

00:35:57.329 --> 00:36:00.900
&gt;&gt;Mike: "Act One, We Fight."

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:01.900
[laughter]

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.799
"Act Two, We Make Up."

00:36:05.799 --> 00:36:10.820
What was the question?

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:11.820
I'm just kidding.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.820
I know the question.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.499
It's, how do we change as story-tellers or
evolve as story-tellers?

00:36:15.499 --> 00:36:16.839
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yeah.

00:36:16.839 --> 00:36:19.059
&gt;&gt;Ira: That's a good question.

00:36:19.059 --> 00:36:20.839
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Thank you.

00:36:20.839 --> 00:36:21.839
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah.

00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:25.849
The, when you guys get finished, I'm gonna
answer this one.

00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:30.640
Sorry, I thought it was funny 'cause he goes,
"Thank you."

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.920
It didn't allow for me to answer.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:39.220
I hope they edit this.

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.630
That's what the opening shot should be.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:41.630
[laughter]

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:44.550
&gt;&gt;Ira: Write a note to the editors, where
ever you are.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.920
&gt;&gt;Mike: Can we just go in, the tight scene,
of me going, "I hope they edit this."

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.920
[laughter]

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.920
And then it's unedited.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.920
[laughter]

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.390
&gt;&gt;Brendan: They'll add the cigarette in there,
too, at the end.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.480
Do you have the cigarette?

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.089
&gt;&gt;Mike: Oh, my mom is gonna be so ashamed
of the cigarette thing.

00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:03.640
Mom, mom, mom, mom.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.960
I'm not smoking.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.880
I'm doing it as a joke.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.900
&gt;&gt;Ira: It's not lit.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.319
&gt;&gt;Mike: Yeah.

00:37:10.319 --> 00:37:13.349
But she doesn't even understand how cigarettes
work.

00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:14.349
[laughter]

00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:17.130
Mom, I'm kidding.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.970
&gt;&gt;Ira: So, anyway.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:21.930
So, speaking for Mr. Birbiglia.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:23.990
&gt;&gt;Mike: No, no, no.

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:27.550
No, I was, when I started out, I was just
doing jokes.

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:34.340
I was modeling myself after Jerry Seinfeld
and Steven Wright and a lot of observational

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.480
comedians who I really admire.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:45.670
And then, over the years, like I started between
performing at The Moth in 2003 and just doing

00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:47.359
these longer sets.

00:37:47.359 --> 00:37:51.950
I got booked at a ton of colleges starting
out because no one else would book me.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:54.569
And colleges have really low standards.

00:37:54.569 --> 00:38:02.519
They're just like, "We need someone to stand
in the coffee house for an hour who's an adult."

00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:03.650
And so, I performed.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.650
And you can perform for like an hour, an hour
and a half, two hours.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.769
And in order to fill the time, a lot of times
I would just tell more and more stories.

00:38:11.769 --> 00:38:17.930
What I found was I was like, well this is
just, these are actually, I'm better at this.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:25.410
I think this is something that happens a lot
of times with artists or people in all fields

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:29.119
is they start on one path and they realize,
"Oh, I'm actually better at this other thing."

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:36.490
And I think what I found was that when I was
telling stories, there was more passion in

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.099
my delivery.

00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:42.640
And as a result, more passion from the audience
coming back at me because I cared about what

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.880
I was talking about, as opposed to, I feel
like there's, right now, we're witnessing

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:54.280
a post-Seinfeld--and I love Seinfeld--but
a post-Seinfeld era of--.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.019
It's not observational comedy anymore because
observational comedy has become ubiquitous

00:38:59.019 --> 00:39:01.450
in TV ads, in billboards.

00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.740
And it's like everything is a joke.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:06.069
Everything's an observational joke.

00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:11.760
I feel like comedians have gone the other
way between like Louis CK and Marc Maron and

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:18.009
Maria Bamford, and even in the movie realm
like Judd Apatow, where its become more personal

00:39:18.009 --> 00:39:21.190
and more specific.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:26.319
And I think that that's the, I don't know,
that's the direction that I went in and I

00:39:26.319 --> 00:39:33.500
just find it to be, I'm able to connect with
people more by telling stories.

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:39.029
And then meeting Ira was great because he
just, when I met Seth Barrish, that was really--.

00:39:39.029 --> 00:39:40.980
&gt;&gt;Ira: He directed your one-man show.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:43.240
&gt;&gt;Mike: He directed the one-man shows.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:47.890
That was really helpful for me developing
longer stories and longer pieces.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:52.880
So, my one-person shows are, have more of
an art to them.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:59.869
And then when I met Ira, it really got me
focused on elements of story-telling that

00:39:59.869 --> 00:40:01.049
I hadn't considered.

00:40:01.049 --> 00:40:04.430
Like, if you watch Ira, and this is a good
place to say this 'cause people are watching

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:10.400
this online, there's this incredible YouTube
series of clips of Ira talking about story-telling,

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.200
how to tell a story.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.119
And I feel like, they all have to do with
surprise.

00:40:16.119 --> 00:40:19.030
&gt;&gt;Ira: Those clips, it's the craziest thing.

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:23.549
That was this thing where somebody just came
by the office to videotape as a training video

00:40:23.549 --> 00:40:27.570
for Al Gore's television channel of how do
you tell a story.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:31.890
And I feel like on the internet, I am more
famous for those videos than I am for my actual

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:32.890
work.

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:33.890
Like, that's--.

00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.749
&gt;&gt;Mike: And that's how it should be because
those videos are really exceptional.

00:40:36.749 --> 00:40:37.749
[laughter]

00:40:37.749 --> 00:40:39.099
&gt;&gt;Ira: Versus your work?

00:40:39.099 --> 00:40:40.099
And yeah, no.

00:40:40.099 --> 00:40:41.099
So yeah.

00:40:41.099 --> 00:40:42.099
But when you and I started working together--

00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:43.480
&gt;&gt;Mike: Those videos are great and I highly
recommend them.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:48.269
&gt;&gt;Ira: like, you were naturally going to stories
which had more emotion and more feeling in

00:40:48.269 --> 00:40:53.069
them anyway, so they weren't just funny stories
with more just a real story arc.

00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:56.960
&gt;&gt;Mike: And I was really lucky because I was
able to work with the oracle.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:59.030
&gt;&gt;Ira: No, I was very lucky.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:00.239
&gt;&gt;Mike: I was very lucky.

00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:01.239
I was very fortunate.

00:41:01.239 --> 00:41:02.239
I feel like I was very lucky.

00:41:02.239 --> 00:41:03.239
&gt;&gt;Ira: No, I was the lucky one.

00:41:03.239 --> 00:41:05.500
&gt;&gt;Mike: I feel like I was so blessed.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.908
I feel so blessed that I'm able to work with
these people who are so brilliant geniuses

00:41:08.908 --> 00:41:09.908
who we just met who are just exuding the sense
of creativity and have natural arcs to the

00:41:09.908 --> 00:41:10.908
stories.

00:41:10.908 --> 00:41:11.908
And we're just so lucky.

00:41:11.908 --> 00:41:12.908
[indistinct]

00:41:12.908 --> 00:41:18.489
&gt;&gt;Ira: [indistinct] working on the radio because
you have a good editor because you have a

00:41:18.489 --> 00:41:21.579
radio show and the sense of going on and on
and talking about nothing at all and just

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:22.579
sort of talking to yourself--.

00:41:22.579 --> 00:41:23.579
[indistinct]

00:41:23.579 --> 00:41:24.579
[laughter]

00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:25.579
[clapping]

00:41:25.579 --> 00:41:26.579
[applause and cheering]

00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:27.579
&gt;&gt;Mike: I don't know.

00:41:27.579 --> 00:41:33.210
How does it end?

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:42.859
How do you end these things?

00:41:42.859 --> 00:41:46.670
&gt;&gt;Brendan: I think you, and you can't end
it any better than that.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.700
But I was just gonna say for people in the
audience here, the movie opens at the IFC

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.489
Center on 6th Avenue on Friday.

00:41:51.489 --> 00:41:53.099
Tickets are still available.

00:41:53.099 --> 00:41:55.559
They'll be doing Q and As, as they said, at
the shows.

00:41:55.559 --> 00:41:56.559
[laughter]

00:41:56.559 --> 00:41:57.559
So, if you'd like to--.

00:41:57.559 --> 00:41:59.970
&gt;&gt;Ira: And then, the week later doing the
same thing in Chicago and in Los Angeles.

00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:00.970
&gt;&gt;Mike: Sorry.

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:04.339
Is this thing--.

00:42:04.339 --> 00:42:08.599
And I'm doing a San Francisco September 2nd
at The Embarcadero.

00:42:08.599 --> 00:42:10.809
And the theater in Berkeley, movie theater--.

00:42:10.809 --> 00:42:13.490
&gt;&gt;Ira: Does Google have an office in San Francisco
yet?

00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:14.550
&gt;&gt;Female #6: Yes.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:15.970
&gt;&gt;Mike: Are you joking?

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:16.970
[laughter]

00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:17.970
&gt;&gt;Ira: Yes.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:21.359
&gt;&gt;Mike: The, and I'm gonna be at The Embarcadero
in San Francisco on that Sunday night.

00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:24.700
And on that Monday night, I'll be at the movie
theater in Berkeley, California, which is

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.940
one of my favorite places to go.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:29.470
And so, you guys in the Google West Coast--.

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:30.609
&gt;&gt;Ira: They've already seen you now.

00:42:30.609 --> 00:42:31.609
They don't need to see you again.

00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:37.349
&gt;&gt;Mike: No, but they'll see the movie and
then also they'll see the answers.

00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:39.359
[laughter]

00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:44.440
&gt;&gt;Brendan: And with that, ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in thanking Mike Birbiglia

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.440
and Ira Glass.

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.440
[applause]

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.440
[cheering]

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.440
&gt;&gt;Mike: Thanks, Brendan

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.440
&gt;&gt;Brendan: My pleasure.

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:49.445
&gt;&gt;Mike: Shake the man's hand.
