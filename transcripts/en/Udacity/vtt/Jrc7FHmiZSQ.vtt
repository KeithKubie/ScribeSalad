00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.160
With this proof, we've actually shown
something even stronger than the duality

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.390
theorem which we set out to show.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.120
Because we actually gave a way to
determine the dual optimal solution.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.825
We'll start with a linear program
in standard form as usual.

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:18.401
And we'll let the columns of
the matrix B form an optimal basis,

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:22.322
meaning that it generates
an optimal basic solution.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:26.549
Then y transpose, defined to be
CB transpose times B inverse is

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:31.725
an optimal solution to the dual
problem by our previous argument.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:34.595
Moreover, the optimum values
of the problems are equal.
