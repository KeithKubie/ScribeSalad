00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:04.504
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
 the 45th and final

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:06.472
 President of the United States.

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.840
Somber.

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:09.542
So somber.

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.110
You see that?

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:12.712
No applause.

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:16.382
My choice-- because this
has been a tough week.

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:20.787
And, folks, I understand tone.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.924
We suffered such great loss
at the hands of a man

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:28.728
who we were saddened to learn
is not a Muslim.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:29.996
(laughter)

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.833
I wanted so badly
for him to be a Muslim.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:37.036
Even ISIS wanted him
to be a Muslim.

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.273
Which is proof that sometimes
it takes a tragedy

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.874
to unite us.

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.877
Wow! Look at that tone!

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.613
This is a chance
for all Americans

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:49.882
to set aside our differences,

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:52.985
no matter which side
of the aisle you're on.

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:56.155
From the obstructionist,
freedom-stealing Democrats

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:59.859
to the un-American
witch-hunting Democrats,

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:02.962
we can't politicize
our politics!

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:04.297
Somber.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.898
(laughter)

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:08.067
It's in times like these

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.303
we must search for answers.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.605
That's why tonight's theme

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:14.907
is "Why?"

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.244
I know, as Americans,
we're all asking ourselves

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.279
the same question:

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:22.415
Why did this have to happen...

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:25.051
during my presidency?!

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.619
So many bad things.

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:28.788
Three hurricanes,
all these investigations

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.623
into my stupid campaign,

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:34.393
getting trash-talked
by that Puerto Rican lady mayor!

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.929
I mean, haven't
I been through enough!

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.798
Tone.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:41.034
Somber.

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:45.705
Nobody understands
how hard it is for me.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.575
Somber Trump.

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:53.412
To walk out here tonight
to no applause at all.

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:55.715
These people want to clap.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.651
You can't see them,
but they're dying to clap.

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:01.287
-(laughter)
-Isn't that right?

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.456
But I-- no.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.625
But I told them not to.

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.828
And for that,
I should be applauded.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.563
Okay, now! Do it!

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:13.466
-(cheering, applause)
-Look at that.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.301
We're already healing.

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:17.170
I'm the president!

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:18.905
Can you believe this?

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:19.938
Let's roll!
