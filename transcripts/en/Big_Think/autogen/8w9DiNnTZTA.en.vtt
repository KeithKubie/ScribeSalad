lot of the devaluation of the teaching

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260

phenomenal teachers but ultimately
 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.740
phenomenal teachers but ultimately
they're the exception not the rule and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750
they're the exception not the rule and
 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.050
they're the exception not the rule and
that's because we don't culturally value

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060
that's because we don't culturally value
 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.420

teachers people make the mistake of

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430
teachers people make the mistake of
 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.069
teachers people make the mistake of
thinking that the salary that we're

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079
thinking that the salary that we're
 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.910
thinking that the salary that we're
offering is somehow designed to make a

offering is somehow designed to make a
 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.399

to make them a better teacher that's

to make them a better teacher that's
 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.219
to make them a better teacher that's
completely missing the point of the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229
completely missing the point of the
 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.350
completely missing the point of the
project the point of the project is just

project the point of the project is just
 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.029

change the perception of who should

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039

in this culture money is a signifier of

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810
in this culture money is a signifier of
 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.429
in this culture money is a signifier of
value and so ultimately the goal is to

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439
value and so ultimately the goal is to
 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.429
value and so ultimately the goal is to
attract more talent into the into the

profession right now we draw from the

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350
profession right now we draw from the
 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.740
profession right now we draw from the
bottom third of college graduates to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750
bottom third of college graduates to
 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.459
bottom third of college graduates to
make up our teaching force and that's

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469
make up our teaching force and that's
 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.100
make up our teaching force and that's
you know that's unfortunate the goal

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110
you know that's unfortunate the goal
 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.200
you know that's unfortunate the goal
should be to draw from the top third of

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210
should be to draw from the top third of
 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.720
should be to draw from the top third of
college graduates to to make up our

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
college graduates to to make up our
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.229
college graduates to to make up our
teaching force I think actually teaching

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239
teaching force I think actually teaching
 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.630
teaching force I think actually teaching
is one of those professions where there

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640
is one of those professions where there
 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640
is one of those professions where there
are many people who secretly want to do

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650
are many people who secretly want to do
 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.480
are many people who secretly want to do
it and in

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490
it and in
 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.400
it and in
enjoy it when they're up there but don't

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410
enjoy it when they're up there but don't
 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.410
enjoy it when they're up there but don't
really view it as feasible they can't

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420
really view it as feasible they can't
 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.520
really view it as feasible they can't
support a family it's not really

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530
support a family it's not really
 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.760
support a family it's not really
realistic to achieve other goals that

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770
realistic to achieve other goals that
 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.920
realistic to achieve other goals that
they may have so I think teaching has a

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
they may have so I think teaching has a
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.780
they may have so I think teaching has a
built-in advantage over some other

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790
built-in advantage over some other
 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.530
built-in advantage over some other
professions we're four and I'm not not

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520
to pick on lawyers but you know I think
 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.680
to pick on lawyers but you know I think
there are a lot of people who love the

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690
there are a lot of people who love the
 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.360
there are a lot of people who love the
law but there are a lot of people who go

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
law but there are a lot of people who go
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.660
law but there are a lot of people who go
into the law just because it is it pays

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670
into the law just because it is it pays
 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.720
into the law just because it is it pays
the bills and it's a relatively

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730
the bills and it's a relatively
 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.220
the bills and it's a relatively
lucrative and respected profession I

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230
lucrative and respected profession I
 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.720
lucrative and respected profession I
mean that sense I think teaching

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730
mean that sense I think teaching
 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.030
mean that sense I think teaching
actually has a great advantage over

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040
actually has a great advantage over
 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.120
actually has a great advantage over
other professions the the problem is

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130
other professions the the problem is
 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.760
other professions the the problem is
that right now it's not realistic for a

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770
that right now it's not realistic for a
 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.940

lot of people who are talented to go
 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.860
lot of people who are talented to go
into it or they don't view it as

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110
realistic and you know one of the
 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.210

interesting things about Teach for

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220
interesting things about Teach for
 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.000
