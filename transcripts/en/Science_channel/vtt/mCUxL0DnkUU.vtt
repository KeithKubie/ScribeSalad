Narrator:
NOVEMBER 28, 1967.

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:07.367
CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND.

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:10.400
JOCELYN BELL IS AN ASTRONOMY
STUDENT EXAMINING

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.601
RADIO WAVE DATA FROM THE MOST
SENSITIVE TELESCOPE OF ITS KIND.

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:17.367
JOCELYN BELL IS
LOOKING FOR QUASARS,

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:22.334
OBJECTS THAT ARE 100 TIMES
BRIGHTER THAN THE MILKY WAY.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:25.501
Narrator:
SHE ANALYZES THE 100 FEET
OF RADIO WAVE DATA

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:28.133
GENERATED EVERY NIGHT.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.634
AND IT'S JUST ALL
ON CHART PAPER,

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:31.968
I MEAN, [laughing] MILES
AND MILES OF CHART PAPER.

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:33.467
THAT'S THE WAY
THEY DID IT BACK THEN.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:34.667
AND SHE'S GOING THROUGH
AND LOOKING FOR,

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.868
YOU KNOW, RADIO SOURCES.

00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:39.734
WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTING TO SEE
IS RADIO EMISSION

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:43.100
IN CONTINUOUS,
BUT SOMEWHAT RANDOM, BURSTS.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.834
Narrator:
INSTEAD, SOMETHING ELSE
GRABS HER ATTENTION.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.868
IT'S A REGULAR PULSE.

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:57.367
WHAT SHE SEES IS A SIGNAL SPACED
PRECISELY 1 1/3 SECONDS APART.

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.868
IT'S VERY REGULAR, LIKE A CLOCK,

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:02.901
BETTER THAN ANY CLOCK,
IN FACT, THAT WE COULD BUILD.

00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:07.634
Narrator:
THE MYSTERIOUS PULSE IS NOT
FROM LITTLE GREEN MEN,

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:12.701
BUT FROM SOMETHING
JUST AS INCREDIBLE.

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:15.000
JOCELYN BELL'S LGM1 SIGNAL

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.100
COMES FROM A NEW
COSMOLOGICAL PHENOMENON.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.467
IN FEBRUARY 1968,

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.834
BELL AND HEWISH PUBLISH
THE DISCOVERY OF A SUPERDENSE,

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:30.834
HIGHLY MAGNETIZED,
CELESTIAL BODY:

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:33.834
A NEUTRON STAR.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:37.634
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A GIANT
STAR DIES IS IT COLLAPSES.

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:41.234
AND IT COLLAPSES DOWN
INTO A NEUTRON STAR,

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:44.968
SO DENSE, A SUGAR-CUBE
PIECE THIS BIG

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:49.033
WOULD WEIGH MORE THAN
10,000 AIRCRAFT CARRIERS.

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:51.467
[ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS ]

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:52.834
AND IT'S SPINNING VERY FAST

00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:55.000
AND, BECAUSE IT HAS THESE
STRONG MAGNETIC FIELDS,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.767
IT'S SENDING OUT BEAMS
OF RADIO ENERGY

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.734
AND ALSO LIGHT INTO SPACE.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:01.601
[ RESONATING ]

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:04.033
IT'S GIVING OFF
VERY POWERFUL JETS,

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.968
ONLY IN TWO DIRECTIONS.

00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:08.334
Man:
AS THE STAR IS ROTATING,
THE SIGNAL,

00:02:08.334 --> 00:02:11.100
IF IT'S POINTING TOWARDS US,
CAN BE DETECTED.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.767
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A LIGHTHOUSE.

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:14.667
SO AS THE LIGHTHOUSE SPINS,

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.634
YOU SEE THE LIGHT,
YOU SEE THE LIGHT.

THE THEORY THAT
ANTHONY HEWISH PRESENTS

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:33.601
TO THE ASTRONAUTICAL WORLD
TURNS IT UPSIDE DOWN

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.734
AND, IN FACT,
BRINGS HIM THE NOBEL PRIZE

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:40.467
FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST
DISCOVERIES MADE.

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.567
Narrator:
THE DISCOVERY LAYS
THE FOUNDATIONS

00:02:42.567 --> 00:02:45.334
OF A PATHWAY THROUGH THE COSMOS,

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:48.901
BECAUSE PULSARS ARE MORE THAN
JUST ANOTHER TYPE OF STAR.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:52.267
THEY ARE BEACONS
FOR GALACTIC NAVIGATION.

00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:54.467
AS WE'VE BEGUN
TO MAP THE UNIVERSE,

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:57.968
WE'VE NOW DISCOVERED
OVER 1,000 OF THESE PULSARS.

00:02:57.968 --> 00:02:59.534
ANY INTELLIGENT SPECIES
WILL KNOW

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.367
ABOUT ALL THE PULSARS
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD,

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:03.067
SO YOU CAN PUT THEM
ON SPACECRAFT

00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:06.400
AS KIND OF MARKERS ON A MAP.

THE NASA TEAMS BEHIND THE
VOYAGER AND PIONEER MISSIONS

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:14.534
INCLUDE MAPS OF THE PULSARS
NEAREST OUR PLANET.

00:03:14.534 --> 00:03:18.667
IF INTELLIGENT LIFE INTERCEPTS
THESE DEEP-SPACE PROBES,

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:21.634
THEY'LL HAVE A CLEAR MAP
TO US ON EARTH.
