00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.800
Let's do another problem.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.430
Very similar to the last one,
but with a subtle difference.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.860
And that subtle difference
will make a big difference.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.050
Let's say we take the line
integral over some curve c--

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.590
I'll define the curve in a
second-- of x squared plus y

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:25.420
squared dx plus 2xy dy-- and
this might look very familiar.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.000
This was very similar to what
we saw last time, except last

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.520
time we had a closed
line integral.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.550
This is not a closed
line integral.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.560
And our curve, c, the
parameterization is x is

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.080
equal to cosine of t, y
is equal to sine of t.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.480
So far-- it looks like sit.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.020
Let me write sine of t-- so
far, it looks very similar to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.800
the closed line integral
example we did in the last

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.120
video, but instead of t going
from 0 to 2 pi, we're going

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.570
to have t go from 0 to pi.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.180
t is greater than or equal to
0, is less than or equal to pi.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.650
So now we're essentially, our
path-- if I were to draw it on

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:11.420
the x-y plane-- so that is my
y-axis, that is my x-axis.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.130
So now our path isn't all the
way around the unit circle.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.120
Our path-- our curve c now--
just starts at t is equal to 0.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.120
You can imagine t is
almost the angle.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.950
t is equal to 0, and we're
going to go all the way to pi.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.970
So that's what our path is
right now, in this example.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.330
So it's not a curved path.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.830
It's not a closed path.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.270
So we can't just show that f,
in this example-- and we're

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.580
going to re-look at what f
looks like-- hey, if that's a

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.370
conservative vector field, if
it's a closed loop that equals

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.920
0, this isn't a closed loop.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.970
So we can't apply that.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.510
But let's see if we can apply
some of our other tools.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.720
So like we saw in the last
video, this might look a

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.800
little bit foreign to you.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.040
But if you say that f is equal
to that times i, plus that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.140
times j, then it might look
a little bit more familiar.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.230
If we say that f of xy-- the
vector field f is equal to x

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:15.500
squared plus y squared times i
plus 2xy times j and dr-- I

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.980
don't even have to look at this
right now. dr, you can always

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.230
write it as dx times
i plus dy times j.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.720
You'll immediately see, if you
take the dot product of these 2

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.330
things, if you take f dot dr--
they're both vector valued,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.150
vector valued differential,
vector valued field, or vector

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.760
valued function-- if you take f
dot dr, you'll get

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.460
this right here.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.820
You'll get what we have
inside of the interval.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.270
You'll get that
right there, right?

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.120
That times that-- you take
the product of the i terms--

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.290
that times that is equal to
that, and add it to the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.360
product of the j terms.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.080
2xy times dy.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.820
Write like that.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.000
So our integral, we can
rewrite it as this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.650
Along this curve of f dot
dr, where this is our f.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, we still might want
to ask ourselves, is this

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.680
a conservative field?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.010
Or does it have a potential?

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.650
Is f equal to the gradient of
some function, capital F?

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.810
I guess I could write the
gradient like that, because

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.860
it creates a vector.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.390
This is a vector, too.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.650
Is this true?

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.040
And we saw in the
last video, it is.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.600
I'll redo it a little
bit fast this time.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.830
Because if this is true, we
can't say this is a closed

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.950
loop and say, oh, it's just
going to be equal to 0.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.330
But if this is true, then we
know that this-- that the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.660
integral is path independent.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.450
And we'll know that this is
going to be equal to capital F,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.780
if we say that t is going
from-- well, in this case t is

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.000
going from 0 to pi-- we could
say that this is going to be

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.490
equal to capital F of pi
minus capital F of 0.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.910
Or if we want to write it in
terms of x and y-- because f is

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.150
going to be a function of x and
y-- we could write-- and this

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.195
right here, these are t's.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.290
We could also write that this
is equal to f of x of pi, y of

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:31.020
pi, minus f of x of 0, y of 0.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.830
That's what I mean
when I say f of pi.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.070
If we were to write f
purely as a function of t.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.310
But we know that this capital
F is going to be a function.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.960
It's a scalar function
defined on xy.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.060
So we could say f of
x of pi, y of pi.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.460
These are the t's now.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.920
These are all
equivalent things.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.090
So if it is path dependent,
we can find our f.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.420
We can just evaluate this
thing by just taking our

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.970
f, evaluating it at
these two points.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.770
At this point, and at
that point right there.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.040
Because it would be
path independent.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.130
If this is a conservative, if
this has a potential function,

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.090
if this is the gradient of
another scalar field, then this

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.790
is a conservative vector field,
and its line integral

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.750
is path independent.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.710
It's only dependent on that
point and that point.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.750
So let's see if we
can find our f.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.670
So I'm going to do exactly what
we did in the last video.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.400
If you watch that last
video, it might be a

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.090
little bit monotonous.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.540
But I'll do it a little
bit faster here.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.430
So we know that the partial of
f with respect to x is going to

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.310
have to be equal to
this right here.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.690
So that's x squared
plus y squared.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.050
Which tells us, if we take the
antiderivative, with respect to

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:44.420
x, then f of xy is going to
have to be equal to x to the

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:50.510
third over 3 plus xy squared--
right? y squared is just a

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.830
constant in terms of
x-- plus f of y.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.640
There might be some function
of y that, when you take

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.480
the partial with respect
to x, it just disappears.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.980
And then we know that the
partial of f with respect to

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.140
y has got to be equal to
that thing or that thing.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.070
We're saying that this
is the gradient of f.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.670
So this has to be the
partial with respect to y.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.230
2xy.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.430
And you might want to
watch the other video.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.540
I go through this just a little
bit slower in that one.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.410
So the antiderivative of this
with respect to y-- so we get f

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:29.050
of xy-- would be equal to xy
squared plus some

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.770
function of x.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.590
Now we did this in
the last video.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.590
These 2 things have to be the
same thing, in order for the

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.520
gradient of capital F
to be lowercase f.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.350
And we have xy
squared, xy squared.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.180
We have a function of x, we
have a function purely of x.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.860
And then we don't have a
function purely of y here,

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.090
so this thing right
here must be 0.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.560
So we've solved.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:02.250
Our capital F of xy must
be equal to x to the 3

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.660
over 3 plus xy squared.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.120
So we know that lowercase f
is definitely conservative.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.200
It is path independent.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.350
It has its potential.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.750
It is the gradient of
this thing right here.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.970
And so to solve our integral--
this was a 0-- to solve our

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.470
integral, we just have to
figure out x of pi, y

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.970
of pi, x of 0, y of 0.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.140
Evaluate the bullet points,
and then subtract the 2.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.400
So let's do that.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.630
So x was cosine of
t, y is sine of t.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.160
Let me rewrite it down here.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.880
So x is equal to cosine of t.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.360
y is equal to sine of t.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:51.600
So x of 0 is equal to cosine
of 0, which is equal to 1.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.400
x of pi is equal to cosine of
pi, which is equal to minus 1.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.960
y of 0 is sine of
0, which is 0.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.870
y of pi, which is equal to sine
of pi, which is equal to 0.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:12.140
So f of x of pi, y of pi--
this is the same thing,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.970
so let me rewrite this.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.560
Our integral is simplified to--
our integral along that path of

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:26.130
f dot dr-- is going to be equal
to capital F of x of pi.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.620
x of pi is minus 1.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.730
y of pi is equal to 0.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:48.730
Minus capital F of x of 0
is 1, comma y of 0 is 0.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.950
And so what is this equal to?

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.160
Just remember, this right
here is the same thing

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.810
is that right there.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.150
That is x of pi.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.400
That is y of pi.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.100
That term right there.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.250
You can imagine this whole f of
minus 1, 0-- that's the same

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.970
thing as f of pi, if you
think in terms of just t.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.420
That could be a little
confusing, so I want

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.410
to make that clear.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.440
So this is just
straightforward to evaluate.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.940
What is f of minus 1, 0?

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.780
x is minus 1. y is 0.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.410
So it's going to be minus 1
to the third power-- right,

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.700
that's our x-- over 3.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.960
So it's minus 1/3.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.700
It's going to be minus 1/3
plus minus 1 times 0 squared.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.360
So that's just going to be a 0.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.830
In both cases, the y is 0.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:34.540
So this term is
going to disappear.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.950
So we can ignore that.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:42.000
And then we have minus
f of 1, comma 0.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.760
We put a 1 here.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.730
1 to the third over 3.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.640
That is 1/3 plus 1
times 0 squared.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.430
That's just 0.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.640
So this is going to be
equal to minus 1/3.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.990
Minus 1/3 is equal
to minus 2/3.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.070
And we're done.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.220
And once again, because this is
a conservative vector field,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.620
and it's path independent, we
really didn't have to mess with

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.180
the cosine of t's and sines of
t's when we actually took

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.130
our antiderivative.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.425
We just have to find the
potential function and evaluate

00:10:11.425 --> 00:10:14.590
it at the 2 end points to get
the answer of our integral, of

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.170
our line integral, minus 2/3.
