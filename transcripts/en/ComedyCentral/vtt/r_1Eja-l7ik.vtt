00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.102
FINALLY, IT'S GRADUATION SEASON,

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:03.604
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:05.606
TO START PAYING OFF
A LIFETIME OF DEBT

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:07.074
FOR AN EDUCATION

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.742
THAT WON'T HELP YOU
MAKE ANY MONEY.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.244
SO WHO BETTER THAN MY FANS,

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.079
WHO'VE ALREADY BEEN BEATEN DOWN
BY LIFE,

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:13.914
TO DISPENSE SOME FREE ADVICE

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:16.216
IN A SEGMENT CALLED
"WORDS OF TWISDOM."

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.957
"WORTH IT?"

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.435
"HI, I'M DAN TOSH."

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.242
TWISDOM.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.247
"NEVER PUSH.

00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:48.482
"IF IT ISN'T COMING OUT,

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.051
PULL YOUR PANTS UP
AND COME BACK LATER."

00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:58.926
"DON'T TAKE PROFESSOR MILLER.

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.762
"[bleep] YOU, MILLER,
YOU SMUG ASSHOLE."

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.096
HA-HA!

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.998
MILLER!

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.039
TWISDOM.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.375
"ONE: BEFRIEND A COWORKER
NAMED BRIAN.

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.045
"TWO: MAKE SURE
BRIAN IS WEAKER THAN YOU.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.148
THREE: BLAME EVERYTHING
ON BRIAN."

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.319
"IF EVERYONE HAS AIDS,
THEN NO ONE HAS AIDS."

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.721
THAT'S SOME DEEP TWISDOM.

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.228
I THINK THAT'S SAFE TO TRY.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:39.666
HAS ANYONE DONE THAT?
REALLY?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.935
GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE.

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.973
TWISDOM.

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.975
GOOD LUCK TO THE CLASS OF 2014.

00:01:48.008 --> 00:01:50.477
AND TRY NOT TO SUCK
LIKE THE CLASS OF 2013.

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:50.577
GOOD NIGHT,
AND CONGRATULATIONS
