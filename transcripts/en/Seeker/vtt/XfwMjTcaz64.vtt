00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.240
Look down at your body.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.900
Some of that stuff
doesn't do anything,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.800
and I'm about to call it out.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.300
Get ready.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.410
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.910
Hey, guys.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.750
Trace here chatting
from DNews in DC.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.714
Your body is filled with
genetic and biological garbage.

00:00:17.714 --> 00:00:19.130
Not just the junk
DNA we've talked

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.170
about in the past
but actual structures

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.475
that your body took the
time to put together.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:24.600
And they don't do anything.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.826
A couple of new studies just
completed by researchers

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.450
at Boston University
and the University

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.790
of Liverpool
focused on our feet.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.990
Take off your shoe and try and
bend your foot in the middle.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.390
The average human foot should
only bend in one place,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.340
at the ball.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.720
But 1 out of every
13, at least, can

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.620
bend a second joint in
their foot just like chimps.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.010
Everyone's got that joint.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.900
But a lot of us,
we can't bend it,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.750
because our bodies
added a tough ligament

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.410
once we started walking upright.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.800
Those with softer
ligaments, they

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.650
can bend their foot like me.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.540
Not Anthony, though,
and he's jealous.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.332
And that's not all.

00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:57.706
That's just one of the things
that you can do at parties.

00:00:57.706 --> 00:00:59.410
Genetic stuff we once
needed that is now

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.290
irrelevant or
non-functional is called

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.390
vestigial, a vestige of
our evolutionary past.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.520
Leftovers like the second foot
joint are all over in our DNA.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.632
The appendix was useful
at one point, for example,

00:01:10.632 --> 00:01:12.090
but now it's just
kind of chilling.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.840
Some primates have
appendices and use them

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.830
to digest tough
cellulose, but we really

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.150
don't eat that anymore.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.530
So now we don't need it.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.030
Over the generations
of humans, it's

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.279
become slowly less pronounced.

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:24.405
But it's still present like an
evolutionary intestinal time

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:24.920
bomb.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.480
Another is this vestigial tail.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.960
It's just one of
those weird things

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.860
that our DNA gives embryos
as a genetic leftover.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.709
But usually, they're given the
command to die by the genes

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:35.000
while you're still in the womb.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.940
But rarely we make
it through birth

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.670
with this vestigial extension.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.470
If you're still in
doubt about evolution,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.790
then combine the tail with
a condition called lanugo,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.450
or a fine growth of hair
that can develop on a fetus.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.950
And it sometimes is
present at birth.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.430
So we have tails and we're
covered in fur at birth,

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.410
and somehow we didn't
evolve from animals?

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.560
Get out of town.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.730
We have a whole other host of
vestigial items-- goosebumps,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.350
tonsils, wisdom teeth,
and other things left over

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.560
from when we had fur.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.110
We had more primitive
immune systems,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.280
and we used
cellulose-based diets.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.220
My favorite, though--
our third eyelid.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.550
We have a vestigial third
eyelid just like reptiles, guys.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.275
It was designed to
keep the eyeball moist

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:17.090
and to protect it.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.910
And now we put that baby in a
corner, genetically speaking.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.520
What is an evolutionary
trait that you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.030
wish we hadn't dropped?

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.920
There are a bunch of lists
online if none of these

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.760
tickle your fancy.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.880
Or just, you know, let
us know in the comments.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.380
Thanks for watching
DNews, everyone,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.310
and keep your DNA clean, OK.
