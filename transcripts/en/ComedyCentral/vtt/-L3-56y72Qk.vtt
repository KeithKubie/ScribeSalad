00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:04.437
(light electronic music)

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:14.114
- Hey, come on in.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.589
Yes, Push &amp; Believe, you got it.

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.290
I want to call you Gabe Liberman

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.859 line:0%
- Do it.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.360 line:0%
- And that's not right.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.561 line:0%
- It's not the wrongest
that people have said it.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.662 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's Gabe Lieberman
or Gay Lieberman?

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:30.864
- Nope.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.298 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I messed up and I
didn't mean to go there.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:33.900 align:start size:97% position:3%
I did not mean to go there,
that's unprofessional.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.270
- I'm going off of vibes
and I know that you're

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.672
not a homophobe and
you don't hate me

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.474 align:start size:94% position:6%
- No!
- So you can say whatever.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.976 align:start size:81% position:19%
- When did you
know you were gay?

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:45.979 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Early, I knew I was gay
when I was like six or seven.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.581
- So I like women, I'll
sit at a coffee house

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:52.018 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I see an attractive
woman and I appreciate that

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.421
and I'm attracted
her, is that a sign

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.022
of being a straight male?

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.424
- Yeah, I would say
that's the sign.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.958
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.361
- So that's kind
of slightly gay.

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.362
- Yes, that is pretty gay.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:03.363
- I'm 10% gay.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.364
- You are?

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.365
- Yes.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:06.633
- That's a lot to admit.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:07.801
- That's a lot of
percentage points?

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.235 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, just that
you're any amount gay.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.004 align:start size:94% position:6%
As a straight guy, I
think it's a lot to admit

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.672
that you're even a little gay.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:13.940
- People have picked on me,
oh Brody, you walk weird.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.276
You gay, you gay.
- Do you walk gay?

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.444
- Brody, you gay.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:18.678
- You walk gay?

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:20.547
- I mean, I don't
want to kiss a guy,

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:22.715
I don't want to hand hold a guy,

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.952
hug a man, but that's
as far as it goes.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.821
- That's 10% gay, hugging?

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.956
- No, then I factor
in the internet.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.524
- Oh, gotcha.

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.259
- Look at you and your posing.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.260
- My ankle?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.261
- How do I get there?

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.963
- Ankle to knee, ankle to knee

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:39.365
and then if you reach forward,

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.768
touch the ground, feel that?

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.002
- Yeah.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.971
- Yeah, rips your butt up.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.473 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Alright, Gabe,
what's another pose?

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.775 align:start size:94% position:6%
- If you just go like
this and sit on the block.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:50.877
- Here we go, here we go.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.479
- Just sit on back.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.747
- And sit on it?

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.015
- Yeah.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:56.883
- Now what do I
do once I'm back?

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.017
- You just breathe.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.085
- Neck rotations?

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:01.621
- Yeah, sure, that feels great.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:06.226
You can reach up, that'll
be your core a little.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.227
- What else?

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:08.228
- Side, you could

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.662
- Gabe, guide me.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:17.137 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Side to side,
that's obliques there.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.273
- Bring me back up, what else?

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:21.341
- Reach back.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.612
- Grasp my hands.

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:29.048 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Your actual
hands, there we go.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:30.884
There you go.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.852
(laughter)

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.354
How are those jeans?

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:35.989 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Stretching, I'm gonna
sit back down on the block

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.457
- There you go.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:40.927 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Wow, that gave me a
head rush in a good way.

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:42.362
Let's wrap it up.

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:43.596
- Let's wrap it up.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:46.533 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Let us wrap it up
with some kettlebells.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:50.370
I'm gonna get up, push, drive,
everything is from the hips.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.538
- [Gabe] Okay.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.707
- I'm gonna grab a 20 right
here, here's a fiver for you,

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:55.842
no disrespect

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.076
- None Taken.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:58.978 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And I just take
these and I hold them

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.980
and I drive, I drive.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.715
You use and you drive up

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.984
like when I go down like this

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:06.219
hips out, push,

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:08.321
down, out,

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:11.691
push, believe,

00:03:13.092 --> 00:03:14.460
you got it.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.029
Drive it up

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.030
- That feels good.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.398
- Push, that's functional.

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.300 line:0%
Gabe, yoga, positivity.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.002 line:0%
- I never do that right, yeah!

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.103 line:0%
- Whew, yeah!

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.975
I'm the Lance Armstrong of
the Comedy Central videos

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:31.744
and I'm sitting on my
testicle right now.

You wanna go bike
riding with me?

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.124
Do what it takes, go live!
