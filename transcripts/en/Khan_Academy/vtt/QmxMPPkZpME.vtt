00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.950
Welcome.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.350
Well what I want to do now is
actually I'm going to use this

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.920
graphing application to explore
the trigonometric functions or

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.450
explore the graphs of them.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.480
And just to start off or just
to let you, this application

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.010
I'm using is from gcalc.net.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.940
it's G C A L C .net.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.030
It's not mine, but I want to
give them credit because

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.090
that's what I'm using and
I hope they don't mind.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.440
So let's start off just
graphing some functions.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.750
Let's start off with
the sine function.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.820
So let's say sine of x.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.420
I hope you all can see it.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.020
I'm typing it in up here.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.580
So sine x, let me graph that.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.890
Look at that.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.260
Like how nice that looks.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.530
So let's interpret this.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.250
So it's oscillating
between-- well, let's

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.280
just go point by point.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.780
I guess that's the
easiest way to do it.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.900
So when x is equal to 0, what
is the value of this function?

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.720
Well, if we look here, the
value of the function is--

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.510
let me actually trace it.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.370
When x equals 0 and it has
it written down at the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.320
bottom of this grey area.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.450
So when x is 0, y is also 0.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.060
And if you're remember when we
looked for the definitions

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.040
in the unit circle
that's what we got.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.080
That the sine of
0 radians is 0.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.060
And now as we move on, or
move along the curve, I

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.620
have the trace function on.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.820
This is when x is equal-- if we
look in the grey area at the

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.650
bottom left it says 1.57.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.180
But what is that?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.240
If you're familiar with
the-- 1.57 is more

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.580
commonly known as what?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.510
It's 1/2 of what famous number?

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.840
Right.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.010
It's half of pi.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.910
We're at pi over 2.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.020
And if you want to convert
pi over 2 to degrees

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.860
that's 90 degrees.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.620
So when we're at the angle of
pi over 2 radians the sine

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.520
function is equal to 1.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.410
And if you go back to some
previous modules you'll

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.060
remember that that's exactly
what the sine function was

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.270
equal to when we looked
at the unit circle.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.045
Because we were essentially
at the point 1 comma 0.

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:02.550
I hope it's not confusing that
I keep referring to the unit

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.470
circle that you can't see.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.460
But we'll keep going.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.380
But one thing I want to
introduce here is the concept

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.840
of the period or the frequency
of the sine function.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.280
It's pretty obvious to you at
this point that the function

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.440
keeps repeating itself.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.910
It goes from 0, moves up to
1, goes back to 0, goes

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.850
down to negative 1.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.500
Then goes back to 0 and
then repeats again.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.500
So the period of this periodic
function because that's what we

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.100
call a function that keeps
repeating, the period of this

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.100
periodic function is this
distance from here to here.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.760
And what's that?

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.450
Well, that's 2 pi radians.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.770
And does that make sense?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.660
Well sure, because 2 pi radians
is one complete revolution

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.990
around the unit circle.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.650
And then it repeats again.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.130
And then it goes the other way.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.450
You go 2 pi radians
backwards and things

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.850
start repeating again.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.580
Pretty interesting, right?

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.200
Oh, and another thing.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.380
What two numbers does
it oscillate between?

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.970
It oscillates between
positive 1 and negative 1.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.450
And that makes sense because in
the unit circle you can never

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.750
get to a point on the perimeter
of the unit circle that's

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.700
larger than positive 1 or
less than negative 1.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.150
And that's why the sine of x
keeps oscillating between

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.990
these two points.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.760
Let's do the cosine of x.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.030
Actually, I'm going to
leave the sine of x there.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.520
Interesting.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.095
It looks almost the same,
but it looks shifted.

00:03:31.095 --> 00:03:33.670
It actually looks shifted
to the left about

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.360
pi over 2 radians.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.160
And that's actually the case.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.550
So let's first think about why.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.970
We figured out before that
sine-- actually, it looks

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.830
like this program is still
tracing the sine function.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.630
That sine of 0 was 0.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.340
But if you look at the green
function, the cosine of

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.580
0 radians is actually 1.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.470
Let me see if I can-- no.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.150
I don't know how to trace
the cosine function, so

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.130
I'll just do it here.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.930
The cosine of 0 is 1.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.110
And why does that make sense?

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.450
Well, the cosine is
the x-coordinate on

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.150
the unit circle.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.900
When you have 0 radians or 0
degrees, you're at the point 1

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.080
comma 0 on the unit circle.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.270
So 1 is the cosine or is
the x-coordinate and

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.380
0 is the sine value.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.620
And if any of this is
confusing, review the video

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.410
where I use the unit circle to
solve the various values of the

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.880
trig functions and then
this should make sense.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.840
And notice that this has
a period similar to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.650
the sine function.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.100
It starts at 1, goes down
to negative 1, and then

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.000
comes back to positive 1.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.560
And it takes 2 pi radians
to complete that cycle.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.210
And just like the sine function
it's oscillating between 1 and

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.370
negative 1 because on the unit
circle you can't get to a point

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.850
on the perimeter that's
higher than that.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.450
And now to really hit
the point home let's do

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.290
the tangent function.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.280
I think this one
might surprise you.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.470
Well, look at that.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.860
So the blue line is
the tangent function.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.280
And why does it do
this crazy thing?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.620
Well, if you remember, the
tangent function is equal to

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.625
the y over the x on the
perimeter of the unit circle.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.350
Or since the y is the sine and
cosine is the x, it also equals

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.260
the sine over the cosine.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.240
So here, tangent is 0
whatever sine is 0

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.050
because that makes sense.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.025
Because tangent is equal
to sine over cosine.

00:05:39.025 --> 00:05:42.590
So it makes sense that when
sine is 0, tangent is 0.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.770
But then, as the sine function
becomes greater and the cosine

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.100
function becomes less, the
numerator in the tangent

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.420
function becomes greater
because the numerator is sine.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.690
So we get larger and larger
values, all the way to the

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.225
point where the denominator of
the tangent function, which is

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:03.970
the cosine function-- I think
this is probably the most

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.870
confusing module I've ever
said because I can't really

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.910
write these things down.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.020
The denominator goes to 0.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.000
The cosine right here.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.070
And then tan spikes and it
actually approaches infinity.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.210
And if you look back at the
unit circle, that actually

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.750
might make a little
bit of sense.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.980
But like the other functions,
actually the tangent

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.210
function has a period of pi
instead of pi over 2.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.130
Instead of 2 pi.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.050
And I'll leave that as
an exercise for you

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.630
to think about.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.450
But with that drawn
out, I'm now going to

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.650
explore something else.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.380
Let me reset this.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.070
Yes, I really want to reset.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.860
I drew the sine
function before.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.650
Let me draw the sine
of let's say, 2x.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.000
Whoops, that's not right.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.820
sine of 2-- maybe I need to
put some parentheses in.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.090
Oh, there we go.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.760
Actually, let me reset it.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.980
Yes, I want to reset.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.400
So first I'll draw the
sine of x and then I'll

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.310
draw the sine of 2x.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.970
So what's the first thing you
notice about the difference

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:10.570
between these two?

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.760
The brown one is sine of x and
the green one is sine of 2x.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.860
They both oscillate between the
same two numbers and just so

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.600
you know, the height of the
oscillation is called

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.630
the amplitude of this
periodic function.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.410
So in both cases, the amplitude
is 1 because they oscillate

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.950
from 1 to negative 1.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:38.550
So the amplitude is 1, but
their period is different.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:45.860
Sine of x takes 2 pi radians to
complete one circle-- one cycle

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:51.910
while sine of 2x only takes pi
radians to complete one cycle.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.572
So it actually completes
it twice as fast.

00:07:55.572 --> 00:07:59.480
And I want you to sit and think
about why sine of 2x has 1/2

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.390
the period of sine of x.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.820
And you can probably
guess what happens if

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.420
I type in sine of 3x.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.030
Actually, let's do sine of 4x.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.770
It should have 1/2 the
period of sine of 2x then.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.530
And it does, even though
this is probably a

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.950
very confusing graph.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:19.920
So let's explore.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.550
So I think you understand
what the coefficient

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.650
on the x term does.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.680
When you have a larger
coefficient it kind of

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.570
speeds up the cycles.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.876
And let's explore a
little bit more.

00:08:30.876 --> 00:08:33.670
Let's start off with
sine of x again.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.220
And now, instead of making the
coefficient larger, let's

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.380
make the coefficient less.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.090
Let's make it sine of 0.5x.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:41.600
Look at that.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.960
Now, all of a sudden, it
takes 4 pi radians to

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.030
complete one cycle.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.830
And I want you to think
about why that is.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.480
Because we're now slowing
down how fast it cycles

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.275
through the angles.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.500
Now I want to start playing
with the amplitude.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.310
So we had sine of x, what do
you think will happen if I put

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:09.330
in this 2 times sine of x?

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.840
So here, the period
is the same.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.540
It's still 2 pi, but notice
that it oscillates between 2

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.840
and negative 2 instead of
between 1 and negative 1.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.120
So whatever the coefficient, or
whatever the number is in front

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.690
of the sine or the cosine
function, that actually

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.885
affects its amplitude.

00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:34.030
And similarly, we can
look at 0.5 sine-- let's

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:38.970
say 0.5 sine of 2x.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.480
Interesting.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.340
So now it only goes up to
0.5 and down to minus 0.5.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.780
So it's amplitude
is 1/2 or 0.5.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.290
And it also oscillates twice
as fast as the sine function

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.300
because it was 0.5 sine of 2z.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.840
I think that's all
the time I have now.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.020
I have a feeling this might
have confused you more than

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.240
helped, but I'll still put
the video up just in case

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.230
it's helpful for someone.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.950
But in the future I might
actually record another video

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.980
where I can actually write
things down so it doesn't

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:10.950
confuse you as much.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.080
So if it confused you
I apologize, but I

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.940
hope it was helpful.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.470
See you later.
