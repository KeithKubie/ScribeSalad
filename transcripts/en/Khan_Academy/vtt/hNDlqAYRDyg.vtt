00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.710
- [Instructor] So we have a
question here on p-values.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.320
It says Evie read an article that said 6%

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.750
of teenagers were vegetarians,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.140
but she thinks it's higher
for students at her school.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.340
To test her theory, Evie
took a random sample

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.780
of 25 students at her school,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.810
and 20% of them were vegetarians.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.220
So just from this first paragraph,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.006
some interesting things are being said.

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:30.359
It's saying that the true
population proportion,

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.420
if we believe this article, of teenagers

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.830
that are vegetarian,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.320
we could say that is 6%.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.390
Now for her school, there
is a null hypothesis

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.680
that the proportion of
students at her school

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.570
that are vegetarian, so
this is at her school,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.870
that the true proportion,
the null would be as

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.160
the same as the proportion
of teenagers as a whole.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.220
So that would be the null hypothesis.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.970
And you can see that she's generating

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.190
an alternative hypothesis,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.070
but she thinks it's higher for
students at her large school.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.640
So her alternative hypothesis
would be the proportion,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.450
the true population
parameter for her school

00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:11.600
is greater than 6%.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.380
And so to see whether
or not you could reject

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.030
the null hypothesis, you take a sample,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.470
and that's exactly what Evie did.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.810
She took a random sample of 25 students,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.680
and you calculate the sample proportion.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.350
And then you figure out
what is the probability

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.460
of getting a sample proportion
this high or greater?

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.210
And if it's lower than a threshold,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.730
then you will reject your null hypothesis.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.620
And that probability we call the p-value.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.820
The p-value is equal to

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.210
the probability that
your sample proportion,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.210
as she's doing this for
students at her school,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.930
is going to be greater
than or equal to 20%

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.300
if you assumed that your
null hypothesis was true.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.210
So if you assumed that the true proportion

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.270
at your school was 6% vegetarians,

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.690
but you took a sample of 25 students

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.850
where you got 20%, what is the probability

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.180
of getting 20% or greater
for a sample of 25?

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.970
Now there's many ways to approach it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.870
but it looks like she
is using a simulation.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.180
To see how likely a sample like this

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.720
was to happen by random chance alone,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.620
Evie performed a simulation.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.160
She simulated 40 samples
of n equals 25 students

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.610
from a large population where 6%

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.370
of the students were vegetarian.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.630
She recorded the proportion
of vegetarians in each sample.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.080
Here are the sample proportions
from her 40 samples.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.320
So what she's doing here
with the simulation,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.470
this is an approximation of
the sampling distribution

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.190
of the sample proportions
if you were to assume

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.000
that your null hypothesis is true.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.230
And it says below,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.660
Evie wants to test her null hypothesis

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.280
which is that the true
proportion at her school is 6%

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.410
versus the alternative hypothesis

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.224
that the true proportion at
her school is greater than 6%

00:03:05.224 --> 00:03:07.300
where p is the true proportion of students

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.900
who are vegetarian at her school.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.850
And then they ask us,

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.970
based on these simulated results,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.200
what is the approximate
p-value of the test?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.000
And they say, the sample result,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.040
the sample proportion here, was 20%,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.900
we saw that right over here.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.910
Well if we assumed that this

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.590
is a reasonably good approximation

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.540
of our sampling distribution
of our sample proportions,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.470
there's 40 data points here,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.180
and how many of these samples
do we get a sample proportion

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.890
that is greater than or equal to 20%?

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.210
Well you could see this
is 20% right over here,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.637
20 hundredths, and so
you see we have three

00:03:42.637 --> 00:03:45.600
right over here that meet this constraint.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.390
And so that is three out of 40.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.380
So if we think this is a
reasonably good approximation,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.378
we would say that our p-value

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:55.920
is going to be approximately

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.910
three out of 40, that
if the true population

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.980
proportion for the school were 6%,

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.290
if the null hypothesis were true,

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.300
then approximately three
out of every 40 times

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.920
you would expect to get a sample

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.090
with 20% or larger being vegetarians.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.440
And so three-fortieths is what?

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.610
Let's see, if I multiply
both the numerator

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.450
and denominator by two and a half,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.380
this is approximately equal to,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.210
I say two and a half 'cause
to go from 40 to 100,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.260
and then two and a half
times three would be 7.5.

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.760
So would say this is approximately 7.5%

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.520
and this is actually a
multiple choice question

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.450
and if we scroll down,

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.090
we do indeed see

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.650
approximately 7.5% right over there.
