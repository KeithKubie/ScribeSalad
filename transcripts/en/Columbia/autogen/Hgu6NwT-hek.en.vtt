the practice of untouchability by the
force of the state so this is one way of

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780
force of the state so this is one way of
 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.690

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:40.650
stopping untouchability which is because
 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.650
stopping untouchability which is because
untouchability exists not merely in the

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660
untouchability exists not merely in the
 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.810
untouchability exists not merely in the
lives of the untouchables but also in

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:44.820
lives of the untouchables but also in

like for example there is no law which
says right right against untouchability

01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:28.670
says right right against untouchability
 

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:32.110
says right right against untouchability
is there is there a right to touch I

01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120
is there is there a right to touch I
 

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.650
is there is there a right to touch I
have a right to touch that right is not

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:35.660
have a right to touch that right is not
 

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:36.280

so I think that right that question is

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440
so I think that right that question is
 

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.620
so I think that right that question is
found only in the ethical not in the

01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:41.630
found only in the ethical not in the
 

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.660
found only in the ethical not in the

might pass in it I think there is a

01:19:58.490 --> 01:19:58.500
might pass in it I think there is a
 

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:03.140

Altima to there are the you evolution of

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:03.150
Altima to there are the you evolution of
 

01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:05.870
Altima to there are the you evolution of
face has to be taken into consideration

01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880
face has to be taken into consideration
 

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.729
face has to be taken into consideration
and I think you see the mudra of

01:20:07.729 --> 01:20:07.739
and I think you see the mudra of
 

01:20:07.739 --> 01:20:09.380
and I think you see the mudra of
Ambedkar here actually is wearing

01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:09.390
Ambedkar here actually is wearing
 

01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:11.570
Ambedkar here actually is wearing
achiever and everything that for

01:20:11.570 --> 01:20:11.580
achiever and everything that for
 

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.310
achiever and everything that for
ensuring an ease in a Buddhist image

01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320
ensuring an ease in a Buddhist image
 

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.370
ensuring an ease in a Buddhist image
actually this is a merger of the two and

01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:16.380
actually this is a merger of the two and
 

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:18.770
actually this is a merger of the two and
now that that's a the ideal is the

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:18.780
now that that's a the ideal is the
 

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.810
now that that's a the ideal is the
actual if it is actually there's no need

01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:20.820
actual if it is actually there's no need
 

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:23.180
actual if it is actually there's no need
for discussion is that ideal you are

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:23.190
for discussion is that ideal you are
 

01:20:23.190 --> 01:20:25.240
for discussion is that ideal you are
really trying to reach which is possible

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:25.250
really trying to reach which is possible
 

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:28.700
really trying to reach which is possible
now therefore I think the ideal is as a

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:28.710
now therefore I think the ideal is as a
 

01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:30.860
now therefore I think the ideal is as a
very very important political function

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:30.870
very very important political function
 

01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:33.500
very very important political function
to perform that really keeps motivating

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:33.510
to perform that really keeps motivating
 

01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:35.780
to perform that really keeps motivating
you towards your goal if there's no

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:35.790
you towards your goal if there's no

you towards your goal if there's no
ideal is a deafness and no future so I

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:40.230
ideal is a deafness and no future so I
 

01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:42.490
ideal is a deafness and no future so I
didn't and also it is really also

01:20:42.490 --> 01:20:42.500

why do you think poor really to sustain

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:48.450

and they don't reload
why that's the that's why it is there's

01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600
why that's the that's why it is there's
 

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.020
why that's the that's why it is there's
a logic in all in this you know

a logic in all in this you know
 

01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:59.090
a logic in all in this you know
therefore I think our our ultimate idea

01:20:59.090 --> 01:20:59.100
therefore I think our our ultimate idea
 

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:02.450
