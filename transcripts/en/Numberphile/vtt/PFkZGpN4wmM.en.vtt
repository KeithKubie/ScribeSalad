00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
Well first of all I want to say that em--
it's such a pleasure to visit again with

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.560
the Numberphile family

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.679
I haven't seen you guys in a long time
so hope you're doing well

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.560
I wanted to talk to you about something
which I've been thinking about lately

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.330
and part of the reason is that um-- I'm
teaching this class at UC Berkeley

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.160
linear algebra

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.420
It has to do with numbers because of
course you know, i love numbers

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.780
I do numbers for a living I'm a
mathematician hello

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.580
and I know you guys also like numbers

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.760
because you know we
are watching Numberphile

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.020
But also being a mathematician I think um--

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.460
I have a certain
vantage point which sort of enables me

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.080
to see perhaps better than people who
are not professional mathematicians

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.360
not only the the uses of of numbers, but also limitations of numbers and this in

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.060
particular you know i was interested in
this as I was following a debate

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.520
a recent debate which many of you may
have seen in a-- play out in the media

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.489
about artificial intelligence

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.600
what do we mean by artificial
intelligence

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.380
I mean of course we can mean many different things

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.780
but essentially we talk-- we're talking about computers right?

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.260
We're talking about computers, we're talking about computer programs, we're talking about algorithms

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.160
How do they work,? they work with numbers

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:20.000
To me um-- when people say that humans are just specialized computers, and eventually we'll just bid--  build more

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.160
and more powerful computer so that
eventually they will surpass the power of a human

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.460
em-- That kind of line of reasoning
to me kind of betrays this idea that

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.659
somehow the human is nothing but a
machine; the human is nothing but a

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.619
sequence of numbers

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.450
It is really something which were-- lives
and dies by numbers you see so that's

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.780
why I'm not suggesting at all that there
is nothing [more] to math than numbers.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.620
Of course there are many other things, right

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.430
So for example there is geometry and so on, and
in fact i will demonstrate now or I will--

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.600
I will I hope I will demonstrate (that--
that's my purpose) that in mathematics

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.250
there are many things which we often
confuse with numbers but which are not

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.890
actually numbers.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.180
or they could be represented by
numbers but numbers do not really do justice to them

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.360
And so would like to eh--
show you this one example which came up

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.740
in my linear algebra class, and this has 
to do with vectors

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.500
So look at this brown paper, so it is on this-- on this-- on this table, right?

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.140
Imagine that it extends to infinity in
all directions

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.420
So you can think about as a two-dimensional vector space; let me do-- be a little bit more concrete

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.940
Let me take a point, there we go, so this
point will be the origin

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.580
this will be sort of like the zero point
of this vector space, ok,?

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.360
and now i want to talk about vectors

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.520
And so a vector to me would be something like this, you see, it's an interval which has a length and a direction

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.400
and it starts at this origin which I have fixed
once and for all-- this is fixed once and for all

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.740
Here is another example of a vector and so on, so a vector is right here

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.540
So the totality
of all vectors is essentially the

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.050
totality of all the points of this brown
paper right,? because for every point i

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.020
can just connect that point to the
origin and point to that point

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.680
Now, it's not just a static thing; it's
not just a collection of vectors, which it is, but there is more

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.080
For example, we can add any two vectors
to each other, and many of you may  know how to do this

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.280
It's-- it's called the parallelogram rule
sooo that's the intersection point

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.940
Okay, very nice but it's not very
functional because they are-- yes the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.549
vectors are here they're concrete-- they're
kind of concrete

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.360
they live here, they have the separation
but it's very difficult to work with

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.390
them so we try to make it more
functional and we do it more functional

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.100
by introducing a coordinate system but
the coordinate system or in linear algebra

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.370
we call it introducing a basis so now we
come to the crucial point

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.570
ok the crucial point is the basis I want
to try to coordinate grid here

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.630
that's what I want to do I don't know
just gotta coordinate grid and so for

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.400
example I can use

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.770
well let me use another this color so i
will have two coordinate axis so what

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.980
them let's say goes like will go like
this

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.550
my drawing is not particularly perfect
you know i have two classes today so

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.470
please excuse my my wiggly lines but I
hope the point is clear

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.120
so usually what we do we say this is x
axis and this is y axis with all this

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.570
from school and we know this even before
we started vectors right with with with

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.220
we think about it rather usually as
representing points but now i want to

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.650
think about more as vectors and then we
will see why

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.150
another way to think about this to give
this two axis is the same as to give

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.390
two unit vectors along this axis so one
of them would be this one say and let's

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.260
go you know I don't want to overload it
with notation but it could be &lt;E1&gt; or

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.640
something and then this would be another
basis vector so this is a basis. they're

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.180
units so you're the kind of unit
relative to something but we'll discuss

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.020
this was meant to be unit here's what i
can do i can represent now this vector

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.390
by a pair of numbers by simply taking
the projection onto the x-axis and the

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.800
y-axis you see

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.060
so this point would be some multiple of
this vector so it will be the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.360
corresponding distance here so it looks
like three halves right so this looks more

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.950
like this looks sort of like 3 halves
close to 3/2. it is one and you

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.090
have the increment which looks like a
kind of close to one and this one looks

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.920
like let's make it let me make it longer
so it'd be 2. so its kind of like

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.210
just kind of rounded up

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.630
ok so then what i say is that this v1
can be represented by we usually what we

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.320
write it as a column, as a column of
numbers

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.860
so the first we write the the first
coordinate three halves and then we

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.560
write this

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.780
- that's what we do in 
linear algebra. but other people sometimes

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.830
people write also like this

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.310
it's you it's your choice. rather than just floating on the paper now, it kind of

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.870
almost has value

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.470
that's right it becomes a very concrete
thing it becomes a pair of numbers

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.890
ok and it's very very efficient because
once you have once you have that

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.360
so every vector can be written in this
form you see my V2 can also be

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.480
written as a pair of numbers my V1
plus V2 can be written as the pair of

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.630
numbers and then we can work with them
because for instance what we are

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.780
interested often is some kind of
transformation of this plane and we can

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.669
feed these vectors this you know this
vector representations pairs of numbers

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:14.370
into about those transformations

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.340
so this is all great and this is very
important to do that to kind of actualize

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.600
vectors by numbers so they become
actualized you can think also of this by

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.870
the way is a kind of a coordinate grid
so I impose a coordinate grid

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.190
so then each of them is can get an
address but this is really isn't it is

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.180
the address of this vector with respect
to this particular coordinate grid it's

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.050
very important to realize that the
vector exist even before we introduce a

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.919
coordinate grid and think about it like
you said the ship exists even before we

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:47.640
look at the relative to an island or
another ship or a person and so on

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.080
or you know I existed even before I have
an address it before you find out what

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.330
my home addresses or before I choose my
home

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.210
you know I already exists and likewise a
vector exist even before we introduce

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.800
the coordinate grid and it's clear why
because look I drew it before i had any

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.000
coordinate system I drew it already it
was already there on the brown paper

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.030
there is no denying the fact that it
existed before right

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.729
but what I did not impose something on
it and the vector if you think about it

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:21.750
vector couldn't care less what we're
doing whether it's just sitting there

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.950
and enjoying its life or whatever their
whatever it is whatever it involves you

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.240
know but we came your i came i imposed
on

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.949
this place I imposed by putting this
coordinate system is coordinate grid and

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:36.419
with respect to this coordinate grid

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:41.069
I have now represented that vector by a
pair of numbers but very important very

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:46.229
important thing to realize at this point
is that I had a choice I had a choice I

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:49.560
could choose this coordinate grid in a
different way and this is what i teach

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.380
my students in linear algebra i tell
them someone else could come and

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.870
construct a different coordinate system

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.250
you see a different courses or I could
change my mind and I could create a

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.479
different coordinate system

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:08.280
this is our imagine that these are the
two basic basis vectors now going along

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.430
the x and y as I drew them originally
but now imagine the tip

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.030
well it could be like this and they
could be like this like that and in

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:17.729
principle you don't you don't even have
to be perpendicular to each other as

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:19.020
long as they're not parallel

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.310
it is my free will if you wish you know
it is my free will is in choosing that

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.449
but once you realize that there are many
coordinate systems many coordinate

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:30.990
systems and I have a choice of making
creating this coordinate system, or someone else

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:32.130
could come you could do it

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:35.760
Brady you could make your own coordinate
system and we cannot i cannot convince

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.279
you that my concern is better than yours

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:42.810
they all are on equal footing but now
because we now realize that this

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:46.920
involves certain choice name is a choice
of the coordinate system it becomes very

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.540
very clear that this pair of numbers is
not the same as the vector and in this

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.589
is fine

00:08:52.589 --> 00:08:57.750
this is how it works but it's very
important to realize that because often

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.010
times we hear we get so caught up in
this process and we get so excited that

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.120
G we can represent a vector by a pair of
numbers and we forget the difference and

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.560
we start we convince ourselves we start
believing we start believing that

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.290
actually there is no difference between
them but what I'm arguing

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.240
is that there is a big
difference and that's what I teach my

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.329
students and this is very important
because you see I mean

00:09:18.329 --> 00:09:23.130
let me put it this way if I could ask
this vector if this vector could talk

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:25.200
and I could ask this vector

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.339
what are your coordinates you know the
record we be like, "What?"

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.500
what are you talking about? what
coordinates he doesn't he or she

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:38.040
you know doesn't know what the
coordinates are. The fact that its just there

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.590
it just is I came and I try to sort of
put it on the box

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.800
if you will I try to sign some numbers
to it

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.000
professor you are talking like a vector
is a real thing that we applied an

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.020
abstraction on to this is the vector
itself an abstraction to start with the

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:56.700
effect is not a real thing

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.540
a vector is just as imagined as the
coordinate system that you imposed on

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:08.100
yes and no because well you see they are
abstractions

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.150
we are now in the world of abstraction
and my point is precisely that

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:15.960
even in the abstract world of
mathematics you have entities you have

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.200
things like vectors which are not the
same as numbers

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.670
how can -- if you appreciate this -- how can
you believe that the human being is the

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.410
sequence of numbers you see what I mean?

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.440
how can you believe that life is an
algorithm if you already see in

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.180
mathematics in the abstract world of
mathematics you find things, which

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:35.970
exist which makes perfect sense

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.630
we can work with them like take the sum
of two vectors without any reference to

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.430
coordinates or anything like this

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.030
how can you believe that that is the
same as the pair of numbers it's not if you

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:49.470
look closely at how we got that pair of
numbers out of a vector you realize that

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.360
involved additional choice

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.130
so every time we make this procedure we
are projecting that vector sort of on to

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.260
our particular frame of reference

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.420
let's look at this Cup now I can project
it onto the plane

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.670
ok I can project it onto the plane when
I project it onto the plane

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.350
I see what do I see I will say disk well
with some little thing protruding which

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.400
you know obviously but more or less the
disc and on the other hand I could

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.000
project it onto this whiteboard onto
this wall

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.570
what will i see well if i put it in a
particular way you will just see a

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.530
rectangle

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.590
ok so let's say you look at this
projection

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:29.790
what do you see you see a disk and and
or you look here and you see a rectangle

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.900
so you might say what is this is this a
disk

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:39.450
no is this a parallelogram? again, no.
Then someone else could come and say AHA

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.899
maybe it is both a disk and a
parallelogram

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:49.649
and he or she was still be wrong because
this is an entirely different thing you

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:50.189
see

00:11:50.189 --> 00:11:54.449
yes I can project it down and i can
record the information and it may be

00:11:54.449 --> 00:11:59.550
some useful information but it doesn't
do justice to this whole thing and

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.819
neither does any other projection and
likewise with the vector think of a

00:12:02.819 --> 00:12:04.110
vector as a cup

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.040
it's an object of an entirely different
nature than a pair of numbers you can

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.809
apply the same technique not only two
vectors but to other things related to

00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:15.929
this vector space for example what we
call linear transformations

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.180
a typical example of a linear
transformation would be a rotation of

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.560
this brown paper around this special point
around the central point and then you

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.240
know i'm teaching my class and
it is a kind of funny things i'm

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.579
teaching my class this is textbook which
we use and so and they can I get into

00:12:35.579 --> 00:12:36.449
this

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:41.339
I get to this point the matrix
representation of a linear transformation they

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:42.480
kind of hit me

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.939
you know the matrix you know and so of
course you know i remember that the

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:52.199
famous movie in this like you know
remember the Morpheus was saying to Neo: Do you

00:12:52.199 --> 00:12:57.540
want to know what it is and that's
exactly what I'm asking right now

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.589
do you want to know what it is well the
matrix on the one hand is a very

00:13:01.589 --> 00:13:07.800
efficient way to package information to
convert objects like vectors and linear

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.709
transformations into collections of
numbers

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:14.639
the menu is not the same as a meal you
know you can read the menu you can order

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:18.540
restaurant it can read the menu all you
want you can even call the way that come

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.779
to your table and explain every
ingredient

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:26.040
you can ask the chef to come and explain
the process of cooking you can get all

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.299
this information but I'm sorry it's not
the same as eating that meal eating that

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:31.319
dish right

00:13:31.319 --> 00:13:36.720
so it is something like this and my
point is that this matrix representation

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.999
on the one can be very useful

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:43.920
just like our computers are very useful
algorithms are very useful or they can

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.300
you know if we forget where they come
from where this programs come from

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.980
where these numbers come from and 
when we forget the difference between

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.360
the actual things they represent

00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:03.269
and the representation that's when we
create the kind of matrix that Morpheus

00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:07.200
was talking about it you know and
Morpheus said you create the you know

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.540
the prison for your mind

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.829
that's what we do when we forget that
difference between the objects

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:15.959
themselves and representations

00:14:15.959 --> 00:14:21.209
so my point is let's use that
representation

00:14:21.209 --> 00:14:25.769
let's use those numbers let's use
computers you know to our advantage and

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:31.769
we are using them but let's not forget
the difference between the essence of

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:36.600
life so to speak about things which just are
 which we are trying to represent

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.700
and the sequences of numbers which we
get as the result of that process of

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.089
representation

00:14:45.089 --> 00:14:50.160
I get asked about this all the time you
know a famous author recently asked me

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.540
you know he said

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.199
so you're a mathematician would you say
that life was an algorithm

00:14:55.199 --> 00:14:59.999
you know people ask me or is human just
the sequence of zeros and ones you know

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:03.959
you have people like Ray Kurzweil, who
believe that they will be able to build

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:09.300
machines so that they could upload their
mind and the brain or whatever whatever

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.819
they got you know onto those machines
