00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.870
In this video, we're going
to play a bit of a game.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.210
I have three different data
sets here, and we need to

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.000
figure out which of these data
sets come from either a

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.893
linear, quadratic, or
exponential function.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.840
And just as a reminder, linear
function is of the form, y is

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.110
equal to mx plus b.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.510
A quadratic is of the form, y
is equal to ax squared plus

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.020
bx, plus c.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.570
And an exponential is of the
form, y is equal to some

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.210
constant-- let's call
it a-- times some

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.230
number to the x power.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.450
Now, the way to tell them
apart-- and I'm going to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.170
actually show you.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.330
It'll probably be intuitive for
you for a linear function,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.890
and maybe even for
an exponential.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.760
The quadratic, the technique I'm
going to use might not be

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.570
intuitive, and I'll actually
prove it to you in the next

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.160
video, or at least show you an
example in the general case of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.630
why it makes sense.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.820
But the way to tell a linear
function, is that when you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.810
increment x by a constant
amount, y will always change

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.040
by a constant amount.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.690
So when you always increase x by
1, y should always increase

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.570
by a certain amount.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.220
So just using that as our first
guideline, let's see

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.600
which of these represent
a linear function.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.970
So in all of these examples, as
we go from one data point

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.955
to the next, we're increasing
x by 1.

00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:33.880
And it's very important that
you pay attention to that,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.760
because if you weren't, you
would have to adjust things a

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.090
little bit.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.920
But in all of these, we're
always increasing x by 1.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.900
So let's look at our
change in y's.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.940
When we go from the first data
point to the second data

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.750
point, our change in y is 60.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.400
When we go to the second
to the third, our

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.680
change in y is 90.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.630
So that immediately tells us
we're not dealing with a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.590
linear function.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.580
When our change in x is 1, our
change in y here is 60.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.230
Then it's 90, and as you go here
it's like a 135, so this

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.090
one is clearly not linear.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.030
Let's look at this
one over here.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.600
Our first change in y
is 2, then our next

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.230
change in y is 0.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.700
Once again, not linear.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.370
As we increment x by a constant
amount, our y does

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.780
not increase or decrease
at a constant amount.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.740
So once again, this
one is not linear.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.650
Now let's look over here.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.850
Once again, we're increasing
x by 1 on every data point.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.740
And when we to go from this
first data point to the second

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.990
data point, y decreases by 3.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.380
Then we go from the second to
the third, once again, y

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.980
decreases by 3.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.760
Third to the fourth,
y decreases by 3.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.350
1 to negative 2, once again,
decreases by 3.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.170
And we just keep decreasing by
3, so whenever we change x by

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.980
1, when we increase x by 1,
y goes down by negative 3.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.855
So we actually have
a constant slope.

00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:02.180
We can say our change in y over
change in x is equal to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.250
when x goes up by 1,
y goes down by 3.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.110
This is a definition of slope.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.620
This is the m in this
equation right here.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.315
Our changes are constant, so
this one right here is linear.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.620
Now quadratic, there's an
interesting, we could call it

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.230
a trick right now, because
I haven't really

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.810
showed you why it works.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.680
But in a quadratic, your changes
in y are not going to

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.850
be constant, as was the
case in the linear.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.600
But the change in the changes
of y will be constant.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.380
Let me write that down.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.320
It probably makes no sense to
you right now, but when you

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.830
see an example it'll
be kind of fun.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:52.315
Change in change
in y constant.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.770
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.080
So over here, let's look at
this first one over here.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.300
So we went from 120 to 180, that
was an increase of 60.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.410
180 to 270, that was
an increase of 90.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.230
Then we went from 270 to 405,
which is an increase of 135.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.960
Now, when I talk about the
change in the change of y,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.620
these are the change in y's,
what are the change in the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.779
change of y's?

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:22.210
Well, we had a change of 60,
then we had a change of 90, so

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.050
that was a change in the
change of y of 30, or a

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.460
difference of the difference,
you could view them that way

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.460
if you like.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.210
Then we had a change of 90, and
then we had a change of a

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.180
135, so the change in the
change, let's see, that is 45.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.030
So here, the change in the
change in y, or the difference

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.290
of the difference
is not constant.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.760
We grew by 60, and then we
grew by 90, which was

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.870
30 more than 60.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.780
Then we grew by 135, which
is 45 more than 90.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.630
So this is not constant
over here.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.240
So this tells us this is not
a quadratic function.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.680
Now let's look at
this over here.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.580
The change in y-- let's
write that down.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.910
This clearly was not linear.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.480
We increased by 2 here,
increased by 0 here, increased

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.670
by negative 2 here, increased by
negative 4 here, increased

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.600
by negative 6 there.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.930
The change in y's are definitely
not constant.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.590
But let's look at the change
in the change of y's.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.350
So we increased by 2, then we
increased by 0, so this was a

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.560
negative 2 in the change in
the change of y, or the

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.270
difference of the difference.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.020
Then when you go from 0 to
negative 2, we changed by 0,

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.485
then we changed by negative 2,
that is a change in the change

00:05:36.485 --> 00:05:38.050
of negative 2.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.490
Then you go from negative 2 to
negative 4, the change in the

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.220
change of negative 2.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.730
This one is starting
to look quadratic.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.120
We changed by negative 4 than we
changed by negative 6, once

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.610
again, a change in the
change of negative 2.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.580
So this data right here fits our
requirement for quadratic,

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.490
and I'm just kind of giving it
to you as a trick right now.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.560
In the next video I'll
actually show

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.230
you why this works.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.470
I'll show you an example, just
so you can get the gut feeling

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.890
of why it should work.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.300
So this one right here
is quadratic.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.930
So you might say, hey, Sal has
given us three examples, one

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.400
of them is going to be linear,
one of them's going to be

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.100
quadratic, one's going to be
exponential, this one's

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.810
probably going to
be exponential.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.535
And you are probably right.

00:06:19.535 --> 00:06:22.690
But let me give you the way
that we can figure out if

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.890
something is exponential.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.580
So when x increases by 1 in an
exponential, you should always

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.790
have a constant multiplying
factor.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:35.520
So when you go from one term to
the next term, they should

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.210
be a similar ratio from
one to the next.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.530
So instead of just subtracting--
in this case,

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.040
120 from 180, and 180 from
270-- to test for an

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.220
exponential function, what you
want to do is check whether

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.340
the ratio of when you increment
x by a constant

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.550
amount, whether the ratio
of the y's are the same.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:02.760
So when we increased x by 1, y
went from 120 to 180, so it

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.760
increased by 18 over
12 is 1.5.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.970
So we went from this
term to this term.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.755
Let me clear all of the
stuff out here.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.690
So when we went from here to
here, this was times 1.5.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.310
And then when we go from 180 to
270, once again, that looks

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.300
like we're going times
1.5, right?

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.070
1/2 of 180 is 90, add that to
270, so once again, we're

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.490
increasing by 1.5.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.360
270 to 405, 1/2 of 270 is 135,
that's how much we're

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.120
increasing by.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.580
So once again, we're
increasing by 1.5.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.390
So every step of this way, we
are multiplying the previous

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.520
term by 1.5 to get the next.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:53.200
And that actually tells us that
this right here is a 1.5.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.820
But our point here isn't to
actually figure out the

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.990
formulas, the point here
is to classify them.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.080
So now we know definitively that
this right here, at least

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:09.950
given the data we have, is
an exponential function.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.800
Anyway, hopefully you
found that fun.
