00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.460
Intro

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.750
The marketing for Star Wars: The Force Awakens
kept this movie’s biggest reveal a secret

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.800
right up until release, when fans learned
that Rey, the scavenger from the planet Jakku

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.770
was the next trilogy’s hero, to be trained
by Luke Skywalker himself.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.500
With Rey’s parents noticeably absent in
the story, and after more than a few hints

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.060
were dropped that the girl was following in
Luke’s footsteps, a ton of fans walked out

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.999
of the theater assuming the same thing: that
Rey was really the daughter of Luke Skywalker

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.999
– a secret that would probably be revealed
over the course of the new trilogy.

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:35.311
We’ve run down the evidence and theories
in a previous docu video, but as more and

00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:39.120
more fans have taken father-daughter relationship
to be an obvious one, we think it’s only

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.040
fair to remind everyone that it’s still
just a theory for now.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.870
In fact, when you weigh all the evidence,
there’s just as much reason to believe she

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.550
CAN’T be a Skywalker in disguise.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.710
We’ll let you decide for ourselves when
our latest docu video is over: Is Luke Skywalker

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.609
REALLY Rey’s Father?

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.449
The Evidence: Mystery Parents

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.280
The most obvious clues may not be the most
convincing, but they’re impossible to ignore.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.280
When The Force Awakens begins, Rey is living
alone on a desert planet – not too different

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.180
from Luke Skywalker’s childhood – or his
father, Anakin’s.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.291
Rey is obviously a fan of the Rebel Alliance,
too, decorating her scavenged home with a

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:14.729
Rebel pilot doll, and even wearing a Rebel
helmet for the fun of it.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.700
But once she reveals her last memory of the
parents who left her behind, the big hints

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.750
start dropping, as a flashback shows Rey watching
as her parents fly off, leaving her behind

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.930
on a backwater planet, but promising to come
back for her one day.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.729
The plot point makes it obvious that Rey’s
parents are important, since audiences wouldn’t

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.920
have even wondered if the film hadn’t made
it a mystery to begin with.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.950
When her interrogation at the hands of Kylo
Ren reveal that she imagines an island in

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.039
the middle of a sea when in need of comfort,
the movie ending on that exact same island

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.899
– with Luke Skywalker on it – was all
the evidence needed that father and daughter

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.479
were destined to be reunited.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:56.219
And Luke’s best pupil would be his own daughter.

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.210
More Than Just Force Powers

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.509
Skill in The Force being passed from parent
to child may be all the evidence some fans

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.219
needed, but it wasn’t just Rey’s Force
powers that seemed to imply she had Skywalker

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.460
blood in her veins.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.100
Take your pick: there’s her knack for flying
spacecraft, rebuilding and maintaining the

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.550
most stubborn spaceships and tech, and even
an immediate affinity for a droid on a mission

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.100
all fit the bill of both Luke and Anakin.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.460
Her power was enough to get the attention
of Kylo Ren, seeming to be an even more powerful

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.460
Force user.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.800
And if you believe that BB-8’s arrival on
Jakku, or Rey being pulled into the war between

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.830
the Resistance and the First Order was total
coincidence, then it was just as random when

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.550
Anakin, then Luke, were plucked from the same
situation for similarly great things.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.080
Luck, or the will of The Force – you decide.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.980
The Force Vision

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.470
The most convincing bit of evidence comes
when Rey first crosses paths with Luke Skywalker’s

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.810
lightsaber – the one originally built and
used by his father, Anakin, before it was

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.880
cut from, and with, Luke’s hand (Empire).

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.540
For starters, the lightsaber actually calling
to Rey implies she’s no random Force user

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.420
– and her childhood screams at being abandoned
on Jakku being used to call her to the weapon

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.680
add even more importance to the mystery of
their identity.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.490
When she actually takes hold of the saber,
she’s given visions of Luke and Anakin’s

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.040
fight, Kylo Ren’s betrayal of Luke Skywalker,
Luke leaving directions to his hiding place

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.700
in R2D2 – basically, a crash course in the
Skywalker family, and a sign of what comes

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.700
next.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:33.510
But it’s the voices spliced into the vision
which also seem convincing: Yoda and Obi-Wan

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.590
Kenobi, the powerful Jedi who trained Anakin
and Luke are both heard calling to Rey, telling

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.950
her that, just as was the case with both Skywalkers,
she is taking her “first steps” into the

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.320
larger world of The Force, and the Light and
Dark Sides of it.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.530
Why would simply touching a lightsaber trigger
such memories?

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.590
If they were those of the new user’s father
and grandfather, it would make plenty of sense

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.180
to even casual fans.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.010
And if Luke really did leave Rey behind before
heading into exile, her not just finding him,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.820
but bringing the Skywalker lightsaber he had
presumed lost forever would probably convince

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.700
him that there was no use fighting the will
of The Force: helping a new Skywalker finish

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.880
the battle he couldn’t.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.880
The Problems

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.530
Again, it’s all just fan theories and speculation
for now.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.160
Fans have assumed that Rey is Luke’s daughter
for a reason, and it’s mainly due to hints

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.610
and clues that the filmmakers have counted
on the audience catching.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.009
It could be true, but when you start thinking
about the actual twist and logic, there seem

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:33.360
to be some real problems with the assumption.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.320
Beginning with the biggest reason some doubt
the upcoming reveal of Rey Skywalker at all…

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.949
It’s Just Too Obvious

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.460
It seems pretty pointless to go the trouble
of keeping a heroine’s identity a mystery,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.449
and draw extra attention to the audience not
knowing who her parents are… and leaving

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.710
only one real conclusion for every single
viewer to draw.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.590
Not just the diehard, conspiracy-obsessed
Star Wars fanatics, but even casual moviegoers

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.270
who leave the theater assuming they are to
believe Luke is Rey’s father.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:10.210
J.J. Abrams has a better track record of twists
when it comes to his other projects, and frankly,

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.770
the reveal would be obvious to the point of
being boring.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.419
Luke Skywalker living out his father’s origin
story seemed poetic, but doing it a third

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.980
time is wearing out the poetry – especially
if the goal is moving the series in a fresh,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.360
inspired direction.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.100
The problem then, is the conundrum at the
heart of the Rey’s parents mystery.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.699
If it is a mystery at all, then it can’t
be Luke.

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.800
Because if it’s Luke, the mystery was obvious
from the word go.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.719
Somehow, we think people will actually be
surprised when the identities are revealed

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:37.719
in the future.

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:42.229
But that’s just our gut talking – there
are other reasons that are a bit harder to

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:43.840
argue.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.539
She Wasn’t Hidden Safely

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.949
In Luke Skywalker’s case, Obi-Wan Kenobi
took Anakin’s son to a backwater world,

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.249
leaving him in the loving hands of Anakin’s
stepbrother and his wife.

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:59.970
Fans can argue that Kenobi’s move was an
idiotic one, leaving Darth Vader’s son with

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.699
his own family, and even keeping his last
name.

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.020
But had things gone to plan, Luke would have
lived quietly and safely on a moisture farm.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.939
In The Force Awakens, Rey isn’t left with
family, or even an acquaintance likely to

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:16.380
keep her safe: she’s left with Unkar Platt,
a cruel, unfair, deceitful scrap trader.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.159
But fine, it’s still in the middle of nowhere,
safe from prying eyes, right?

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.159
Wrong.

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:25.160
When BB-8 pops onto the First Order’s radar,
Platt tries to buy the droid from Rey.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.560
But when she refuses, Platt reveals he’s
secretly communicating with First Order agents,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.180
and sells Rey out in a heartbeat.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.070
It’s easy to think of reasons why Luke Skywalker
would leave his daughter behind: out of fear

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.360
he would corrupt her, too, or that she would
be a target for Kylo Ren, as eventually does

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.539
happen in the movie.

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.550
But Luke leaving her behind with nothing,
in the hands of a corrupt, villainous alien

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.060
who wouldn’t hesitate to sell her out to
Kylo Ren’s allies?

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.610
It doesn’t make much sense.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.610
Even the idea that Rey is a daughter of Leia
Skywalker doesn’t hold water, since Leia

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.099
says herself that if she had kept her son
close, she could have kept him from falling

00:06:56.099 --> 00:06:57.129
to the Dark Side.

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.150
So why would she make the same mistake twice,
or let Luke make it himself?

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.039
There’s A Better Story To Tell

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:08.819
At this point, the best surprise would have
to be the biggest.

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.770
And with all the rumors spinning and theories
being built, the biggest surprise would probably

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.999
be if Rey’s true parents were… just some
random people.

00:07:15.999 --> 00:07:20.289
Maybe a jedi, or another character or family
from the previous films, but definitely not

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:21.289
a Skywalker.

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:25.199
We would be just as happy as the fans to see
that twist played out with love and purpose,

00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:29.229
but c’mon: the third time telling the same
story would be… well, less groundbreaking

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.020
than fans were told to expect.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.110
And would the prophecy of the Chosen One bringing
balance to the The Force, an act completed

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.580
when Anakin and Luke both defeated the Dark
Side, be better, or worse, if it was just

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.360
continued for another chapter?

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.669
Anakin fell to the Dark, so Luke could save
him from it… and Rey could do the same over

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:46.669
again?

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.379
The more interesting answer is that fans haven’t
seen the ending to this story before: maybe

00:07:50.379 --> 00:07:53.960
the beginning, and maybe even the middle,
but shrouded in mystery, they won’t see

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.860
the conclusion coming until it’s here.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.279
Could Rey be a descendant of Obi-Wan Kenobi
instead, with Luke forced to train his friend’s

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.490
descendant, moving Luke completely into the
role of his former Master?

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.389
Maybe Rey was the daughter of another missing
Jedi, or even a Rebel hero too dangerous to

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:08.389
even name?

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:11.969
It’s the same idea as mentioned earlier:
if Rey’s identity or lineage is meant to

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:15.719
be a mystery, then we tend to think just a
single movie in, it still is.

00:08:15.719 --> 00:08:20.099
If we’re wrong, and Rey really is Luke’s
daughter, then it’s not the twist, surprise,

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:23.719
mystery, or story that fans – or the filmmakers
– must have hoped for.

00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:27.020
And we can’t help but think feel that Abrams
would have done a better job of hiding it

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.599
so close to the start.

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:33.360
Conclusion

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.360
So what do you think?

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.510
Has the mystery already been solved, or do
you think there’s a bigger surprise in store,

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.780
or something fans are missing on purpose?

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.210
