00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.880
<i>[rock music]</i>

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.790
- This is my shop.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.960
<i>My grandfather had built it.</i>

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.380
<i>Let me give you a tour.</i>

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.380
<i>All right.</i>

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.040
So we got
a nice chop saw

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.040
for whatever kind of steel
or material

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.580
I'm gonna have to cut.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.540
I have a backup anvil
and stand.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.830
Have a nice band saw

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.210
just in case,
for whatever I need to cut,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.500
wood-wise,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.580
and then I have
my nice worktable,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.960
where I'll be doing
the majority of my grinding

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.710
and final touches.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.920
Uh, I have a nice
sword forge here

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.830
that I'll be using.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.210
- My name's Todd Andrews.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.330
I'm a blacksmith

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.750
<i>in Eighty Four, Pennsylvania.</i>

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.120
<i>Uh, this is my home forge.</i>

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.120
<i>Are a--an invention
I saw and copied.</i>

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.420
Slide vise.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.790
This enables me
to work on long projects.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.920
<i>Very handy,
uh, very nice to have.</i>

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.920
<i>My forge, uh, can be operated
with--by hand,</i>

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.880
or with a motor.
Uh, the hood--

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.120
<i>I'm highly criticized
about the hood on the forge.</i>

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.580
This does--it doesn't
give you enough room

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.040
to get things done.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.040
<i>My little gi-giant
power hammer.</i>

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.250
Some people
may not recognize it,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.120
because of the safety shield.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.670
<i>They were manufactured
pre-OSHA,</i>

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.960
<i>so in the safety realm
of things,</i>

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.290
<i>if anything breaks
on the front of the hammer,</i>

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380
<i>chances are, it's just
gonna come at you</i>

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.250
and dig into your flesh.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.420
- I have a 280-pound Vulcan

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.790
that actually used to be
my grandfather's father's,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.790
so it's over 100 years old.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.170
<i>I have a whole bunch
of tongs,</i>

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.290
<i>so whatever I need to do,</i>

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.790
I can change 'em, and...

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.170
<i>be able to work
with almost any stock.</i>

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.670
That's about it
for this shop.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.040
<i>- These are some
of the various items</i>

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.830
that I produced, uh,
over the years.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.790
Uh, horseshoe art,
which is, of course,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.380
functional, uh, coat rack.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.120
The animal head elephant,
uh--award-winner.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.000
Uh, to the above--
I call it

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.830
the above-average
candle holder.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.540
Metal, uh, or a copper patina
on steel.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.580
Uh, brass inlay.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.670
Uh, course, I make knives.
I don't keep them all.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.170
I try not to fall
in love with them.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.500
This is one of the knives
that started it all.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.120
It's designed
for the left hand.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.920
Uh, it's, uh, my example
of a Rambo knife.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.750
When the movie came out,
I saw the knife in "Rambo,"

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.830
and said, "I should--
I should make one of those,"

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.790
because that's--you know,
it was--it was influencing,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.000
he was so--so tough,
so hardcore.
