00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.460
Let’s play a little game of “name that
tune.”

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.080
I’m going to start singing a tune, and I want
you see if you can finish it without me.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.660
Ok here it goes:

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.000
“Ba da ba ba ba…”

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.780
What about, “I am stuck on Band Aid Brand....”

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.580
Did you hear that in the little kids’ voice?
That’s a cute one.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.960
OK last one: “Gimme a break, gimme a break.”

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.540
C’mon you had to know that one.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.920
If you didn’t finish at least one of those
on your own, I’d be shocked.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:39.060
These little songs advertisers use in commercials are
called jingles, and you know these popular ones because
they were written specifically to get stuck in your head.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.880
Catchy tunes are just one technique advertisers
use to get you to remember them and, hopefully,
buy their stuff.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:53.840
For years psychologists and sociologists have
studied why humans buy things, and brands use that
research to hack our brains and open our wallets.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:02.180
By applying the skills we’ve learned so far, we
can protect ourselves from buying yet another fancy
frappuccino off the not-so-secret secret menu.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.180
Today we’re going to un-hack your brain
on advertising.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:16.380
[Theme Music]

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.600
First things first: let’s define advertising and its
close cousins, public relations and propaganda.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.780
An advertisement is a public notice promoting
a product, event, or service.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.500
Advertising is the art of creating those.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.960
Sometimes brands create ads themselves, and
sometimes they hire companies to do it for them.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.940
Yes, just like the people from Mad Men.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.060
Public relations, or PR, is something different.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.820
PR is the management of the relationship between
the public (that’s you) and a brand.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.160
PR tells the public what the brand is up to
and tries to make the brand look as good as possible.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.500
They’re the people who write the apology
when someone makes a mistake or build the
hype around the latest iPhone release.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.760
Finally, propaganda is information distributed
with the direct purpose of promoting a certain
point of view.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.220
This info is often misleading or biased, and
propaganda is usually used to promote specific
political viewpoints.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.800
These definitions may seem tidy, but the differences
between these fields can be really hard to distinguish
out in the real world, especially online.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.500
Don’t worry, we’ll talk a lot more about
propaganda later in the course.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.420
Last time on Crash Course Media Literacy,
we learned that all media is constructed.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.720
Creators make choices each step of the way,
from their work’s purpose and focus to the
point of view they use to tell their story.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.240
Advertisements work the same way, from the
split-second ad you swipe through before watching
your friends’ stories

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.660
to elaborate movie trailers that get as
much hype as the movie itself.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.780
On top of that, ads are created using a century’s
worth of market research: experiments carried out
to discover what makes us want to buy things.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.680
Advertisers use that knowledge to tap into our
desires, often exploiting our most basic needs –

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.240
not only the food and shelter kind,
but the love and belonging kind, too.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.540
One of the pioneers of this somewhat sinister
art was Edward Bernays.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.240
Working in the 1920s and ‘30s, he wrote:

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.980
“The human being—male or female—is a
herd animal.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.080
Man is fearful of solitude...He is more sensitive to
the voice of the herd than to any other influence.”

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.040
That’s from his 1923 book Crystallizing
Public Opinion, which became a classic in
the public relations field.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.140
It detailed how humans can be persuaded to change
their habits if it will help them to follow the crowd.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.600
Think back to middle school.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.160
What was that one trend that everyone had
to follow, or you totally felt left out?

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.080
Friendship bracelets, the latest pair of Jordans, a fidget
spinner, one of those little electronic keychain pets –
seriously what was the deal with those things?

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.680
Chances are you or your friends bought them because
everyone else had one – you wanted to fit in.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.760
Advertisements love to play on this need,
and that’s how trends and fads happen in
the first place.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.400
In the 1940’s, psychologist Abraham Maslow
added another piece to this puzzle.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.830
He identified a hierarchy of needs he said
all humans had.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.240
It’s set up like a pyramid.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.420
At the base, the foundation, all humans need
food and water, shelter, and sleep.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.660
Just above that, they need to feel safe, too.

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.860
Then comes the need for love and feeling like
you belong somewhere.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.760
After that, we need to feel accomplished,
like we matter.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.850
At the tippy top of the pyramid is the need
to fulfill our destiny, to be our best selves.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.480
Now all of these needs, combined with our
natural desire to follow the crowd, are like little
buttons on our hearts and brains.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.420
Advertisements press different combinations of
buttons in hopes that we’ll respond the right way.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.400
Usually that means buying their product.

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.449
The sales pitch of most modern ads is that
product X will satisfy your need for Y.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.680
For example, security systems promise one
of our most basic instincts: safety.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.760
We want to be safe, so we buy alarms to keep
out the bad guys.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.819
And Slim Jims? They promise food –
of a sort.

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.370
Down at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.300
But some products claim to satisfy multiple
needs higher up on that pyramid.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.790
Let’s head into the Thought Bubble to take
a closer look.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.150
Check out this vintage ad for hair dye.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.410
It features L’Oreal’s iconic slogan “Because
you’re worth it.”

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.280
They’ve used this slogan more or less since
1971.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.000
In this ad, it’s used with the claim that
this dye is the most expensive in the country.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.640
Usually, that’s not a great way to sell
a lot of anything.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.700
But the slogan “because you’re worth it”
presses a lot of our human need buttons.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.480
For starters, any advertisement for hair dye
implies that natural hair color is boring.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.840
So, for other people to like us, to stick with the herd,
our hair has to be a different, better color.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.740
But still a pretty normal, human-y color,
so we don’t stick out from the herd.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.620
That’s the button for feeling loved and
like we belong.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.660
But there’s also that need for accomplishment,
like we matter. We’re worth it.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.600
The ad is saying, you’re hot. You’re the best.
You deserve this product.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.120
You deserve the most expensive dye, even though
it’s luxury. Nay, BECAUSE it’s luxury.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.420
Not only is this ad an appeal to stick with
the herd, to blend in with beauty norms, but
it’s also an appeal to individualism.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:56.500
It’s an appeal to that middle of the pyramid
and the tippy top, the desire to become our best
selves and rise above the rest of the herd.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.580
It’s genius, really.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.860
If you’ve ever screamed TREAT YOSELF while
splurging on a pair of designer shoes after a long
day, you’ve fallen into this ad trap.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.260
Thanks for the help, Thought Bubble.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.220
Once an advertiser knows which “need button” to
press, they need to persuade you that it will work.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.879
Turns out that there are a few things that
really persuade us.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.880
The first is authority: if we think the person
talking is an expert, we’re likely to believe them.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.600
Like in those “5 out of 5 dentists recommend”
toothpaste commercials.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.080
Dentists know teeth, right?

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.440
The next is likeability: if we like them,
are friends with them, or trust them, we’re
also likely to listen.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:37.140
That's why brands use extremely popular and
respected celebrities, like, say, Leonardo DiCaprio
and Kate Winslet, to sell watches or perfume.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.820
Same with consistency: if what’s being said
vibes with what we already believe, we’ll probably
go along with it.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.900
If everything you’ve ever heard about this new true crime
podcast says its great and thrilling and awesome,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.780
you probably wouldn’t believe your
coworker’s negative review of it.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.820
If there’s a consensus around something, if it’s
popular, we are easily swayed to think it’s good, too.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.220
And if we think it’s a scarce resource and we
could have a piece of it, it’s even more attractive.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.360
So, if everyone else had an iPhone and you
didn’t, you’d probably really want one.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.220
And if a limited edition version came out
that was signed by Beyonce you’d want that one even more.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.640
Advertisers often use these persuasive
qualities in benign ways to get us to buy one brand
of chocolate over another or something.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.780
But they can also be used against us by being
baked into false claims.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.680
They’re not lying, exactly, but making claims
based on poor or misleading logic.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.619
One popular type of fallacy in advertising
is an appeal to emotions.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.420
This is when an ad convinces you to take action
by tugging at your heartstrings.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.960
Those sad sick dog commercials with the Sarah
McLachlan song?

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.960
That’s an appeal to emotions.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:44.760
Just because sick dogs make you sad doesn’t
automatically mean an organization deserves a
donation; it just makes you link the two together.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.920
(I mean, please still save the sick dogs,
this is just an example folks.)

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.980
Then there’s the false dilemma, where an
ad shows you a limited number of choices so
you won’t consider all of the options.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.880
Laundry detergent ads for example, seem to
always go “head to head” with another brand –

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.760
but only one other brand, even though
there are dozens.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.560
Another popular one is the red herring, the
presentation of something totally irrelevant to
distract you from the issue at hand.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.400
This happens in politics all the time.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.840
Ever seen a TV campaign ad during a
local election that shouted something
totally unrelated at you?

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.300
Like, “Don’t elect Dan, his daughter eats
CEREAL!”

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.600
And suddenly you’re wondering what’s wrong
with cereal until you forget that cereal has nothing
to do with politics.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:28.920
Then there’s traditional wisdom, the idea that
you should pick something because that’s how your
grandmom or your old man used to do it.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:36.340
But your old man used a record player because there
wasn’t any other option, not because he wanted to lug
around a crate full of vinyl to every single party.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:41.660
All of these fallacies and persuasive techniques
can be used for good and for evil and in between.

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:46.040
Public service campaigns can get kids to stop
smoking or invest in local journalism.

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.580
But on the other hand, cosmetics ads can harm
teens’ body images, causing eating disorders and
depression.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.620
The better psychologists and sociologists
get at persuading the human brain –

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.340
even if their intentions are good – the better
bad actors get at it, too.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.460
All the more reason to stretch your media
literacy muscles.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.140
Today we talked about how advertisements can
make you change your mind.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.980
Next time on Crash Course Media Literacy we’re
going to tell you when and where they’re doing it.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:16.500
We’re going to talk all about those creepy
targeted ads that follow you around the internet
and much, much more.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.040
See you next time.
Until then, I’m Jay Smooth.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:23.320
Crash Course Media Literacy is filmed in the
