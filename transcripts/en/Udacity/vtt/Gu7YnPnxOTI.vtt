00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let's start building up these chained environments

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
through a series of function calls.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What will that look like?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Well, at some point we declare or define the function--some fun, we'll call it--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and then later on we call it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We want to have some fun, and we're going to pass in as the actual arguments

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
three different expressions.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Here are the steps we go through.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
First, we create a new environment, and its parent pointer points to the current environment.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This parent part is really essential.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Next, in that new environment we create storage places for each formal parameter.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Formal parameters, in this example, p1, p2, and p3.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There are three formal parameters.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Then you want to fill in those places with the values of the actual arguments.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The actual arguments are e1, e2, and e3.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Oh, no! There's a step 4.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Then you actually just do it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You evaluate the function body in the new environment.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That means it's going to be able to see the values of the actual arguments,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which is just what we wanted.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Let's try this out with a bit of a quiz.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Here I've got a 5-line Python program.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
X gets 1; Y gets 2.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I define a function, myfun, of formal parameters A, B, and X,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
prints out A + B + X.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And then I make a call to myfun with actual arguments 1+2, 3+4, and 5+6.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm definitely going to have a global environment,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and when we call myfun, we want to make a new environment

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
pointing back to the old one,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which is going to have room for some new places.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But I haven't quite filled everything out, and I'm hoping you will help me.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We need to know the value of X and Y in the global environment

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and then fill in these three boxes down here in this child environment

00:01:39.000 --> 09:59:59.000
corresponding to the myfun function call. Fill in the blanks.
