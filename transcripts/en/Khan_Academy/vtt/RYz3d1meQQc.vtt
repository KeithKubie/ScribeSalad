00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.320
- [Instructor] We are now going to discuss

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.120
molecular variation in cells.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.380
You are probably familiar with the idea

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.110
that you have a variation

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.150
of genetic makeups in a population.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.260
But even within an organism you have

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.370
variation in the types of molecules

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.810
that an organism can produce

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.960
and when they produce them.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.140
So, for example, we know
that we all have DNA,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.360
all organisms, living organisms

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.100
that we know about, they have DNA.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.000
I'll just do this as a
quick drawing of DNA.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.270
We know that we have genes in our DNA

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.230
that code eventually, they go from DNA

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.180
to messenger RNA, and then
they go to the ribosomes

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.663
to be translated into proteins.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.380
And these proteins are a major way

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.930
of expressing what is encoded in our DNA.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.200
Now, it turns out that our DNA

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.900
will encode for not only multiple proteins

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.180
but multiple types of the same protein,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.870
and it can encode for
some of these proteins

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.680
more under certain circumstances

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.540
and other proteins more
in other circumstances

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.130
based on environmental factors.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.060
Those environmental
factors might influence

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.300
what part of the DNA is being transcribed

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.690
into mRNA, which then is translated

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.330
into proteins at different times.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.760
And there's several

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.740
very interesting examples of this.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.490
It turns out that hemoglobin,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.650
which you might recognize

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.930
as the protein complex that binds

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.350
to oxygen in our red blood cells,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.700
that the type of predominant
hemoglobin changes

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.250
from when we are inside our mothers' wombs

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.640
to when we become independent beings.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.420
So, this right over here is a picture

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.200
of a hemoglobin molecule.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.860
You see here four heme groups

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.110
that each bind two oxygen,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.640
and when you're a fetus the primary type

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.080
of hemoglobin is hemoglobin F,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.930
and then once we come
out of our mothers' wombs

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.740
the hemoglobin F stops getting produced

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.750
and we go to hemoglobin A.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.440
Now you might say, well, why do we have

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.710
this variation in the type of hemoglobin?

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.820
And the answer is, that those are

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.620
two different environments.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.810
When a fetus is in the mother's womb,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.810
it's not directly breathing.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.750
It's getting its oxygen
from the mother's blood.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.180
The mother's blood does not mix

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.920
directly with the baby's blood,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.240
but there's a boundary where you have

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.260
the mother's blood here, and I'll say

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.120
this is the baby's blood right over here,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.800
and you have the gas
exchange of the oxygen

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.150
going through that boundary,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.170
and then of course the release

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.650
of the carbon dioxide going the other way.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.060
And this environment

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.660
where the baby's red blood cells

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.410
have to bind to the oxygen

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.360
is a relatively low oxygen environment

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.800
compared to, say, our lungs,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.320
because it has oxygenated
and deoxygenated blood

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.730
mixing in that same place,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.600
and it does not have direct access

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.770
to, say, the lungs.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.870
And so in this low oxygen environment,

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.370
the hemoglobin molecules have to be

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.400
really really really good
at binding to oxygen.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.040
And we can see that from this diagram

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.670
right over here, where the horizontal axis

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.080
is the partial pressure of oxygen,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.690
and the vertical axis is how saturated

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.450
with oxygen these different

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.990
hemoglobin molecules can become.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.170
And you can see that the fetal hemoglobin,

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.210
which is depicted by this blue curve,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.790
it gets 50% saturated at
a lower partial pressure

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.700
of oxygen than the adult hemoglobin.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.720
So one way to think about it,

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.420
it is stickier, it binds with that oxygen.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.900
It can pull that oxygen out of the blood

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.590
far better, which makes sense

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.850
for the environment that the fetus is in.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.940
But once it comes out
of the mother's womb,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.510
it doesn't need that stickiness

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.570
and there're some drawbacks
of that stickiness as well

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.890
because it makes it hard for that oxygen

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.880
to go into as many of the body's tissues,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.940
and so that's why you have this transition

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.723
from hemoglobin F to hemoglobin A.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.750
It's not just hemoglobin where we see

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.343
this molecular variation.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.060
Plants and other organisms
that conduct photosynthesis

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.390
contain multiple types of chlorophyll.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.160
Remember chlorophyll is a very important

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.660
molecule in capturing light energy

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.080
which can then be used to help synthesize

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.630
carbohydrates in things like plants.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.950
And here we see how two
different chlorophyll molecules,

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.740
both that would be found in plants,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.490
how well they absorb light
of different frequencies.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.880
So you can see chlorophyll
a is really good

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.270
at absorbing the violet
bordering on blue light,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.610
while chlorophyll b is better

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.920
at the blue-green type of light.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.260
And then you have another peak here

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.000
where chlorophyll b is better at absorbing

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.750
an orangish red, while chlorophyll a

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.180
is better at absorbing,
I guess you could say,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.960
a red bordering on infrared wavelength.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.410
And the reason why it is valuable

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.550
is that the light that the plant gets,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.980
especially at different times of day,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.490
at different times of year,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.540
is going to have different wavelengths,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.510
and so this just lets the plant

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.640
capture more energy that it can use

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.010
in photosynthesis.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.920
And these were just two examples

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.830
of molecular variation.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.330
In our cellular membranes,

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.030
there's multiple types of phospholipids

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.180
that are forming the phospholipid bilayer,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.720
and those multiple types are,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.250
they have different levels of how fluid

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.130
they are at different temperatures.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.040
And there're animal studies that show

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.610
that the variations change

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.900
depending on the conditions.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.660
For example, a cold-blooded animal

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.610
might have more of the fluid phospholipids

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.010
when it is very cold so that the membranes

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.120
don't become overly rigid.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.470
But I will leave you there.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.660
This is just to appreciate this idea

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.370
that we have all sorts
of molecular variation

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.980
inside organism cells, and it allows

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:07.560
those organisms to better adapt

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.410
to their environment or different stages

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.653
of their development.
