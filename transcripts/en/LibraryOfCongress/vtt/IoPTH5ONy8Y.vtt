00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:23.050
[ Silence ]

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: My
name is Kerri Willette.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.850
I'm here with folks from the
Empire State Digital Network.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.600
And I'm just going to give
you a real quick overview

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.760
of the service hub, and then
I'm going to let the folks

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.090
on the ground do some talking

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.910
about what the work
actually involves day to day.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.250
I'm going to start by
making some introductions.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.560
First, brief 101 about
New York State,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.770
which is its own delightful
entity of, you know,

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.520
wonder, and did I say delight?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.820
I think I did.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.120
[Laughter] Okay, good.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.170
So since the 1960s, the state
of New York has been divided

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.250
up into these sort of nine regions
for the purposes of legislating

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.210
and distributing funding,
and all of that stuff.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.790
It kind of breaks up
on county lines.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.540
But there are nine regions.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.540
All of the libraries and archives
in the state or, you know,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.510
the majority of libraries and
archives in the state make

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.950 position:56%
up this Empire State Library Network
or participate in it, I would say.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.000
And the Empire State Library
Network is nine regional councils.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.900
So each region in the state
has a council that serves.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.690
It's a multi-type library council
that serves libraries and archives

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.770
in their region, in their
geographic region of the state.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.270
So each has its own lovely acronym.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.110
I memorized them all.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.510
And we also have in
the state preexisting

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.800
in the service hub three
large-scaled digital --

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.150
collaborative digital
collection projects.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.410
So regions offer -- the councils
in each region offers a suite

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.930
of services to their membership.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.550
So it's like, everything
from interlibrary loan

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.900
and sometimes chat reference
support, to digital services,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.220
so hosting digital
collections, content

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.640
and doing digitization trainings
and services for their members.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.220
So each council does
that in their own way.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.880
But that's what's happening
throughout the state.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.020
Seven of those councils collaborate

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.370 position:56%
on one shared big digital collection
project called "New York Heritage",

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.870
which you'll hear more about.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.690
And then two of the councils host
their own digital collections

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.230
locally in support
of their membership.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.940
So we have Hudson River Valley
Heritage at Southeastern New York.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.230
And in New York City at Metro,
we've got Metro's Digital Culture.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.300
So those are sort of the
big large-scaled projects.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.340
And then, of course, throughout
the state in every region,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.310
there are institutions that also
host their own content locally.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.190
So, for example, in Rochester we
have the University of Rochester

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.170 position:56%
who hosts their own stuff instead of
participating in New York Heritage,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.160
or one of the shared
collaborative projects.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.670 position:56%
So those are our partners statewide.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.230
And then oh yes, this one.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.980
I'm going to introduce us.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.280
Again, my name is Kerri Willette.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.080
I manage the service
hub out of the council

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.990
in New York City, which
is called "METRO".

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.990
And in DC that makes me
sound like I drive a train.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.590 position:56%
[Laughter] I don't, but I'd like to.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.660
And then Laura Osterhout is going
to talk to us from the perspective

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.290
of Rochester Regional Council --

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.780
I guess I didn't memorize
what they stand for,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.830
Rochester Regional Library
Council, and she's going

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.940
to give us some background on
the state sort of collaborations

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.720
that have happened over time.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.660
Susan D'Entremont is
here from Albany

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.030
in the capital District
Library Council.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.330
Jennifer Palmentiero is here

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.840
from Southeastern New York
Library Resources Council.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.560
And she manages Hudson
River Valley Heritage,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.690
which is one of those collaborative
projects I was talking about.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.180
So we're going to hear
from each of them.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.650 position:56%
The hub itself, Empire State Digital
Network, we have a staff of three.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.400
We live at the METRO offices.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.880
METRO hosts and administers
basically the technology of the hub

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.000
and project management
workflow and things like that

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.360
for coordinating aggregation.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.490
ESDN is a straight-up aggregator.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.480
We are not a repository.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.780
We do not have a frontend
portal at this time,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.140
although we'd like to build
one, and we're working on it.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.240
And then, you know, it's
really coming from the councils

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.910
where all our content is, right?

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.940
So all of the council members
go to their one person on staff

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.650 position:56%
in each region if they want to
participate in contributing to DPLA.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.950
So in, you know, Albany if there's
a library that wants to contribute

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.080
to DPLA, Susan is the face of DPLA
in New York for that person, right?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.170
And that's true of
each regional council.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.460
So together we've done pretty
well over the last two years.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.130
We have over 181 institutions
contributing

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.400
to DPLA through our network.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.350
And we're up over 200,000 objects,
and going strong, we're growing.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.720
And now I'm going to let the
folks who are actually are

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.810
on the ground doing all the
stuff come and talk to you

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.510
about that; so starting with Laura.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.160
[ Silence ]

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.460
&gt;&gt; Laura Osterhout: Thank you.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.760
Hey, everybody.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.060
It's good to see so
many people here today.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.360
Can you hear me okay?

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.300
I hate the sound of my own voice.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.670
[Laughter] So I am going to tell
you a bit about the building blocks

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.980
that we had in place in
New York that enabled us

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.490
to connect everything up and
make a really successful hub.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.630
And as Kerri mentioned already
to you, there are the three sort

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.970
of main digital content
sites in New York.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.440
I'm going to talk about how
we sort of started with these

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.250
and connected everything to be
the foundational pieces of the hub

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.330
and contribute to the success.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.640
So Kerri went through the nine
library councils that we have.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.350
We make up the Empire
State Library Network.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.030 position:56%
And we collaborate very heavily now,
but that wasn't always the case.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.480
And so up until about ten years
ago, we didn't work as closely

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.980
with each other as we do now.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.800
And in 2006 to 2009 timeframe,
there was a real push for us

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.190
to work closely together, reduce
redundancies, and things like that.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.930
I joined the councils in 2007.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.650
So I came in right
at that time period.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.540
And so just to give you a bit of
background of the digital landscape

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.960
of New York at that time,

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.610
each of the nine regions had
their own regional digital

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.950
heritage collection.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.230
And they all happened
to use CONTENTdm.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.860
So there were nine different
licenses of CONTENTdm

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.190
around the state, not counting some

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.170
of our other partners
who had their own.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.870
And so as we were talking and
looking for ways to collaborate,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.180
we're thinking, "Does
it really make sense

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.360
to have nine separate
regional sites?

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.660
Could we save money?

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.040
Could we streamline?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.430
And then what about the
experience for our end users?"

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.480
In my region in Rochester,
the regional site was called

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.830
"Finger Lakes and Genesee
River Valley Heritage".

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.540
It didn't mean a ton to
the people in my region,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.620
and it meant even less
outside of there.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.610 position:56%
So trying to pull together some sort

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.760
of statewide option
made a lot more sense.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.110
So we talked about that, and we
were in conversations with all

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.970
of the library councils about that.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.910
And we ended up beginning
a merge in about 2010.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.950
And we were lucky because
we were all in CONTENTdm,

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.820
so that helped a lot, actually.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.010
And we started with
an unlimited license

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:33.110
from the Western New
York Council WNY Alert,

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.000
which is in the Buffalo region.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.710
So we used that to --
as the base to pull

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.220
in content from the other sites.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.520
And each merge was
a little different,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.220
just because everybody's
local situation was different.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.230
Some people were hosted at OCLC.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.770
Some people hosted their own.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.230
But, you know, we made it
work, and it was easier

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.650
because we were on
the same platform.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:58.800
And then we brought the first
sort of the up-staters everything

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.270
above the [inaudible], we
brought in by the middle of 2011.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.830
And then our most recent addition
is the Long Island Council.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.190
And we -- I think we officially
added everything from them

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.950
at the end of 2005, I believe.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.310
So we're really representing
a huge part of New York.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.530
It's been really successful.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.780
The other two major building blocks

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.080
that we were pulling
together are the HRVH,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.020
that's Jen's area,
Hudson River Valley.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.340
And I'm just going to
call it "Digital Metro",

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.230
because that's what
I remember it as.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.180
[Laughs] And I want
to talk a little bit

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.040
about why these two sites are
separate from New York Heritage,

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.860
and there's really good reasons for
that, and why it's totally fine.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.860
And I also want to give a shout-out
to Jen and HRVH and their region.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.840
They were -- I think all of us

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.090
from New York can agree they
were really some of the pioneers

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.850
in collaborative, large-scale
digital projects.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.980
And when we were forming all of
our New York Heritage standards,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.340
especially Metadata, we basically
cribbed everything from them.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:04.950
So I just want to give
you a shout-out

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.890
because it was a huge help.

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.880
She's going to talk
about Metadata later.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.090
But both of these two
projects, in particular,

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:20.230 position:56%
really want to maintain local
control of their front and back end,

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.440
and their ability to make changes.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.610
And New York Heritage
has hosted OCLC,

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.840
so we are more limited
in what we can do.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.580
And that's okay, and
it works for us.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.690
But for these two particular
projects,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.640
their users really expect
that level of control.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.420
And so that really
makes sense for them.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.540
In addition, they both
had, you know,

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.870
really good brand recognition
among your members.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.960
And it didn't necessarily
make sense to abandon that.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.660
And at the time of the merge, we
had a CONTENTdm multisite server,

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.180 position:56%
which is, you know, like a glorified
federated search, essentially.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.690
So we were able to target
whatever CONTENTdm site collections

00:09:58.690 --> 00:09:59.990
that we wanted to.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.180
But OCLC stopped supporting that
a couple of years ago, I think.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.690
So, you know, up until
that point, it was fine.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.020
There was a way to
connect everything,

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.320
but then there was this gap.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.260
And then along comes DPLA.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:17.400
[Laughs] So it's really a
lot less important that we're

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:23.090
in different sites and different
systems even because, you know,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:29.640
the team at ESDN is looking at
using the DPLA API to create sort

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.950
of a New York State portal
search, which is wonderful.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:35.910
It solves the problem for us that
we've been working on, you know,

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.950
for ten years and we
didn't have a solution for.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.110
So it's just been amazing.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.810
Let's see.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.110
How am I doing on time?

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.840
I've been practicing and
I couldn't get it down.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.140
Oh, good, all right.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.710
So the other ways that these
foundational building blocks

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:57.330
contribute to the success of
the hub is that you could see

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.470
from the other -- I mean, the map,

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.860
like everything is represented
within these projects.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.950
So pulling the data
from these projects in,

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.910
in sort of the initial wave
[inaudible] just covered the

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.210
whole state.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.510
So it was really --
not low-hanging crew,

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.860
and I know it wasn't super easy,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.200
but it was a great way
to just blast it out.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.790
And it enabled us to get a
statewide hub going faster.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:27.460 position:56%
And these projects we really -- we
worked directly with our membership,

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.550
our libraries on high-quality
metadata.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:32.070
[Laughs] And I always look at Jen.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.400
She's my metadata girl.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.270
And it -- we've been working
on it for a long time.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:44.590
And we are able to sort of make the
global tweaks that are necessary

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:49.240 position:56%
to make the data understandable
when you view it from the DPLA lens.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.520
And it's really helpful to us,
because we didn't necessarily --

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.250
you don't always think about,
"What does your stuff look like out

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.550
of the context of the
system that it's in?"

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.850
So that's been really helpful.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.450
I think that's all I wanted
to say about that one.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.210
Okay.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.400
[ Silence ]

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.310
And as Kerri mentioned to you, the
regional liaisons are the main face

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.890
of DPLA, at least at first

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:17.650
when someone is interested
in participating.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.270
And that benefits all of us,
really, because we get more --

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.260
understand the institutions and the
libraries in our regions very well.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.350
And we have great relationships
with them.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.420
And so it's easier for us to
contact them, to talk to them,

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.600
to know their particular situation.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.030
And it does help, I think, ESDN
because there's no way the staff

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.810
of three could talk to all
the different libraries

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.110
and members that we do.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.990
So that's mutually beneficial.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.170
And we also -- in having
these conversations,

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.840
we are able to see different
collaborations that we might have.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.840
So, for example, if
there was an institution,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.750 position:56%
say like a historical society in my
region, maybe they want to be a part

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.640
of DPLA, but they're not
a member of our group yet.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.050
So I can talk to them.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.960
I can say, "Hey, these are
the services that we provide.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.920 position:56%
These are the projects we have going
on that you could participate in

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.250
and ultimately get, you
know, funneled into DPLA."

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.630
So it's like a win-win.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:15.450
You know, we get new collections,
DPLA gets new collections.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.260 position:56%
It's just all good; good all around.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.970
Okay. So I was going to put
a cat on this, but I didn't.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.460
[Laughter] I was trying to
make some building blocks,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.970
and this is what happened,
so I apologize about that.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.110
So before I turn this over to
Susan, I just wanted to say

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.800
to anybody that's in the
audience that is thinking

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.090
about forming a statewide hub, you
know, we were lucky in New York

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.020
because we had a really
strong background

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.650
of networks going already,
but what I would say to you is

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.470
to just take a look
around your state

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.850
and identify the large-scaled
projects that you have,

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.580
identify the partnerships, even
the networks that you have,

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:01.070
even informal things, because
you may look around and find

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.170
that you have a lot of the building
blocks already that are necessary

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.560
to connect up and make
a successful hub.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.850
And so I will turn it over to
Susan who will tell you what it's

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.510
like to actually work
with the members.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:19.080
[ Applause ]

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.000
&gt;&gt; Susan D'Entremont: Well, I
had my remarks all prepared.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.160
And then I had dinner last
night with these ladies,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.040
and I got a lot more ideas.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.640
So I think Kerri's probably
going to have to cut me off.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.700 position:56%
But Laura provided a great overview
of our process throughout the state.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.540
And I'm going to talk to you a
little bit about the point of view

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:42.180
from our ten county region around
Albany, which consists of urban,

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.750
suburban, and rural members.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.080 position:56%
I'm not going to talk too much
about our specific way that we train

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.770
to do things, because we all
do it a little bit differently.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:56.010
But I'm sure we'll all be happy to
answer questions at the Q&amp;A time.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.940
But I will say, for some of
you who are from bigger states,

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.730
we actually train most
of our people remotely,

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.220
because our trainer moved
to Atlanta, Georgia.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.360
And we did it out of necessity, but
it's worked really, really well.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:15.810
So we can talk about that.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.110 position:56%
Okay. Sometimes size doesn't matter.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.680
We went into this thinking, "Oh, we
have these great big institutions.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.630
We have the University of Albany,
we have Skidmore, so forth.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.220
They're going to be
so eager to join DPLA

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.970
and the little people are
going to be a lot of trouble.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.280
[Laughter] Or they're going to --

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.570
we're going to have
to coax them along."

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.820
And we thought that that's
not necessarily true at all,

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.940
that basically the
smaller places a lot

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:40.780
of times have a lot
more flexibility,

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.780
they can turn their
ship more quickly,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.120
and that the bigger
institutions have --

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.680
they really invested in
doing things their own way,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.160
and to try to get do things our way

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.700
or the DPLA way takes
a lot more work.

00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:00.500
So really the small people were
-- are fairly easy to bring in.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.440
And we're also finding that
they have a lot more skills

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.030
than maybe we thought
that they would.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.850
We happen to have a lot of
-- I mean, the capitals,

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:12.600
we happen to have a lot of state
worker retirees who do IT work.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.900
So we're lucky that way.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:19.160 position:56%
But that it's more of the getting
people to buy into the idea has been

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.510
as much of an effort as
teaching them the skills.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.720
[ Silence ]

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.280
First of all, most of these
are probably pretty obvious

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.580
to people in the room.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.080
But having -- all the supervisors
can be like, "Yes, yes, join DPLA,"

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.550
but they weren't -- they're
not necessarily willing to turn

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:43.230
over the labor resources
needed to do that.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:48.200
So we started -- and we were really
surprised, too, that even people

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.800
in museums and libraries, they --

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.230
a lot of the people in charge
weren't really very different

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.670
from the general public in
thinking like, "Yes; put it online.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:56.970
It's really easy."

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.930
So we started to do a very
brief application process,

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.450
which wasn't so much of a
weeding or vetting process,

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.710
but more like answering,
"Who's going to do scanning?

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:09.590
How are you going to --
who's going to do metadata?

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:11.590
How are you going to do it,"
to kind of get them to think

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.940
about what's involved, and yes
to decide that they do want

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.130
to take the effort to go into this.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.020
And then the supervisor
has to sign off on that

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:23.800
so they know what they're doing.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.830
And one person willing to own it
who could very well be a volunteer,

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:28.450
but one person who's
really, really into it.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.640
And that's been one of our big
challenges is those people change,

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.050
those people leave, and you have
this really vibrant collection

00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.350
that then just stops.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.660
And we try not to take it
personally, but sometimes we do.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:44.940
The third bullet, detail-oriented,
yet not too bogged down in details,

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.500
people that are like
that, that's a sweet spot

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.910
that I think is the most
difficult thing for us to meet.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:54.160
We have institutions that
follow that, you know,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.540
they'll put up an item,
and a title, and that's it.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.890
And then we have other
institutions who want

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:59.240
to research every single thing.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.590
And I think working with
Empire State Digital Network,

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.100
which I'll talk about in a minute,
has really helped us fine-tune that

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.630
and get people to have
their ducks in a row.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.900
And flexible, good humor
and then patience basically

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.070
when you're starting a hub,
I would highly recommend

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.460
that you pinpoint members
that you know --

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:25.010
early participants who you know
are willing to go with the flow,

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.480
and are willing to change things,
because you are going to have

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.710
to make them change
everything they've done,

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.140
or change their workflow
for your very first members.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.600
And then now we're at the point

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:39.660
where I think we have a
workflow pretty well set up.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:45.010
And newer members it's much
easier for them to join.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.250 position:56%
And willing to give up some control.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.340
We all have trouble
with that, don't we?

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:56.510
We found that the smaller places
are very worried about their stuff,

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.300
like they're afraid --
and you've all heard this,

00:18:58.300 --> 00:18:59.810
they're afraid they're
going to lose money

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.100
and we keep showing them the
stats like, "No; actually,

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.880
people know you exist,
and they'll find you,

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.890
and they'll visit you,
and they'll buy things."

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.190
And they're also worried

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:10.610
about people doing bad
stuff with their images.

00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:13.560
Like I had one historical
society someone said, "Well,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.000 position:56%
what if they take our image and
they like put a word balloon over it

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.170
that says something really bad?"

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.860
"I don't know.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:29.150
You just have to give that up
if you're going to be in DPLA."

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.360 position:56%
The bigger places we're more worried
about losing professional control,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.950
we've had some of the bigger
institutions going into DPLA,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:40.580 position:56%
like not even New York institutions,
but institutions in other parts

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.380
and saying, "Well, what
are they doing here," and,

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.680
"Why do they have this
metadata in there,"

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.320
and "Why aren't they
doing it our way?"

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.070
And so, you know, just -- you have
to talk them through it and say,

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:52.150
"Well, if you're going to be
in DPLA, there's going to be --

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.930
you're going to have to
follow our rules a little bit,

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:55.760
and there's also going
to be people in there

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.830
that are doing things
not exactly the way

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.400
that you do them, and that's okay."

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.200 position:56%
And then Laura did a really good job
at explaining our different regions.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.710
And we have all had to give up
a little bit of our control.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.640
We all do things slightly
differently.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.870
Our memberships' needs are
different in each region.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:16.200
And that's been hard too, but
we have to be okay with the fact

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.420
that everyone does things
a little bit differently.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.070
Well, everyone, if
you're talking about DPLA,

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.580
you want to have some
things from DPLA in there.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.110
So these are a couple of examples
of institutions in my region.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.660
The first, the Dunadins
with their cycle

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.030
at Luna Park, Rexford, New York.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.270
This is from the Clifton
Park-Halfmoon Public Library,

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.160 position:56%
which is a suburb basically
halfway between Albany and Saratoga.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.370
So people -- so it's for
couples who have people that work

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:41.670
in both places live there.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:43.880
And it's a very, very
popular collection.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.640
It was only a few hundred items
in there, and there will be

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.150
like 50,000 hits in a month.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.040
And it's -- you know,

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:54.380
I think everyone thinks this
is a really boring suburb

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.680
with nothing to do.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.980
And, you know, yet
it has this history,

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.460
and it's gotten a lot of hits.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.360
They had a historian and a
librarian working together,

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.430 position:56%
which has been a very good
partnership for many of our members,

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.890
where the historian has the
content in the metadata,

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:12.930 position:56%
and the librarian actually puts it
in and does the collaborative stuff.

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.240
But then the librarian took
a job at another library,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.910
and so that's been a
dormant collection.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.520
And again, we have
to be okay with that.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.550
This is the Rudolf Steiner Library
of the Anthroposophical Society

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.320
in America, which is a tiny, tiny
library with a halftime librarian.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.250
It has moved twice since they
joined New York Heritage,

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.670
but they have a real -- but they've
put in a lot of wonderful stuff.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.620
They have a great librarian that's

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:42.180
like the Waldorf School
Biodynamic Farming Movement.

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.480
They have a real mission.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.990
And they've put a lot of stuff in.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.730
People want to be told, but
they don't always listen.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:55.830 position:56%
People -- we gave them
guidelines, two pages of guidelines.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.130
People didn't like that.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.710
Now we have 60-page guidelines.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.010
They love that.

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.010
[Laughter] But they don't
always do what we say.

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:08.760
So Empire State Digital
Network has helped us

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.140
to get the people to listen.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.300
Kerri and Chris Stanton, who's the
metadata guy, they are experts,

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.940
but they're also perceived
as experts.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.350
They can tell our members things.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.850 position:56%
We could tell them the same thing,
and that's just that crazy librarian

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.430
in Albany, but -- oh, two minutes.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.120
But when we say that
Empire State Digital Network

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.700
and DPLA says you need to do
this, then they'll listen.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.810
Also now that they know that
their things are national,

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:40.120
they don't want to be embarrassed.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.360
So they'll, you know, make sure
their things are right-side

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.660
up and that sort of thing.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:47.990
They have had renewed enthusiasm,
like lots of people were waning.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.600
And now that we've joined DPLA,
they're putting more things in.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.440
And then it's been very,
very helpful, I think,

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.370
to give them the resources, the
labor, and the money resources

00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.200
from their boards and
from the administrators,

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.640
because they were doing
a great job before.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.400
But now saying they're part
of DPLA, they'll do that.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.460 position:56%
And Empire Digital State Network has
been able to provide us with tools.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.760
This is a tool.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.350
Jen's going to talk in a
minute more about metadata,

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.960
but this is something
that Chris Stanton

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.840
of Empire State Digital
Network created

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.140

were able to pinpoint people

and tell them what
it's like in the field.

permission letters --

of understanding we have just
very brief permission letters

and that's been helpful.

they're nervous

about signing these legal documents.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.160
I'm nervous about signing it, and I
think when we have that, you know,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.570
that more one-on-one
relationship we'll be able

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.240
to get that permission up.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:13.320
And I'm very excited about hearing
about that rightstatements.org.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.240
So we're going to be able to help
ESDN get good rights [inaudible]

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.580
to get a lot of metadata taking
up a lot of room out of there.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.190
And in turn they're going
to be able to help us.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:27.200
I had a lot of problems with
people thinking they have copyright

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.500
that they don't have.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.770
And so I think this discussion --
besides pointing them to this book,

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:35.460
this discussion that we need
for DPLA will help with that.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.910
[ Silence ]

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:40.640
Well, what are participants
going to do?

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.930
Right now we're very, very --
just like DPLA, we're a new hub.

What is it, how long, a year?

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:46.530
Okay.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:52.690
Does our members still --
we still -- we don't --

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.050
most of us don't charge
our members at this point.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.350
We will have to at some point.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.940
So I think they're going to look
at the value versus the cost.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.950
Is it worth what they perceive
as red tape to be in DPLA?

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.390
I hope they say yes.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:07.070
And looking -- we haven't had a
chance yet to look at our stats

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:12.400
to see how much DPLA has
helped them get views.

Hello, everybody.

And we don't use the
word "stealing",

we use "creatively repurpose."

[Laughter] That's what we do
with each other's stuff, so.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.420
Okay; so come on a journey with me

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:33.750
into the weeds of metadata
harvesting.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.910
And everything Susan said is true

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.210
for our Hudson River
Valley Heritage Environment,

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.520
in terms of who our members and
how all of that kind of plays out.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.130
So what she said.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:46.580
Okay; so I'm going to
talk about my workflow

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.120
with my Hudson River
Valley Heritage members,

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.940
and how I get their
metadata ready for DPLA.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.620
And I have about 30 seconds to
share with you on what ESDN does

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.900
with the non-hosted
repositories in our state.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.510
So you can get a little
understanding

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.000
of what that looks like.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.030
So I do an assessment.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.520
When I get a collection ready after
they've signed a permission letter,

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.450
I take a look at the collection,
see what I'm dealing with.

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.650
And then there's some consultation
that happens, sometimes with Chris

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.850
at ESDN if I have some questions
before I go to my member.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.560
And then I will talk to my member

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.540
about some things that
need to change.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:24.570
And I do about 90% of the
cleanup for them, but I am lucky

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.880
that my collections
are all really small.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.700
Most of them are under
1,000 objects.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.320
We have a few in the few thousand.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.750
Our largest is 5,500.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:35.390
That one didn't get as cleaned up
as often as some of the others.

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.760
So then I do the cleanup.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.510
And then I map our fields according

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.570
to a spreadsheet that
Chris provides me.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.680 position:56%
And then they do the transformation.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.890
So before I kind of go into
collection level workflows,

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.940
I want to talk about assessment
for just another second, or two,

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.220 position:56%
or five, that we had to kind of look

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.670
at our higher-level
metadata guidelines,

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.300
and see what needed
to be changed there.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:59.100
We had to change some
of our mapping.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.510
We're all CONTENTdm shops.

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.700
CONTENTdm is very flexible in
terms of your field labels,

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.020
what you present to the user.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.940
We can map those to
[inaudible] fields or not.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.570
So we did have to change
some of our mapping

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.450
to make our resources more
shareable, and un-map some things.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:15.940
I thought we were going
to have to like,

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.970
maybe really do some things
differently in a couple of fields.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.800
And it turns out that so
far, that hasn't happened.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.100
You can be a little different,

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.650
as long as you're consistently
different,

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.750
then ESDN can work with it.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:31.150
I still might revisit a couple
things, and that might be phase two

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:32.830
of metadata cleanup, really kind

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:35.510
of making some things a bit
more shareable and less messy.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.640
Okay. So again we're
a CONTENTdm shop.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.440
So the first thing I do is I export
all of the records into Excel

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.990
so I can filter on field
to see where I'm kind

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:49.650
of -- where some problems are.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:53.150
Also in CONTENTdm, we have the
ability to kind of browse list

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.930
where we have controlled
vocabularies enabled so I can kind

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:57.230
of see when a person's going

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:01.120
to index five different ways;
and take a look at that.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.100
And all of our metadata cleanup
has to happen in CONTENTdm.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.030
Unfortunately, we can
get the data out,

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.730
we could even wrangle it all we
want in something like OpenRefine

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:10.420
or Excel, but we can't
stick it back in.

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.040
So this is part of the reason
why I do a lot of the cleanup

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:17.350
for our members is because I've
been using CONTENTdm for 12 years.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.180
I know how to maximize the software

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.510
to get it done quickly
and efficiently, so.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.060
[ Silence ]

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:26.420
So I look at every field.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.260
I'm going to highlight a few here.

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.820
But I do take a look at everything.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.610
Some fields are easier to clean
up, some are pretty normalized.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.030
You know our internet media
types and our language codes,

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:37.130
those tend to be pretty
standard, and if they're not,

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.910
that's kind of an easy fix.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.140
Some are more complicated.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.860
I have subjects [inaudible]
formats in italics here,

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.520
because this is an older
version of the PowerPoint,

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.900
and that I wasn't sure
I was going talk

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.840
about those, but I am apparently.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.250
So we'll see what we've
got going on here.

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.550
All right.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.850 position:56%
So let's just kind of get into this.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.150
All right.

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.450
So in an ideal world,
we know when all

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.590
of our resources were
created; that never happens.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:02.430
And we do try to adhere to
the international standard.

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:03.730
It's in our guidelines.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:05.520
And interestingly enough,
12 years ago

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.720 position:56%
when we developed our guidelines, we
tried to normalize on certain days

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.020
with just a question mark.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.240
We thought it would
be easy to script out,

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.260
or to otherwise remove
from indexing.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:16.830
And it turns out people really
don't like that question mark.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.130
It means something
different than circa.

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:22.110
They're really, really tied to that
word "circa" or the letters C A,

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:25.550
or the letter C, or all
three in one collection.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.100
So -- [laughter] it happens.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.630
And so I have to do some
kind of wrangling about that.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:33.520
And we were allowing them to keep
the circa, and just do it one way

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.370
to make it easier for ESDN
to write a script to indicate

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.130
that that's an uncertainty.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.700
Here are more date formats.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.650
Some of this is just they
don't read the guidelines.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:47.600
[Laughter] So I clean all this up.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.140
And we've kind of gone to date
ranges for like the top three,

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.480
and deal with some of these
other formats in other ways.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.210
And the bottom two
are just wrong, so.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.340
Okay, again, geographic
locations; and this is one area

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.640
where I thought we
were going to have

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.210
to really do things
differently, because nobody else

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:06.780
in the whole entire country does it
this way, except New York Heritage

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.620
because they creatively
repurposed our guidelines.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.920
[Laughs] So and, you know, we --

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.710
there were decisions
behind all this.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.080
We sat and talked about geographic
formats for like a whole day.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.990
And this is what we came up with.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.910
So we ask our members to do it
this way, and in reality we get all

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:23.210
of these different formats.

00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:26.400
Some is just punctuation, and
then some is they didn't read

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.700
the guidelines.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.420
So I normalize all those.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.320
And maybe we'll go
back and we'll revisit,

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.040
but right now this
hasn't been a problem.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.540
Again, we're different, but we're
consistently different, so okay.

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.700
Personal names, very
hyperlocal collections.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.920
You're not going to find
the majority of your people

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.730
in the Library of Congress
name authority file,

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.050
or any other authority file.

00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:47.350
We have some.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.740
We deal with famous artists
and revolutionary war figures.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.790
But most of our people
are just the, you know,

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.710
folks who have lived
in your neighborhood.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:55.010
So I take a look at this.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:59.830
And sometimes it's obvious,
obvious enough that I'm dealing

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:03.820
with the same person;
sometimes it's not.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:08.030
This is where I might pull
in my contributors and say,

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.330
"You just might want to
take a look at these."

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.440
They don't always know
either, but we're trying

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.550
to index one person one
way as much as we can.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:20.130 position:56%
Corporate names; postcard publishers
have been the bane of my existence

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.070
since we've started
harvesting to DPLA.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.530
There was just absolutely
no control.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.010
And people just key in
what they see on the back.

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.580
And a fair amount of them
are in authority files,

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.400
so I do try to normalize those.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.490
Oh, God. And then,
again, we have a lot

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.300
of our local businesses,
and clubs, and things.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:38.040
So again, here's where
I take a look.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.040
And the bottom example,
I'm not exactly sure

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.480
that that's the same story.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.800
I could have changed
names over time.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:47.050
So again, I might throw that
back to my contributors.

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.320
I do try not to get into a
lot of intellectual work here,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.020
but I do take a look at
subjects for smaller collections

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.560
when things really jump out at me.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.440
Like we do allow multiple
vocabularies.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:58.860
And sometimes they'll use the
same term from two different ones.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.090
And I know that the DPLA will
kind of rather not have that.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:03.400
I think you're dealing with that
at some level, and may be able

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.460
to pull them out I heard,
but -- or reduce redundancy.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.110
But I try to do that first.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:10.630
I do catch typos.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.310
Crazy unauthorized heading,

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:13.710
I don't know why they
thought this was a Library

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:15.310
of Congress subject
heading, but they did.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:18.870
So I kind of do that when the
collection's small enough.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.650
Sometimes we have some
over indexers, you know,

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:26.020
that they treat image indexing
like a game of "I Spy", you know.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.130
[Laughter] So I might do something
there, or sometimes not enough.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:31.640
So I might throw a couple in.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.710
And I've talked to them
first before I do this.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.010
They're okay with me doing it.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:36.390
And they love me, and
they trust me [inaudible].

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.740
All right.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:42.540
So I don't have a slide on original
formats, because it's a disaster.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.000
That is one area where
we just had no control.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.240
Again, we had a big meeting,
we all sat around the table,

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.920
and try to get museum people, and
archive people, and library people

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:53.080
to agree on even what
the word means.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:56.610
So what, you know, "Jen,
what's the format of a chair?

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:57.910
How about a dress?"

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.210
I'm like, "I don't know.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.020
Do what works for you,
and be consistent."

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.720
They're not consistent at all.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:06.700
And that is, again, where I've
cleaned things up as much as I can.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.720
We also stick kind of
form genre information

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.330
in the same field with
extent information.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.540
And punctuation is
all over the place.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.490
So I'm doing my best
because ESDN wants

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:20.250
to parse those two
pieces of information out.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:22.070
So that -- we're going to
have to go back and clean some

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.380
of that up moving forward.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.380
[ Silence ]

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.070
Okay. This one isn't
supposed to be in there.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.370
But yes, we have to update some

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:31.570
of our metadata guidelines
and the right statement.

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.210
I didn't mention rights,

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.510
because right now I just make
sure that everybody has one.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.280
One thing I want to let you
all know if you're thinking

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.460
about starting a hub, you don't
have to go through this level

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.000
of cleanup that I go through.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.870
All the DPLA requires of you is
a title and a right statement,

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:45.810
and make sure things are
mount [phonetic] correctly.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:47.880
But we want our stuff to
be as clean as possible.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.730
So now's the time.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:52.190
You know, am I going to go
back and do all this, no.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:53.980
Now's the time where
I'm looking at it.

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.520
And we are going to be
doing big rights work.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.800
Our right statements
need a lot of help.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.560
And I've started to do
something seed planting.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.030
I've been following the DPLA since
they started getting the right

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.050
on rights [phonetic] project
and then through the white paper

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.420
that was released in the fall.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.550 position:56%
And I kind of let my people know,
"This is coming, and now it's here."

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:11.190
So we'll all be ready.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.630
And I've been asked to come talk to
boards and directors, and things,

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:14.930
which makes me really nervous.

00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:18.210
So I'm not sure about that.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.150
Oh, and my slide about the
-- this is the old version.

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:22.450
So it's okay.

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:23.750
It's fine.

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:25.250
So let me just mention what happens
with our non-hosted repositories

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.180
when ESDN works with them.

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:31.100
So there's lots of
different systems in play.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.460
Sometimes the sharing
isn't even there.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.370
So there's no OIA feed.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.840
So that has to be developed
or configured first.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.470
And then Chris said
-- a lot of times --

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:44.280
you know, these better funded and
better staffed organizations tend

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.160
to have professionals
doing the metadata.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.040
So things tend to be pretty clean,

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:50.180
but they can be very
domain-specific;

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.100
so art, and music, and things.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.460
So sometimes getting the
mapping right is challenging.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.830
As has been mentioned, you
know, you kind of lose some

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:00.830
of your really specific field
labels when you go to DPLA,

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.360
so kind of working
through those issues.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.810
And I -- yes so -- yes
there's my mapping.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.680
Ad then Chris does all his
crazy transformations, and John,

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.760
and it's all beautiful, and
awesome, and we love it.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.950
And I just have to say that
we have checked our stats,

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.760
up 30% since we started
contributing to DPLA.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.010
So Q&amp;A time.

why we have stuff in DPLA.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.320
So I -- we kind of thought this
would be set up like a table

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.870
for like, questions and answers.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.750

mind coming up here?

Yes; just cuddle in behind here.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.450
So I'd like to give
everybody the opportunity --

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.670
I mean, I have some like
seed questions I can ask

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.220
in case nobody has any, but I
think it would be more interesting

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.760
if you all ask the questions you're
interested in hearing more about,

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.110
and one of us can answer.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:03.510

&gt;&gt; Jennifer Palmentiero:
I talk to them.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.080
And part of the reason
why now is the time is

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.290
because those are challenging
conversations to have.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:28.860
But most people have been
pretty receptive to it.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.840
So we just -- I just do it.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.460 position:56%
And I don't do an awful lot of that.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.620
Some collections are better
in that area than others.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.090
So I just have -- I'm very nice.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.840
[Laughter] And I'm a good
cheerleader, you know?

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:42.230
And I always start with
all of the positives.

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.030
And then, I'm like, "You
know, there might be --

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:45.830
" and I don't get into
specific records.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.410
It's like, "I've kind of noticed a
little of this," and they're like,

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:49.170
"Fine, go ahead, do it," so.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:50.470
&gt;&gt; Susan D'Entremont: And
I just wanted to jump in,

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.120
because like we said we each treat
our regions a little differently.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.420
In our region for most -- except

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.590
for the very smallest places we
actually tell them what's wrong,

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:02.180
and have the institutions do
the cleanup, because that way

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.480
when they go and add more --

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.780
&gt;&gt; Laura Osterhout:
They'll do it right.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.080
[Laughs]

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.380
&gt;&gt; Susan D'Entremont: They're
more likely to do it right.

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.680
&gt;&gt; Laura Osterhout: Right.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.980
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Palmentiero: Right.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.280
&gt;&gt; Susan D'Entremont: So.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.580
&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: And that works
really well for us at the hub,

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.880
because the more cleanup that
happens at the local level,

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.180
the less we need to intervene

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.540
and maintain those
interventions over time.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:21.110
So for us in New York, that's
really been at the high level.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.690 position:56%
Our goal is not to do a lot of like,

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.570
"We're going to make
it all perfect," or,

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.170
"We're going to change
it all to this thing."

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.250
We're like pretty baseline, "It's
going to go through to the DPLA

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.940
if it has these, you know, a
thumbnail and these things."

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.700
But at the local level these
guys are doing all that work

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.400
with the institutions directly.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.700

will tell -- I mean ESDN --

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.000

to see cleaned up.

So some of it's that.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.280
And then I've cleaned up
all of their vocabularies.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.900
And I do have to work with them on
some of the more nuanced issues.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.290
So yes; we have a conversation

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.770

CONTENTdm, I think as Jen said,

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:38.450
if things are weird but
they're consistently weird,

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:39.750
we can deal with that.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:42.920
And CONTENTdm has some
consistently weird things about it.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.560

can be pretty varied in terms

of the descriptive
data that's in there.

So everybody doesn't have to

they don't know what to
do about right statements.

And if we can come to them with
these 11, you know, statements,

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:31.160
and we can say, "This
is what they mean."

Maybe consult with them,
"This probably applies

to what you're doing, and you
can feel comfortable using it,"

subcommittee that comes together

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:44.290
in a room, that's basically
all of us sitting here,

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:46.580
and Carly's unit this
year from METRO too,

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.860
and she'll run that group for us.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.670
[Laughter] And then, you know,
like we'll be able to say like,

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.470
"This is how we're going
to do this across the state

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:57.870
to help people figure out
what they should do next,

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.170
and what we need from them.

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:03.470
And then we'll also share that
out, of course, to all of you.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:07.510
But we're excited.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.350
&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: That's
a great question, Liz.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:27.500
And so basically the deal
is everybody in the regions,

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.050
they're working directly with
institutions on their collections

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:35.250
that are often in a, you know,
hosted CONTENTdm, or Islandora,

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.320
in the case of METRO, repository.

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.350
So those are really the
collection managers,

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:41.700
and they're also the people

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.800
who are doing digitization
trainings and all that stuff.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:49.690
But Chris, at the hub level,
is taking their OIA feeds.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.480
Right; so when Jen does
her amazing metadata

00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.050
in their CONTENTdm instance,
she's working with Chris, then,

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.600
to map that one collection
stream or that --

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:04.180
many collections, but one
data stream to our data model.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:07.090
And he's meanwhile working with
Susan, and working with Laura,

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.960
and working with Ann, to pull
in data streams from each

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.260
of those other collections.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.590 position:56%
So he's actually normalizing across
all of these different institutions,

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:19.830 position:56%
and then also working with our state
library, and our state archives,

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:24.260
and our, you know, many other
institutions that host locally.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.590
He works directly with them

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:28.360
so that we can get those
data streams normalized.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:32.790
So we pass one single
stream to DPLA.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:37.200
I've passed it straight to
Gretchen in the backup, I'm sorry.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.510
They passed it right there, so.

We've talked about this last night.

&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: That
is a good question.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.600
&gt;&gt; Laura Osterhout: Do you want
to talk about ESDN [inaudible]?

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.900
&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: You
talk about the state first.

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.200
&gt;&gt; Laura Osterhout: Okay.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.500
The nine library councils
are actually directly funded

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.800
by New York State.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:07.680
We receive sort of like
general operating funding.

00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.520
We're actually considered
library systems in the state.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:15.710
And there's some wacky metric way
they decide who gets the funding.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.320
I mean, you know, METRO
gets a lot more

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.730
because they have a lot more
people than we do upstate.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:24.850 position:56%
But then we also get some
additional revenue from statewide --

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:27.910
different grants to run
different types of programs.

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:31.270
We used to get -- was it
LSDA that was federal money?

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.520
We don't get that anymore.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.170
But then ESDN is funded sort
of a little differently.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.520
&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: So ESDN
-- like three years ago,

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.820
all of the councils came together,

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.600
they said we want to
become a DPLA hub.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.770 position:56%
You know, the big strategic planning
meetings happened, blah, blah, blah.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:49.590
Next thing you know
-- this is my version.

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:51.610
I like -- [makes sounds]
I wasn't there.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:57.740 position:56%
So this is what I've been told, when
I was just a twinkle in their eye.

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:00.530
Basically, METRO's board --

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:03.260
because each of the councils
has its own board of directors

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.920
or whatever they're
called, "Board of Trustees".

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.440
&gt;&gt; Laura Osterhout:
Yes, trustees, yes.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.840
&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: And so
basically METRO's board said, "Yes;

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.140
we want to kick this off."

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:12.780
But really we didn't have
at any of the councils,

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.070
a way to handle the technology
and the project management

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:18.600
and everything on top of whatever
everyone was already doing.

00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.690
And you may be familiar
with that situation.

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:25.830
And so the Empire State Library
Network kicked in some money

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:28.820
and then, METRO board
basically funded the rest.

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.820
So it's three fulltime positions.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.800
And we're very fortunate.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.220
And it was funded for three years.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.640
It was funded for one year
initially, and then three years.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.520 position:56%
So we're hitting the third year now.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.570
And we're having a
lot of conversations

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.750
about how funny it will
work going forward.

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.970
And that's what my
next year will be.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:47.550
[Laughs] So I'll have more answers.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:51.260
&gt;&gt; Susan D'Entremont: And then also
we do charge member fees to our --

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.260
the councils charge
member fees to our members.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.220
And that's been another
difficult conversation,

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.720
because there are definitely
people that hold material

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.370
that probably they want in
DPLA, or we should have in DPLA

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:06.220 position:56%
that are not our traditional library
museum archives type members.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.700
And how do we deal with that?

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.410
And we don't have any
great answers yet.

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:11.880
We're talking about that
in the next year as well.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:13.680
&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: Yes.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.100
We -- well, I mean, it
depends on what it is, right?

00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:38.570
I mean, we don't do a ton
of intervention at ESDN,

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.230
because we're getting it from too
many sources and it would be a lot

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:42.530
of -- you know, it's all --

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:45.990
we use REPOX, which is
an XXLT-based system.

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:48.100
So it would be a lot of
writing individual scripts

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.400
to clean things up.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.830
So we do pass many
inconsistencies onto DPLA.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:57.120
And I will say this, we
pass that information back

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.940
down the chain along
to the institutions

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.470
and ask them to address it.

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:04.110
So we're not -- there are
cases where we'll fix things

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:08.890
that we just have to fix,
but we're really pushing

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:15.430 position:56%
down like along the sort of chain of
contribution to try and get it fixed

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.730
at the source, because I think
that's better for everyone.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.720
But then also we can't
do it otherwise.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.690
&gt;&gt; Laura Osterhout: And it can't
be perfect, and it never will be.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:23.990
&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: Right.

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:25.290
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Palmentiero: Yes.

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:26.590
&gt;&gt; Laura Osterhout: But it's
better to have it in there,

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:27.890
you know, and everybody agrees.

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:29.190
&gt;&gt; Kerri Willette: Yes.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:30.490
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Palmentiero: And
in the a wide-world metadata,

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:31.790
like go look for World War II
posters they're been digitized over

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:34.190
and over again, and look at all of
the records for the same poster,

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:35.490
and you'll see lots of
different [overlapping].

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:39.390
I mean, it's just metadata
is messy anyway.

that are correct [laughter]

between types of contributing
institutions too,

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:53.570
like what may be correct in
the museum world may be --

may be very different
in the public library.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:02.780

to say, and to make those choices

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.890
