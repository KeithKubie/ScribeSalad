00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119
you might have heard about BF Skinner

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129
you might have heard about BF Skinner
 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.439
you might have heard about BF Skinner
you know he used food pellets to

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449
you know he used food pellets to
 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.999
you know he used food pellets to
motivate his rats but what you don't

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009
motivate his rats but what you don't
 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.440
motivate his rats but what you don't
know about Skinner is that those rats

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450
know about Skinner is that those rats
 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.870
know about Skinner is that those rats
were starved to 3/4 of their normal body

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880
were starved to 3/4 of their normal body
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.020
were starved to 3/4 of their normal body
weight so they would who would work for

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
weight so they would who would work for
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.079
weight so they would who would work for
food and so Skinner's routes were kind

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089
food and so Skinner's routes were kind
 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.390
food and so Skinner's routes were kind
of oversimplified but you can get rats

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
of oversimplified but you can get rats
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.890
of oversimplified but you can get rats
to work for food they don't have to be

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
to work for food they don't have to be
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.269
to work for food they don't have to be
that hungry you can get them to work for

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
that hungry you can get them to work for
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.439
that hungry you can get them to work for
food and they'll do all sorts of things

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449
food and they'll do all sorts of things
 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.390
food and they'll do all sorts of things
they'll press levers and and they'll

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400
they'll press levers and and they'll
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.359
they'll press levers and and they'll
open bar open doors and they'll solve

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
open bar open doors and they'll solve
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.250
open bar open doors and they'll solve
problems and you know they'll do all

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
problems and you know they'll do all
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290
problems and you know they'll do all
sorts of things and one of the things

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
sorts of things and one of the things
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.600
sorts of things and one of the things
you can do to kind of measure how much

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
you can do to kind of measure how much
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.280
you can do to kind of measure how much
the rat is motivated is let's say you've

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
the rat is motivated is let's say you've
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.540
the rat is motivated is let's say you've
run him through a maze and he knows

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
run him through a maze and he knows
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.459
run him through a maze and he knows
there's some food at the end of the maze

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
there's some food at the end of the maze
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.310
there's some food at the end of the maze
you can tie a little spring to his tail

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
you can tie a little spring to his tail
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500
you can tie a little spring to his tail
and see how hard he pulls when you open

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
and see how hard he pulls when you open
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090
and see how hard he pulls when you open
the door to the maze so that's because

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
the door to the maze so that's because
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.950
the door to the maze so that's because
that's how much rat work the route is

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
that's how much rat work the route is
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.690
that's how much rat work the route is
willing to do so you can measure that or

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700
willing to do so you can measure that or
 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220
willing to do so you can measure that or
you can see how fast he skitters down

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
you can see how fast he skitters down
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.350
you can see how fast he skitters down
the maze and you can get an estimate

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
the maze and you can get an estimate
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.990
the maze and you can get an estimate
about the rats motivation and so then

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
about the rats motivation and so then
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.119
about the rats motivation and so then
you might say well how motivated is a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
you might say well how motivated is a
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130
you might say well how motivated is a
hungry rat and the answer would be

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140
hungry rat and the answer would be
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319
hungry rat and the answer would be
depends on how hungry is but there's

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
depends on how hungry is but there's
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.170
depends on how hungry is but there's
another answer it also depends on what's

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
another answer it also depends on what's
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759
another answer it also depends on what's
chasing him when he's going after the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
chasing him when he's going after the
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.149
chasing him when he's going after the
food so if you have a rat and you you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
food so if you have a rat and you you
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700
food so if you have a rat and you you
have food over here and you waft in some

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710
have food over here and you waft in some
 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.609
have food over here and you waft in some
cat odor rats hate cat odor and it's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
cat odor rats hate cat odor and it's
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920
cat odor rats hate cat odor and it's
innate they never have to see or smell a

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
innate they never have to see or smell a
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740
innate they never have to see or smell a
cat to be absolutely petrified by cat

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
cat to be absolutely petrified by cat
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.140
cat to be absolutely petrified by cat
odor and so if you walked in some cat

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
odor and so if you walked in some cat
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.030
odor and so if you walked in some cat
odor and then open the door that rat

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
odor and then open the door that rat
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.770
odor and then open the door that rat
will zoom to that food a lot faster than

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
will zoom to that food a lot faster than
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.020
will zoom to that food a lot faster than
it will if it's just hungry so a rat

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
it will if it's just hungry so a rat
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149
it will if it's just hungry so a rat
running away from something that it

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
running away from something that it
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830
running away from something that it
doesn't want towards something that it

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
doesn't want towards something that it
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.620
doesn't want towards something that it
does want is a very motivated rat and so

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
does want is a very motivated rat and so
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.870
does want is a very motivated rat and so
one of the things we did with the future

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
one of the things we did with the future
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.550
one of the things we did with the future
authoring program that's germane to this

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
authoring program that's germane to this
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350
authoring program that's germane to this
idea of terror because there's an is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
idea of terror because there's an is
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.149
idea of terror because there's an is
this idea in the old testament the fear

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
this idea in the old testament the fear
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.770
this idea in the old testament the fear
of God is the beginning of wisdom and

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
of God is the beginning of wisdom and
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.219
of God is the beginning of wisdom and
it's a pretty harsh idea but but there's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
it's a pretty harsh idea but but there's
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.810
it's a pretty harsh idea but but there's
something really useful about it because

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820
something really useful about it because
 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.370
something really useful about it because
one of the things you see with people

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
one of the things you see with people
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.410
one of the things you see with people
all the time is that they're maybe

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
all the time is that they're maybe
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.090
all the time is that they're maybe
they're trying to stumble forward

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
they're trying to stumble forward
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.480
they're trying to stumble forward
towards their ideal as poorly defined as

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
towards their ideal as poorly defined as
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310
towards their ideal as poorly defined as
it might be but then they're afraid

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
it might be but then they're afraid
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.870
it might be but then they're afraid
right they're afraid about what they

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
right they're afraid about what they
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.910
right they're afraid about what they
might encounter and that stops them

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
might encounter and that stops them
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920
might encounter and that stops them
because fear does stop people it freezes

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
because fear does stop people it freezes
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899
because fear does stop people it freezes
you like a prey animal and so people

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909
you like a prey animal and so people
 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.459
you like a prey animal and so people
move ahead but then they get afraid and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
move ahead but then they get afraid and
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.100
move ahead but then they get afraid and
then they start moving ahead and so and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
then they start moving ahead and so and
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.080
then they start moving ahead and so and
that's not so good because negative

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
that's not so good because negative
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.760
that's not so good because negative
emotion is a really powerful mode of

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
emotion is a really powerful mode of
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.620
emotion is a really powerful mode of
so we're more motivated by negative

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630
so we're more motivated by negative
 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.990
so we're more motivated by negative
emotion than positive emotion

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
emotion than positive emotion
 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.580
emotion than positive emotion
quantitatively speaking quantitative

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
quantitatively speaking quantitative
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.140
quantitatively speaking quantitative
quantitatively speaking you can measure

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150
quantitatively speaking you can measure
 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.060
quantitatively speaking you can measure
that and that's I think because we can

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070
that and that's I think because we can
 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.860
that and that's I think because we can
only be so happy but we can really be

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
only be so happy but we can really be
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.590
only be so happy but we can really be
suffering and yet you know so we have to

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600
suffering and yet you know so we have to
 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.150
suffering and yet you know so we have to
pay more attention to the negative and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160
pay more attention to the negative and
 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.040
pay more attention to the negative and
that's bad because the negative can stop

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050
that's bad because the negative can stop
 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.380
that's bad because the negative can stop
you and then in my clinical practice you

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390
you and then in my clinical practice you
 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.930
you and then in my clinical practice you
know I often talk to people who are

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
know I often talk to people who are
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.670
know I often talk to people who are
trying to make a difficult life decision

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
trying to make a difficult life decision
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.520
trying to make a difficult life decision
and and they are weighing out the costs

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
and and they are weighing out the costs
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.810
and and they are weighing out the costs
and the benefits of making the life

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820
and the benefits of making the life
 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.430
and the benefits of making the life
decision you know and one of the things

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
decision you know and one of the things
 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.410
decision you know and one of the things
I always talk to them about is wait a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
I always talk to them about is wait a
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.200
I always talk to them about is wait a
second that's an incomplete analysis you

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210
second that's an incomplete analysis you
 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.610
second that's an incomplete analysis you
have to weigh out the benefits and the

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620
have to weigh out the benefits and the
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.130
have to weigh out the benefits and the
costs of doing this and you have to

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140
costs of doing this and you have to
 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.930
costs of doing this and you have to
weigh out the costs and benefits of not

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
weigh out the costs and benefits of not
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.030
weigh out the costs and benefits of not
doing that not doing it and that's not

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040
doing that not doing it and that's not
 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.460
doing that not doing it and that's not
the same as the zero that you assume

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470
the same as the zero that you assume
 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.380
the same as the zero that you assume
that you're starting with right because

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390
that you're starting with right because
 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.710
that you're starting with right because
to not make a decision also has a cost

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720
to not make a decision also has a cost
 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.690
to not make a decision also has a cost
and sometimes the cost of not making a

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
and sometimes the cost of not making a
 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.670
and sometimes the cost of not making a
decision is far worse than the cost of

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680
decision is far worse than the cost of
 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.770
decision is far worse than the cost of
making a decision even if the decision

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780
making a decision even if the decision
 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.750
making a decision even if the decision
is risky and so one of the things you

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
is risky and so one of the things you
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.980
is risky and so one of the things you
can derive from that and this is very

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990
can derive from that and this is very
 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.210
can derive from that and this is very
useful I think is that this is also I

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220
useful I think is that this is also I
 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.980
useful I think is that this is also I
think why it's so useful to contemplate

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990
think why it's so useful to contemplate
 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.050
think why it's so useful to contemplate
your mortality so to speak as you're

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060
your mortality so to speak as you're
 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.960
your mortality so to speak as you're
screwed no matter what you do you know

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
screwed no matter what you do you know
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.090
screwed no matter what you do you know
and that actually frees you is that you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100
and that actually frees you is that you
 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.550
and that actually frees you is that you
you have power to aid that has cadastre

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560
you have power to aid that has cadastre
 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.750
you have power to aid that has cadastre
reason you have path B that has

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760
reason you have path B that has
 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.550
reason you have path B that has
catastrophes and you don't get to have

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560
catastrophes and you don't get to have
 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.860
catastrophes and you don't get to have
the no catastrophe path but you get to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870
the no catastrophe path but you get to
 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.690
the no catastrophe path but you get to
pick which one and that's really

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700
pick which one and that's really
 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.980
pick which one and that's really
something because if you know that

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990
something because if you know that
 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.190
something because if you know that
there's terrible risk associated with

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200
there's terrible risk associated with
 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.020
there's terrible risk associated with
everything that you do and don't do then

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030
everything that you do and don't do then
 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.310
everything that you do and don't do then
you can afford to take some risks

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320
you can afford to take some risks
 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.110
you can afford to take some risks
because you're not you know and this is

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120
because you're not you know and this is
 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.840
because you're not you know and this is
all within the arc metaphor I'm still

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850
all within the arc metaphor I'm still
 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.330
all within the arc metaphor I'm still
making the case that despite the fact

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340
making the case that despite the fact
 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.590
making the case that despite the fact
that your life is essentially

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600
that your life is essentially
 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.110
that your life is essentially
catastrophic you can you can make a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120
catastrophic you can you can make a
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.000
catastrophic you can you can make a
covenant with the highest ideal and that

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010
covenant with the highest ideal and that
 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.710
covenant with the highest ideal and that
will take you through it the best way

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720
will take you through it the best way
 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.960
will take you through it the best way
possible and I'm still making that case

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970
possible and I'm still making that case
 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.240
possible and I'm still making that case
so so then you think okay well I'm

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250
so so then you think okay well I'm
 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.470
so so then you think okay well I'm
trying to make this decision I'm gonna

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480
trying to make this decision I'm gonna
 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.060
trying to make this decision I'm gonna
go try to do something difficult and

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070
go try to do something difficult and
 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.740
go try to do something difficult and
isn't that terrifying and then you think

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750
isn't that terrifying and then you think
 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.990
isn't that terrifying and then you think
yeah but wait a minute what's really

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000
yeah but wait a minute what's really
 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.900
yeah but wait a minute what's really
terrifying is not doing it and then you

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910
terrifying is not doing it and then you
 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.390
terrifying is not doing it and then you
think about the cost of not doing it so

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400
think about the cost of not doing it so
 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.010
think about the cost of not doing it so
in the future authoring program we have

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020
in the future authoring program we have
 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.690
in the future authoring program we have
people do this little meditative

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700
people do this little meditative
 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.700
people do this little meditative
exercise which is okay just think about

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710
exercise which is okay just think about
 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.040
exercise which is okay just think about
your insufficiencies by your own

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050
your insufficiencies by your own
 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.900
your insufficiencies by your own
definition right the way that you don't

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910
definition right the way that you don't
 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.440
definition right the way that you don't
do

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450
do
 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.260
do
what you know you should do about the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270
what you know you should do about the
 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.970
what you know you should do about the
things that you do that you shouldn't do

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980
things that you do that you shouldn't do
 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.800
things that you do that you shouldn't do
that you know you shouldn't do beyond a

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810
that you know you shouldn't do beyond a
 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.480
that you know you shouldn't do beyond a
shadow of a doubt right there's some

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490
shadow of a doubt right there's some
 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.460
shadow of a doubt right there's some
things like that and that that's bad

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470
things like that and that that's bad
 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.860
things like that and that that's bad
habits and poor aim and all of the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870
habits and poor aim and all of the
 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.990
habits and poor aim and all of the
resentment and hatred and aggression and

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000
resentment and hatred and aggression and
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.940
resentment and hatred and aggression and
unresolved conflicts and all those

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950
unresolved conflicts and all those
 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.160
unresolved conflicts and all those
things that are demanding you and

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170
things that are demanding you and
 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.570
things that are demanding you and
warping you and then think okay

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580
warping you and then think okay
 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.370
warping you and then think okay
those things get the upper hand man they

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380
those things get the upper hand man they
 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.080
those things get the upper hand man they
get the upper hand and they take you the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090
get the upper hand and they take you the
 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.330
get the upper hand and they take you the
worst possible place you could go in the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340
worst possible place you could go in the
 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.250
worst possible place you could go in the
next three to five years what exactly

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260
next three to five years what exactly
 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.770
next three to five years what exactly
does that look like and so you sketch

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780
does that look like and so you sketch
 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.180
does that look like and so you sketch
all that out you think hey I don't want

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190
all that out you think hey I don't want
 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.070
all that out you think hey I don't want
to go there and so the next time that a

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080
to go there and so the next time that a
 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.260
to go there and so the next time that a
temptation comes up you think well I'd

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270
temptation comes up you think well I'd
 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.580
temptation comes up you think well I'd
be a lot better for me if I didn't

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590
be a lot better for me if I didn't
 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.050
be a lot better for me if I didn't
succumb to this temptation it's like

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060
succumb to this temptation it's like
 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.120
succumb to this temptation it's like
that's kind of weak a you'd look a

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130
that's kind of weak a you'd look a
 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.560
that's kind of weak a you'd look a
little better if you didn't eat like a

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570
little better if you didn't eat like a
 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.150
little better if you didn't eat like a
cheesecake a day or something like that

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160
cheesecake a day or something like that
 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.490
cheesecake a day or something like that
you know that's that's something but

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500
you know that's that's something but
 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.220
you know that's that's something but
it's not the same as I'm gonna have

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230
it's not the same as I'm gonna have
 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.620
it's not the same as I'm gonna have
diabeetus and I'm gonna lose my damn leg

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630
diabeetus and I'm gonna lose my damn leg
 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.750
diabeetus and I'm gonna lose my damn leg
in in five years if I don't get my

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760
in in five years if I don't get my
 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.060
in in five years if I don't get my
eating under control that's motivating

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070
eating under control that's motivating
 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.530
eating under control that's motivating
and so then the temptation comes along

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540
and so then the temptation comes along
 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.820
and so then the temptation comes along
and you think oh how about no seriously

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830
and you think oh how about no seriously
 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.480
and you think oh how about no seriously
how about no not just because a higher

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490
how about no not just because a higher
 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.520
how about no not just because a higher
good would be obtained if I avoided it

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530
good would be obtained if I avoided it
 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.670
good would be obtained if I avoided it
but because a terrible catastrophe would

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680
but because a terrible catastrophe would
 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.880
but because a terrible catastrophe would
be averted if I didn't and so well so

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890
be averted if I didn't and so well so
 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.500
be averted if I didn't and so well so
you want to get your fear behind you

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510
you want to get your fear behind you
 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.570
you want to get your fear behind you
right you want to get it behind you

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580
right you want to get it behind you
 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.070
right you want to get it behind you
where it's pushing you forward instead

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080
where it's pushing you forward instead
 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.240
where it's pushing you forward instead
of in front of you where it's stopping

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250
of in front of you where it's stopping
 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.370
of in front of you where it's stopping
you and you get your fear behind you

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380
you and you get your fear behind you
 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.830
you and you get your fear behind you
pushing your for you forward by actually

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840
pushing your for you forward by actually
 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.050
pushing your for you forward by actually
thinking through the consequences of not

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060
thinking through the consequences of not
 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.970
thinking through the consequences of not
putting your life together and the least

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980
putting your life together and the least
 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.980
putting your life together and the least
of those is that you waste it and suffer

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990
of those is that you waste it and suffer
 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.570
of those is that you waste it and suffer
right because you can't suffer anyways

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580
right because you can't suffer anyways
 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.840
right because you can't suffer anyways
man so you waste it and suffer that's a

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850
man so you waste it and suffer that's a
 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.150
man so you waste it and suffer that's a
bad deal because maybe if you're gonna

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160
bad deal because maybe if you're gonna
 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.530
bad deal because maybe if you're gonna
suffer you could at least do something

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540
suffer you could at least do something
 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.020
suffer you could at least do something
