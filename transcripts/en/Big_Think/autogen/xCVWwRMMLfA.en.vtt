one thing that fascinates me is that

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120
one thing that fascinates me is that
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.150
one thing that fascinates me is that
we're spending so much time with the

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160
we're spending so much time with the
 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.490
we're spending so much time with the
internet and we're searching online and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
internet and we're searching online and
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.470
internet and we're searching online and
when I wrote my book I brain I was

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480
when I wrote my book I brain I was
 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.660
when I wrote my book I brain I was
amazed that no one had studied directly

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
amazed that no one had studied directly
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.890
amazed that no one had studied directly
what happens to the brain when it

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
what happens to the brain when it
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.439
what happens to the brain when it
searches online so we decided to do that

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449
searches online so we decided to do that
 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779
searches online so we decided to do that
we did we did that study and we use

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
we did we did that study and we use
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.250
we did we did that study and we use
functional MRI to measure brain function

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
functional MRI to measure brain function
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.709
functional MRI to measure brain function
from moment to moment miss area and we

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719
from moment to moment miss area and we
 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.650
from moment to moment miss area and we
use functional MRI to measure the neural

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
use functional MRI to measure the neural
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.720
use functional MRI to measure the neural
circuits how they were behaving from

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
circuits how they were behaving from
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.360
circuits how they were behaving from
moment to moment while people searched

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
moment to moment while people searched
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.510
moment to moment while people searched
online and it was quite an interesting

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
online and it was quite an interesting
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.959
online and it was quite an interesting
study we found that older people who

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969
study we found that older people who
 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.060
study we found that older people who
searched online for the first time that

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
searched online for the first time that
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.430
searched online for the first time that
their brains really didn't activate that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
their brains really didn't activate that
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590
their brains really didn't activate that
much in fact their brains look very

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600
much in fact their brains look very
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.619
much in fact their brains look very
similar to how the brain looks when it

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
similar to how the brain looks when it
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.250
similar to how the brain looks when it
reads a book page but older people who

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
reads a book page but older people who
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.620
reads a book page but older people who
had previous experience searching online

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
had previous experience searching online
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.100
had previous experience searching online
had a much greater degree of activity in

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
had a much greater degree of activity in
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.870
had a much greater degree of activity in
the brain when they searched online in

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
the brain when they searched online in
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.240
the brain when they searched online in
the functional MRI scanner in fact it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
the functional MRI scanner in fact it
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.999
the functional MRI scanner in fact it
was a two-fold increase in activity so

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
was a two-fold increase in activity so
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.570
was a two-fold increase in activity so
that suggested so that finding suggested

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
that suggested so that finding suggested
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.179
that suggested so that finding suggested
to us that maybe the brain is exercising

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
to us that maybe the brain is exercising
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.120
to us that maybe the brain is exercising
when it's searching online so to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
when it's searching online so to
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.429
when it's searching online so to
understand that better we did a part two

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
understand that better we did a part two
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.649
understand that better we did a part two
of that study we took these internet

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
of that study we took these internet
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.499
of that study we took these internet
naive people and we said to them okay we

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
naive people and we said to them okay we
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.940
naive people and we said to them okay we
want you to practice searching online

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950
want you to practice searching online
 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.760
want you to practice searching online
and they practice doing it for a week

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
and they practice doing it for a week
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.880
and they practice doing it for a week
just an hour a day and we had a very

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
just an hour a day and we had a very
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039
just an hour a day and we had a very
interesting result and that was in a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
interesting result and that was in a
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.620
interesting result and that was in a
matter of just a week we saw significant

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
matter of just a week we saw significant
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.410
matter of just a week we saw significant
increase in neural circuitry not

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
increase in neural circuitry not
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.179
increase in neural circuitry not
randomly throughout the brain but in the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
randomly throughout the brain but in the
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.030
randomly throughout the brain but in the
frontal lobe areas that control

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040
frontal lobe areas that control
 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.990
frontal lobe areas that control
short-term memory and control

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
short-term memory and control
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.069

decision-making so the headline was

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079
decision-making so the headline was
 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.840
decision-making so the headline was
Google is making a smart I don't know if

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850

it's making a smart but it is increasing

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
it's making a smart but it is increasing
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.760

frontal circuits that control some of

the mental tasks that we need to search

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
the mental tasks that we need to search
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.790
the mental tasks that we need to search
online now whether it's

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
online now whether it's
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800
online now whether it's
it's helping us with short-term memory

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
it's helping us with short-term memory
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.960
it's helping us with short-term memory
outside of the searching task or with

outside of the searching task or with
 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.090

decision making when we get offline we

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100
decision making when we get offline we
 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.560
decision making when we get offline we
don't know that and it would be

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570
don't know that and it would be
 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.170
don't know that and it would be
interesting to study
