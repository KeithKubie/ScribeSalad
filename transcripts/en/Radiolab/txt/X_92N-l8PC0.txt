Speaker 1:          00:02          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:03          You're listening to radiolab from New York public radio, public radio, W C [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:16          testing, testing. This is radio lab. I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich. And since this hour we'll be talking about brains and bodies and how they communicate. We thought we'd begin the program with a guy with that we'd go to quite often he knows about this sort of thing. Oliver Sacks,

Speaker 2:          00:33          Oliver is a neurologist. As I get closer to very famous author, he took us to his study to show us something that just fascinates him.

Speaker 1:          00:41          Um, I've become fascinated. I'm incidentally, I hope you, you have to be careful with your watch or your computers.

Speaker 4:          00:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:49          um, he showed us a silver ball. I should just describe here I am looking at a silver ball about the size of a small, small ping pong ball, which he handed to you, right?

Speaker 1:          00:58          Would you care to lift up that little steel ball? [inaudible] and as soon as he did,

Speaker 2:          01:05          I am trying

Speaker 3:          01:08          the ball flying through the air, taking your hand with it, smack into the nearest bit of metal in the vicinity, which was a plate Latier left very fast and it hurt it.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Wow. That'd be cool. I've got a cat. Okay. I don't put it too near your watch and also you have to put it down very gently. Otherwise it may fly with great violence onto this nickel slam. What is that? Um, and what are we talking about it. Okay. Um, well this is a little rare earth metal magnet of great strength.

Speaker 4:          01:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:39          these magnets orient themselves almost violently to the earth's magnetic field. If you have a couple of these things, say in your pockets and you go for a walk, as you turn a corner, you will feel them really at themselves in your pockets. I like like little animals.

Speaker 2:          01:58          So your, your pockets would tell you whether you were going north, south, east or west,

Speaker 1:          02:03          your pockets or wherever you, you have the way with magnets and

Speaker 2:          02:09          how you have very weird man. How would you propose to use this? In what situation that you have imagined? Would it be a happy advantage? Well, I myself, I'm always getting lost. I have no, I have no sense of direction. I would function. Do you all ever come downtown to meet me? You would know because of the pressure on your thighs from these little balls that you were carrying out, whether you were going downtown or not downtown. See, and I may need things like this. I am very bad at all. Anting myself in space.

Speaker 3:          02:42          He's trying to do with the birds too. Right? Bird. Because birds have magnets in their brains or something like magnets, which lets them fly south. Yeah. Yeah. So

Speaker 2:          02:50          they know where they're going. They fly in when they're migrating, right? Yeah. He's trying to start a conversation like a bird, but he's cause he's choosing his thighs. He wants his thighs to talk to his brain. I've often wondered as an aside, uh, the extent to which one, um, one could develop

Speaker 3:          03:08          the nuisance. That's what this hour of radio lab is about. Human beings, not just Oliver. All kinds of folks who are attempting to add census and mostly to subtract census. We'll have stories about both adding and losing senses. And more generally, you look at how brains and bodies communicate, often fail to communicate because believe it or not, it's not an easy relationship between your brain and your body. There's a lot of confusion, deception, even. That's what new research shows and we'll get into all of that.

Speaker 2:          03:40          So let's get into it. All right. Okay. Ready? Yeah, we're first, well, let's begin with an urologist. Listen, my cell phone is ringing, so let me pause until it stops. So that's Robert Sapolsky. He's a professor of biology at Stanford. I've never figured out how to do voice messaging or whatever it is even has done in this century. Prisoners of our machine is, okay, we're in business. Okay, so to begin now, I said to Robert Sapolsky just to get my head around this, let's imagine it. I decide to visit my best friend in the world, Tommy, Tommy. I walk over to his house. I have a key. So I opened the front door, Tommy, I walk into his apartment and then I see him sprawled on the floor, dead

Speaker 5:          04:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:32          and in a horrible, tragic, instant like that, I wonder what would be going on in my brain. And I asked this because his answers suppose gives the answer. It was so we heard according to supposed ski, what happens happens in the following order. First Light bounces off Tommy's corpse and Andrew's my eye. Okay? It goes up some nerve from your eyes and into one part of the brain, which turfs it onto the next part. And then the information keeps moving. A couple of steps down. It gets into what's called your visual Cortex, which turns the dots into lines and lines into shapes. And that's just like a local train. You're taking eventually that local train carrying the image of timing, chug and chug deeper into my brain, to my cortex. And after a few more stops, I will finally know, I will consciously know that Tommy is dead.

Speaker 2:          05:24          But now here's the surprise. Information can move through the brain in different ways at the same time. And there is a second route, it turns, there's a second pathway into my body, into my nervous system, which bypasses all of that visual cortex stuff like a bullet train and goes straight to this area called the Amygdala. And what the Amygdala does is instantly it tells the heart to pound your heart speeds up the stomach to clinch stomach muscles, clench tears to flow, and you're still a couple of seconds away from like even consciously making sense of what you're, and by then already your stomach is heading towards your throat or your throats in your mouth or whatever the cliche is. So as I'm standing there in Tommy's apartment looking at this figure on the ground before I even know what I'm looking at before, I am consciously aware that Tommy is dead. My body already knows. That's exactly the punchline, right? Your body knows that before you consciously know it.

Speaker 6:          06:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          06:28          which is an astonishing idea. It is

Speaker 2:          06:31          astonishing, but it's not a new idea. Yeah. This goes back to what was originally viewed as this totally asinine theory in psychology back around 1,901 of the, you know, grand old Poop Oz of psychology, William James James,

Speaker 3:          06:46          and he's trying to answer the question where feelings came from. That's Joan Alara science writer. He really likes William James. He's written a lot about him and he says, a hundred years ago, William James poses a thought experiment. He gives the example of a bear. He says, imagine you're walking through the woods.

Speaker 7:          07:01          All of a sudden I'm behind a tree,

Speaker 3:          07:05          a bear attacks. Any wonder William James did. Okay, so the bear attacks, you're gonna feel scared. But what exactly is that feeling of fear made of? Which seems like a strange question to ask. Yeah, but, but he was trying to be empirical about it. He was trying to be a good psychologist. And his answer was that the feeling is the perception of your body, meaning step one, you see the bear, you see a bear with his teeth and his claws. Step two, your body responds fast. Heartbeat, the adrenaline, cursing in your bloodstream. And it's only in step three. When the brain sees the body respond, does it then trigger the feeling?

Speaker 7:          07:42          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          07:43          a fear and the feeling of fear comes from the perception of those changes in your body. If you took away the heartbeat, if you took away the body, there'd be nothing left to feel. Needless to say, when William James proposed this idea, people's got solutely crazy. He was nuts, completely nuts. They said, you know, if you're right, then someone who's paralyzed from the neck down and who doesn't get signals from their body, well that person would see the bear in the woods and they wouldn't get scared, which is ridiculous. Completely ridiculous. So the critics said, William James is wrong, dead wrong, and that's the end of it. Well,

Speaker 2:          08:17          it's not quite the end of it. Hello, we happen to bump into a neurologist, Antonio Damasio, director of the brain and creativity institute at University of Southern California. Wow. What a nice place. So we're sitting near with demasio where we happen to be talking about William James and his critics, which we always do always do on, you know, lunch. We don't go into a luncheon at for lunch and before we order a tuna fish sandwich, we always mentioned William James in his critics. This is something we do. So I said to the, I said, the Moscow, you know the critics call James Wrong because he said people who were paralyzed couldn't feel anything, and he says, you know, it's funny you should mention this because been a series of studies thinking about James One more time and it's very interesting because the first study that was made in this area, it was made by a paraplegic psychologists who thought that he felt less emotional than he was before and he talked to others and others reported the same.

Speaker 2:          09:16          The studies reported that people who had once been able bodied and then became paralyzed, felt less, less happy than able bodied people, less sad than able body people just less our B is rooted in a body state. If I would be able to remove from your brain the representation of your body, you would not know that you were you and would I not be sorry at my friend's Daddy. You definitely would not be sorry. At anything. What is in fact the essence of being joyful or sad? If you don't hook those notions on a changed body, he's right. You know? I mean, if you think about the last time you were sad, like really sad, how would you describe that feeling to yourself? In fairness, when I guess I would, I would say I felt dragged out and heavy. Yeah. That feeling is completely rooted in your flesh. Wow. Brain has nothing to do with that thought. Made me say it and then my body,

Speaker 8:          10:29          hold on. Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on one second. Is Your wife here

Speaker 6:          10:42          Robert? Yeah. I can't believe you're still there. What are you doing there? What do you mean you were supposed to be home an hour ago in the studio. We were on the, I don't care. What do you mean you were supposed to be home an hour ago. I reminded you this morning. I reminded you last night. I was pissed. Not Important to you. There's not such a big deal. I'll be back and actually this just a supplement example of what we've been talking about. No, Robert's having a fight with his wife, Tamar, and while he's fighting inside his body, his stomach is clenching his hardest. Palpitating. Hers is doing the same thing. Their brains are picking up these signals. I'm thinking anger, feel angry. Look at people who were just as important as your WIC and you plan on screwed it up. How did they screw it up? How did I screw up [inaudible] job? No. At a certain point, Robert will probably realize he has screwed up and just get home. He'll apologize. I'll see if I get home in 20 minutes. I'm really sorry. I know this is horrible. Is Everything okay? Yeah, yeah. It's just a sec. Sorry. Okay. He'd be like, no. When it comes to brains and bodies and men and women, the interesting thing is that when a man and woman fight these systems in their body, the heart palpitating, the stomach clenching, while these systems do turn on at

Speaker 2:          11:54          the same speed and it takes like two seconds according to Robert Spolsky where there's an interesting gender difference is how long it takes to turn off the system and ladies, sorry. In advance and in general it turns off more slowly in women than in men, which may explain something that happens to couples all the time. Okay. I'm really sorry this isn't right. I know. Oh, I'm really sorry and like here we are. Maybe like maybe at later we'll go do something or I'm really sorry. Robert Stomach is relaxing. This was really stupid. I know. His heart is slowing versed where he thinks the fight might be over.

Speaker 9:          12:30          Okay,

Speaker 6:          12:33          but you know this is something you do all the time. We're going to be, we're having a dinner right after we got engaged and we went to the restaurant and I was waiting for you and I've made the reservation and that was for like 45 minutes. You didn't even call.

Speaker 2:          12:50          Did you hear what just happened there? It's this William James stuff coming back to haunt us a century later. Topolsky says sometimes the body actually tricks the brain. Tamper knows the fight is over mentally, but her body's still tense. Her heart is still racing and her brain thinks, Whoa, wait, if my heart is still racing and I consciously know that this issue has been resolved, it must be because I'm still pissed off about that thing that happened in the Carter Administration. Minimize every day we made it goes for you. The brain fills a vacuum. You have a list, you have a list.

Speaker 6:          13:19          I do. I have a long list. Know How often you do this sort of thing. I do it like one. I can tell them it's your, the babysitter calls. I'm going to be out of town and says, should I make dinner for Robert? Because quickly you can't make dinner for yourself and the kids. No, I do make dinner. I haven't made much of the anything Tito's. Last week, Wednesday I made the baked potatoes. That's just applying heat.

Speaker 2:          13:50          I want to thank my wife, Tamer Lewin for what I think was a pretty startling lead that really, I mean I show performance, which I don't know how she did that because it's so unlike our rest of our marriage. You know, this story, by the way, came from Robert Sapolsky and he tells it about his wife too, but they're not reporters. They're scientists, so they do it differently. My wife's in the same business as me, so the very words we will say to each other is, honey, don't forget what the half life is on the autonomic nervous system. Then suddenly it's all over with. That's such a rare exchange between two people. You know? I know we're just sentimental.

Speaker 3:          14:28          By the way, Robert Spolsky's latest book is called Monkey Love, which is where that wife anecdote came from. Speaking of brains and bodies, let's put the science on pause for a moment and take a brief detour because often what gets you into these ideas like take this kid. For example, Christopher seals go to the Blake high school isn't the science. It's more basic than that. It seems something disgusting and not being able to look away. You really just can't believe that if something feels like this, it actually came out of a real person who just don't get the feeling. When we bumped into Christopher, he was gingerly holding a pair of human lungs, but it is a real person, but you just can't really associate it with a real person because it's there in front of you and it doesn't look like a real person in case. That sense of, whoa. That's why we originally went to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington d c but here's what happened. Our tour guide.

Speaker 10:         15:26          Okay. Steven S. T. E. V. E. N. Solomon, s. O. L. O. M. O. N. He showed

Speaker 3:          15:30          us a particular photo that got us thinking.

Speaker 10:         15:34          So famous photo in our archives. It's called field day.

Speaker 3:          15:37          It's a civil war photo hanging in a sign gallery. It's a picture of legs, Heil of amputated legs, a huge heap of severed legs,

Speaker 10:         15:48          some feet thrown sort of haphazardly into a pile.

Speaker 3:          15:53          Wow. It's oddly beautiful in a way. Drusen Skousen at the next time. Immediately after was what was happening at that moment. Right to one side of the picture frame. Must've been an operating table and on the table, soldier inhaling chloroform and at the foot of the table must've been a doctor signing away.

Speaker 10:         16:15          A circular amputation involve cutting straight through the skin to the bone of flap. Amputation required the tissue to be cut leaving two flaps of skin that were used to create a stump and in fact your typical army surgeon was basically graded on how quickly they could do an amputation.

Speaker 3:          16:33          That was one of the first orders where you really had doctors being aggressive in terms of taking off limbs. Like I said, that photo got us thinking, so we went back to Jonah Lehrer who has written but a very ghostly side effect that pops up during the civil war as a direct result of all of that, taking off of limbs, this, this one astonishing syndrome that these men who have had their limbs taken off, they describe very, very often this a very common thing that they still feel their phantom limbs

Speaker 9:          17:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          17:04          they say, they say, yeah, they say, doctor, I, I still feel it. Move. They can feel it hurt. Give you that. Sometimes get hot, sometimes very cold. Imagine you're a civil war doctor and you hear this. You don't even know what germs are yet, but one guy, Dr Silas, where Mitchell decides he's going to get to the bottom of it, the first thing he did was he wrote some clinical reports. Only about 5% of the men who have suffered amputation never have any feeling of the part as being still present and circulated them around the hospital. While the remainder seems to retain a sense of its existence, so vivid as to be more definite and intrusive than it is of the truly living fellow member, the stump is liable to the most horrible neurologists and to a certain curious spasmodic paralysis. No one could make sense of this. Even our Guy William James, even he looks into it, he did a very authoritative study where he sent out questionnaires to all these amputee victims and wanting to know about their lost limbs. He has to all of these civil war amputees, all these questions, does your phantom limb hurt? Can you move it if you really concentrate? And what he found was that there were no patterns, no stereotypical lost limb. Every, every experience was different. In other words, phantom limbs are like real limbs. They're yours.

Speaker 2:          18:18          Well, on this topic of Phantom limbs, there is a guy who has figured at least something out about this phenomenon. Dr v S Rama Shondra. I am a v S Ramachandra. I remember him. I remember him. He's a well known neurologist. He works in California at the University of California, San Diego. And one day he says, a patient showed up in his office and it seems that the guy had had his arm amputated. It was his left arm. And then ever since this man had an uncanny feeling that he still had an arm where his real arm used to be. Yes, it's important to emphasize this is not a delusion. He doesn't think he has an arm. He knows he doesn't. He's not crazy, but he vividly feels its presence. And the rough part was that this arm, it hurt. This sometimes happens to people with phantom limbs.

Speaker 2:          19:04          He would have days where his phantom arm would seize up in pain. Doctor, it hurts me really badly. Goes into this painful clenching spasm. The nails dig into my palm. So he has a phantom hand at the end of his phantom limb. Yes, and he'll say things like, it's going into a cramp with the nails digging into the phantom palm and it's excruciatingly painful, but there are no nails. There is no no problem. And weirdest of all, the patient couldn't do anything about it. He try to unclench his phantom nails from his phantom palm to make the pain stop, but he couldn't. He said, I cannot move the fountain. The fandom I'm wouldn't obey. I cannot volitionally move it. And I started thinking to myself, what does he mean when he says he cannot move his phantom limb like an oxymoron? There is no arm there.

Speaker 2:          19:53          Drew Ramachandran was confused what's going on. He, he checked with the patient and discovered that 11 years earlier before the amputation, he'd had an injury to his spine and after that his real left arm was paralyzed. He could not move it. He tried his brain would issue the commands. His brain was saying move the arm, but he was getting visual feedback and indeed feedback from his muscles saying, nope, move the arm. No move. No. And this went on for months, move. No, so maybe the Dr Rameshchandra, maybe this patient got so frustrated trying to move his real arm that at some point after a few months or a year, the paralysis got learnt by the brain, snapped into the circuitry of the brain.

Speaker 2:          20:38          No, I call it learned, learned paralysis. So even when they cut the patients, I'm off a year after the accident, he still didn't get any relief because the problem wasn't in his arm. It was learned paralysis. It was in his head. Now, and that is when Ramachandra thought, well, maybe the solution here is to trick this man's brain to unparalyzed to get his cells to think, well, actually we can move an on the patio trick a brain. How would you do that? How would you do that? How would you do that? How would you do that? Indeed he thought for a bit.

Speaker 11:         21:13          Then I hit on this way using a mirror property inside a cardboard box, a mirror mirror prompt inside a cardboard box, a mirror pro parked inside a car. I mean, I got a box cropped up. Oh,

Speaker 2:          21:26          it was kind of a home depot solution. Really. [inaudible] took a long and skinny mirror. The kind you'd hang on a closet door, right? Any propped it up, using a cardboard box and then turned it sideways. Place the side right in front of the patient like right on his nose. So he couldn't see himself. No, couldn't see anything in the mirror yet unless he hooked his neck around. Took a pee. Oh, otherwise he's just looking at the side. Ramesh Arjun says, I want you to imagine this with me. Jeff says, I want you to take your good on your [inaudible] arm. Okay? And stick it out in front of the mirror. So do that. Okay, now make it do what the phantom arm does. Pick your good arm. Make it stiff. Curl your hand into a fist. Dig Your fingernails into your palm, deeply. Make it hurt. You're doing that. It's kind of hurting. Now when I tell you, Cook your head so that you can look into the mirror and on your left, just where the phantom ought to be. Let's pretend that that's your phantom arm. It's cramped. It's curled exactly as you'd imagine it. So now look in the mirror, okay. And there's your arm. You see it there in nearer your phantom arm. Got It. Now very slowly keeping your eye on the mirror. Now I want you to [inaudible] curl your hand.

Speaker 11:         22:35          Patient says, okay, he opens his real hand, my God. And of course it looks like his phantom is opening. That's not surprising. He's got to do the mirror there. But he says, my God, doctor, you're not going to believe this. The movements have all come back. All these movements in my fingers, in my elbow, in my wrist from 11 years ago, come flooding into my mind.

Speaker 2:          22:57          So is his pretend nails are now ungripping from his pretend palm. And the whole problem of the pretend pain goes away, goes away. That's what he said. For how long? By the way, till the middle was in place. But when Dr Ramachandran took away the mirrors, the pain came back.

Speaker 11:         23:17          I said, fine salary, you know, and then I said, look, why don't you practice with the mirror for the few weeks, every day for an hour? Then maybe if you do it repeatedly, you can unlearn the learned pain. So this guy goes home, I got him. You give him a mirror to take home? Correct. And you don't know if it was took $2 take it with you. So he takes it with him. He was delighted. And then after about another week, he phones me and he sounds all agitated on the phone and I said, what's going on? So talk, you're not going to believe this. It's gone. I said, what's going on? I thought maybe the mirror was gone. He said, no, no, not the mirror. The friend Tom has gone, gone, gone, go. That's what I said. Gone. Done. What do you mean fandom is going? You do it. Well, this phantom arm I been having for the last 11 years is disappeared. What am I, my initial reaction was alarm. I said, my God, does this bother you that if you said no, you know this has happened three days ago and in the last three days you remember the excruciating elbow pain and wrist pain? I got several times a day, but I don't have them any more because I don't have an arm.

Speaker 12:         24:21          Okay.

Speaker 11:         24:21          But my fingers,

Speaker 12:         24:25          okay.

Speaker 11:         24:25          They have not disappeared and they're still up here dangling near my shoulder. They're still painful. You mean just disconnected? Disembodied fingerlings yeah, finger looks dangling from the shoulder. What does that mean? This guy saying that he seems to have fingertips hanging on his shoulder. He said you a mirror doesn't work anymore, so can you redesign it and push it prophet near my nose so I can look at the reflection and maybe get, get rid of the fingers. So he now wants to get Dr Ramachandra in to prop up the mirror, point them at these phantom fingertips and have the mirror erase the fingertip. You thought I was a magician and I could, you know, eliminate his different body parts in sequence. And this is amputation by mirror? Yeah, it's, as I tell my medical colleagues jokingly, I say, this is the first example in the history of medicine of a successful amputation of a phantom limb, so don't leave me hanging here.
