00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.970
 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.830
Hello, I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.300
This is the second segment of a lecture
on the welfare theory of copyright.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.200
In this portion, I'll examine in
more detail how copyright law works--

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.670
specifically, how it functions from
the standpoint of the welfare theory.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.940
Along the way, I'll point out a few
of its advantages and disadvantages,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.750
again, viewed from the
standpoint of welfare.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.640
For this purpose, we'll be
using a slightly fictionalized

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.390
real-world example.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.370
Cambridge Documentary Films is a
small documentary filmmaking company.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.980
It's run by two people, Margaret
Lazarus and Renner Wunderlich.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.220
It's called Cambridge
Documentary Films because it

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.460
used to be based here, in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.820
But it's now housed in
Santa Barbara, California.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.590
Cambridge Documentary Films,
or as we will call them,

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.560
CDF, produces very high-quality,
short documentaries.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.000
One of those documentaries
is Defending Our lives.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.730
It's 30 minutes long.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.560
Its subject is the scourge
of domestic violence.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.470
Domestic violence is a phenomenon
that, as many of you know,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.340
is global in character.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.090
If anything, it's
increasing in severity.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.930
This film examines the subject by
talking with, doing interviews with,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.840
many of the women who've been
subjected to domestic violence.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.820
It won the Academy Award for
Short Documentary in 1993.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.990
Because of the continued
salience of the social problem

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.320
and the quality of the
film, demand for the film

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.560
remains sizable and fairly constant.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.580
And as a result, CDF continues
to sell copies of it.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.090
So that's the real-world case.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.830
We're going to use an adapted,
simplified version of that case

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.160
to explore the way in which
the copyright system works.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.720
First question-- suppose CDF wants
to make some money by distributing

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.160
copies of the film in DVD format.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.910
How much should CDF
charge for each copy?

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.340
To answer that question intelligently,
CDF would need some more information.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.780
I'm going to supply you hypothetical,
but reasonably realistic,

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.070
data of the sort they would need.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.950
For simplicity and clarity, I'm going
to present that information graphically.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.190
To those of you who've
studied some economics,

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.300
graphs of the sort you see on your
screen will surely be familiar to you.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.440
The x-axis, the horizontal
axis, represents quantity--

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.040
in this case, the quantity
of DVDs containing

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.480
the film Defending Our Lives.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.490
The vertical axis is
money-- we'll use dollars,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.340
but we could use any currency-- to
represent first the cost of those DVDs,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.070
and then the revenue that
they could generate for CDF.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.210
The first thing we'd
want to know in order

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.220
to determine how much CDF should charge
is the cost of producing the DVDs.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.420
CDF surely doesn't want to charge
less than the cost of generating them.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.660
So here are some numbers.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.680
It turns out that producing and
distributing a DVD is inexpensive.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.840
It costs approximately $1 to reproduce
the film in the physical disc,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.790
$0.90 to package it, and $0.80
to distribute it to customers.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.090
So roughly speaking, $2.70 is the cost
of making and distributing each copy

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.740
of the film.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.590
That cost doesn't vary much
with how many copies you make.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.530
Expressed graphically, this
means that the marginal cost

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.260
of producing DVD copies
of Defending Our Lives

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.930
is low and flat-- flat because it
doesn't change, as I indicated,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.630
materially as the total number of
copies produced increases or decreases.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.360
Now, this is not true of
all cultural products.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.550
With respect to some, there
are economies of scale,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.100
meaning that the marginal
cost of making copies of them

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.510
goes down the more you produce.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.300
There may be a few types
of cultural products,

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.970
though examples are hard
to think of, in which

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.370
the marginal cost of
making copies goes up

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.930
if the materials used to
produce them are scarce.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.690
But many, perhaps most, will
have marginal cost curves

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.020
that look roughly like
this, low and flat.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.640
 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.320
But this information actually
doesn't get us very far.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.100
As any business school professor will
tell you, the seller of a commodity

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.050
should be paying primary attention
when pricing that commodity not

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.560
to the cost of producing it, but to
what potential buyers of the commodity

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.280
are able and willing to pay.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.510
How would CDF get
information of that sort?

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.800
Perhaps through consumer surveys,
focus groups, or projections

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.860
on the basis of what
earlier films sold for.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.850
To keep things simple, we'll supply them
with the information they are seeking.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.980
If CDF set the price of
the DVDs up here, where

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.190
the red dot is located on the vertical
axis, a modest number of people

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.290
would pay for it each month.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.850
The high price would keep it out of
the hands of most potential customers.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.550
If, by contrast, it's
priced at a lower point,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.850
the number of people who
would purchase it is larger.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.690
Still lower price, still
larger a number of purchasers.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.080
And if CDF priced it
at 0-- in other words,

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.710
if they just gave the DVDs away--
this even larger number of people

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.130
would accept it and watch it each month.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.250
The number here is not
infinite, because not everyone

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.080
is interested in domestic violence.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.620
Put differently, there are other things
they'd rather do with their time.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.870
But as one might expect, the
total number of copies sold

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.270
would be greatest if the price were 0.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.980
 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.240
It will turn out to be
helpful to plot these pairings

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.250
on the two-dimensional
space of the graph.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.590
This is a representation of the
combination of price and quantity

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.960
associated with the red option.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.750
Here's the blue, and here's the green.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.340
Finally, yellow is already
marked at the bottom.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:47.850
When you connect up all these
dots, the result is a demand curve.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.380
To keep things simple, I've chosen
combinations of price and quantity

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.800
that would generate a straight
line, rather than a curve.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.050
In the real world, the shape of this
line would, of course, be more complex.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.760
But a simple straight line enables us
to illustrate the basic principles more

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.930
clearly.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.850
The demand curve, to repeat,
is merely the accumulation

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.700
of many observations of
the sort we just did;

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.260
namely, for any given price,
how many copies of the movie

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.000
could CDF sell each month.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.600
Having built the curve, we can
now remove the scaffolding.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.290
OK, so against this backdrop, what
should CDF charge for the DVDs?

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.750
In other words, where along this
curve should CDF position itself?

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.030
We'll try to answer that question first
in a hypothetical environment in which

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:40.460
copyright law does not exist, and
then in a hypothetical environment

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.420
in which copyright
protection is available.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.060
 

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.170
If copyright law does not
exist, then the CDF managers

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.830
will quickly recognize
that, sooner or later,

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.120
if they wish to sell
significant numbers of DVDs,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.050
they will have to set
the price very low.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.870
They could, of course, begin
by setting the price up here.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.420
The result will be that,
in the first month,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.790
they would sell a modest number of
copies and earn a fair amount of money.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.970
More specifically, they would
earn the amount of money

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:18.790
equal to the number of copies sold times
the price of each copy; in other words,

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.190
revenue equal to this area.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.130
But if they did this,
CDF would very quickly

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.770
face competition, because a rival
would purchase one of their copies

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:34.270
and then replicate it, selling
the knockoffs for a lower price.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.630
So let's suppose that this
occurs in month number two.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.990
By choosing this price,
the competitor would

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:42.870
sell a much larger number of DVDs.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.880
But even more seriously, it would
eliminate or largely undermine

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.580
the demand for the CDF
authorized version.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.870
CDF's market would more or less go away.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.200
So to respond, CDF would
be obliged, if they

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.370
wished to continue to sell
films at all, to lower

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.820
their price in the third month.

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.400
In the fourth month, the rival
would respond by lowering its price,

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.750
and CDF will be obliged
to lower its price,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.150
and so forth, until the price
of the copies of the film

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:20.610
fell all the way down to almost the
marginal cost of producing copies.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.150
The general point illustrated
by this simple sequence

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.950
is that, in the absence of
copyright, copying and competition

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:35.200
will drive the price down to
marginal cost or nearly so.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.310
In two related respects,
this is socially beneficial.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.450
Indeed, in most contexts,
antitrust law is

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.720
designed to generate
exactly this behavior.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.710
First, the total number of
DVDs produced and distributed

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.950
in this scenario is very large,
meaning that a lot of people

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.180
get the benefit of access to the film.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:10:01.260
Second, the consumer surplus generated
by this pricing pattern is very large.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.310
Consumer surplus is just
a term that represents

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.040
the difference between the
price that a given consumer pays

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.670
for the product and the
value of that product

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.970
to the consumer, measured most easily
by the maximum amount the consumer would

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.650
be willing to spend.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.660
A rough measure of the total surplus
generated by a particular marketing

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.640
practice is the area between
the demand curve, which

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.830
represents consumers'
willingness and ability to pay,

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.710
and the price of the
product; in other words,

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.700
the green zone in the
graph in front of you.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.020
So you might think, great, we hope
this scenario does indeed occur.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.380
The trouble is that the CDF
managers, anticipating this effect,

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.230
won't produce Defending Our
Lives in the first place,

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.120
because they will
recognize that they will

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.440
be unable even to recoup their costs.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.020
Or, perhaps more
realistically, they won't

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.630
make any more of their
wonderful films in the future.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.780
So the seemingly large
social benefits associated

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.230
with the absence of copyright
protection turn out, unfortunately,

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.480
to be illusory.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.240
Very few films will be produced
in this legal environment.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.897
 

00:11:15.897 --> 00:11:17.730
So wait a minute, you
may be thinking, won't

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.380
some of the alternative motivations
that are sources of revenue

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.630
for filmmakers that I discussed in
the first segment of this lecture

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.460
prompt CDF to keep making films?

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.330
Perhaps, for example, CDF
can get a government grant.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.160
Or perhaps private
philanthropists will come forward.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:36.860
Maybe.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.200
But for the time being, we're
focused exclusively on the incentives

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.460
that the copyright system can generate.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:47.830
So ignore for the moment the
possibility of other sources of funding.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:53.630
Returning to our story, the purpose of
copyright law is to avoid this outcome.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.890
How?

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.880
By suppressing competition in
the production and distribution

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.910
of embodiments of the creative work; in
this case, the film-- in other words,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.510
to eliminate CDF's rivals.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.690
If the managers enjoy protection
against competition, how, then,

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.240
will they price the film?

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.210
Well, if they have very good and
detailed information concerning

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.030
the ability and willingness to
pay of every individual customer,

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.020
plus the capacity to vary
the price of the DVDs,

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.910
then the managers will charge
each customer the maximum amount

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.070
that they can.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:37.400
So for example, if the managers know
that X is able and willing to spend PX,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.000
they will charge that much.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.335
If they know that Y is able and willing
to spend PY, they'll charge that much.

00:12:43.335 --> 00:12:47.240
If they know that Z is able and willing
to spend PZ, they'll charge that much.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.790
And the result is that they will
enjoy, the managers will enjoy,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:57.400
through this pricing strategy, monopoly
profits that occupy the same area

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:04.020
in our graph that, in the competitive
model, was devoted to consumer surplus.

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.500
From the standpoint of the CDF
managers, this, of course, is wonderful.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.090
It gives them a very large return
on their original investment.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.910
From a social welfare standpoint,
it's beneficial in two respects.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:21.060
The total output, meaning the number of
consumers who get copies of the film,

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.190
is maximized.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.430
And the prospect of these
large potential profits

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:30.370
will induce CDF to keep making the
films from which we all benefit

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:35.990
and will draw many other aspiring
documentary filmmakers into this field.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.100
On the other hand,
consumers are much less

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.990
happy with this outcome, because each
individual consumer has paid the most

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.730
that he or she would be willing to pay.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.270
The result-- the large
amount of consumer surplus,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.800
generated by the competitive
scenario, has been altogether

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.480
replaced here by producer surplus.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.860
In other words, all of the benefit
that, in the previous narrative,

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:05.060
was reaped by consumers in this
scenario goes to CDF, the producer.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.000
 

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.160
So what we've just illustrated
is profit-maximizing behavior

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.460
by a copyright owner who can
engage in so-called perfect price

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.250
discrimination-- in other
words, differentiate perfectly

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.500
among buyers-- charging
each one the maximum amount

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.740
that he or she would be willing to pay.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.310
Now, as you can imagine,
this never happens.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.860
Perfect price discrimination
is impossible.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.610
Later in this lecture series,
I'll discuss some circumstances

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:40.710
in which, aided by copyright law,
the producers of informational goods

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.850
can engage in imperfect forms
of price discrimination.

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:47.740
But for now, let's assume that CDF
doesn't have good information about

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:53.210
their consumers and thus cannot
and does not discriminate at all.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.800
In other words, we'll
assume that CDF will

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.305
charge the same price for
every copy of the DVD.

00:14:59.305 --> 00:15:02.240
 

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.990
OK, so now how much will
the managers charge?

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.040
Well, they might determine
the price by experimentation.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.890
Remember, the demand for
Defending Our Lives is stable.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.730
So the managers could experiment.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:19.430
In month one, they could
set the price at p.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.050
They discover that u
number of consumers buy it.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.870
They earn revenues of this amount.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.340
This zone is, of
course, the cost to them

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.450
of producing and distributing the DVDs.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.300
But that still leaves them
a quite generous profit.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.110
So they try an alternative approach.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:42.780
The next month, the managers lower
the price slightly to q, here.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:47.160
They discover that v number of
consumers buy it, a larger number,

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.150
not surprisingly, because
the price is lower.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.830
They make this much more
money in the second month,

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.430
because they've sold more copies.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.090
They forfeit this much
money, because they've

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.630
had to reduce the price for everyone.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.250
But notice that the purple zone
is larger than the orange zone.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:08.220
So it was a good idea to
have reduced the price.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.800
Put differently, the size of the
monopoly profits in the second month

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:18.270
is larger than the amount that
CDF enjoyed in the first month.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:21.530
Suppose that, encouraged by
this beneficial price reduction,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.910
the managers lower the price more
dramatically in the third month.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.790
An even larger number of people buy it.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:32.050
Again, the result is a revenue
gain that exceeds the revenue lost.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:37.090
Once again, the profits enjoyed are
larger than in the previous month.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.460
So the managers try
this strategy once more.

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.700
They reduce the price
of the DVD from r to z.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.090
An even larger number of people buy it.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:51.240
This time, the price reduction
turns out to have been a mistake.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.460
The revenue gained
through increased quantity

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:58.700
is smaller than the revenue lost
because of diminishing the price.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.980
What I've just outlined is
a possible experimental way

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.520
of discovering the profit-maximizing
price for copies of the film.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.359
Notice that the profit-maximizing
price, when it finally

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:17.569
emerges from this experimental process,
is still well above marginal cost,

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:23.770
but not as high as the managers might
initially have been inclined to charge.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.500
Now, let's change the
assumptions once more.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.710
Suppose that the CDF managers have
no practical way of differentiating

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:34.450
among individual consumers, but
on the basis of their experience

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.380
making and selling other
documentaries in the past,

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.170
they are able to estimate the
overall shape of the demand curve

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:43.770
for Defending Our Lives.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.780
If they knew that, then they can
determine the profit-maximizing price

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:52.290
in a less haphazard, less
trial-and-error fashion.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.450
They would do so by plotting
the marginal revenue curve.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.670
What's that?

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.920
It's a representation of the impact
on their total revenues caused

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.960
by each change in the price.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.370
Here's what it looks like.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.630
The reason why this curve drops
more steeply than the demand curve

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.520
is that, as we've seen,
each price decrease

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.320
benefits CDF by expanding the
set of people who purchase,

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.770
but also injures CDF by
forfeiting some of the profit

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:28.980
that CDF could've enjoyed by
targeting a smaller set of customers.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.090
So on the highly simplified
assumptions embodied in this graph,

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.710
the marginal revenue curve
will bisect the angle

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:41.590
between the demand curve
and the vertical y-axis.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.670
By plotting this line,
the CDF managers are

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:49.360
able to locate the place where the
marginal revenue and marginal cost

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.410
curves cross.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:54.410
They should then select
the price for their DVDs

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:59.800
that will reach a set of
consumers that, in turn, will

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:03.370
cause those curves to intersect.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.850
If they drop the price any
further, the marginal revenue

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.670
they gain through
additional purchases will

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:12.676
be less than the marginal cost
of producing the additional DVDs.

00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:16.820
If they increase the price, they
will forfeit in potential revenue

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.760
more money than they save in costs.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.110
So they should settle at this point.

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:30.858
If they do, the number of consumers who
purchase the DVD each month will be q.

00:19:30.858 --> 00:19:35.520
p on the graph is the corresponding
profit-maximizing price.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.300
And q is the profit-maximizing output.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.530
This strategy, to repeat,
will generate each month

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.020
profits measured by the blue zone.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.950
The strategy I've just
outlined will have

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:52.740
two crucial side effects-- one
of them good, the other one bad.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.030
The good one is that, unlike
perfect price discrimination, which

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.740
we discussed a minute ago, this
more familiar and feasible strategy

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.700
will leave many consumers happy.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:10.200
Specifically, the people who buy
the DVD at price P feel better off.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.590
Specifically, they
experience pleasure measured

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.870
by the difference
between what they paid--

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.350
that's price p-- and the
maximum amount that they

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.540
would have been willing to pay.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.740
The sum of all of the
benefits enjoyed by all

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.810
of the consumers who bought
the DVD-- in other words,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.670
the total consumer surplus--
is represented on the graph

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.910
by the green zone.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.270
The bad side effect is
that many of the people who

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.620
would have purchased the
film, had it been priced

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.990
at the actual cost of
making the copies, won't,

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.250
because they can't afford price p.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:50.220
The result is what economists refer to
as deadweight, a somewhat grim term.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.810
In this case, it refers to consumer
surplus that could have been gained,

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.100
but is sacrificed or foregone as a
result of the pricing strategy pursued

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.730
by CDF.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.480
So the green zone is
socially beneficial,

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.020
while the red zone is unfortunate.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.500
Why do we tolerate the red zone?

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.530
The conventional justification is
that films, like Defending Our Lives,

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:19.480
will only exist if potential
creators, like CDF, are attracted

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:24.970
by the opportunity to enjoy
profits, measured by the blue zone.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.820
In short, the red zone
is regrettable, but is

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:33.980
necessary to enable us to
reap the blue and green zones.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:38.420
That, in brief, is the core of
the justification and explanation

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:45.412
of the copyright system seen from
the standpoint of welfare theory.

00:21:45.412 --> 00:21:47.620
Now, those of you who are
economists have undoubtedly

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.690
recognized respects in which
this scheme is oversimplified.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:54.200
Some of those respects I'll address
in the remainder of this lecture.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.210
Others I'll examine in subsequent
lectures in this series.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.720
And still others I won't address at all.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.060
But this is enough to get us started.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.090
It's very important that
you feel comfortable

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.130
with the primary features
of this argument.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.520
To repeat one more time,
the heart of welfare theory

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.850
is the proposition that,
unless creators can

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:20.070
recoup the costs of their creations,
their so-called costs of expression,

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:24.120
they won't produce those
creations in the first instance.

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.730
And the way that the law enables them
to recoup their costs of expression

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:32.650
is to suppress competition
in the creation

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.550
and distribution of their works.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.520
The absence of competition,
in turn, enables the creators

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.800
to price copies of their
creations well above the costs

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.020
of making and distributing
them, which enables

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:50.090
the creators to reap monopoly profits.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.780
That still leaves consumers who are
able to purchase the goods better

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:57.730
off than before, but has
the unfortunate side effect

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:03.370
of pricing out of the market a
significant set of potential consumers.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:06.480
That's regrettable, but
we tolerate it in order

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.120
to stimulate creativity
in the first instance.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.004
 

00:23:13.004 --> 00:23:15.670
Some confirmation for this approach
can be gleaned from the fact

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.650
that actual pricing practices
in the film industry align

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:23.040
reasonably well with the
predictions generated by this model.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.786
Here, for example, is
the price on amazon.com

00:23:25.786 --> 00:23:30.260
of a DVD of Schindler's List,
which, like Defending Our Lives,

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.580
won an Academy Award in 1993.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.170
Like Defending Our
Lives, Schindler's List

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.400
remains popular, so there's
still considerable consumer

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.510
demand for copies of it.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.390
So how was it priced?

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.900
Well, as you can see,
the list price is $15.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.980
Amazon sells it for $10.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.610
As you'll recall, the
cost of producing a DVD,

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:57.480
including one containing
Schindler's List, is roughly $2.70.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.520
So P, on this graph, which, you'll
recall, emerged from our analysis

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:09.025
as the profit-maximizing price, is
more or less in the zone of $10 to $15.

00:24:09.025 --> 00:24:12.050
 

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:16.270
Now, interestingly, the film that we've
been discussing thus far, Defending

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.650
Our Lives, is not priced at $15.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.640
On the screen is the website
for Cambridge Documentary Films

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.220
from which you can purchase
the copies of the DVD.

00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:33.710
Enlarging it a bit, you can see
that CDF is selling it for $175.

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:38.170
That's hard to explain on the basis of
the analysis we've conducted thus far.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:44.180
It would seem that CDF has chosen
to set the price way up here.

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:49.920
A price this high will earn
CDF some monopoly profits.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:54.320
But the CDF managers seem to be
forfeiting a large potential market.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.820
So why do they do this?

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.490
A clue is provided by their website,
which indicates, as you can see,

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:07.190
that the prices of their DVDs
include public performance rights.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.440
To understand the significance
of that statement,

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.160
I need to provide you a
preview of some material

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.610
that we'll discuss in much more detail
in lectures number seven and number

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.580
eight.

00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.430
When you buy a DVD, you're permitted
to do a lot of things with it,

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:25.500
including, of course, watch it at
home in your living room or den.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.740
But you're not permitted
to use that DVD to display

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.370
the film on a screen in a public place.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:35.050
The reason is that the owner
of the copyright in the film

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:40.470
enjoys, among other rights, the
exclusive right to perform it publicly.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:43.140
Your ownership of a
copy of the DVD does not

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.800
authorize you to encroach upon the
copyright owner's public performance

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.860
right.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.230
So if you want to show it to people
other than your family and friends,

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.850
you have to get a
separate license to do so.

00:25:54.850 --> 00:26:01.650
So what CDF is doing here is selling a
bundle of two things-- a physical DVD

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.340
and a separate public
performance license.

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:08.770
The latter is worth much
more than the former.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:13.810
Another inference we can draw from
this somewhat unusual pricing strategy

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.060
is that the customers that
CDF has primarily in mind

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.660
are not ordinary consumers,
people who buy DVDs in order

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.210
to play them on
televisions in their dens.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.700
Rather, the CDF managers
are aiming primarily

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:32.130
at teachers or institutions that want to
educate people about domestic violence.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:36.060
Put slightly differently, it seems that
there are two quite different markets

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:42.410
for Defending Our Lives-- regular
consumers and institutions.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:47.890
To represent the two markets, I have to
adjust the graph that I've been using,

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:53.210
first by shrinking it and
then by expanding the scales.

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:55.730
The institutional market
for Defending Our Lives

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.670
would then look something like
this, while the market consisting

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.760
of ordinary consumers
would look like this.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.030
Why is the demand curve for
the former so high and steep?

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:11.070
Because the institutions anticipate
showing it to lots of people

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:14.350
repeatedly in educational settings.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.500
And at least some of those
institutions are thus

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:20.880
able and willing to spend quite
a bit for that opportunity.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.940
Individual consumers, by contrast, are
able and willing to spend much less.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:33.610
If CDF's customers are clumped this
way, then CDF's pricing practice

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:35.850
makes a lot more sense.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.860
The managers are setting
the price way up here.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.760
They are, to be sure,
forfeiting a significant number

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:43.390
of potential consumers.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.400
But this price is indeed
profit-maximizing.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.210
 

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.500
Now, there's a nuance lurking here.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.300
Why don't the managers
separate the two markets

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:57.220
and charge the two sorts of
customers different amounts?

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:02.470
That would represent a form of price
discrimination, not the perfect price

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:07.330
discrimination of the sort we considered
before, but imperfect discrimination.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.490
it would not be as lucrative
as perfect discrimination,

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:16.840
but it would generate higher
profits than flat pricing.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.130
Indeed, my brief discussion a few
minutes ago of public performance

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:24.100
rights may alert you to one way in which
the CDF managers could separate the two

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.230
markets.

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:29.810
They could offer the DVDs with public
performance rights for one price,

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:35.960
$175, and then DVDs without such public
performance rights for much less,

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.860
say $10.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.030
Not only would that practice
currency df more money

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.510
you would also be socially beneficial
because more people would have access

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:47.940
to the film.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:51.320
So why don't the CDF managers do this?

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.060
The most likely explanation
is unenforceability.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.080
Even though copyright
law, on its face, seems

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.420
to give them the power to
differentiate prices in the two markets

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.490
by granting to some buyers
public performance rights

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:09.300
and denying those rights
to others, in practice,

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:13.340
CDF could not detect and punish
violations of their public performance

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:19.900
rights by institutions that
purchase the plain DVDs.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.870
Anticipating this, some teachers would
buy the inexpensive, plain copies

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:29.390
and then unlawfully perform
them for their classes.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:34.280
And the result would be to
corrode CDF's high-end market.

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.440
The result in loss of
revenue would exceed the gain

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:41.800
that CDF gets for making the simple
DVDs available to non-teachers.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.400
 

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.210
Several important themes
lurk in this last example--

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.500
the merits and demerits
of price discrimination,

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:55.700
the marketing possibilities created
by the various exclusive rights held

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:59.360
by a copyright owner,
and the limitations

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.920
on those options created
by the difficulty

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.730
in some settings of
enforcing copyrights.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:12.280
We'll return to all of these
themes later in the course.

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.070
This concludes our initial exploration
of the welfare theory of copyright.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.280
In the third and final
segment of this lecture,

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.400
I'll discuss a few applications and
refinements of the welfare approach

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.690
and then step back from
the details and ask you,

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:33.010
through these lenses, what are the
strengths and weaknesses of copyright.
