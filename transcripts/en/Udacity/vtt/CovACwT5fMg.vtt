Let's start with a fun quiz to get you warmed up. You may have heard the term

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.170
virtualization in different contexts. Memory systems,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.222
data centers, JVM, virtual box, IBM VM/370,

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:21.300
Google Glass, cloud computing, dalvik, VMware

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.270
workstation And even the movie Inception. What I want you to do select

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.130
all the context in which you've heard the term. There is

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.240
no right answer for this and in fact there are several

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.240
that might fit into this. Go ahead and pick the choices

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.570
that you think jogs your memory when you hear the term virtualization.
