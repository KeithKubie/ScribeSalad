00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.980
Note that like in any analysis process, the conclusions that we reach are always

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.550
tentative. As we engage in the process, we learn more about the problem,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.390
which may lead to revisions of our analysis. In fact, it was one of the early

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.030
lessons of software engineering, is that requirements documents are always wrong

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.010
in the sense that they're incomplete, or inconsistent, or they don't truly

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.690
reflect what it is that the customer ultimately wants. And as an analyst it's

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.380
your job to elicit that correct description. And OOA can help you do that.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.860
Questions that arise during OOA may require research on your part,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.290
or even going back to the customers. Often, the customers may not have even

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.240
considered, what you, what you bring up as a question. And will thank you for

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.190
realizing that there was more to the problem than what they originally had in my

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.630
mind. Thus, the overall process of analysis is inherently incremental,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.760
hopefully leading to a joint understanding between the analyst and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.240
customer so that the design and implementation can proceed
