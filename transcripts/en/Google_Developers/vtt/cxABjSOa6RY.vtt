00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.420
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Welcome to "Assistant on Air."

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.003
We have conversations
with people that

00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:10.260
build for Google Assistant.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.560
I'm Jessica Dene Early-Cha.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.900
And I'll be your host today.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.860
I'm a developer advocate
for Actions on Google,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.370
which means I create content
to teach developers on how

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.810
to build for Actions on Google.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.120
And I get their feedback to
make the platform better.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.830
Today, we'll be
chatting with Dan Myers.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.520
Welcome, Dan.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.850
DAN MYERS: Thanks.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.610
Glad to be here.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.950
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: So
what do you do here at Google?

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.660
DAN MYERS: So I'm a developer
advocate on the Google

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.090
Assistant and Actions on
Google developer platform

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.210
team where I work
specifically on smart home.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.810
So controlling and
automating your house

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.060
using different IoT devices
through Google Assistant.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.643
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Oh, that
sounds like such a cool, cool

00:00:41.643 --> 00:00:42.290
space to be in.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.730
And so the only
smart thing I really

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.610
know about and that I use
everyday is my lights.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.680
So can you go in more
into detail about what's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.520
happening there?

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.437
DAN MYERS: Absolutely.

00:00:51.437 --> 00:00:56.910
So when you are developing
any type of smart device

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.880
with Google Assistant,
there's a specific flow

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.050
that you have to go through.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.330
So when a user says a command
or says a different phrase

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.210
to control their light,
what's actually happening

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.310
there is the Google
Home or Google Home

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.910
Mini is taking in the audio.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.860
It sends this up
to Google's cloud

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.790
for processing the natural
language understanding engine.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.570
At that point it actually
goes to a partners cloud

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.080
for who that device is.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.340
So for example, if it was a
Philips Hue light bulb, right?

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.560
It would actually be going
to the Philips cloud service

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.220
with a specific
structure of JSON

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.240
that matches the intent
of what the user said.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.400
So if they said,
"turn on my light,"

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.980
there's a specific
structure in JSON

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.350
that is sent to
Philips Hue servers.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.700
And Philips then takes that
and processes that information

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.650
and sends it back down
to the light bulb.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.590
So it's all done through Wi-Fi
and internet connectivity.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.890
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
And that sounds awesome.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.348
So what happens if
I'm a developer,

00:02:01.348 --> 00:02:03.300
and I have my own
thing that I want

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.740
to connect my Google Assistant?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.520
Is that possible?

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.280
DAN MYERS: It is.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.780
It is.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.930
So we have a variety
of tools for developing

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.670
your own smart devices,
both in Node.js and Java.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.710
All of these different
libraries come

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.710
with samples, come with
tutorials on how to build it.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.820
And so when
developing for those,

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.220
we have a list of
different device types

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.785
and a lot of different elements
for this when developing.

00:02:29.785 --> 00:02:31.410
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
So I'm assuming

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.952
because you said "device types,"
does those device types mean

00:02:33.952 --> 00:02:36.202
that there's different
functionalities for each device

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:37.080
that's possible?

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.950
DAN MYERS: Yes.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.570
So the device type itself
defines what type of icon

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.868
might show up in different
applications, things like that.

00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:47.160
And then there's device traits.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.590
And the device trait
is what actually

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.590
is used to define the
capabilities of that device.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.070
So when you think
of a smart light,

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.010
you could have a light bulb
that can turn on and off.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.380
You might have one that can dim.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.780
You might also have one
that can change colors.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.370
And so-- or you could even
have one that does all three.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.870
Right?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.080
And so each of those are
defined in different traits

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.220
within the smart home
library and given to Google

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.523
during the sync process.

00:03:17.523 --> 00:03:19.440
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
So if I'm a developer,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.080
and I'm building my own,
I'm doing my own thing,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.132
do I have to worry about
anything outside of just

00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:27.090
the functionality and
seeing the functionality?

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.800
Or do I still have
to worry about how

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.690
users might ask for this?

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.492
Like, how to work with my device
I've just made or connected to?

00:03:33.492 --> 00:03:34.200
DAN MYERS: Right.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.120
This is the beautiful
part of Google Assistant

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.510
for smart home is that
Google Assistant handles

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.030
that natural language
understanding for you.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.170
So as long as you have all of
those capabilities defined,

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.530
Google Assistant is able
to take that and apply

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.540
literally the infinite
number of phrases

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.000
that people can say to
control that capability.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.500
So anything from "turn down
the lights just a little bit,"

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.810
right, to, "make it 50%
less bright in the room."

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.310
Right.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.490
It's able to understand these
different kinds of phrases

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.157
and be able to control
it appropriately.

00:04:07.157 --> 00:04:09.073
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
Oh, that sounds great.

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:10.720
For me, that just
means as a developer,

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.090
I can focus on my
own thing and not

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.140
have to worry about all that.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.410
Because that's a
lot of overhead.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.030
DAN MYERS: Absolutely.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.905
And that's-- I mean,
when you talk about NLU,

00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:18.448
that's a whole
other nut to crack.

00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:19.740
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: No, no.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.240
Definitely.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.019
So if I am--

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:22.530
I'm excited.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.330
I'm watching this video.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.413
What's the first thing I
should do as a developer?

00:04:25.413 --> 00:04:26.640
I want to get on-boarded.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.590
Is there something I
should go to first?

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.780
DAN MYERS: My approach
would be to instantly go

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.860
to the code lab.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.500
The code lab is a
complete walkthrough

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.190
of every aspect from
setting up your Google Cloud

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.580
project to setting
up on the Actions

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.720
on Google console to
setting up your Firestore.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.960
Every aspect of developing
a smart washing machine.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.007
So you get to see exactly what
goes into a process like that.

00:04:53.007 --> 00:04:54.840
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA:
That sounds awesome.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.430
Well, thank you, Dan, so
much for hanging out with me

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.810
and chatting with me.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.850
I really appreciate it.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.240
DAN MYERS: Thank you.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.540
JESSICA DENE EARLY-CHA: Thanks.
