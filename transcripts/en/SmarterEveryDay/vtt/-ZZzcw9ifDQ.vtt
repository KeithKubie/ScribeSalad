00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.040
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So you're probably

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.090
wondering, if you've been watching the amazon series how I took an ink pen, a little scrap

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.120
of paper and a camera into the middle of the jungle and walked out with footage of

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.140
ants carrying a little sign that says Smarter Every Day. It's actually pretty simple,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.190
and gross. You pee on the paper. I know,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.210
sounds a little weird, but you gotta realise that leaf cutter ants forage for sodium.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.240
But before I show you how exactly we did this and you get to see us make the video

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.280
I want to show you a leaf cutter ant colony during the daytime, and then we'll go

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.320
back and check out the same colony at night. You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
This whole area is a colony? Is that what you call it?

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.400
- Yep, um these colonies are known to just, be giants. They're farming ants so they take in

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.460
those leaves they grow fungus on so they have to tend to that fungus very very regularly.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.500
So the smaller ones, they really ride on the leaf,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.540
and they clean the leaf, and they also protect the carrying ant

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.580
from any decapitating flies that are in the area.
- Really?

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.630
-Yep.
(Destin) They clean the leaf on the way to the colony?

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.660
- Yeah so one guy's, like a bigger and will be carrying it, and a little cleaner ant will be on top

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.750
there protecting it and cleaning it from any fungus or any crazy stuff

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.800
that may be on the leaf.
- Awesome.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.840
- There are millions of ants inside this colony, so this is one of several entrances,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.870
probably one of their main highways that they use to go and collect leaves.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.890
(Destin) I'm also told they have one of the most complex social structures. Is that true?

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.940
- Yeah. Um, I mean down to the finest of details. Even like

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.960
the ants that go out and cut, once they get old, maybe like

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.990
three months old and they can't cut as well, then they become carrying ants.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.010
So they kind of retire as a leaf cutter and then they become a leaf carrier.
- These are leaf cutter

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.060
ant trails. They look like people trails but they're not. One way

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.090
you can tell is if you get really close you see next to them, you see all the

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.130
little cut leaves.
- Um so you can see some of them are starting to come out

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.170
a little bit, so I bet you if we came back in a few hours, they would

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.190
have come out and go for the trees.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.200
[Rainforest sounds]

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.240
(Destin) So what we're gonna do, is we're gonna cut out

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.280
little pieces of paper, and we're gonna put some

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.330
salty liquid onto a

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.360
piece of paper. We're thinking that it will entice them

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.380
but, we're gonna find out. Put your headlamp on the leaf.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.390
[Peeing sound]
- There you go. [laugh]

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.400
- The sound of science ladies and gentlemen. [laugh]
- There you go. So what do you want to do first?

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.430
- I've got the worst Smarter Every Day one,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.470
and I got it wet on the back side so it doesn't quite...

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.500
- Alright, so it doesn't bleed.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.600
[laugh]
- Let's try this.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.720
- You want pliers?

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.750
- What do we need?

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.790
- That's probably it.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.820
- I wonder if we need a... bigger, can we make it bigger?

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.880
- [whispered] Oh man, focus wasn't perfect.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.000
So that's it. That's how you get leaf cutter ants to carry your sign.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.050
Special thanks to Mr Torres here.
- Of course.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.080
- Entymologist. He's the guy that came up with the idea. Worked well. Alright, that's it.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.130
Getting Smarter Every Day.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.150
These guys aren't playing nice any more.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.200
Going to my base.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.210
So this one's too big

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.240
So of course leaf cutter ants are cutting it,

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.250
which is still pretty cool. Found him.

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.270
Yep, he's about 20 yards away.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.280
