00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:36.000
The people most affected by the negative aspects of it are the poor and the powerless – which in America,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.500
by and far, are the people of color, are black people.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:28.620
1,500 feet. Right beyond those trees is the plant.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.240
How far away is this elementary school from the plant?

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.260
being bombarded with that, some of them, 24 hours a day.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.060
still a majority-black school today. The
school has levels of chloroprene that are

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.780
A large percentage of these students live right here as well, so these kids are

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.820
400 times higher than what the EPA says
is safe to breathe.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:54.320
Robert went to school here in the late
50's, early 60's, during segregation. It's

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.610
This school is a big point of contention.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.120
We have the Fifth Ward School right there, with the lower elementary being really, really exposed.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.540
Yes. It is totally undeniable that the link is there.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.020
In your opinion, is it undeniable that it's linked [to cancer]?

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.680
well as leukemia, heart and reproductive problems.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.370
absorbed through the skin, and is linked
to liver, kidney, and digestive cancers, as

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.720
pungent smell. The chemical enters the
body when it's breathed in, ingested or

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.560
Chloroprene is released into the air during its production process. It can't be seen, but does give off a

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.920
This is the only community exposed to chloroprene at these high concentrations in the whole United States.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.440
DuPont operated the plant until Denka took it over in 2015, keeping on almost all of the facility's employees.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.060
LaPlace-Reserve area for 49 years, and
releasing it into the air.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.400
Everybody's been exposed for a very, very long time. DuPont has been making chloroprene here in

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.840
They hold regular meetings to fill the
town in on what's going on.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.360
Robert teamed up with Wilma Subra, a chemist who is doing pro bono scientific analysis for the community.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:30.300
look what I've got to go through. Look what I'm up against, just trying to come and visit with them.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:21.300
My mom and my dad in there. Brothers and sisters, uncles, aunts, my grandfather, but

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.540
with Robert. Petrochemical companies on
all of the surrounding land.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.500
This is the cemetery. Across
the tracks, this is where I was standing

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:03.260
I have to visit from here. I can’t go on that property, I can’t even walk across to go into the cemetery.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.260
So you have to visit from here?

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.900
relatives, who mostly died of cancers
linked to the emissions.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.420
All of our ancestors here now are covered by this monstrosity here.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.220
neighborhood now is this cemetery, which
is ironically filled with Robert's

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.710
Mississippi River, highways and railroads.
All that's left of Robert's childhood

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.880
companies have bought out much of the
town because of its proximity to the

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.790
sugarcane fields. The sugar company
closed in 1985, and now petrochemical

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.320
Reserve was once a thriving black community post-World War II. Robert's parents and many others were

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.330
drawn to work in the large sugar
refinery or farming the surrounding

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.200
we're still deep in slavery in America.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.000
The methodologies and whatnot changed, but the effect and all of this is still the same,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.380
that the powers that be have toward black
people has not changed since slavery.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.500
We don't even have a swimming pool in the black community. The predatory attitude

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:50.120
in wetsuits and laptop covers. It's more
of a product that's made for people's recreation.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.840
Well, that's a that's a part
of that humiliation that we suffer.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.020
which makes chloroprene, a chemical the
EPA says is a likely carcinogen.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.540
I think the ignitions need to stop. I don't think that human life should be subject to a profit motive.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.720
What chloroprene goes to
make is the neoprene material that goes

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.220
large chemical plant a few blocks from
his house. It's the only plant in the U.S.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.120
He's currently in a legal battle against a

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.780
it was a next-door neighbor and the people down the street.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.220
son died of lung cancer. My wife got it.  My daughter. When it wasn't close relatives,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.620
Robert Taylor has lived here all his
life. And he's surprised he's made it to the age of 77.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.760
My mother got cancer. My
brother died of lung cancer. My sister's

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.520
poor and black, with extremely high rates
of sickness and suffering.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.680
We're in what's known as Cancer Alley in Louisiana, an area between New Orleans and Baton Rouge

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.170
But we know that people in this little
town are suffering at a cancer rate

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.050
lined with petrochemical plants and
refineries. Most of the towns here are

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.540
that's 700 to 800 times that of the nation.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.360
Welcome to Reserve, Louisiana. This is
the cancer capital of the United States.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:14.300
cancer and realize the suffering that they're going through. And to realize that you could be next.

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:08.880
that’s where our power will be. We’ll exercise political power. That’s where our hope lies.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:50.820
What I get from them since I’ve been involved is just a sense of helplessness, powerlessness. How can we

00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.670
Something is here, killing us. It's a
terrible thing to watch people die of

00:05:50.829 --> 00:06:00.149
fight these powerful, rich organizations? Once we can get enough people to join with us,
