for as tiny value as it gets for the
 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.860
for as tiny value as it gets for the

that do that and if you start with those

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:52.690
that do that and if you start with those
 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.440
that do that and if you start with those
markets it's gonna be much easier to

markets it's gonna be much easier to
 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.300
markets it's gonna be much easier to
scale globally so this has a couple of

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:57.310
scale globally so this has a couple of
 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.270
scale globally so this has a couple of
key takeaways I guess we'll discuss more

00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280
key takeaways I guess we'll discuss more
 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.560

thanks to Google wonderful thank you
thank you so much

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:05.480
 

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.800
all right so one of the first questions

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:09.810
all right so one of the first questions
 

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:12.560
all right so one of the first questions
that we get from developers is okay yeah

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:12.570
that we get from developers is okay yeah
 

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.210
that we get from developers is okay yeah
emerging markets that's great but where

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220
emerging markets that's great but where
 

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.820
emerging markets that's great but where
do we start where do we go to for you

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:16.830
do we start where do we go to for you
 

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.740
do we start where do we go to for you
what was the decision factor to go after

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:18.750
what was the decision factor to go after
 

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.810
what was the decision factor to go after
these specific markets other than a

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:20.820
these specific markets other than a
 

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.850
these specific markets other than a
personal interest and just visiting

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860
personal interest and just visiting
 

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:28.010
personal interest and just visiting
those markets I guess we saw a lot of

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020
those markets I guess we saw a lot of
 

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.070
those markets I guess we saw a lot of
user growth in in India because of the

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080
user growth in in India because of the
 

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.350
user growth in in India because of the
the the change in the data providers and

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360
the the change in the data providers and
 

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.980
the the change in the data providers and
you know whenever we see you know users

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:36.990
you know whenever we see you know users
 

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.630
you know whenever we see you know users
growing that dramatically then you just

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640
growing that dramatically then you just
 

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.430
growing that dramatically then you just
pay attention to it naturally we've all

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440
pay attention to it naturally we've all
 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.140
pay attention to it naturally we've all
got our analytics dashboards we can all

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.150
got our analytics dashboards we can all
 

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.880
got our analytics dashboards we can all
see what's lighting up and and what's

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:43.890
see what's lighting up and and what's
 

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.860
see what's lighting up and and what's
growing and so then you just kind of

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:45.870
growing and so then you just kind of
 

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.490
growing and so then you just kind of
naturally make that choice I have seen

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500
naturally make that choice I have seen
 

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.620
naturally make that choice I have seen
from others and for us you know

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:51.630
from others and for us you know
 

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.270
from others and for us you know
especially for us amia based developers

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:53.280
especially for us amia based developers
 

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.640

home is a little easier as well so kind
 

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.560
home is a little easier as well so kind
of concentrate on but you know for us it

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:00.570
of concentrate on but you know for us it
 

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.370
of concentrate on but you know for us it
was the fact that we saw audience growth

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:04.380
was the fact that we saw audience growth
 

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.250
was the fact that we saw audience growth
in India as I'm sure many people have

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.260
in India as I'm sure many people have
 

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.780
in India as I'm sure many people have
seen across other emerging markets we've

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:08.790
seen across other emerging markets we've
 

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.580
seen across other emerging markets we've
also seen that growth in Brazil which is

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:10.590
also seen that growth in Brazil which is
 

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.020
also seen that growth in Brazil which is
why we're concentrating on Brazil as

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:12.030
why we're concentrating on Brazil as

grown organically so far and I mean

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800
grown organically so far and I mean
 

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.350

language learning is something that

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:33.360
language learning is something that
 

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.510
language learning is something that
people in almost every single country

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:35.520
people in almost every single country
 

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.160

on so many different regions and areas

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.150
on so many different regions and areas
 

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.040
on so many different regions and areas
but for us it was one thing was sort of

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.050
but for us it was one thing was sort of
 

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.560
but for us it was one thing was sort of
organic chem new user numbers that we

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:48.570
organic chem new user numbers that we
 

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.260
organic chem new user numbers that we
obviously monitored but not less

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:51.270
obviously monitored but not less
 

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.880
obviously monitored but not less
significant factor was actually

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:52.890
significant factor was actually
 

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.180
significant factor was actually
subscriber user base so we we started

00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.190
subscriber user base so we we started
 

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.760
subscriber user base so we we started
seeing trends where it was easier for us

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:58.770
seeing trends where it was easier for us
 

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.730
seeing trends where it was easier for us
to convert people and to to make them

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740
to convert people and to to make them
 

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.820
to convert people and to to make them
memorize subscribers and we actually

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:04.830
memorize subscribers and we actually
 

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.200
memorize subscribers and we actually
then saw that okay if there is already

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.210
then saw that okay if there is already
 

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.660
then saw that okay if there is already
organic interest then what can we do to

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:08.670
organic interest then what can we do to
 

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.850
organic interest then what can we do to
actually improve the value proposition

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860
actually improve the value proposition
 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.310
actually improve the value proposition
and offering so that more people from

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320
and offering so that more people from
 

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.320
and offering so that more people from
these countries have a reason to use our

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:15.330
these countries have a reason to use our
 

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.220
these countries have a reason to use our
app and

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:16.230
app and
 

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.730
app and
and their languages well even though we

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:19.740
and their languages well even though we
 

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.100
and their languages well even though we
started with us as the global launch

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:22.110
started with us as the global launch
 

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.860
started with us as the global launch
market we figured out that based on the

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:24.870
market we figured out that based on the
 

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.470
market we figured out that based on the
number of youtube uploads the game

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480
number of youtube uploads the game
 

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.260
number of youtube uploads the game
resonates well with variety of north

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:30.270
resonates well with variety of north
 

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.780
resonates well with variety of north
markets so we had to tackle that we went

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:32.790
markets so we had to tackle that we went
 

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.750
markets so we had to tackle that we went
to Google Play team talk about those

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760
to Google Play team talk about those
 

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.870
to Google Play team talk about those
markets went to local playtime events

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880
markets went to local playtime events
 

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.550
markets went to local playtime events
learned more about it worked with local

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560
learned more about it worked with local
 

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.760
learned more about it worked with local
creators so it was more of a discovery

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:43.770
creators so it was more of a discovery
 

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.940
creators so it was more of a discovery
process where do we put our efforts into

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:46.950
process where do we put our efforts into
 

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.430
process where do we put our efforts into
and especially like just optimizing for

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440
and especially like just optimizing for
 

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.800
and especially like just optimizing for
those for some of those markets it might

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:51.810
those for some of those markets it might
 

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.440
those for some of those markets it might
not be really self explaining so it was

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:54.450
not be really self explaining so it was
 

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.260
not be really self explaining so it was
quite a learning curve but once we got a

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:57.270
quite a learning curve but once we got a
 

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.150
quite a learning curve but once we got a
couple of first countries in it get

00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160
couple of first countries in it get
 

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.510
couple of first countries in it get
easier so now I think if if we look at

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:02.520
easier so now I think if if we look at
 

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.810
easier so now I think if if we look at
eight top eight countries seven of them

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820
eight top eight countries seven of them
 

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.330
eight top eight countries seven of them

growth somewhere you decide you want to
go after a market and you know typically

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200
go after a market and you know typically

go after a market and you know typically
one of the things we advise our

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:17.850
one of the things we advise our
 

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.880
one of the things we advise our
developers is to actually localize for

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:19.890
developers is to actually localize for
 

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.100
developers is to actually localize for
those markets but localization can be a

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.110
those markets but localization can be a
 

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.590
those markets but localization can be a
quite broad spectrum right from just

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600
quite broad spectrum right from just
 

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.560
quite broad spectrum right from just
translating text in game to all the way

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:27.570
translating text in game to all the way
 

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.660
translating text in game to all the way
to actually you know customizing

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:29.670

experience for different markets how do

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:33.390
experience for different markets how do

you decide where do you want to be on

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:35.250
you decide where do you want to be on

you decide where do you want to be on
that spectrum well we I mean we we take

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420
that spectrum well we I mean we we take
 

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.510
that spectrum well we I mean we we take
a we take an approach when we build the

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:41.520
a we take an approach when we build the
 

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.190
a we take an approach when we build the
games to try and reach the biggest

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.200
games to try and reach the biggest
 

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.160
games to try and reach the biggest
audience possible so I mean for pool for

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.170
audience possible so I mean for pool for
 

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.320
audience possible so I mean for pool for
instance everyone asks us what do you do

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.330
instance everyone asks us what do you do
 

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.910
instance everyone asks us what do you do
to culture lives or localize the game

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920
to culture lives or localize the game
 

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.220
to culture lives or localize the game
apart from strings I mean it's not much

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:52.230

that's the game and if you don't know if

00:11:59.330 --> 00:11:59.340
that's the game and if you don't know if
 

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.890

that's going to be a difficult thing so

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:06.750
that's going to be a difficult thing so
 

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.810
that's going to be a difficult thing so
I think it's a bit unfair to ask us if

German and Russian so there's no point

00:14:07.759 --> 00:14:07.769
German and Russian so there's no point
 

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:10.429
German and Russian so there's no point
in prioritizing Brazilian Portuguese or

00:14:10.429 --> 00:14:10.439
in prioritizing Brazilian Portuguese or
 

00:14:10.439 --> 00:14:15.169
in prioritizing Brazilian Portuguese or
or Spanish for them in order to actually

or Spanish for them in order to actually
 

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:18.650
or Spanish for them in order to actually
be super relevant and then also pricing

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660
be super relevant and then also pricing
 

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.799

I think localized pricing is something

00:14:21.799 --> 00:14:21.809
I think localized pricing is something
 

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:24.139
I think localized pricing is something
that has really unlocked opportunities

00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:24.149
that has really unlocked opportunities
 

00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:26.299
that has really unlocked opportunities
in different countries and where it can

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:26.309
in different countries and where it can
 

00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:30.859
in different countries and where it can
make a big difference whether you you

00:14:30.859 --> 00:14:30.869
make a big difference whether you you
 

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:32.559
make a big difference whether you you
get sort of half a percentage of people

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:32.569
get sort of half a percentage of people
 

00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:36.230
get sort of half a percentage of people
to pay versus a few percentages of

to pay versus a few percentages of
 

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.409
to pay versus a few percentages of
people to pay so there are different

00:14:39.409 --> 00:14:39.419
people to pay so there are different
 

00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:40.819
people to pay so there are different
things to look at different stages of

00:14:40.819 --> 00:14:40.829
things to look at different stages of
 

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:41.870

January we ran one of the global events

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160
January we ran one of the global events
 

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.210
January we ran one of the global events
which was the Lunar New Year and it was

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220
which was the Lunar New Year and it was
 

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.980
which was the Lunar New Year and it was
kind of counterintuitive for us as a

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:54.990
kind of counterintuitive for us as a
 

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.250
kind of counterintuitive for us as a
local event that was launched globally

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:57.260
local event that was launched globally
 

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:02.570
local event that was launched globally
has performed as well as Christmas or

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:02.580
has performed as well as Christmas or
 

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.740
has performed as well as Christmas or
something like that in US but globally

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:03.750
something like that in US but globally
 

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.430
something like that in US but globally
so Lunar New Year was accepted by

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440
so Lunar New Year was accepted by
 

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.370
so Lunar New Year was accepted by
everyone across the world so since then

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:09.380
everyone across the world so since then
 

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.350
everyone across the world so since then
every single local event we tried to

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:12.360
every single local event we tried to
 

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.970
every single local event we tried to
launch the globally would try to see how

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980
launch the globally would try to see how
 

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.340
launch the globally would try to see how
that works like nowadays like we

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:16.350
that works like nowadays like we
 

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.140
that works like nowadays like we
recently rolled out local content for

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.150
recently rolled out local content for
 

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.790
recently rolled out local content for
India and it was well-received and I

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800
India and it was well-received and I
 

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.290
India and it was well-received and I
think it's just because of the

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:24.300
think it's just because of the
 

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.260
think it's just because of the
collectible nature of things inside our

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:27.270
collectible nature of things inside our
 

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.260
collectible nature of things inside our
game people just want to try all of that

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:30.270
game people just want to try all of that
 

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.940
game people just want to try all of that
and they want to have all the costumes

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:31.950
and they want to have all the costumes
 

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.010
and they want to have all the costumes
all of the suits and want to try it all

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.020
all of the suits and want to try it all
 

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:36.980
all of the suits and want to try it all
so I think what it might work in

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:36.990
so I think what it might work in
 

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:38.180
so I think what it might work in
different ways for different types of

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:38.190
different ways for different types of
 

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:40.280
different ways for different types of
games so you have to try different

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.290
games so you have to try different
 

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.000
games so you have to try different
strategies so one of the things that you

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.010
strategies so one of the things that you
 

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.530
strategies so one of the things that you
obviously know is that purchasing power

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540
obviously know is that purchasing power
 

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:48.320
obviously know is that purchasing power
varies between you know Tier one mature

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:48.330
varies between you know Tier one mature
 

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:51.680
varies between you know Tier one mature
markets compared to emerging markets how

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:51.690
markets compared to emerging markets how
 

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:52.940
markets compared to emerging markets how
do you cater for that how have you

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:52.950
do you cater for that how have you
 

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:54.380
do you cater for that how have you
thought about pricing when you've gone

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:54.390
thought about pricing when you've gone
 

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:59.300
thought about pricing when you've gone
actually after after emerging markets so

00:15:59.300 --> 00:15:59.310
actually after after emerging markets so
 

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.300
actually after after emerging markets so
we we the first thing we have looked at

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.310
we we the first thing we have looked at
 

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:06.230
we we the first thing we have looked at
and tested quite a bit as well as to had

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240
and tested quite a bit as well as to had
 

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.810
and tested quite a bit as well as to had
to see what is the sweet spot for

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820
to see what is the sweet spot for
 

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.410
to see what is the sweet spot for
different subscription plans so it's

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:12.420
different subscription plans so it's
 

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.600
different subscription plans so it's
very easy to set up monthly three

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:14.610
very easy to set up monthly three
 

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.030
very easy to set up monthly three
monthly six monthly annual turns and

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040
monthly six monthly annual turns and
 

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.340
monthly six monthly annual turns and
then see which one works and how to kind

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:19.350
then see which one works and how to kind
 

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.190
then see which one works and how to kind
of point that the good spot for the the

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:22.200
of point that the good spot for the the
 

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.190
of point that the good spot for the the
exact price that has the highest LTV and

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:25.200
exact price that has the highest LTV and
 

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.640
exact price that has the highest LTV and
and long term potential for for the app

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:30.650
and long term potential for for the app
 

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.220
and long term potential for for the app
so there's a lot of ways how to

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:34.230
so there's a lot of ways how to
 

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.590
so there's a lot of ways how to
experiment with that we have seen that

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600
experiment with that we have seen that
 

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.350
experiment with that we have seen that
in some emerging markets people tend to

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360
in some emerging markets people tend to
 

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.560
in some emerging markets people tend to
pick the cheapest and also the shortest

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:42.570
pick the cheapest and also the shortest
 

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.050
pick the cheapest and also the shortest
period subscriptions and then thinking

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060
period subscriptions and then thinking
 

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.480
period subscriptions and then thinking
of strategies how to change that and how

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:47.490
of strategies how to change that and how
 

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.960
of strategies how to change that and how
to make the make the longer plans either

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:50.970
to make the make the longer plans either
 

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.460
to make the make the longer plans either
more affordable or more appealing and

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.470
more affordable or more appealing and
 

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.220
more affordable or more appealing and
and communicating the right value the

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:56.230
and communicating the right value the
 

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.970
and communicating the right value the
latest experiment we we did was was in

00:16:59.970 --> 00:16:59.980
latest experiment we we did was was in
 

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.280
latest experiment we we did was was in
Mexico where we saw that there is a very

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:02.290
Mexico where we saw that there is a very
 

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.320
Mexico where we saw that there is a very
high proportion of users who instead of

00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:04.330
high proportion of users who instead of
 

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.930
high proportion of users who instead of
going for annual price which is the

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:06.940
going for annual price which is the
 

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.530
going for annual price which is the
overwhelming preferred one for memorize

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540
overwhelming preferred one for memorize
 

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.240

seventy percent of people from Mexico

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:12.250
seventy percent of people from Mexico
 

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.960
seventy percent of people from Mexico
actually picked a monthly price and

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:14.970
actually picked a monthly price and
 

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.310
actually picked a monthly price and
without doing anything else but just

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:17.320
without doing anything else but just
 

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.900
without doing anything else but just
increasing the monthly price

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:18.910
increasing the monthly price
 

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.660
increasing the monthly price
subscription fee a little bit we see the

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:21.670
subscription fee a little bit we see the
 

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.430
subscription fee a little bit we see the
shift towards people preferring the

shift towards people preferring the
annual suddenly so just experimenting

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:25.990
annual suddenly so just experimenting
 

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.300
annual suddenly so just experimenting
around that and really kind of

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:27.310
around that and really kind of
 

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.790
around that and really kind of

games it's much harder you know people

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:38.860
games it's much harder you know people
 

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.070

in the US might complain about lower

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.080
in the US might complain about lower
 

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.160
in the US might complain about lower
tier pricing in the other country but we

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.170
tier pricing in the other country but we
 

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.380
tier pricing in the other country but we
found a sweet spot you know players

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:46.390

so we figured out that giving out the

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:52.900
so we figured out that giving out the
 

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:56.160
so we figured out that giving out the
free kind of free cheaper starter packs

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.170
free kind of free cheaper starter packs
 

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:59.310
free kind of free cheaper starter packs
it might be worth 10 so even a hundred

00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320
it might be worth 10 so even a hundred
 

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.290
it might be worth 10 so even a hundred
dollars in some of those emerging

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:01.300
dollars in some of those emerging
 

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.380

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:40.800
then afterwards you just have standard
pricing across the globe well we don't

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:40.810
pricing across the globe well we don't
 

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.660
pricing across the globe well we don't
have some discounts and deals and things

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:42.670
have some discounts and deals and things
 

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:44.940
have some discounts and deals and things
like that but yeah well some of those

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:44.950
like that but yeah well some of those
 

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.980
like that but yeah well some of those
deals are kind of still pricey so we

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:46.990
deals are kind of still pricey so we
 

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.110
deals are kind of still pricey so we
don't really just the value of the

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120
don't really just the value of the
 

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.210
don't really just the value of the
currency for those countries because

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:51.220
currency for those countries because
 

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.760
currency for those countries because
that's the question like you can truly

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:53.770
that's the question like you can truly
 

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.680
that's the question like you can truly
do that as too many people will try to

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:55.690
do that as too many people will try to
 

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:57.810
do that as too many people will try to
switch the region you know like other

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:57.820
switch the region you know like other
 

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.270
switch the region you know like other
platforms like PC platform selves or

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280
platforms like PC platform selves or
 

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:01.890
platforms like PC platform selves or
dealing with that as too many players

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:01.900
dealing with that as too many players
 

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.050
dealing with that as too many players
are trying to buy the currency in

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:04.060
are trying to buy the currency in
 

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.300
are trying to buy the currency in
another region so we don't try to do so

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:06.310
another region so we don't try to do so
 

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.000
another region so we don't try to do so
we did that we did a whole geo pricing

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.010
we did that we did a whole geo pricing
 

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.400
we did that we did a whole geo pricing
activity where we change prices

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:11.410
activity where we change prices
 

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.130
activity where we change prices

on this platform I think we need to

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:33.340
on this platform I think we need to
 

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.660
on this platform I think we need to
acknowledge that but it's too early to

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:36.670
acknowledge that but it's too early to
 

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.290
acknowledge that but it's too early to
tell with geo pricing for us right now

tell with geo pricing for us right now
 

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.440

we we definitely saw an impact and

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.450
we we definitely saw an impact and
 

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.780
we we definitely saw an impact and
conversion we definitely saw people

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:45.790
conversion we definitely saw people
 

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.390
conversion we definitely saw people
spend more and for us it wasn't just a

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400
spend more and for us it wasn't just a
 

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.280
spend more and for us it wasn't just a
starter pack it was across the whole

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:50.290
starter pack it was across the whole
 

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:53.090
starter pack it was across the whole
store and across the whole economy and

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.920

the reality right now is we're not sure

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:55.930
the reality right now is we're not sure
 

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.920
the reality right now is we're not sure
how that's affected LTV because we don't

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:58.930
how that's affected LTV because we don't
 

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.510
how that's affected LTV because we don't
know if people are doing more purchases

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520
know if people are doing more purchases
 

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.580
know if people are doing more purchases
little and often or if they're still

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:05.590
little and often or if they're still
 

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.130
little and often or if they're still
buying like the one pack that they would

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:08.140
buying like the one pack that they would
 

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.260
buying like the one pack that they would
have done before but got more for it so

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:10.270
have done before but got more for it so
 

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.480
have done before but got more for it so
we really are still balancing that thing

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:12.490
we really are still balancing that thing
 

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:14.159
we really are still balancing that thing
but ultimately for us

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:14.169
but ultimately for us
 

00:21:14.169 --> 00:21:16.440
but ultimately for us
I think the more important question is

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:16.450
I think the more important question is
 

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.759
I think the more important question is
how much are you getting as in terms of

00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:20.769
how much are you getting as in terms of
 

00:21:20.769 --> 00:21:22.739
how much are you getting as in terms of
the share of wallet for that consumer in

00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:22.749
the share of wallet for that consumer in
 

00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:25.019
the share of wallet for that consumer in
that region and from what we see in

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:25.029
that region and from what we see in
 

00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:27.419
that region and from what we see in
these emerging markets we're very

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:27.429
these emerging markets we're very
 

00:21:27.429 --> 00:21:28.739
these emerging markets we're very
encouraged by the fact that they are

00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:28.749
encouraged by the fact that they are
 

00:21:28.749 --> 00:21:30.989
encouraged by the fact that they are
willing to spend on entertainment the

00:21:30.989 --> 00:21:30.999
willing to spend on entertainment the
 

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:32.129
willing to spend on entertainment the
fact that there is a willingness to

00:21:32.129 --> 00:21:32.139
fact that there is a willingness to
 

00:21:32.139 --> 00:21:35.399
fact that there is a willingness to
spend on ia P I think is a very

00:21:35.399 --> 00:21:35.409
spend on ia P I think is a very
 

00:21:35.409 --> 00:21:37.049
spend on ia P I think is a very
interesting thing because I I actually

00:21:37.049 --> 00:21:37.059
interesting thing because I I actually
 

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:39.869
interesting thing because I I actually
think that emerging markets have got to

00:21:39.869 --> 00:21:39.879
think that emerging markets have got to
 

00:21:39.879 --> 00:21:41.099
think that emerging markets have got to
that step before even the Tier one

00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:41.109
that step before even the Tier one
 

00:21:41.109 --> 00:21:43.470
that step before even the Tier one
markets I think it took a long time for

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480
markets I think it took a long time for
 

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.169
markets I think it took a long time for
free-to-play an IO P game mechanics to

00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:46.179
free-to-play an IO P game mechanics to
 

00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:49.799
free-to-play an IO P game mechanics to
really be seen as the de facto business

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:49.809
really be seen as the de facto business
 

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:52.499
really be seen as the de facto business
model here in in in Tier one markets

00:21:52.499 --> 00:21:52.509
model here in in in Tier one markets
 

00:21:52.509 --> 00:21:54.119
model here in in in Tier one markets
because if you think about it even 5-10

00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:54.129
because if you think about it even 5-10
 

00:21:54.129 --> 00:21:55.560
because if you think about it even 5-10
years ago we were having debates about

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:55.570
years ago we were having debates about
 

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.139
years ago we were having debates about
it's free-to-play the future we know it

00:21:58.139 --> 00:21:58.149
it's free-to-play the future we know it
 

00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:59.639
it's free-to-play the future we know it
is and no one really talks about that

00:21:59.639 --> 00:21:59.649
is and no one really talks about that
 

00:21:59.649 --> 00:22:00.210
is and no one really talks about that
anymore

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:00.220
anymore
 

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.419
anymore
but in emerging markets it's just they

00:22:03.419 --> 00:22:03.429
but in emerging markets it's just they
 

00:22:03.429 --> 00:22:05.249
but in emerging markets it's just they
don't even think about it they don't

00:22:05.249 --> 00:22:05.259
don't even think about it they don't
 

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:06.960
don't even think about it they don't
worry about it so that's where I think

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:06.970
worry about it so that's where I think
 

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.989
worry about it so that's where I think
the Geo pricing stuff needs to be

00:22:09.989 --> 00:22:09.999
the Geo pricing stuff needs to be
 

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:11.609
the Geo pricing stuff needs to be
considered around the share of wallet

00:22:11.609 --> 00:22:11.619
considered around the share of wallet
 

00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:13.409
considered around the share of wallet
for that consumer because obviously an

00:22:13.409 --> 00:22:13.419
for that consumer because obviously an
 

00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:15.299
for that consumer because obviously an
Indian consumer does not have the same

00:22:15.299 --> 00:22:15.309
Indian consumer does not have the same
 

00:22:15.309 --> 00:22:17.879
Indian consumer does not have the same
disposable income as a US consumer but

00:22:17.879 --> 00:22:17.889
disposable income as a US consumer but
 

00:22:17.889 --> 00:22:20.580
disposable income as a US consumer but
we've seen in China that change and

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:20.590
we've seen in China that change and
 

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.619
we've seen in China that change and
obviously you just have to look at the

00:22:22.619 --> 00:22:22.629
obviously you just have to look at the
 

00:22:22.629 --> 00:22:24.960
obviously you just have to look at the
kind of macroeconomic situation of some

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:24.970
kind of macroeconomic situation of some
 

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.399
kind of macroeconomic situation of some
of these countries and nations that that

00:22:26.399 --> 00:22:26.409
of these countries and nations that that
 

00:22:26.409 --> 00:22:28.470
of these countries and nations that that
will eventually change so we feel like

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480
will eventually change so we feel like
 

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.899
will eventually change so we feel like
being there early making these steps and

00:22:30.899 --> 00:22:30.909
being there early making these steps and
 

00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:32.489
being there early making these steps and
understanding how the consumer behaves

00:22:32.489 --> 00:22:32.499
understanding how the consumer behaves
 

00:22:32.499 --> 00:22:35.849
understanding how the consumer behaves
is super important so that's what I want

00:22:35.849 --> 00:22:35.859
is super important so that's what I want
 

00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:38.669
is super important so that's what I want
to read off from that conversation our

00:22:38.669 --> 00:22:38.679
to read off from that conversation our
 

00:22:38.679 --> 00:22:40.289
to read off from that conversation our
games portfolio throughout the years

00:22:40.289 --> 00:22:40.299
games portfolio throughout the years
 

00:22:40.299 --> 00:22:42.180
games portfolio throughout the years
we've definitely seen some of the

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:42.190
we've definitely seen some of the
 

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.509
we've definitely seen some of the
markets transitioning from emerging to

00:22:45.509 --> 00:22:45.519
markets transitioning from emerging to
 

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:47.729
markets transitioning from emerging to
much more mature markets perhaps

00:22:47.729 --> 00:22:47.739
much more mature markets perhaps
 

00:22:47.739 --> 00:22:49.830
much more mature markets perhaps
Southeast Asian markets that now have

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840
Southeast Asian markets that now have
 

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.169
Southeast Asian markets that now have
many more payment methods and people are

00:22:52.169 --> 00:22:52.179
many more payment methods and people are
 

00:22:52.179 --> 00:22:54.720
many more payment methods and people are
just used to play that so I think it's

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:54.730
just used to play that so I think it's
 

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.599
just used to play that so I think it's
just a matter of time when we will see

00:22:56.599 --> 00:22:56.609
just a matter of time when we will see
 

00:22:56.609 --> 00:22:59.639
just a matter of time when we will see
more spending power in those countries

00:22:59.639 --> 00:22:59.649
more spending power in those countries
 

00:22:59.649 --> 00:23:03.450
more spending power in those countries
and like in a year or two we're going to

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:03.460
and like in a year or two we're going to
 

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.950
and like in a year or two we're going to
talk about those mark it's not as

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960
talk about those mark it's not as
 

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.409
talk about those mark it's not as
emergent remember that breaks had China

00:23:07.409 --> 00:23:07.419
emergent remember that breaks had China
 

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:09.330
emergent remember that breaks had China
in it as an emerging market here now we

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:09.340
in it as an emerging market here now we
 

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.119
in it as an emerging market here now we
don't speak about China so I nowadays I

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:12.129
don't speak about China so I nowadays I
 

00:23:12.129 --> 00:23:14.549
