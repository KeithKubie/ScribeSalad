00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.540
SHELBY STANGA: What the hell is
that doing up here on my
property?

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.380
Huh?

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.790
It look like a damn junkyard.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.540
I pull up and there's a
damn RV sitting on my land

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.080
like a big pile of junk.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.620
Did you remember what I
told y'all about people

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.710
dropping [bleep] off here?

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.500
The gate was wide open.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.830
I don't-- I thought
you left the gate open.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.710
Ain't this a [bleep].

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.750
You can't get your
work done there.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.380
Got people dropping junk off.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.040
They think it's a damn dump.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.920
It might look like a dump.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.250
But it ain't.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.540
You know that?

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.750
NARRATOR: While Shelby
was living off the grid,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.880
the locals made his
landing the family

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.210
neighborhood garbage dump.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.080
And some folks
haven't stopped yet.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.710
I'm going to take the
stuff that's good off of it.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.880
Someone leaves stuff on my
land, I'm taking the stuff.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.210
How do you open this up now?

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.420
NARRATOR: Now this may look
like a five ton rust bucket.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.210
But everyone knows the swamp
man has a knack for turning

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.330
trash into treasure.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.080
So Shelby will put the
order on a brief hold

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.250
as he raids his
shiny new piggy bank.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.040
One of them good ones
there for a farmer.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.000
Already get in a high
tax bracket already, man.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.920
NARRATOR: And he's
going to crack it open

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.420
and take every last penny.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.290
A TV that plugs into
a cigarette lighter.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.920
I've never seen
one of them before.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.000
I sure would like a TV.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Got my own TV!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.580
What is this thing?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.120
Oh, man.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.960
A bed.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.250
Oh, here we go!

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.420
What the hell?

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.420
Charcoal lighter fluid
for the charcoal.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.290
Boy, this RV is
like a gold mine.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.960
I mean, totally wrong.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.710
You see anything you want,
put it in your pocket.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.580
[dog barking]

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.960
Where you at?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.040
This thing worth a bunch
of money on the damn eBay.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.500
WOMAN: Ain't you
have one of those?

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.790
- Here.
- Holy crap.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.920
Put that outside.
That will be $500 smackaronis.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.120
Oh my, we used to play
this at my grandma's house

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.460
all the time.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.290
That's valuable stuff.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.460
It might be better than logging.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.790
It's better than
"The Price Is Right".

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.580
Here.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.040
[cash register sound]

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.460
Give that to the kids.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.540
OK.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.460
Better go on the
wall, like Bob Barker.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.670
I don't know what that is.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.920
I never seen one of them.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.830
I don't know what that is.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.580
What is that?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.500
That's a Pop-A-Plate.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.330
What does that mean?

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.330
You stick your plates up here.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.420
Come on.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.830
Like this.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.670
Ah hah.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.790
Oh, man.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.170
Got to have that.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.830
Take that off.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.500
[cash register sound]
- Yeah.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.540
That is cool

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.380
Oh man.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.580
Look at here.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.170
Man, that's $400,
$500 that's in there.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.880
[cash register sound]
NARRATOR:

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.210
WOMAN: The brokedown RVs
turned out to be a cash cow.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.500
[cow mooing]

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.380
And Shelby is milking
it for all it's worth.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.880
I got everything
I need out of it.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.580
Ain't nothing left.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.830
We're doing good now.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.380
WOMAN: Slowly but
surely, the swamp man's

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.920
getting back on track.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.670
Get that high tax bracket.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.380
Ha!

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.380
Here we go!
