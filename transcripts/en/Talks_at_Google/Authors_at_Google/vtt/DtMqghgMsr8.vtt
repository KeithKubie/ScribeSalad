00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720
[applause]

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.170
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: Thanks so much for having
me. We're gonna talk about my story first

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.160
and then I'm gonna give you some high level
information on personal branding and then

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.219
I'm gonna walk you through the four step personal
branding process that's in Me 2.0, the book

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.219
all of you have in front of you.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.219
So when I got started, when I got started
I had eight internships in seven years for

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:23.490
positions in college. I was trying to figure
out everything on my own so I started from

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.320
really nothing and I had to get each internship
in order to build my profile to get the next

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:39.150
internship. I went to these internships with
what I call now a personal branding toolkit,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:47.330
different materials that help you sell me
as a person, now as a brand; so business card,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:57.900
a website, a CD portfolio of work, like all
these materials and they would help me stand

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.550
out during these interviews.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.400
The problem that I had was I never networked
and I was a little bit afraid to network and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.850
as a result it took me eight months, meeting
15 people, getting rejected twice to get my

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.620
first job out of school, so it was a hard
lesson learned.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.990
But one of the most fascinating things that
happened before I got my job at EMC was during

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.120
one of the last interviews they looked at
my resume, which was two pages, and they said,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.580
"Wow you worked at Reebok." Now when I had
my internship at Reebok I did almost nothing,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.290
I hate to admit to people watching [laughs]
that work at Reebok. But I had so much experience

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.880
at the smaller firms, but they cared about
Reebok because Reebok was a brand and the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.240
brand opened the door, I got the job.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.360
And then about a year later I read Tom Peters'
"A Brand Called You" article which was written

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.150
back in 1997 on the cover of Fast Company
magazine. And when I read this article it

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:11.290
called out to me. He was saying you have to
be the chief marketing officer for the brand

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.459
called you. You have to be the CEO of Me,
Inc.

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.770
And reading his article I was saying "Wow,
this is exactly what I've been doing all along,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.060
marketing myself" without even knowing of
that term. And so I started the personal branding

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.209
blog which is now personalbranding.com that
used to be personalbranding.wordpress.com

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.730
when it was first started. And when I started
this I started writing 10 to 12 posts a week

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.480
because I love to do it, I knew that I could
probably become the spokesperson of my generation;

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.560
I'm 27, I was 23 years old then. So I just
started writing and just getting my ideas

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.200
out and everything that I'd learned along
the way: getting the internships, getting

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.940
the jobs throughout college to help other
individuals who were struggling.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.930
And then, what I did was, I started a few
more projects. I'll go through a few of these.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.740
The Personal Brand Awards and we wanted to
recognize people who are already really successful

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.240
building brands online. And I also did Personal
Branding TV which was very uncomfortable for

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.620
me. I still don't really like doing video,
but I put videos of myself interviewing CEO's

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.599
and executives so you get to meet my own uncle.
And I also gave like chalkboard lectures and

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.420
tried to get my ideas out in a different format
because I believe that you pretty much have

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.530
to put everything in any format that your
audience is looking for right now.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.239
And then what I did was I wrote articles.
Now I had never written articles before, I

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.060
didn't consider myself a writer, I didn't
think I was that great of a writer during

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.350
high school or college. And I got the opportunity
to write for about.com which was my first

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:51.140
opportunity to write. And it was published
and when it was published I said, "Wow, this

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.930
is incredible! Someone's willing to publish
something that I wrote."

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.800
I took that published work, and anytime you
get published you get a lot of benefits. It

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:08.620
positions you as an expert, you get links
back to your site, increases your Google standing,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.519
and builds traffic to your site. So it's really
good, it really helps you. And I took that

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.849
published article and I used it to get my
next opportunity.

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:21.079
So my next opportunity was with American Marketing
Association. I wrote a best practice on personal

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.910
branding for them used both of those published
works to get my next opportunity. It took

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.960
me six months but I got published in Branding
Magazine which was a pretty big deal at the

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.170
time for me.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.699
And then I just kept building and building
and while I was building that I was still

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.350
blogging, I was commenting on any single blog
that mentioned personal branding. It's a ton

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:44.000
of work, so you have 40 to 50 hours a week
at my day job at EMC Corporation in product

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.940
marketing, and then I'd go home, I'd sacrifice
nights, I sacrificed weekends to continue

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.280
to build upon something that I truly believed
in, not getting any money to do any of this.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.441
And then I started Personal Branding Magazine
because I wanted to continue to position myself

00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:04.840
as an expert 'cause I call myself a personal
branding spokesperson for Gen Y, I didn't

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.490
want to just take the expert status right
away I wanted to feel like I proved myself

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.050
and I was worthy of the expert status.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.699
So the first issue had 11 articles and the
cover was Donald Trump, an interview between

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.840
him and Guy Kawasaki. And on that day when
it launched I was also profiled in Fast Company

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.560
which was 10 years to the day Tom Peters'
article came out, but more positioning me

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.169
as the person who understood personal branding
for the younger generation tied with this

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.300
new social media technology which was really
heating up at this point; Facebook has like

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.690
700 million users now. So at that point it
was starting to go a little bit more mainstream

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.300
back in 2007.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.699
And when it launched I never told my employer
what I was doing outside of work, it was just

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.020
a hobby, I wasn't making money, I wasn't,
I didn't see it as a big deal. PR got wind

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.580
of it because it noted that I was working
at EMC in a private marketing role at this

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.759
point while doing everything else. PR sent
it to a vice president, the vice president

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:08.190
called me into his office which was a big
deal I was an entry level candidate which

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.930
was very intimidating. And then he introduced
me to the head of public relations, the head

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.350
of public relations called me in.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.970
And it took me so much work, over such a long
period of time to get into this company and

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.840
now they're coming to me based on my online
personal branding, something I had built based

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.230
on my passion. To me that was profound and
I was ready to really market myself to this

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:37.759
head of PR. I brought him a press kit, I brought
him a printed copy of the Brandweek Magazine

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.300
article. I was doing whatever I could, but
I was already sold through that third party

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.770
endorsement based on everything I was doing
outside of work.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.930
And so I was able to co-create the first social
media position back in November 2007 which

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:56.820
inspired me to write Me 2.0, now you have
the second edition now, but back then I got

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:03.180
my own book deal. I got rejected by 70 agents,
let's me see, I got rejected by 70 agents

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.330
and two publishers, kept with it in January
2008 I got the book deal.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:14.970
And then after speaking at more companies
and continually building upon what I had already

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.150
been doing and building more business model
around that with consulting, speaking, and

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.271
the advertising platform that I've created,
I started Millennial Branding, LLC, and that's

00:07:24.271 --> 00:07:25.940
my company now.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.940
[pause]

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.620
What are these two toddlers talking about?

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:31.919
[pause]

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:38.860
They're talking about their online brand because
92% of them already have one. And why I bring

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.710
this up is it's not really the content that
they're creating about themselves even though

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.960
80% of them use the Internet, they're just
not that savvy at this point. It's what other

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.410
people are creating about them and that's
why you need to own your brand because if

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.040
you don't take a stand, if you don't publish
content based on your passion, what you wanna

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.319
become an expert in and really get yourself
out there, other people will have control

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:03.319
over your career future.

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:04.319
[pause]

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:07.930
I look at the Internet different than most
people. I look at it as the global talent

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:13.669
pool; this is where all the recruitings occur;
this is where all the opportunities are. And

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:18.580
for that reason you need to build an online
presence; you need your own website, at your

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.430
full name dot com, you need to be on social
networks because people need to find you.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.930
Because if people are searching for you or
people like you, you have to come up or you're

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.599
gonna lose an opportunity every single time
they perform that Google search.

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:35.409
And more and more employers are saying, "Forget
about the resume, we are just gonna search

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:40.079
for you online and whatever comes up that's
gonna depict whether you get the job or not.

00:08:40.079 --> 00:08:44.179
As you can see 34% of companies feel that
the online presence is really taking over

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.279
the resume, and this trend is just continuing.

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:47.279
[pause]

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:51.069
There's three skills you need or three main
big ideas. Is that the first one is you need

00:08:51.069 --> 00:08:56.769
hard skills. And back in the day, if you had
the right hard skills, if you got the degree,

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:01.179
if you were a good software programmer, you'd
be pretty much guaranteed the job. And then

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:05.689
it became more competitive to get jobs so
now not only do you have to be able to program,

00:09:05.689 --> 00:09:09.970
let's say, but you need good communication
skills. You need to be well organized, you

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.970
have to be able to talk with people, you have
to be able, you have to be a good writer,

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:17.350
you have to fit in the corporate culture,
all these things leadership, all these things

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.790
became more and more important.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.880
And now were entering another stage where
not only do you have to have great hard skills

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.489
and soft skills, but you have to have online
influence. And we're gonna talk about more

00:09:26.489 --> 00:09:30.149
about that towards the end of the presentation.

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:34.199
You have to be able to establish a strong
network, you have to be able to have to have

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:38.249
people listen to what you have to say, and
maybe retweet you and spread your messages.

00:09:38.249 --> 00:09:42.129
And that's gonna account for more and more
in the future.

00:09:42.129 --> 00:09:47.529
And you don't wanna end up like the dinosaurs.
And I think the biggest challenge for people

00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:51.959
now and in the future is to stay relevant.
It's becoming so hard, I mean, I read and

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:57.449
scan 800 RSS feeds a day in order to keep
up. I mean it's my business to keep up, but

00:09:57.449 --> 00:10:02.329
in a sense if you don't know what's going
on with your company and industry and technology,

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:06.050
then you're gonna be outdated and irrelevant
to the market place and that's gonna really

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.050
hurt your career.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.089
And that's why I think blogging is really
important because it forces you to read because

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:15.470
the best bloggers are the best readers. The
more you understand what's going on, you can

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:21.639
more predictions, you can cite research, there's
so much more you can do with that content.

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:22.639
[pause]

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:27.100
And there's been a big branding shift; I think
people have to act more like companies, behave

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.429
more like companies. At the end of the day
success is in your hands, you have to be in

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:32.759
the driver's seat of your career not the passenger
seat.

00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:40.499
And then companies have to act more like individuals
because consumers want to interact with companies.

00:10:40.499 --> 00:10:46.110
I mean there was a report yesterday that said
56% of people on social networks are looking

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.279
for responses to their questions from companies.
So there's a huge demand for it, it's gonna

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:57.429
always increase, and so it's very important
that companies tap their employees to connect

00:10:57.429 --> 00:10:59.690
in a human fashion with the outside world.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:00.690
[pause]

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:05.959
And this is the Four Step Personal Branding
Process. Discover is about figuring out who

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:09.499
you are, how you want to brand yourself and
I always say for people who work in companies

00:11:09.499 --> 00:11:15.089
becoming the go-to expert on a specific topic
or skill within your company so when people

00:11:15.089 --> 00:11:21.790
need that skill or need some advice they go
to you each time and that's how you build

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.790
value.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.170
Establishing short term and long term goals,
making sure both of those align as well.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.720
Create is about creating the personal branding
toolkit like I mentioned earlier with all

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.079
the materials that you need to help sell you
whether you're a job seeker or employed or

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:37.459
you're an entrepreneur you always have to
keep those updated.

00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:41.739
Communicate is what you have to do every single
day, really get out there, make sure people

00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:46.309
are aware of your name, your face, and your
value. Seeing as though you have to be on

00:11:46.309 --> 00:11:49.970
Twitter and Facebook and updating people,
so let them know what's going on with you

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:50.970
and your career.

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.660
And maintain is maintaining a positive image
for the rest of your life. It's not today

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.360
in fact it's something that you have to invest
in the long term.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.360
[pause]

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:07.410
And this is the Success Triangle. The first
thing you need in order to be successful is

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.139
passion, you have to really love what you
do. You can't work for the weekend, you can't

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:15.350
wake up in the morning and just throw a brick
against the wall, it's just not gonna do much

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.410
for you. So if you really like what you do
you'll put in more effort, you'll make sacrifices

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:24.689
because if you really wanna get to a higher
level in your career there has to be come

00:12:24.689 --> 00:12:26.769
sort of sacrifice that you have to make.

00:12:26.769 --> 00:12:31.609
And then you have expertise. Expertise is
being able to fulfill job descriptions and

00:12:31.609 --> 00:12:35.540
support other people and that's really how
you make money. But if you're an expert and

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.670
hate what you do or what you're an expert
in, you're not gonna be happy so you really

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:39.670
need both of those.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.079
And the last piece is the support system,
this is the network component. You always

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:46.249
have to, you have to treat your life as a
networking event, you have to constantly meet

00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:49.399
new people because that's how you're gonna
really advance.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:55.369
And the thing about working for a company
is the more people you know early on, its

00:12:55.369 --> 00:12:59.749
gonna support you guys to become a manager,
director, and beyond because once you're out

00:12:59.749 --> 00:13:02.579
of that level it's not sustainable if you
don't have a network that can help you accomplish

00:13:02.579 --> 00:13:03.579
your goals.

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:08.519
And then there's four other key words: authenticity,
some of these key words are buzz words, I'm

00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:11.889
sure you've heard 'em a lot. Authenticity,
you have to be the real you, you don't wanna

00:13:11.889 --> 00:13:15.160
copy anyone else, and your personality's your
greatest asset.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.579
Transparency, you have to be up front and
honest with people. So when I got my new position

00:13:20.579 --> 00:13:26.819
as a social media specialist back in 2007
I told them that I was gonna be speaking at

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:30.563
different places and everything I was doing
outside of work because if I didn't they could

00:13:30.563 --> 00:13:35.720
just search for me online and find out the
hard way and that would affect my brand negatively.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.449
Value, you have to figure out what your unique
value is, what your differentiation is, what

00:13:40.449 --> 00:13:44.379
makes you different from the next person,
you need to answer these types of questions.

00:13:44.379 --> 00:13:48.649
And then visibility, if people don't know
what you're doing, you don't exist to them.

00:13:48.649 --> 00:13:54.419
If you're not found in search engines or social
networks it's gonna really hurt you.

00:13:54.419 --> 00:13:55.419
[pause]

00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:58.569
So there's four big brands here. We're gonna
go through each one and you're gonna say one

00:13:58.569 --> 00:14:01.470
word that describes them. Michael Jackson?

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.109
&gt;&gt;[audience members respond]

00:14:03.109 --> 00:14:05.309
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: Anyone else?

00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:06.399
Paris Hilton?

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:08.049
&gt;&gt;female #1: Rich.

00:14:08.049 --> 00:14:09.689
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: Obama?

00:14:09.689 --> 00:14:10.689
Anyone?

00:14:10.689 --> 00:14:16.279
&gt;&gt;[audience members respond]
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: That's a good one. And Oprah?

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:17.919
&gt;&gt;[audience members respond]

00:14:17.919 --> 00:14:23.329
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: The reason why I just asked
you that is because I believe that if you

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:27.399
wanna manage your brand properly, your self
impression has to equal perceptions. So how

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:30.339
you describe yourself has to equal how people
describe you. And if you're doing that your

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:36.889
managing your brand correctly, right. So if
you think you're the smartest person in the

00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:40.692
world and everyone thinks you're dumb, you
got an issue.

00:14:40.692 --> 00:14:41.692
[pause]

00:14:41.692 --> 00:14:45.620
And you wanna become an expert. This is, Edelman
puts this survey out every single year and

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.499
I got wind of it a few days ago and I'm thinking,
"Wow this is just so true." If you look at

00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:57.669
from 2009 to 2011, experts and academics are
the most trusted. So just another reason why

00:14:57.669 --> 00:15:02.919
you need to become an expert in your field
because people will trust you and that obviously

00:15:02.919 --> 00:15:04.019
supports your company.

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:08.389
And you wanna take a niche. In general what
I believe is you have to brand yourself with

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:12.720
the career you want not the job you have because
if you position yourself online based on your

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.639
passion, what you're really, really interested
in, which might not be what you do at your

00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:19.660
day job, you're gonna attract the right opportunities.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.619
If you hate your job and you talk about how
much you hate your job online it's obviously

00:15:23.619 --> 00:15:28.649
not good, but if you position yourself saying,
"I'm this type of engineer," online you're

00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:32.429
gonna keep getting the opportunities that
you don't want. So it's almost like the law

00:15:32.429 --> 00:15:37.389
of attraction online is if you put your real
self out there you're gonna attract the right

00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:44.729
people, the right opportunities. If you don't
and you just copy someone else you're gonna

00:15:44.729 --> 00:15:46.050
get the wrong opportunities. It really is
that simple.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:48.779
And so the example that I share with you today
is how you can position yourself as an expert

00:15:48.779 --> 00:15:53.089
and take a niche. So if you wanna become a
personal finance expert it's gonna be very

00:15:53.089 --> 00:15:57.470
hard to compete with Suze Orman because she's
a well known brand, multi-time New York Times

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:03.309
bestseller, TV show, you name it. But if you
take a niche off of that and you say, "Hey

00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:08.229
I live in Minnesota and I wanna become the
number one personal finance expert in this

00:16:08.229 --> 00:16:15.239
area," then you can. And if you do that online,
you're gonna be found when someone searches

00:16:15.239 --> 00:16:20.609
for you on Google and not Suze Orman. So you
have a chance at building a real business

00:16:20.609 --> 00:16:24.810
and getting visibility. And people who live
in Minnesota, Suze Orman isn't a consultant

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.769
but they wouldn't pay for Suze Orman anyway
'cause they would wanna deal with someone

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:29.769
locally.

00:16:29.769 --> 00:16:37.189
Here's another example: someone wants to become
known as the SEO expert in Utah. You Google

00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:43.089
those terms, SEO, expert, Utah or SEO Utah,
he comes up first so he gets all of the visibility

00:16:43.089 --> 00:16:44.740
and he gets all the opportunities.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.189
And the final one is innovative legal counsel
for Gen Y entrepreneurs. This is a business

00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:58.319
but look how focused that is: it's entrepreneurs
who are young. They could have just said innovative

00:16:58.319 --> 00:17:04.720
legal counsel and then they're one of a billion
companies. But by segmenting your business

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.959
or segmenting yourself, you'll be very specific
and attract the right people that you can

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:12.880
serve and grow your business on.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.880
[pause]

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:21.000
Creating a personal branding toolkit: so resume,
cover letter, link to profile, which I believe

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.309
is replacing cover letters and resumes. Video
resumes, which are popular but a lot of people

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:31.929
screw them up. So if you don't have the right
personality for it, don't do it it's gonna

00:17:31.929 --> 00:17:32.929
hurt you. You know Tufts University, they
accept video resumes for their application

00:17:32.929 --> 00:17:41.289
process so it's becoming more a possibility
familiar to these companies and to these academics.

00:17:41.289 --> 00:17:45.789
Also the social networks: Facebook, LinkedIn,
Twitter are the main ones and we'll discuss

00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:50.970
a little bit more about those; a blog versus
a website; website very static, blog more

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:51.970
dynamic.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:57.350
And these are really just materials that you
can use: CD portfolio, or a website portfolio,

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:03.250
just to showcase what you can give to other
people. And the object of doing this is to

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:08.169
lower risk. So the more you put out there,
the more high quality things you put out there

00:18:08.169 --> 00:18:12.960
the less risk a company has when thinking
of hiring you or not.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:19.559
Blogging: so these are two blogs that we've
recently created for clients and the object

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:23.169
of creating a blog and what you need to do
now is you need to take a unique position,

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:27.040
you don't wanna recycle news, you need to
have your own opinions on them because that's

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.110
what's gonna attract other people and you
need to figure out what your voice is as well.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:35.410
And then you have to make the investment.
You do need a custom website design now. If

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:40.769
you just steal someone else's templates not
gonna do much because there's 160 million

00:18:40.769 --> 00:18:46.210
plus blogs; a lot of competition out there.
So if 100 blogs having the same template those

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:51.210
are probably going to be ignored, but the
ones who invest in their blog or their website,

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.980
those are the ones that are gonna capture
more attention.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:58.909
And then social networking's great, Google+
one button, Facebook share button all that

00:18:58.909 --> 00:19:04.809
has to be in all blog posts and on your sites
because people are finding out about new content

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:10.450
on blogs and traditional media sites though
social networks first. So if you don't enable

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:16.610
your community to share your content quickly,
you're gonna miss out on building that type

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:18.830
of community that you're looking to get.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:24.590
And then upkeep: you have to be committed
to anything that you really care about and

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:30.180
if you have a blog you have to be really committed
to it. You can't just update it once every

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.180
six months; it's gonna make you look bad because
everything is dated. So the reason why you

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:36.120
go to Facebook all the time is because you
don't want it to say last update 2009, like

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:41.231
where is this person? If I drop off for 72
hours people think I'm dead and that this

00:19:41.231 --> 00:19:43.780
is the world we're living on, a lot of people
live online.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.750
[pause]

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.340
The big three social networks, I don't know
if you can see this, together they have over

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:56.519
a billion users I mean people are on the same
ones, but huge users bases. The number one

00:19:56.519 --> 00:20:00.440
question I always get asked is what do I do
with my Facebook profile, employers are looking

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:05.970
at it and search my name on Facebook and I
don't want them to see my conversations that

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:10.370
I have with family and friends. So keep 'em
private, keep everything private as much as

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:16.730
you can. Of course people can get their hands
on information if they want to or if they

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:22.450
wanna spend money, but you need to protect
yourself as much as possible and maybe establish

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.450
a fan page, you can use that as your professional
identity.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:29.940
And then Twitter is great because you can
connect on the same, how many of you are on

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.940
Twitter?

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:31.940
[pause]

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.860
Twitter's great because you're all in the
same place and you can network and have access,

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:38.500
access if one of the key words, to people
that you wouldn't have access to before. Because

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:44.879
you can go in and you can form a relationship
with experts in your industry, hiring managers,

00:20:44.879 --> 00:20:50.429
directors, entrepreneurs, whoever you want.
And if you specifically target these individuals

00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:52.809
you can form relationships in a public setting.

00:20:52.809 --> 00:20:58.370
The way I look at this, the way I look at
Twitter is, that instead of asking a girl

00:20:58.370 --> 00:21:04.460
or guy over to your place the first night,
first time you see them, you're establishing,

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.899
you're putting the other person in a very
comfortable situation because it's like taking

00:21:08.899 --> 00:21:13.350
them to the movies or to dinner. That's how
I look at it.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:17.620
And then LinkedIn: LinkedIn's valuable especially
if you already have a strong network because

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.620
you just import all your contacts and then
you use those contacts to tap into the second

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:28.350
or third degree relationships. So it gives
you access through a referral based system

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.480
which is more powerful than just sending someone
a blind resume or a blind email to other people

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.800
that can help you in your career.

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.800
[pause]

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.590
We're on to communicate.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:43.390
There's so many different ways you can promote
yourself now as simple as an email signature

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:49.309
with a URL, a blog URL, a website URL, social
network profile, LinkedIn profile. There's

00:21:49.309 --> 00:21:56.330
also writing a book or an eBook, starting
a blog, going to charity events --

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:57.330
[pause]

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:05.129
becoming a member of an association, becoming
a leader in the association, speaking, attending

00:22:05.129 --> 00:22:11.710
networking events. There's so many different
ways: being active on blogs, commenting, and

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:16.259
going to forums and commenting. You just have
to get out there and it takes a lot of work.

00:22:16.259 --> 00:22:20.860
If you build a website or blog, people aren't
just gonna come because there's so many. So

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:26.340
you have to be in the driver's seat again
and you have to go get those users by playing

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:33.019
where they are, right, fishing where they
are, fishing where the fish are.

00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:36.889
Networking now exists on three levels. When
I grew up, my parents said, "It's all about

00:22:36.889 --> 00:22:42.350
who you know." But with LinkedIn and other
social networks and the social graph on top

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:47.659
of them, it's now about who they know and
that information for the first time ever is

00:22:47.659 --> 00:22:54.420
available to you. You can see through your
network who knows who and tap into those contacts.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:59.480
Before, I'd say seven to ten years ago, you're
not gonna go ask all your friends, "Oh, who

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.240
do you know? Do you know him that knows her?"
I mean it's just not gonna work like that.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.850
So LinkedIn's a little more regulated where
you can see okay I know you work at this company

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:11.809
but look one of your contacts works at a company
that I wanna work for as well, and then you

00:23:11.809 --> 00:23:16.460
can just tap into that so there's a lot, a
lot of that in there.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.700
And the last piece is it's who knows you and
this is what happens when you start to build

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:26.573
a brand, become more well known is more people
know you than you know people. And when people

00:23:26.573 --> 00:23:31.480
know you, you've probably created some degree
of word of mouth so they can say nice things

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.320
about you. And what other people say about
your brand is more impactful than what you

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.220
say about yourself especially if they're respected
by society. If the New York Times says your

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:43.947
grade, it counts for a lot more than if you
say your grade to other people. If your manager

00:23:43.947 --> 00:23:48.629
says or a VP tells your manager you're doing
a great job, it counts a lot more than if

00:23:48.629 --> 00:23:52.809
you tell your manager that you're doing a
good job.

00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:53.809
[pause]

00:23:53.809 --> 00:23:56.980
And we're really entering a world of one-on-one
marketing. I think it's becoming more obvious

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:02.940
everyday because Tweets and Facebook updates
are being ignored 'cause there's so many of

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.029
'em. People are following hundreds, the average
person in the UK on Facebook has at least

00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:15.299
a thousand friends. So it's so much content,
so many people and a lot of that content's

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:18.629
being ignored. The best thing you can do is
focus in on the right people that you want

00:24:18.629 --> 00:24:22.470
to form relationships with and spend more
of your time with those people rather than

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.409
trying to mass market yourself which is very
ineffective.

00:24:25.409 --> 00:24:26.409
[pause]

00:24:26.409 --> 00:24:32.490
Four rules of brand relationships that I live
by. The first one is mutualism; it's creating

00:24:32.490 --> 00:24:37.200
win-win situations in business. The other
person has to get as much out of the deal

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.080
as you do and if they don't it's not gonna
be a long term relationship.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.789
The next one is giving which is the number
one most important networking rule.

00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:49.820
&gt;&gt;female #1: Could you give some example of
that first one.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.639
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: Yeah, so if you're in a business
deal,

00:24:54.639 --> 00:24:55.639
&gt;&gt;female #1: Um-hum.

00:24:55.639 --> 00:24:58.080
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: and you let's say create someone's
website,

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.990
&gt;&gt;female #1: Um-hum.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:05.130
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: and they give you $10,000
and the website's really not at the level

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:06.130
it should be at --

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:07.130
[pause]

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.130
you're getting more than they're getting.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:09.130
&gt;&gt;female #1: Right.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.700
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: It's all about, it's really
about value.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:21.030
&gt;&gt;female #1: But I guess maybe like with some
financial transactions because you were talking

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.870
about branding or are you just talking about
financial transactions?

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.129
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: Well I'm mean financial transactions
is one of them, but it goes with anything.

00:25:27.129 --> 00:25:28.870
If you're selling something to somebody and
they feel like they're getting ripped off

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:34.039
it's not gonna be a long term relationship,
and that's why it kind of goes back to giving,

00:25:34.039 --> 00:25:35.241
helping out other people without asking for
anything in return. Because then people are

00:25:35.241 --> 00:25:41.100
more apt to help you it's just naturally how
it works.

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:47.480
And then reconnecting is another really important
rule. You need to constantly reconnect with

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.240
people that you really care about because
if they go under the radar for four years,

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.321
it's not gonna be a long term relationship.
But if you contact them maybe six times a

00:25:57.321 --> 00:26:03.509
year at least then it means, it shows that
you care and they'll probably help you in

00:26:03.509 --> 00:26:07.249
some way if you ever need it. It's like if
you get a Facebook friend request or message

00:26:07.249 --> 00:26:11.510
from someone you hated in high school, you're
still not gonna help them, but if you liked

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:18.590
someone in high school and they kept in contact
with you, you might help them. It's a big

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:19.590
difference.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:24.940
And then the last one is targeting. So it's
again like I said a few times, being very

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:29.730
specific with the people you wanna go after,
not trying to mass market or mass network

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:39.240
yourself, knowing the type of people in your
industry that interest you and then focusing

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.490
your attention on those. You'll get a lot
more out of it. It's like if you go to a networking

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.240
event, instead of passing out 500 business
cards --

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.240
[pause]

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.639
taking five business cards, meeting the five
people you really, really are interested in

00:26:49.639 --> 00:26:52.200
and spending the entire time with them.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.200
[pause]

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.179
And maintain: what does Google say about you?
That's a plug for you. [chuckles] So what

00:26:58.179 --> 00:27:05.500
I'm gonna ask you now is how many people do
you think Google themselves, what percentage

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.340
of people Google themselves? Just shout out
any number.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.340
[pause]

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.340
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thirty.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:22.870
&gt;&gt;Dan Schawbel: Thirty. It's actually 57%
of people self Google and 53% of people Google

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.440
others. And I think these are actually low,
I think it's just becoming more of a habit

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.440
for people right now.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.440
[pause]

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.499
And reputation management 2.0 because I believe
Google's your permanent record. When people

00:27:29.499 --> 00:27:33.269
search for you it can have a negative or a
positive impact on your career based on what

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:38.179
shows up. Anthony Weiner, from the House of
Representatives, he had a huge issue because

00:27:38.179 --> 00:27:42.870
he didn't understand that the Web was such
a public place and it came back to bite him

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:48.700
of course. So if you look at what happened
to him, he's Tweeting and putting up all these

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:54.360
pictures, it's becoming public and even if
one person saw it and he takes it down, that

00:27:54.360 --> 00:28:00.240
one person can do a print screen and paste
it and share it and can reblog it and can

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.039
share it with someone else and they can put
video on it. So one mistake can actually go

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:09.860
viral now and really hurt someone's brand.
And I'm not sure if he's gonna retire or anything

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:16.850
or step down, but if you Google his name,
it's all negative. And if you go to his Wikipedia

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:20.019
it has this incident on it.

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:24.850
And a new survey came out by Retrevo that
said 35% of people post something that they

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:31.770
later regret. What you post right now could
affect you 35 years from now, because it's

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:36.649
always gonna visible whether it's on the 2nd
page or the 50th page. Someone's trying to

00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:39.679
research your background and see if they wanna
hire you and work with you, that's where they're

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:40.679
turning to.

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:41.679
[pause]

00:28:41.679 --> 00:28:47.840
And you can actually be proactive and set
up a great defense to combat anything negative

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:54.119
that would occur in the future. So Google
Profile, Facebook, professional page where

00:28:54.119 --> 00:29:02.679
you have facebook.com/your full name. LinkedIn
getting a URL in LinkedIn; registering on

00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:10.159
Twitter. Again use your name, your picture,
and position all these profiles and websites

00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:15.869
and blogs the same way. And everything if
you link everything together they'll reinforce

00:29:15.869 --> 00:29:19.799
one another and they'll all start to rank
higher. And it's great to preserve all this

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:22.700
before someone else does so you have a little
bit more control and because they rank high

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:28.039
for name especially if you have a unique name,
that can combat something that would have

00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:33.009
happen in the future that would be a threat
to you in your career.

00:29:33.009 --> 00:29:37.419
And what you need to do is you need to monitor
your name to see what people are saying about

00:29:37.419 --> 00:29:42.250
you. You need to monitor different key words
that pertain to your industry and your profession.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:46.559
You need to monitor what people are saying
about your company, any partners and competitors.

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:52.649
And you can set all this up by going to google.com/alerts
which you're probably familiar with and setting

00:29:52.649 --> 00:29:55.619
comprehensive alert for your name, business,
and etcetera.

00:29:55.619 --> 00:30:00.360
And then backtype.com does the same for blog
comments, then boardtracker.com does the same

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:07.820
for forums online, and then you have Social
Mention which searches your name on many different

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:12.400
networks and microblogs. You have this Technorati
which can search one of the most authoritative

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:20.460
blogs. You have Facebook, Facebook you can
do a search through your contacts and then

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.719
you can do a search through everyone on Facebook
for your name and what people are saying about

00:30:22.719 --> 00:30:27.799
you. And then Twitter you can go to search.twitter.com
or tweetbeep.com and set an alert for your

00:30:27.799 --> 00:30:36.080
name and you pull that all into a google.com/reader
so you can follow what people are saying about

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:43.499
you and do something about it before it's
a forest fire and negative viral activity

00:30:43.499 --> 00:30:44.499
on your name.

00:30:44.499 --> 00:30:45.499
[pause]

00:30:45.499 --> 00:30:46.519
And what ends up happening is you collect
all this information about what people are

00:30:46.519 --> 00:30:50.230
saying about you and your company and key
buzz words and all this information you care

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.809
about along with all the articles that you
subscribe to and all the blogs you subscribe,

00:30:54.809 --> 00:31:00.190
and pull all that into Google Reader and then
you take the best of that content, you organize

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:08.000
it, use in delicious.com and then you distribute
it using maybe a presentation or a blog or

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.840
social network profiles or maybe you cite
something in your blog. And this is a great

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:18.669
system to have because it's very easy to use
and if you get into the right rhythm you can

00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:23.039
make things happen very quick and stay updated.
And you have to get your voice online as much

00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:26.600
as possible so people remember you and you
become top of minds so when they're looking

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.129
to hire someone or work with someone they
think of you first. But if they don't see

00:31:30.129 --> 00:31:35.850
your face for a few weeks you're out of sight
out of mind.

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:36.850
[pause]

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:43.820
And the reputation marketplace it's at cloud.com.
How many, raise your hand if you're familiar

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.289
with cloud.com. Anyone?

00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:46.289
[pause]

00:31:46.289 --> 00:31:50.190
So cloud.com is basically is it basically
gives you a reputation metric of how influential

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:54.909
you are online. So it now takes into account
LinkedIn so it has LinkedIn, Twitter, and

00:31:54.909 --> 00:32:02.059
Facebook. So based on the amount of people
who follow you, who those people are, how

00:32:02.059 --> 00:32:05.539
many people are retweeting and sharing your
content, you're gonna get a score from zero

00:32:05.539 --> 00:32:13.029
to one hundred. And then people with the highest
scores for different topics get rewarded different

00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:15.840
prizes, they call it perks.

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.730
And to me this is becoming more and more important
because employers are actually using this

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:25.119
when hiring now. And that's a huge shift and
this number the more accurate it gets the

00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:29.600
more weight it's gonna carry in recruitment
process so it's definitely something to pay

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.600
attention to.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:36.940
And you can bring more value to your company
using social networking sites. So recruitment,

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:46.760
PR, marketing, you name it. Bloggers have
been known to sell products that their company

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:52.330
sell on their blogs and it works over 60%
of the time they've been able to do that.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.690
Free marketing, your company messages, your
company press releases, any big announcements,

00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:01.110
you can promote all that through networks
and seen as a value add to your company.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:06.110
Public relations we have negative things happen
online, people are saying bad things about

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:12.980
your company, get right in there, putting
the facts into play, help people out, you

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.530
can prevent the negative viral activity.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:20.030
Recruitment: having your networks to source
the right people. You're probably already

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:25.750
connected to people who would be a good fit
for Google and that really helps your company,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:26.750
too.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.139
So really at the end of the day it's about
bringing more value to your current job, putting

00:33:29.139 --> 00:33:32.130
in the extra effort, staying later, doing
that whatever it will take in order to get

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.130
to that next level in your career depending
on what you're looking ahead.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:40.809
And you need to command your future, you need
to be careful about what you put online because

00:33:40.809 --> 00:33:46.340
it could come back to haunt you it could really
screw things up for you when you get older.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.990
You have to really love what you do, passion's
the only thing that's sustainable so if you

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:55.549
hate what you do it's gonna be very hard for
you to be successful at doing that.

00:33:55.549 --> 00:34:03.009
You have to form relationships that's what
all this is about; the more people you know

00:34:03.009 --> 00:34:06.059
the more people who are connected to you and
care what you have to say, the better. And

00:34:06.059 --> 00:34:09.830
you also wanna be talking you wanna be trying
yourself again.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:15.600
And you gotta work hard. Go back to what I
said before a lot of the stuff I discussed

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:23.200
today takes a little bit more time than what
you would normally do at a day job, but it's

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:29.399
gonna help you and it's gonna safeguard your
career and allow you to advance in the future,

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:31.849
it's an investment in yourself.

00:34:31.849 --> 00:34:40.399
So I want to thank you today. My book Me 2.0

[applause]
