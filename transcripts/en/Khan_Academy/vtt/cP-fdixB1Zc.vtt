00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.646
- [Sal] What I'm going to
do in this video is give

00:00:01.646 --> 00:00:04.998
a very high-level history of some

00:00:04.998 --> 00:00:08.551
of the significant events in Judaism.

00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.198
I will use the word, history, loosely,

00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:14.135
because historians aren't
able to really find a lot

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:17.235
of evidence for some of
what I'm going to talk about

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:20.660
before the First Millennium BCE.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.909
These stories we get
from the first five books

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.044
of the Hebrew Bible, often
referred to as the Torah,

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:31.759
also the first five books
of the Old Testament,

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.009
also we get them from the Muslim Koran.

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:39.050
But there isn't a lot of
historical evidence for them.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.428
And so, many historians view it more

00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:43.122
along the lines of legend,

00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:46.547
but there are many people who
view these as historic facts

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:50.912
and have attempted to place
them on a historic timeline.

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:54.278
What I'm gonna do in this
video is I'm going to attempt

00:00:54.278 --> 00:00:58.445
to fit onto this historic
timeline where some of the people

00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:04.049
who believe it did happen,
when they believed it happened.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.572
Keep in mind that there's
not a lot of strong

00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:09.347
archeological evidence,
historical record here,

00:01:09.347 --> 00:01:12.110
and these accounts were
written several hundred years

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.384
after when they were purported to occur.

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:17.462
So let's start in the beginning.

00:01:17.462 --> 00:01:20.353
Let's start in the Book
of Genesis, in the Torah,

00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:23.221
in the Hebrew Bible,
and the Old Testament.

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:25.462
I'm not gonna go into detail
on the Book of Genesis.

00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:29.673
It starts, of course,
with the monotheistic God

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:32.599
creating the heavens and Earth.

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:34.770
And then we have the
stories of Adam and Eve,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.732
and then, several generations later,

00:01:36.732 --> 00:01:39.007
the story of the Great Flood of Noah.

00:01:39.007 --> 00:01:42.676
And then Noah's son, Shem,
and I talk about Shem

00:01:42.676 --> 00:01:47.316
because this is where the
word Semitic comes from.

00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:48.530
You might have heard people refer

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.013
to Jewish people as Semitic;

00:01:50.013 --> 00:01:52.579
but also, Arab people are
referred to as Semitic;

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.285
because, according to Biblical accounts,

00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:57.330
they are both viewed as
descendants of Abraham,

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.576
who is a descendant of Shem.

00:01:59.576 --> 00:02:02.258
So they are viewed as Semitic.

00:02:02.258 --> 00:02:06.624
The first real significant
patriarch of the Hebrew Bible

00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:10.986
is considered Abraham,
who I just mentioned.

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:14.486
It has Abraham moving from the City of Ur.

00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:19.914
There's debate on which Ur that is.

00:02:19.914 --> 00:02:24.081
It might be the ancient Sumerian
city in lower Mesopotamia.

00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:27.612
Or, some people believe that

00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:30.479
it was an Ur in upper Mesopotamia.

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.289
But regardless of which
account you take...

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:34.946
Once again, Abraham is considered

00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.221
by many historians as a legendary figure.

00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:38.740
So there's not clear evidence

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.624
that he existed in a historical sense.

00:02:41.624 --> 00:02:44.933
But if you take the accounts
in the Old Testament

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:46.442
and the Hebrew Bible,

00:02:46.442 --> 00:02:49.478
he would have gone with
his family from Ur,

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:52.821
and eventually migrated to Canaan,

00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:57.512
which is in, near, or
around modern-day Israel,

00:02:57.512 --> 00:03:00.693
Lebanon, Palestine, that general area.

00:03:00.693 --> 00:03:03.943
So it's either from this Ur or that Ur.

00:03:05.186 --> 00:03:08.565
And Abraham is considered
the first of the three

00:03:08.565 --> 00:03:11.862
significant patriarchs
for the Jewish people;

00:03:11.862 --> 00:03:15.414
the other two are Isaac and Jacob.

00:03:15.414 --> 00:03:17.330
Once again, I could do a whole series

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.105
of videos on the stories of Abraham.

00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:23.007
But Abraham's first son is Ishmael,

00:03:23.007 --> 00:03:26.560
who he has with the
servant of his wife Sarah

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.045
after they determine
that they're not able to,

00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:31.247
or they don't think that
they're able to, have children.

00:03:31.247 --> 00:03:32.873
According to Biblical accounts,

00:03:32.873 --> 00:03:35.973
Ishmael is viewed as the progenitor,

00:03:35.973 --> 00:03:39.003
as the patriarch of the Arab people.

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:41.580
But later in life, Abraham,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.518
and at this point he is
roughly 100 years old,

00:03:44.518 --> 00:03:46.840
and his wife Sarah, according
to Biblical accounts,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.649
is in her 90s, they have Isaac,

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:53.816
who is considered a significant
patriarch in Judaism.

00:03:55.178 --> 00:03:57.137
This is a painting by Rembrandt

00:03:57.137 --> 00:04:01.304
of the famous Abraham being
willing to sacrifice his son,

00:04:03.078 --> 00:04:06.853
Isaac, but then he gets
stopped at the last minute.

00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:09.995
But it's viewed as a
sign of his willingness

00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:14.322
to his faith in God and his
willingness to follow God.

00:04:14.322 --> 00:04:16.072
Isaac's son is Jacob,

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.913
and Jacob is later named by God as Israel.

00:04:20.913 --> 00:04:23.879
And so, this is where the
word, Israelites, come from,

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.608
and even the modern state of Israel.

00:04:26.608 --> 00:04:29.835
Now, one of Jacob's son is Joseph.

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:31.797
Once again, this is according
to Biblical accounts.

00:04:31.797 --> 00:04:34.363
There isn't a lot of
historical evidence here.

00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:37.858
But it's a fascinating
story, the story of Joseph,

00:04:37.858 --> 00:04:41.120
how he is sold by his
brothers into slavery,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.703
and taken from Canaan to Egypt.

00:04:46.263 --> 00:04:49.236
But Joseph, once again, fascinating story,

00:04:49.236 --> 00:04:51.476
is eventually able to
rise through the ranks,

00:04:51.476 --> 00:04:53.961
become the vizier of Egypt, and later,

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.202
his family, including Jacob,

00:04:56.202 --> 00:04:59.139
come to Egypt when there
is a famine in Canaan.

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.306
And that is the explanation
for the Biblical settlement

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:08.357
of a significant fraction
of the Israelites in Egypt.

00:05:08.357 --> 00:05:10.308
But then they are enslaved.

00:05:10.308 --> 00:05:12.607
According to Biblical accounts,

00:05:12.607 --> 00:05:16.607
they are enslaved for 400
years, over 400 years,

00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:21.662
and that's what you see in this
green line right over here.

00:05:21.662 --> 00:05:25.829
They stay enslaved in Egypt
until we get to Moses,

00:05:26.678 --> 00:05:28.965
who's considered the most significant

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:31.287
of the prophets in the Jewish tradition,

00:05:31.287 --> 00:05:33.609
and one of the very most
significant prophets

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:36.192
amongst Christians and Muslims.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.490
So let's get to Moses.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.231
Moses' story, once again,
one of these famous stories,

00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:46.564
how the pharaoh is feeling threatened by

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:51.012
the growing population
of the Jewish people,

00:05:51.012 --> 00:05:53.003
who, remember, are enslaved.

00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:55.569
And so, as the story goes, he orders all

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.831
newborn Hebrew Jewish boys to be killed,

00:05:58.831 --> 00:06:01.200
but Moses' mother hides Moses,

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.321
and he puts him on a basket in the Nile,

00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:09.721
and the pharaoh's daughter
discovers him, and raises Moses.

00:06:09.721 --> 00:06:11.637
And so, he's able to get an education

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:15.341
and is part of the royal
court of the pharaoh.

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:19.303
But later in life, he sees
a slavemaster that's abusing

00:06:19.303 --> 00:06:22.582
a Jewish person to death, and
then he kills the slavemaster.

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:26.004
And so, he's afraid for his
life, and so he runs away,

00:06:26.004 --> 00:06:29.057
fearing the penalty for
killing the slavemaster,

00:06:29.057 --> 00:06:32.192
and he goes to Mount
Sinai, or Mount Horeb,

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:34.564
and this is where we
think the Biblical mount,

00:06:34.564 --> 00:06:37.274
this is where the current
Mount Sinai, Mount Horeb, is,

00:06:37.274 --> 00:06:39.977
and that's where we think the
Biblical one might have been.

00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:42.534
That's where we have the
story of the burning bush,

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:45.737
where he is commanded by God.

00:06:45.737 --> 00:06:48.384
The angel of the Lord is
speaking through this bush,

00:06:48.384 --> 00:06:50.704
and telling Moses: "Go back, and you need

00:06:50.704 --> 00:06:54.668
"to free the Jewish
people from enslavement."

00:06:54.668 --> 00:06:59.367
And so, he does go back, and
he is able to liberate them.

00:06:59.367 --> 00:07:02.536
Once again, this is a very famous story.

00:07:02.536 --> 00:07:03.964
The pharaoh's armies follow him.

00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:05.183
He parts the Red Sea.

00:07:05.183 --> 00:07:08.280
The pharaoh's army is
eventually destroyed.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:12.447
He takes the Jewish people back
to Mount Sinai, Mount Horeb.

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:16.485
These are sometimes viewed
as two different mountains,

00:07:16.485 --> 00:07:17.751
sometimes the same mountains,

00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.265
different sides of the same mountains.

00:07:19.265 --> 00:07:20.821
We are not exactly sure.

00:07:20.821 --> 00:07:24.162
But most people view them
as the same mountain.

00:07:24.162 --> 00:07:27.331
It was at Mount Sinai, Mount Horeb,

00:07:27.331 --> 00:07:30.164
where now Moses is able to receive

00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:33.937
the famous Ten Commandments,

00:07:33.937 --> 00:07:37.354
and he's able to receive the Jewish laws.

00:07:38.262 --> 00:07:42.783
The first five books of the
Hebrew Bible, the Torah,

00:07:42.783 --> 00:07:46.696
the Pentateuch, the first five
books of the Old Testament:

00:07:46.696 --> 00:07:50.746
Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, and Deuteronomy,

00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:54.496
the authorship of these
is ascribed to Moses.

00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:59.521
Once again, historians really debate that,

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:02.850
but this is according
to Biblical accounts.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.100
Now, once he receives this word of God,

00:08:07.332 --> 00:08:10.757
he then takes the Jewish people,
they set up a tabernacle,

00:08:10.757 --> 00:08:13.415
they go through the desert for 40 years,

00:08:13.415 --> 00:08:16.387
and he brings them to the promised land,

00:08:16.387 --> 00:08:18.663
and before entering, Moses dies.

00:08:18.663 --> 00:08:20.741
But he, essentially, is able to resettle

00:08:20.741 --> 00:08:23.491
the Jewish people back in Canaan.
