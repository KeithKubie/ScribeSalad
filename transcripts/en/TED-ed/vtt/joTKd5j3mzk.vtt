00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:07.415
Without a doubt,

00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:10.174
the most exciting scientific observation of 2012

00:00:10.174 --> 00:00:12.087
was the discovery of a new particle

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:13.147
at the CERN laboratory

00:00:13.147 --> 00:00:15.206
that could be the Higgs boson,

00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:18.620
a particle named after physicist Peter Higgs.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.876
The Higgs Field is thought to give mass

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:21.592
to fundamental, subatomic particles

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:22.471
like the quarks

00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:23.053
and leptons

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:24.955
that make up ordinary matter.

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:27.551
The Higgs bosons are wiggles in the field,

00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:28.435
like the bump you see

00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:29.937
when you twitch a rope.

00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:32.662
But how does this field give mass to particles?

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:34.440
If this sounds confusing to you,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.682
you're not alone.

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:38.386
In 1993, the British Science Minister

00:00:38.386 --> 00:00:40.715
challenged physicists to invent a simple way

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:42.728
to understand all this Higgs stuff.

00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:45.192
The prize was a bottle of quality champagne.

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:47.810
The winning explanation went something like this:

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.698
Suppose there's a large cocktail party

00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:50.730
at the CERN laboratory

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.323
filled with particle physics researchers.

00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:56.418
This crowd of physicists represents the Higgs field.

00:00:56.418 --> 00:00:58.660
If a tax collector entered the party,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.008
nobody would want to talk to them,

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:01.969
and they could very easily cross the room

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.264
to get to the bar.

00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:05.503
The tax collector wouldn't interact with the crowd

00:01:05.503 --> 00:01:06.807
in much the same way

00:01:06.807 --> 00:01:09.641
that some particles don't interact with the Higgs field.

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:11.212
The particles that don't interact,

00:01:11.212 --> 00:01:12.897
like photons for example,

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:14.441
are called massless.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:17.186
Now, suppose that Peter Higgs entered the same room,

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:19.030
perhaps in search of a pint.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.092
In this case, the physicists

00:01:20.092 --> 00:01:22.022
will immediately crowd around Higgs

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:23.155
to discuss with him

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:24.862
their efforts to measure the properties

00:01:24.862 --> 00:01:26.566
of his namesake boson.

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:28.763
Because he interacts strongly with the crowd,

00:01:28.763 --> 00:01:30.930
Higgs will move slowly across the room.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.194
Continuing our analogy,

00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:33.926
Higgs has become a massive particle

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:36.039
through his interactions with the field.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.948
So, if that's the Higgs field,

00:01:37.948 --> 00:01:40.320
how does the Higgs boson fit into all of this?

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.177
Let's pretend our crowd of party goers

00:01:42.177 --> 00:01:44.552
is uniformly spread across the room.

00:01:44.552 --> 00:01:46.957
Now suppose someone pops their head in the door

00:01:46.957 --> 00:01:48.342
to report a rumor of a discovery

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:50.677
at some distant, rival laboratory.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.673
People near the door will hear the rumor,

00:01:52.673 --> 00:01:54.258
but people far away won't,

00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:56.138
so they'll move closer to the door to ask.

00:01:56.138 --> 00:01:58.297
This will create a clump in the crowd.

00:01:58.297 --> 00:01:59.846
As people have heard the rumor,

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:01.258
they will return to their original positions

00:02:01.258 --> 00:02:03.120
to discuss its implications,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.178
but people further away will then ask what's going on.

00:02:06.178 --> 00:02:08.067
The result will be a clump in the crowd

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:09.758
that moves across the room.

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:12.534
This clump is analogous to the Higgs boson.

00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:13.763
It is important to remember

00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:15.623
that it is not that massive particles

00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:17.372
interact more with the Higgs field.

00:02:17.372 --> 00:02:18.906
In our analogy of the party,

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:21.676
all particles are equal until they enter the room.

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:24.620
Both Peter Higgs and the tax collector have zero mass.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.512
It is the interaction with the crowd

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.591
that causes them to gain mass.

00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:29.990
I'll say that again.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.036
Mass comes from interactions with a field.

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:34.488
So, let's recap.

00:02:34.488 --> 00:02:36.298
A particle gets more or less mass

00:02:36.298 --> 00:02:38.126
depending on how it interacts with a field,

00:02:38.126 --> 00:02:40.258
just like different people will move through the crowd

00:02:40.258 --> 00:02:43.940
at different speeds depending on their popularity.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.033
And the Higgs boson is just a clump in the field,

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:47.097
like a rumor crossing the room.

00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:48.945
Of course, this analogy is just that --

00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:50.165
an analogy,

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:51.315
but it's the best analogy

00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:53.118
anyone has come up with so far.

00:02:53.118 --> 00:02:54.310
So, that's it.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.171
That's what the Higgs Field

00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:57.277
and the Higgs boson is all about.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.418
Continuing research will tell us if we found it,

00:02:59.418 --> 00:03:01.176
and the reward will probably be more

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:03.543
than just a bottle of champagne.
