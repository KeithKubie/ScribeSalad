00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.400
Get your gloves, and safety equipment, because
in this project, we're exploring 5 ways to

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.340
start a fire, using water.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.719
Grab an old light bulb and chisel out the
bottom, so you can see down inside. Now pour

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.349
in a bit of hot water, and when you shake
it vigorously, you'll notice the white coating

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.509
washes right out. After you've rinsed it a
couple of times, you should have a crystal

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.669
clear bulb like this. Fill the lightbulb with
water, cap the bottom with a balloon, and

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.360
voila! You've just created a makeshift magnifying
glass. Go ahead and use your liquid lightbulb,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.390
to focus the sunlight on a piece of newspaper.
It should start smoking immediately, and just

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.830
a minute later, burst into flames.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.500
Find a small dish and line it with plastic
wrap, in a way that takes the shape of the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.930
bowl. You can add water until the bowl is
nearly full, and gather each of the plastic

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.690
corners at the top. This will form a little
liquid pouch, and by twisting the corners

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.329
together, you can seal the water inside. You've
just formed, a clear liquid sphere, that fits

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.670
in the palm of your hand. Now put the sun
behind you, and focus the light, on a dark

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.899
piece of paper. Your tinder should start smoking
within seconds, and when enough embers have

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.599
collected inside, you'll soon have your fire.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.840
Take a picture frame, and cover it with a
layer of plastic wrap, then suspend it on

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.549
something, a couple feet off the ground. Now
carefully pour hot water onto the plastic,

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.280
and as you do, it will begin to sag, forming
a natural, and effective liquid lens. Now

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.420
gather up something you can use as tinder,
and find the focal point of the beam, to concentrate

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.310
the heat. When your tinder's smoldering, set
it down so it rests in the beam, and now you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.010
can sit back and watch the elements ignite
the fire for you, completely hands free.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.810
Try to find a juice bottle, that looks like
a giant plastic bubble, and fill it with water.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.499
Position the liquid filled bubble between
the sun, and your tinder pile, until you find

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.389
the spot where it starts smoking. Hold everything
steady, so the heat will continue to build,

00:01:56.389 --> 00:02:00.299
then add something like dried grass, to help
you lift the pile up, and blow the smoldering

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.040
embers into a flame.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.829
If the clouds have rolled over, and blocked
off your solar supply, you can use a toilet

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.190
paper roll, and a couple chunks of sodium.
The paper roll should be cut in half, with

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.860
a small piece, cut out of the bottom, and
a wad of tissue pushed into the top. We can

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.190
use the lid of a jar as our starter base,
and cover it with one square of toilet paper,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.540
and place the small bits of sodium in the
middle. The paper roll sits overtop, followed

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.750
by a heavier gauge kindling, like a bunch
of straw, or dried grass. Now carefully pour

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.530
a tablespoon of water into the base, and run
away. In just a couple of seconds, a little

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.030
flame shoots out, igniting the kindling on
top. You can see how this would stoke a blazing

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.780
fire, in just a matter of seconds.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.820
Now every experiment has it's dangers, so
if you try these methods yourself, make sure

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.760
you have proper safety equipment, as well
as adult supervision.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.650
Well now you know 5 ways to use water, to
start a fire.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.170
