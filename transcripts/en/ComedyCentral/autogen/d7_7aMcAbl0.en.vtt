00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 align:start position:0%
school and I saw them like how they're
 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.270 align:start position:0%
school and I saw them like how they're
cool<00:04:56.840><c> with</c><00:04:57.840><c> a</c><00:04:57.870><c> lot</c><00:04:58.080><c> of</c><00:04:58.110><c> like</c><00:04:58.289><c> trickshot</c><00:04:58.889><c> stuff</c>

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
cool with a lot of like trickshot stuff
 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
cool with a lot of like trickshot stuff
so<00:04:59.490><c> it's</c><00:04:59.610><c> like</c><00:04:59.760><c> throwing</c><00:05:00.150><c> a</c><00:05:00.419><c> football</c><00:05:00.660><c> into</c><00:05:01.620><c> a</c>

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 align:start position:0%
so it's like throwing a football into a
 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.710 align:start position:0%
so it's like throwing a football into a
basketball<00:05:02.460><c> hoop</c><00:05:02.669><c> like</c><00:05:03.060><c> from</c><00:05:03.270><c> the</c><00:05:03.360><c> top</c><00:05:03.510><c> of</c><00:05:03.630><c> the</c>

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
basketball hoop like from the top of the
 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.060 align:start position:0%
basketball hoop like from the top of the
stadium<00:05:03.930><c> and</c><00:05:04.169><c> I</c><00:05:04.349><c> think</c><00:05:04.530><c> the</c><00:05:04.620><c> trick</c><00:05:04.860><c> is</c><00:05:05.039><c> that</c>

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 align:start position:0%
stadium and I think the trick is that
 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
stadium and I think the trick is that
they<00:05:05.550><c> just</c><00:05:05.789><c> try</c><00:05:06.180><c> it</c><00:05:06.240><c> a</c><00:05:06.510><c> hundred</c><00:05:06.900><c> times</c><00:05:07.110><c> and</c>

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 align:start position:0%
they just try it a hundred times and
 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.050 align:start position:0%
they just try it a hundred times and
