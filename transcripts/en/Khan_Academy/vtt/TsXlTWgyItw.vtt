00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.650
Let's say we wanted to figure
out the equilibrium constant

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.550
for the reaction boron
trifluoride in the gaseous

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.840
plus 3-- so for every mole of
this, we're going to have 3

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.570
moles of H2O in the liquid
state-- and that's in

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.036
equilibrium.

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:27.060
It's going forward and backwards
with 3 moles of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.060
hydrofluoric acid, so it's
in the aqueous state.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.760
It's been dissolved
in the water.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.000
If it wasn't dissolved, if it
was in the solid state, you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.540
would call this hydrogen
fluoride.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.030
Once it's in water, you call
it hydrofluoric acid, and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.820
we'll talk more about naming
in the future, hopefully.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.030
Plus 1 mole of boric acid, also
in the aqueous state.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.820
It's dissolved in the water.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.680
H3BO3 in the aqueous state.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.000
So what would the expression for
the equilibrium constant

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.180
look like in this situation?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.370
So you might be tempted say, OK,
that's easy enough, Sal.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.700
So the equilibrium constant,
you just take

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.300
the right-hand side.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.280
That's just the convention.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.110
There's symmetry here.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.150
I could've rewritten it either
way, but let's just say you

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.370
take the right-hand side and
say, OK, this is dependent on

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.070
the concentration of the
hydrofluoric acid, the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.920
concentration of the HF, or the
molarity of the HF, to the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.680
third power, times the
concentration of the boric

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.840
acid, H3BO3.

00:01:40.725 --> 00:01:43.355
And remember, this intuition of
why you're taking this to

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:45.760
the third power is what's the
probability-- because in order

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.300
for the reaction to go this
way, you need to have 3

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.810
molecules of hydrofluoric acid
being very close to 1 molecule

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.300
of the boric acid.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.650
So if you watched the last video
I just made about the

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.270
intuition behind the equilibrium
constant, this is

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.820
indicative of the probability of
this reaction happening or

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.669
the probability of finding
all of these

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.600
molecules in the same place.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.450
Of course, you can adjust it
with a constant and that's

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.770
essentially what that does.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.490
But that's on the product
side, or the reactant,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.510
depending on what direction
you're viewing this equation,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:31.150
divided by the molarity of the
boron trifluoride times-- and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.360
I'll do this in a different
color-- the molarity of the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.230
H2O to the third power.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.700
And that's, of course,
the H2O liquid.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.410
So there you go.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.580
We'll just figure this out.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.200
And my rebuttal to you is I
want you to figure out the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.590
molarity of the water.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.580
What is the concentration
of the water?

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.810
Remember, the concentration is
moles per volume, but in this

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.960
case, what's happening?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.030
I'm putting some boron
trifluoride gas essentially

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.090
into some water, and it's
creating these aqueous acids.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.120
These other molecules
are dissolved

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.700
completely in the water.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.600
So what's the solvent here?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.850
The solvent is H2O.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.980
This might be how the reaction
happens, but pretty much,

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.150
there's water everywhere.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.000
The water is in surplus.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.630
So if you were to really figure
out the concentration

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.150
of water, it's everywhere.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.860
I mean, you could say everything
but the boron

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.820
trifluoride, but it's
a very high number.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.900
And if you think about it from
the probability point of view,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.670
if you say, OK, in order for
this reaction to happen

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.680
forward, I need to figure out
the probability of finding a

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.710
boron trifluoride atom or
molecule-- actually,

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.650
molecule-- in a certain volume,
and it also needs 3

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.760
moles of water in that
certain volume.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.310
But you say, hey, there's
water everywhere.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.140
This is the solvent.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.740
There's water everywhere, so
I really just need to worry

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.360
about the concentration of
the boron trifluoride.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.880
So you could say the forward
reaction rate, rate forward,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.200
is going to be dependent on some
forward constant times

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.570
just the concentration of
the boron trifluoride.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.510
The water's everywhere, so you
don't have to multiply it

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.810
times the concentration of
water, whatever that means,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.650
because the water's
everywhere.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.040
So the denominator here, you
do not put the solvent.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.430
So the correct answer for this
one is you only put whatever

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.890
is actually dissolved
in the solution.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.710
Because frankly, the
concentration doesn't actually

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.255
makes sense for everything else,
and if you think about

00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:40.850
it from the probability point
of view, that also makes

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.290
sense, because there's
always water around.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.700
If you said, OK, what's the
probability of finding water

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.940
at any small volume of our
fluid, it's going to be 1, so

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.820
you could just multiply it by
a 1 there, but that doesn't

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.270
make a difference.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.720
Now, what about the following
reaction?

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.410
Any equilibrium where you have
different states of matter is

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.020
called a heterogeneous
equilibrium.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.610
And so let me write another
heterogeneous equilibrium.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.810
So let's say I have H2O in the
gaseous state and that's

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.830
essentially steam-- so it's not
going to be the solvent

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.640
this time-- plus carbon
in the solid state.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.120
And let's say that that's an
equilibrium with hydrogen in

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.940
the gas state plus carbon
dioxide in the gaseous state.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.060
This is a heterogeneous
equilibrium because you have

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.610
things in the gaseous
and the solid state.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.970
And solid state, by definition,
it can't be

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.840
dissolved either into the gas
or into the-- when we talk

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.490
about solutions, we talked about
colloids and suspensions

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.170
and mixtures before, but we're
talking about solutions.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.690
By definition, if this
is in the solid

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.620
state, it's not dissolved.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.130
If this was dissolved, we
would write an aq here.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.170
It would be the aqueous state.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.840
So if you talk about the forward
reaction, what's the

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.800
forward reaction going
to be dependent on?

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.670
So the rate forward, well, the
solid, there's a big block of

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.130
carbon sitting there.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.880
There's a big cube of carbon
there, and there's steam,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.020
there's water gas
all around it.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.600
So if you pick any volume,
especially if you pick some

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.760
volume near the boundary of
the carbon, you're always

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.290
going to have carbon around.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.330
It's just what matters
is the concentration

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.580
of the water gas.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.180
That's what's going to drive
the forward rate, so the

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.150
forward rate is going to be
dependent on some constant

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:49.300
times the concentration
of the water gas.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.340
And, of course, the backwards
rate, so you need to get some

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.060
H2, some molecules of-- let me
draw it like that, because it

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.230
has 2 hydrogen molecules plus
a carbon dioxide, so maybe a

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.170
carbon dioxide looks
like that.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.210
So the reverse reaction, so
rate, let's call that reverse,

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.100
is going to be equal to some
constant times the probability

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.980
of finding both of these
molecules in the same place.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.340
And, of course, the probability
is related to or

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.720
it's on a first-level
approximation, depending on

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.590
the concentration.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.775
So it's concentration of H2
times the concentration-- and

00:07:29.775 --> 00:07:31.640
to find both of them, you
multiply the probability,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.330
because you need this
and that-- times the

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.520
concentration of CO.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.030
So when a reaction is in
equilibrium, these two equal

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.640
each other-- this is an r right
here-- so this is going

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.880
to be equal to the reverse
rate of reaction H2 times

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.390
carbon dioxide.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.540
Divide both sides by the K's,
both sides by the H2O, and you

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:01.020
get the forward coefficient or
constant or whatever you want

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.460
to call that, divided by the
reverse constant-- I'm just

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:09.440
dividing both sides by that-- is
equal to this-- let me just

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.480
copy and paste that-- is equal
to that divided by this.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.930
You take that and you
divide it by that.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.875
And so if we call this the
equilibrium constant, because

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.950
it's just two arbitrary
constants, so we can just call

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.360
this the equilibrium constant,
you see that it actually makes

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.710
a lot of sense to ignore
the solid state in your

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.760
equilibrium reaction.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.770
So the two takeaways here
is when you're trying to

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.690
calculate an equilibrium
constant, you should ignore--

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.360
especially when it's in a
heterogeneous equilibrium--

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.250
you should ignore the

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.970
solution-- or not the solution.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.370
Ignore the solvent in that first
example, where I did it

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.250
with boron trifluoride
with water.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.890
Water was the solvent,
so I ignored it.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.010
Because water is everywhere,
and you also

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.220
ignore the solid state.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.330
Ignore the solid.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.173
Anyway, we'll probably use these
in future things where

00:09:13.173 --> 00:09:15.880
we actually calculate the
equilibrium constant.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.890
See you in the next video where
we'll learn about Le

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.260
Chatelier's principle.
