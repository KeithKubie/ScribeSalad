00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here I've recopied the grammar.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I've abbreviated the non-terminals a bit.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Subject became subj, and probably whether or not these are upper

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or lower case has been a little iffy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's allow all of those details for now.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I don't care about case.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We just care about the concepts in grammar.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And now down here I've written 6 possible utterances:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
students think, teachers write, plus 4 more.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's quiz time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In this multiple, multiple choice quiz,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'd like you to identify which of these 6 utterances

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
could be derived using this grammar starting from sentence.

00:00:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And again, don't worry about exact spelling or upper or lower case.
