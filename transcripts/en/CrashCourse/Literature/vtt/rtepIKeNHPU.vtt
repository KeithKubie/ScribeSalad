00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Hi, I'm John Green and this is Crash Course Literature.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.320
So for the last few weeks, we've been talking a lot about Dystopias, imaginary societies gone wrong.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.560
Like George Orwell's "1984" is a world of war, surveillance, and mind control.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.340
"The Handmaid's Tale" portrays a toxic landscape in which healthy women are forced to produce offspring for the ruling class.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.420
"Candide" showed us the best of all possible worlds, which was terrible.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.360
And "Parable of the Sower" takes place in an alternate universe where a sloganeering, strongman president presides over a country,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.440
experiencing intense social disorder thanks to climate change. Fortunately none of that stuff has happened, yet,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.320
But today we're gonna talk about our final dystopia of the series, "The Yellow Wallpaper" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.620
And it's about a dystopia that already happened.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840
First published in 1892 in the New England magazine, this story is less of a "what-if" dystopia

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.700
then a "this is happening to me" call to action.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.680
So at first glance the life that Gilman describes in this story might not seem that bad, a young

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.719
woman is married to a doctor and spends all of her time in a country mansion, and I mean all of her time.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.198
But make no mistake about it. The social order in this story is in some ways as oppressive as the others that we've examined.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:16.199
Gilman's narrator is imprisoned within her marriage and her social order and also her house.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.220
And she eventually goes insane trying to preserve her perspective. Today

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.319
I want to talk about Gilman who was a feminist, humanist, sociologist, novelist, poet, and essayist.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.889
I also want to talk about perspectives on mental health, and how they've changed between Gilman's era and ours, and of course

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:35.780
I'm gonna talk about yellow wallpaper. Soon enough you're gonna see it everywhere.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.840
(Intro music plays)

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.280
(music fades)

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.460
So Charlotte Perkins Gilman had a fascinating life.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.490
She was born in Hartford,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.629
Connecticut in 1860 and she lived with her mother and brother, after her father

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.250
abandoned the family, and although she moved from school to school her childhood was really

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.419
intellectually rich, largely because of her three brilliant and famous

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.280
aunts: Isabella Beecher Hooker, suffragist and abolitionist, Harriet Beecher Stowe, best-selling author of Uncle Tom's Cabin, and Katharine Beecher,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.660
education reformer and advocate for Native American rights. With some financial help from her Ne'er-do-well father, Charlotte enrolled in design school. Later

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.049
she supported herself by illustrating advertising cards and tutoring so, you know, she did know something about wallpaper

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.729
patterns. In 1884 she married Charles Walter Stetson and gave birth to a daughter,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.910
Katherine, and in the years after her daughter's birth Charlotte experienced a series of what were called at the time

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.120
"Nervous-Disorders". In 1887 she visited a specialist who encouraged her to try a "rest cure",

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.410
and this involved living as domestic a life as far as possible having

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.619
But two hours intellectual life a day, and never touching pen, brush, or pencil

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.220
again. After three months of this so-called treatment

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.589
she quote "came so near to the borderline of utter mental ruin, that I could see over."

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.669
Gilman wanted to warn others of the dangers of this rest cure and her story she explains was not intended to drive people crazy,

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.319
but to save people from being driven crazy, and it worked.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.090
We'll get to that working bit in a second,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.009
but back to her life. So in 1888, Charlotte left her husband and took Katherine with her to Pasadena,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:26.049
California. Her professional life flourished. She organized social reform movements. She represented California at the suffrage convention in Washington DC.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.119
She became a lecturer and edited a series of

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.459
magazines. She also wrote essays, poems, a novella, and by far her most famous story, "The Yellow Wallpaper."

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.559
Much of her work focused on women's unequal status in marriage and their need for financial independence.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.850
And she achieved financial independence and also an equal marriage in her second marriage.

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.379
Eventually she was diagnosed with breast cancer and as she had lived on her own terms,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.419
she also died on her own terms.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.390
She was an advocate of euthanasia, and she chose chloroform over cancer, committing suicide in 1935.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.138
I wanted to focus a little on Gilman's life story to emphasize that this was a person who experienced severe, disabling

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.339
mental illness and whose treatment ended up making it much worse

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.560
and yet who still went on to live a long, fulfilling, and productive life.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.750
I think it's really helpful to read "The Yellow Wallpaper" with that background. As for the story itself, well,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.239
Let's go to the thought-bubble. "The Yellow Wallpaper" is the

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.698
first-person narrative of a 19th century woman

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:29.499
suffering from a mental breakdown after giving birth. In a secret diary this narrator describes her setting ,"a colonial mansion, a hereditary

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.119
estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity--

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.519
But that would be asking too much of fate!" This narrator is confined to a room with barred windows.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.320
It's possible that she's in an asylum,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.229
But the physical setting is less important than another landscape, the shifting consciousness of her mind.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.590
The narrator knows that she perceives reality differently from her husband, who is also her doctor. At first

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.220
She chalks this up to the expected difficulties of male-female relations. "John," she writes, "laughs at me of course,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.929
But one expects that in marriage." This expectation of marriage is of course troubling in its own right,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:12.729
But there's an even darker side to their dynamic, John has almost complete control over his wife's body. The narrator's descriptions may be at times

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.419
Unreliable, but there are a few things we do know: she recently had a baby,

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.519
She recognizes that she is sick,

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:25.239
John belittles her saying that she suffers from a temporary nervous depression, a slight hysterical tendency. Meanwhile

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.740
he prescribes her a scheduled prescription for each hour in the day of phosphates or

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.470
Phosphites, the narrator doesn't know which, and a regime of tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.129
Also, John forbids his wife from writing,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.109
Working, or socializing and it quickly becomes clear that these so-called cures are

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:50.349
Exacerbating the narrator's condition as she is left with very little to do except stare at the yellow wallpaper.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.389
Thanks thought-bubble. So today

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:57.879
We would probably say that the narrator is experiencing postpartum depression and/or postpartum psychosis.

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:02.919
These are conditions that can result from a drop in hormones like estrogen and progesterone and are

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.599
intensified by the two central experiences of new parenthood, sleep deprivation

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:14.540
and anxiety. Postpartum psychosis can include the depressive symptoms of postpartum depression along with confusion, disorientation,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.380
Hallucinations, and paranoia. Today these conditions would be treated with medication and therapy and other medical interventions,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.409
But whatever treatment John gives his wife in "The Yellow Wallpaper"

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:32.029
Definitely does not work. If Gilman's story were an argument this line from it would be its thesis, "John is a physician,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.750
Perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster."

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.079
Admittedly the 19th century wasn't a golden age for psychiatry,

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.080
But even so, John is

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.519
exceptionally bad at treating mental illness. At the start of the story Gilman's narrator craves more society and

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.019
Stimulus. She writes that she must say what I feel and think in some way.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.769
Forbidden from communicating with a living soul she secretly

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.850
Confesses her thoughts to dead paper in a journal and in her writing

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.399
She projects her mental disintegration onto the patterns that she sees on the walls.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.069
"I never saw worse paper in my life,"

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.400
She writes, explaining that it contains "one of those sprawling

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:18.830
Flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin." Still she finds this pattern compelling: "it is dull enough to confuse the eye and following,

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.370
Pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study...

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.690
And when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:33.410
They suddenly commit suicide --
 plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard of

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.069
Contradictions." Of course this also describes the narrator's interior landscape

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.110
But it also describes the story, right? Like initially her narrative seems dull.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:48.080
I mean plot summary woman stares at wall. But then it becomes confusing the wallpaper seems to be moving

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.850
We aren't sure where this narrator is or if we can trust her and then something becomes

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.850
Pronounced enough to provoke our further study. Are these romantic descriptions of a house, a delicious garden,

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:06.079
Or it's tattered decor? Are they intimate descriptions of a failing marriage, the desire for connection, or are they veiled

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:11.750
Suicidal musings, or maybe they're attempts to find a meaning in an extremely limited

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.310
Experience, like Offred opening her hand in the sunlight in "The Handmaid's Tale."

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:22.670
I've always been fascinated by how the narrator tries to understand her situation in terms of principles of design,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:30.740
Like after she studies one breath or strip of wallpaper she concludes that its pattern is "not arranged on any laws of

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.280
radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symmetry, or

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:41.000
Anything else that I ever heard of." I think anybody who's experienced mental illness can relate to that. For her each of these breaths

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.749
Exists as an isolated column of fatuity, in other words

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:49.850
It's meaningless. A pattern only emerges when she considers the strips next to one another

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:57.769
Dim shapes appear to resemble a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern. The wallpaper also

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:05.450
Changes as the light changes. At night the woman in the wallpapers captivity behind bars becomes as plain as can be,

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.669
So of course does the narrator's own captivity. And also wait hold on full disclosure

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.099
I'm about to go full Freudian which I know is like a

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.390
Frustration and annoyance to many of you who are not like hardcore lit crit people

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.049
But just walk with me on this one. So the paper has this

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:27.109
Peculiar odor that creeps all over the house and is stronger after a week of fog and rain.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:32.300
Her husband might explain it as a combination of glue and mold intensified by humidity

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:39.620
But smells travel through the olfactory bulb closely connected to the regions of the brain that handle memory and emotion.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.160
That's why smells always remind us of moments from our past.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:50.540
And it seems to me the narrator's fixation on this smell could be what Freud called the return of the repressed, or unconscious material

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.310
rising to the surface.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:58.790
And maybe that's part of why the narrator becomes determined that nobody discovered the wallpapers meaning except herself, although

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.829
She had initially craved conversation,

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:06.949
She decides that it does not do to trust people too much, especially with her most frightening thoughts.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.359
I mean after all having previously trusted people with her frightening thoughts has landed her in this situation

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.090
Where she has to stare at yellow wallpaper all day.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:19.790
And then eventually the narrator begins to suspect that many women are trapped inside this paper:

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:27.649
"I think there are great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over." The

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.219
Narrator longs to free this woman or women. On her last day in the house

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:36.770
She locks her door, throws the key into the garden, and tethers herself to the bed which she also bites.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.159
She rips at the wallpaper and thinks that it would be an admirable

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:46.790
exercise to throw herself out the window. Then she wedges her shoulder into a smudge that runs along the lower part of the wall and

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.510
walks hunched over along the periphery of the room, a kind of

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:57.109
Reenactment of the woman stuck behind the wallpaper. John enters the room at last and then faints at the sight of his wife, yet

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.520
She continues her laps crawling over the body of the man who had oppressed her.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.819
"I've got out at last," she announces, "in spite of you and

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:10.849
Jane?" Getting out at last involves rejecting societal norms and defying John and breaking free of

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.510
Jane, a character not mentioned until this point who may be herself?

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:20.029
But then comes this question mark which complicates everything and makes it ambiguous. Charlotte Perkins Gilman

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:27.349
Transformed her experience of enduring this rest cure into a story that invites us to reconsider gender dynamics

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:29.350
And the treatment of mental health disorders.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:34.520
At the time of its publication the story may have inspired concrete change too. In an article published in

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:40.099
1913 Gilman claims that her story quote "has to my knowledge, saved one woman from a similar fate --

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:46.969
So terrifying her family that they let her out into normal activity and she recovered. But the best result is this. Many years later

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:52.130
I was told that my own doctor had admitted to friends of his that he had altered his treatment of

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.919
neurasthenia since reading The Yellow Wallpaper." stories affect the world in mysterious ways and if "The Yellow Wallpaper"

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:03.140
Helped end the practice of separating the sick from the world then I am grateful.

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:09.589
But I think the story has served another far more personal function. It has given form and expression to many people's

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.250
Experiences with mental illness including, I have to say, mine.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.989
It's a story that explores the ways that physiological brain disorders can be hurt or

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:25.099
Helped by treatments and by the way the social order imagines and talks about mental illness. And although we no longer

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:32.989
Embrace rest cures we still have a long way to go when it comes to talking about mental illness without the stigmatization that can worsen

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.939
Suffering. But then also mental illness and the way it's discussed isn't the only Yellow Wallpaper

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:39.890
Out there. I wonder

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:40.980
What is the wallpaper

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.390
That constrains you and who else do you feel might be

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:45.890
imprisoned by its pattern?

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.369
How might you escape, how might you tell your story to

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:53.839
Influence others? Those questions haunted me when I first read Gilman's story in high school

00:12:53.839 --> 00:13:00.319
And they shaped a lot of the ways that I think about writing today. More than 20 years later I'm still asking them.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.490
