00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.706
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.620
&gt;&gt; It is such a pleasure
to finally meet Jane Smiley

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.720
because I've been chasing
after her for years.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.203
I taught at the prep school
in St. Louis that still brags

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.106
about her attendance like
all of you who have read

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.090
and loved "A Thousands Acres",
her Pulitzer Prize winning novel.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.373
Then when I got to the post, I had
the honor of sending her novels

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.400
to review for us, which is one of
the reasons I admire her so much.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.140
She's one of the few
really successful novelists.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.190
She's willing to stay fully
engaged in the critical conversation

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.906
and not just by blurbing
her friend's books,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.443
but by taking literally
criticisms seriously.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.370
Her 1996 essay for Harper's
Magazine about Huck Finn

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.533
and Uncle Tom's Cabin remains
one of the classics of the genre,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.760
and she continues to publish
insightful book reviews

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.840
for us and other publications.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.280
Meanwhile, Smiley's popular and
critically acclaimed novels take us

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.060
into the comedy and the tragedy of
the world around us from farming

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.276
to academics, from real
estate to Hollywood,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.653
and young people are discovering
this talent of author for themselves

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.940
in her young adult novels now.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.583
Winner of the PEN USA Lifetime
Achievement Award for Literature

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.756
in 2006, Jane Smiley is one of the
brightest stars in the constellation

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.023
of a modern American literature.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.023
Please join me in welcoming her.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.390
[ Applause ]

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.350
&gt;&gt; Well, that was a
wonderful introduction.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.593
And I should tell you that when
the Huck Finn article came out,

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.440
it was not greeted as a piece
of great literary criticism.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.756
Harper's tell me that they
received more hate mail

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.190
than they had in 150 years.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.933
I thought that was really an honor.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600
[ Laughter ]

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.800
&gt;&gt; I have to thank you
all for staying this long.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.016
I'm not sure I would have
stayed for even Leo Tolstoy

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.513
at this point of this day.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.236
But it reminds me of a story
that they told me yesterday

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.006
at the Naval Observatory.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.483
This book "Private Life"
contains two characters

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.656
that were part of my family.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.856
And the woman is based on my
great-aunts, and the man, Andrew,

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.530
is based on her crackpot
scientist husband.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.610
And he is still present
on the internet.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.806
And when you type in his name, about
half the stuff that comes up says,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.536
"He's right, he was always right."

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.736
He will be vindicated.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.003
And the machine that
I built in accordance

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.936
with his principles was taken
away from me at US Customs

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.816
and is now being used by the
CIA as a surveillance machine.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.736
So, yesterday, he worked
at the Naval Observatory.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.310
So yesterday I was over there and
they told me the following story.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.553
When he was in-- my aunt
died in the early '50s.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.843
And sometime in the mid '50s,
he decided it was time for him

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.263
to get his Nobel Prize, so he
went to Stockholm to claim it.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.943
And the university there was very
kind to him and an astronomer there

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.120
who did know who he was, set up a
thing where he could talk to a group

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.140
like this, and he did
give this talk.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.553
But unfortunately, he seemed
not to be able to get that--

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.013
extract that Nobel Prize from them.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.950
And so, he decided to go back again.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.083
So two years later,
he went back again.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.456
And that the astronomer, you know,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.503
a man whose kindness is probably
legendary, couldn't get any

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.596
of his fellow astronomers to
come and listen to the sky,

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.236
give the talk anymore,
and so he rounded up all

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.133
of the janitorial staff
at the university.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.880
[ Laughter ]

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.813
&gt;&gt; And he had them sat,
sit through the talk.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.863
And so I hope this is
not the janitorials.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.030
[ Laughter ]

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.843
&gt;&gt; I am gonna read, do something I
haven't done before with this book

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.880
which is to read from
toward the end.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.016
For me, this is a reasonably
well-plotted book.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.983
You may have read "Ten
Days in the Hills,"

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.203
a third of which is graphic sex
and there is no sex in here.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.880
So once you leave out the sex,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.546
you have to introduce
the plot or a plot.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.026
And so at the beginning of
Part 5, there are five parts,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.750
and at the beginning of Part 5,
Margaret feels that she has come

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.006
to understand her husband and to
be able to manage him, you know,

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.076
fatal mistake as you
ladies must know.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.193
And she's now-- she's now about 55.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.266
He is in his late 60s.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.530
He seems to have given up his desire

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.896
to do mortal combat
with Albert Einstein.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.376
He seems to have done that,
and to take up other interests.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.250
And so, I am going to read a
little bit about what happens then.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.270
This is-- you have to imagine this
takes place in December of 1937.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.963
One day, Margaret came
home from a morning visit

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.926
to Mrs. Wareham [phonetic]
to find newspapers laid

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.960
out on the dining room table,
the examiner and the chronicle,

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.976
the Vallejo paper and
the Sacramento Bee.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.903
Andrew was proceeding around
the table reading every word

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.600
about an unfortunate
incident outside of Nanking.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.563
The incident looked quite
straightforward to Margaret.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.253
The Japanese Army had taken Nanking

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.450
which Chiang Kai-shek
had then had to abandon.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.003
In the course of these Japanese
plains, sunken American boat

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.743
because the pilots
didn't see American flags.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.260
Though lots of men were wounded,
only three were killed and most

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.540
of the sailors were rescued
by nearby British boats.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.800
Roosevelt complained and
some admiral apologized.

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.060
By the next day, the Japanese had
offered to pay for the sinking

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.866
of the boat and the foreign
minister himself apologized.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.320
Andrew decided to go over to
the island, he hadn't been there

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.413
in months, and hear what they
were saying in the officer's club

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.360
and anywhere else he
could manage to eavesdrop

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.080
or to get someone into conversation.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.383
He was a light with
investigative purpose.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.260
Margaret was glad to get
him out of the house.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.566
At the end of the week, he even put
in a call to their friend, Pete.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.970
Andrew wasn't the only
person interested, of course.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.110
The ladies in Margaret's
meeting group had talked

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.136
about the incident for an hour.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.826
When he hung up she reported
what they had all agreed upon.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:25.286
But Andrew, when most governments
make a mistake like that,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.146
they covered up for weeks and then
go on for more weeks insisting

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.720
that there was provocation
and then wait

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.333
to be sued for years after that.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.666
"I think this incidence
speaks well of the Japanese."

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.360
"Perhaps it does, but
it's a mystery.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.473
The sailors on the boat said that
the flags were completely visible."

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.603
"Well, then anyway, it seems
outside your usual area."

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.810
"It is an interesting event
in and off itself," he paused,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.593
"and I have been feeling of late

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.616
that I have let the
world get away from me."

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.806
"What did I come across?"

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.340
He said, "Oh, yes, my bird
list from so long ago.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.193
Remember how we walked
about the island

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.270
and looked at gulls and hawks?

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.986
I realized that I haven't
always been a dull boy."

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:25.610
She thought, "Oh, what harm can come
from his getting out of the house

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.980
and diverting himself with this?"

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.056
So she said, "It's worth
looking into them."

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.070
She said reassuring things like this
all the time now while she was going

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.073
about her own business passing
in and out of the room as he was

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:40.270
in on her way to the shop or
to weed or to visit somewhere

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.783
or to coordinating or to work

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.716
with the AIDS Society
should collect it for.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.666
Though her happiness had taken
a little while to set in,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.140
she traced it directly to this
house Andrew had purchased.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:01.156
It was pleasant to wake up and
convenient to all of Vallejo

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.690
and quite suitable
for hosting her share

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.950
of meeting circles
and get-togethers.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.860
After a few days, she quietly put
the newspapers away, and in fact,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.653
forgot the whole thing until she ran
in to Mrs. Kimura around Christmas.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.206
They talked about Neoko
[phonetic], Mrs. Kimura's daughter.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.573
Margaret asked after Mr. Kimura and
Mrs. Kimura asked after the captain.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.586
When Mrs. Kimura declared that she
had just heard from her son, Joe,

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.326
that morning, Joe had moved
to Japan as a dentist,

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.346
thinking there would be
more opportunity there,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.650
but in the three years since going,
had never made up his mind whether

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.790
to stay in Japan or to come home.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.520
Lester could not make up his
mind, that was the other son.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.960
Is that us?

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.240


00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.203
Do you hear that?

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.120
[ Laughter ]

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.920
&gt;&gt; Les-- is there something
we can do here?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.986
&gt;&gt; Okay, Lester-- Lester could
not make up his mind whether

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.093
to join his brother
or to continue working

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.253
for the Pacific Trading Company.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.826
Mrs. Kimura, Neoko, Cassandra,
Mrs. Wareham and Margaret had been

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.663
over the pros and cons
of all the choices.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.520
It was one of their standard
topics of conversation.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.800
Now, Mrs. Kimura reported that Joe
and two of his friends are planning

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.220
to go to the US Embassy
in Tokyo before Christmas

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.160
to leave off a letter of sympathy

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:32.966
and also a monetary contribution
toward the medical and dental needs

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.153
of those wounded aboard
the boat in China.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.623
Margaret exclaimed,
"That's very kind."

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:49.336
Mrs. Kimura said, "Many have done
same thing, wealthy businessmen

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.680
down to simple schoolgirls.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.413
America Ambassador wife
doesn't have moment to herself

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.776
from receiving wives
of high families.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.046
I admit Joe, not think of this,
but two friend to ask him."

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.373
"Even so, they agree
to donate two-week

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.476
from their employment to this."

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.113
She gave Margaret a happy smile,
"And Joe says he found a bride

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.273
from good family 26-year-old.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.060
She has business sewing
western style dress

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.056
for wealthy Japanese wives."

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:26.683
"Two weeks pay, though.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.290
To me I see because of this that
Japanese people will prevail

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.600
over the warriors of the army.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.023
Emperor is being pulled into.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.133
He knows that Japanese people
don't like war in China,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.250
but the army foils
their wishes every time.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.323
Two-week pay for this is how
much Japanese people want

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.700
to live in peace."

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:50.203
Later Margaret wished she had not
mentioned this encounter at supper.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.416
Andrew was skeptical and Margaret
was rather sharp when she said,

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.636
"They have been forthcoming,
very forthcoming."

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.940
"Well, my dear, there
is literally always more

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.210
to everything than meets the eye.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.453
The eye is a very poor
instrument for seeing anything.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.250
Over on the island, they
are very, very suspicious."

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.260
"Of what, though?"

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.990
Her voice was rising.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.856
She inhaled deeply.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.456
"What did it matter really?"

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.393
She adopt a neutral
expression, it helped.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.716
"Of some slight of hand,
the orange will be pulled

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.696
out from behind the ear biggest
life, and how did it get there

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:43.153
when the magician was
wearing short sleeves?"

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.930
She laughed.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:46.996
It wasn't very often the
Andrew made her laugh,

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:48.153
and he gave her a gratifying smile.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.573
And then the incident of the boat,
the Panei [phonetic] was resolved,

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.243
and the papers completely
stopped talking about it.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.270
Space, Andrew has been talking

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.270
about cosmology practically
their entire wedding,

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:11.756
I mean their entire marriage, but
he seems to have given that up.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.400
So, it goes on.

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.910
Without the universe, the big
house was too small for him,

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.980
the steep steps too shallow,
the high ceilings too low,

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.240
the spacious rooms only
a stridor too long.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.330
Whatever she was doing, knitting
or reading or cleaning or cooking,

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.510
there was the constant drum of
footsteps, boot steps, really.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:38.826
So she was happy when he
went out, dressed nicely,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.013
always in a suit and
well-shined shoes.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.933
He carried a walking stick and
wore hat to keep off the sun.

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.700
He walked fast and he was
healthy for a man of his age.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.703
He would never be mistaken for a
bum or a ne'er-do-well, she thought.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.573
It was Officer Napolitano and
Officer Kelly who stopped by one day

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.570
and told her that once in a
while he would flag someone

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:09.886
down driving a car.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.923
Once in a greater while, that
person would stop, no doubt thinking

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.943
that Andrew was an old
man and distressed.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:18.766
Andrew would open the
passenger door and get

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.306
in telling the driver almost
always a woman to drive him

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:28.886
over the causeway to the island
or perhaps somewhere downtown.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:29.800
One poor girl took
him about for an hour

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.300
and a half while he
did various errands.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.603
The girl thought he was lost
and didn't want to abandon him.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:39.633
The girl didn't even
know what the Panei was.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.740
She thought he was saying Panama.

00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.896
Margaret said, "I thought he
had forgotten about the Panei,

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.356
but is he in some sort of danger
or is he a danger to other stepping

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.646
into the street suddenly,
is that the problem?"

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.666
"Ma'am, it is that he is relentless
in engaging people in conversation.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.543
He won't let them turn
away or refuse to answer.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:07.176
And when they do answer, he hooks
his finger into their button holes

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.796
and won't let them get away.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:13.463
When they complain to us,
then they complain to us.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:15.973
Personally, ma'am, I'm afraid
someone is gonna pop him

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:20.420
in the nose one day."

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.246
"Are his opinions that
controversial?"

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:25.376
He said, "Oh no, ma'am,
it's not that.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.170
Here's an example.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:29.126
He flagged down Officers
Lugano and Moore

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:31.813
who brought him here the other day.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.813
You were out, ma'am.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.466
He sat in the car with one foot
in the street and the door opened

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.960
for 45 minutes before they
could get rid of him."

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.816
Margaret chuckled and said, "They
should have taken him to jail."

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:46.580
"Would that frightened them, ma'am?"

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.380
Officer Napolitano looked
very earnest and young.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:54.166
She guessed he was about 25 or 26.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.410
She shook her head, her tone
still light, "From what you say,

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.776
he would just engage everyone in
the station in conversation and ask

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.183
for rides here and there."

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.316
"I don't doubt that, ma'am."

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:07.460
"But do these young women seem
to feel threatened in anyway?"

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.773
"Oh no ma'am, not in the usual way.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.090
They seem to feel that
it is rather like being

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.930
with an elderly eccentric relative."

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.463
"But Captain Early has
old-fashioned courtly manners."

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:23.916
"All of the young ladies
say that, ma'am.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:31.263
But one young woman had a job to get
to and he made her two hours late."

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.843
"Oh dear," they were
smiling but making it clear

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.043
that this could not go on.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.003
She said, "Officer, I do apologize,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.893
but my husband is frustrated
in his work."

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.356
"Oh, we know that, ma'am.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:48.773
We know that Albert Einstein
has backed him at every turn

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.700
and now comes to Vallejo
to spy on him."

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.460
Actual alarm displaced the
confusion she had been feeling.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:01.980
"Einstein?"

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.980
"Oh yes, ma'am.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:05.246
He told Officers Lugarno and Moore

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:07.513
that he saw Einstein
on Capital Street.

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.646
He thought maybe Einstein had
come to Vallejo to see him

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.060
but he wasn't able to make
himself known to Einstein

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.233
on that particular occasion."

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.570
They all three side
at the same time.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.520
Finally, she said,
"I see what you mean,

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.140
Officer Kelly, I'll talk to him."

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.826
But first she called on
Mrs. Wareham at the hotel.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.466
The Warrington was a good business
and a respected establishment.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.076
Over the years with her
multitude of borders and guests,

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.350
many are most of whom are men,

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.410
Margaret suspected Mrs. Wareham
had seen a great many things.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.526
Andrew, as it turned out,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.026
came in there everyday
and had a cup of coffee.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:50.713
Mrs. Wareham said, "Margaret,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:51.670
I thought you knew you
were sending him to me?

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.450
He's here promptly at 9:30.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.203
He gives me your best greetings
and he drinks the cup of coffee

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.626
with a lump of sugar
and reads his paper.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:00.966
He stays about an hour
and then says goodbye

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.300
and goes out, rain
or shine, really."

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:06.423
"But haven't you heard
about his activities?"

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:09.530
"Not at all."

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:14.140
She told her friend what the
police told her then said,

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.003
"Does he talk all the time and make
people discuss the war in China?"

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:18.810
"He never says a word
about anything.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:21.306
He just nurses his cup of
coffee and then pays and goes.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.553
He always leaves the
girl a nice tip too."

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:28.663
"But what should I do?"

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.183
"Well, Margaret, first
you must inform him

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:32.563
in no uncertain terms what--
that these girls aren't sailors

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.196
and he can't become
endearing their services

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:39.716
as he once did those young men.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.070
They all did that.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:42.003
It was part of being a captain."

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.136
"Well, that's true.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.803
I should've remembered that."

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:48.276
"And you must say that it looks
very strange to the police.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.330
That will catch his attention.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.366
You and I know Captain Early,
he is the reticent of men,

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.760
but he is very large also."

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:02.263
The thought made her nervous.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.090
Mrs. Wareham leaned
toward her and said,

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.356
"I see you're shaking your
head as you always do."

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:08.670
Margaret hadn't realized that
she was shaking her head.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:13.530
She made herself sit still.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:14.113
"For once in your life,
Margaret, you must take charge

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:19.346
at the situation, take
charge of him."

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.720
I have to say, despite
of her best efforts,

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.320
Margaret must have
continued to look dismayed.

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.543
"I mean this kindly, dear.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.210
You are who you are."

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:31.810
"Who is that?

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.810
Who is that?"

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:36.810
Margaret found herself saying.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.303
There was a long pause that Mrs.
Wareham looked a little embarrassed.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:43.516
She said, "Everyone knows
you're a good woman, Margaret.

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.220
Everyone knows that."

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.666
It sounded like an insult but
it had the desired effect.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.746
That evening she cooked
Andrew's favorite supper dish

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:54.886
and also made a pie since there was
some nice rhubarb in the market.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.500
Not quite sure how to approach
her subject, she hummed and hawed

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.660
about the weather, but
finally she said, "Andrew,

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.276
I understand you have met
Officer Lugano and Moore

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.556
of the Vallejo Police Department."

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.000
&gt;&gt; "Indeed I have.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.293
They were most interested
in my investigations."

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:16.903
"I didn't know you were
pursuing investigations, Andrew?"

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.710
"Well, of course I am
into the Panei incident.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.253
Surely you haven't forgotten that."

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.810
His tone was affable.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:28.606
"You mean that boat that was sunk in
China, the reparations were paid."

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.423
He took a last bite of
liver, sat down his fork,

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:35.580
and carefully wiped his
mustache with his napkin.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.893
He shook his said, "Yes,
they were, a clever gambit

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.450
and cheap in the long run."

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.283
"Do you think so?

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.280
Mrs. Kimura told me how generous
the Japanese people have been?"

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.553
"Yes, yes, no denying that, but
my dear, I am now free to tell you

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.723
that I have solved the mystery."

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.010
"You have?"

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.803
"Oh yes I have, and I have informed
the Vallejo police of my views

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.203
and I have sent letters to
the Common down to the Base

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.600
to the Secretary of State, and
of course, to the New York Times.

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.060
I mailed them yesterday.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:12.976
I feel that I can talk
more freely about this even

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:17.943
to you having committed
my ideas to paper.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.533
And certainly I hope,
although I have no assurance,

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.530
that the Times will
publish my conclusions.

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.136
I believe that we would all be safer
in the end if they were to do so."

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:32.243
Then they talked a little
bit about the Panei incident

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.936
and I'm not gonna tell
you about that.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.360
And then she listens to
everything he has to say.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.736
She's a little disturbed.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:51.670
And then she says, "Perhaps in order
to change the subject", she said,

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:58.153
"And the police also told
me you've seen Einstein."

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.670
"Oh yes, indeed twice now."

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:05.750
He seemed happy to talk about it.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.503
"He is surprisingly short.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:12.236
He wears glasses and his suit
was rumpled, but of good twill."

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.863
He coughed and went on.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.996
"He does wear nice shoes.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.596
His feet are small.

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:19.796
It looked to me like he has
his shoes made in England

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:20.820
and his hair isn't as wild
as it looks in pictures."

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.440
She said, "You noticed his shoes?

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.356
Were you staring at him?"

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:30.440
"I am a naturally observant person."

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.216
"I've never seen him in
glasses in the newspaper."

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.073
"That surprised me too.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.340
He looks older than he is."

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.606
"He must be 60."

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.073
"He looks 70 if a day."

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:45.340
"Maybe it wasn't Einstein?"

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.606
"Maybe, indeed."

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.340
She ventured, "Why do
you think he's here?"

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.660
"I have thought the first time
that he was here to see me.

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:59.990
And I was prepared to extend
the aisle of branch, I must say,

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.993
but I am more suspicious now.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.753
I'm glad I did not reveal myself

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:07.640
to him the first time
as I had thought to do."

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.126
She got up without
saying anything and began

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:12.393
to clear the dishes from the table.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.120
How to proceed was a mystery to her.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.666
He was evidently delusional about
both the Japanese and Einstein,

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.950
but also she thought harmless.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:23.830
She took the dishes to the kitchen
and set them beside the sink.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:27.796
When she came back into the
dining room, fortifying herself

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:29.883
with thoughts of Mrs. Wareham's very
earnest instructions, she sat down,

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.083
not across from Andrew,
but beside him,

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.440
and she put her hand on his knee.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.030
She leaned forward
and said, "Andrew,

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.406
I am sure that those whom you
contacted will read your letters

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.170
with utmost interest and respect,

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.790
and I hope that when
you conclude it,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.133
what you've concluded shows
them what they must do.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.283
But at the same time, the
policeman here today told me

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:00.416
that you have been waving down
automobiles and then getting in

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.260
and telling the drivers that they
must take you here and there."

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.053
"Young people don't mind."

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:12.903
"Maybe not, but if these
young people are young girls,

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:17.650
I am absolutely certain that their
parents would object to you--

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.740
what was the phrase here-- diverting
them from their regular business.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.373
If you want to get around,
you have to use the street car

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:28.486
or I will drive you myself."

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.606
"My dear, what I need to do is not
always systematic or well-organized,

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.720
I am led here and there
by my investigations."

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.950
"But your investigations
seemed to be over in part."

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:48.090
"The police made it clear to
me," here she caught his gaze

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.960
and held it, "You must not
impose yourself upon any women.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:57.930
You must not.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:24:59.170
Doing so after the
police have asked you

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.556
to stop could seriously
compromise your reputation

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.270
in Vallejo and on the island."

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.173
He looked genuinely startled, and
said, "I hadn't thought of that.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:18.440
I was only-- " "Yes, Andrew, I
am sure you were only thinking

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.323
of the next step in
your investigation.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:23.956
But it looks different to others."

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:26.286
"People know I'm enthusiastic."

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:27.940
"They do, but not everyone knows you

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.140
in town the way they
did on the island."

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.816
This he seemed to accept.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.310


00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.510
[ Applause ]

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:47.896
I like the questions part, so
jump up, run to the microphones.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.503
I'll answer questions about any
book and most anything else.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.353
So, most anything else.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:01.700
Yes?

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.433
&gt;&gt; I wanted to tell you how
very much I enjoyed your book

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:08.116
"A Thousand Acres."

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:12.316
I was really inspired
especially by the writing style

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.546
in the first part scenario
which I really love.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:20.896
And it was because of that
inspiration that I decided

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:23.010
to throw my own hand
at writing a novel.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.410
&gt;&gt; Oh, really?

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.953
&gt;&gt; And as because of my research, I
wrote a novel about George Gershwin.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:29.923
I discovered that you
were born on his birthday.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:33.676
&gt;&gt; I was, tomorrow.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.543
&gt;&gt; Yes, tomorrow.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:36.543
So, I like to wish you a happy--

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:38.610
&gt;&gt; T.S. Eliot has joined us also.

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:41.610
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay, okay.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:46.476
Anyway, I was wondering sometimes
it seems as if really people

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:49.193
who are well established as writers

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.890
like you are really wouldn't
know an answer to this question,

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.230
but I'm gonna ask it anyway,
what should a person do

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.146
who believes they have
written a really good novel

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.046
but they just can't find an agent
and they've tried very hard?

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.540


00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:06.216
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:08.150
[ Laughter ]

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.030
&gt;&gt; One of the problems is that
if you're starting out and you're

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.936
in a school or a program,
then it's easier to network

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.820
and get connected to
somebody like that.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.973
And so, one of the things I
always advice writers that no

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:31.716
of what ever age is don't hesitate
to join a program, don't hesitate

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.190
to join a writing group, don't
hesitate to join a book group.

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:39.676
Networking is really important,
and you know, in the old days,

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.780
and I mean the real old days before
me, you really had to go somewhere

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.726
like New York to get connected.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.156
But that's not true anymore.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:54.683
There are-- universities
have programs,

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:56.933
universities have summer programs,
people teach in those programs.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:04.526
What you really want to do is for
someone to read your manuscript

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.450
or part of it, and say, "Oh, this
is interesting, I'm gonna show it

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:14.216
to my friends so and so," and to
me that's probably a better way.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.356
But my caveat is, we don't know
what publishing is gonna be

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.563
like even in two years.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.206
And so, maybe the better way is
to publish it yourself online.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:30.913
I have a friend who has a website
and he started publishing his novel

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.173
on his website, you know, say a
thousand or 2,000 words at a time,

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.370
and pretty soon he had
quite a few readers.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.240
So, in some ways your question
is less answerable today

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.226
than it was 10 years ago.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.273
And I'm sorry I can't be more help.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.520
Yes?

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.386
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to thank you
for writing "Duplicate Keys."

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.520
&gt;&gt; Oh, thanks.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.120
&gt;&gt; I'm a librarian and I have
been reading that book on

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.320
and off for about 10 years.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.520
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:11.720
&gt;&gt; So, and I'm just always find--

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:13.786
&gt;&gt; That's one of the obscure ones.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.920
I'm glad you like it.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.720
&gt;&gt; I just love it.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.186
And I had no idea that you are gonna
be here until yesterday when I got

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.253
to my parent's house and opened the
program, and I thought, "Oh, my God,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.720
I should have brought my
copy of Duplicate Keys."

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.786
&gt;&gt; Duplicate Keys is a
murder mystery that I wrote

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:27.966
as about my third novel and
takes place in Manhattan.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.606
And my boyfriend, for a
while before that time,

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.073
was an inspiring singer songwriter.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.453
And after we broke up, I
split myself into two girls -

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.933
one of whom was a sap and one of
whom was really mad, and I split him

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.756
into two guys, one of whom
was pretty nice and one

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.576
of whom was pretty nasty.

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.636
And then my mad self
killed both of his selves.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:04.910
[ Laughter ]

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.976
&gt;&gt; But then he-- then he
came back into my life

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.566
and we've got married
and fathered a son.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:12.940
It's very nice.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.406
And so, so we actually got in a
long great mess, so, you never know.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400
You never know.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.580
Yes?

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:25.980
&gt;&gt; In regard to your
earlier comment,

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.046
can you put too much
sex in your book?

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.913
&gt;&gt; It depends on who the reader is.

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:36.363
If the reader is a member of
your family, absolutely yes.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.263
No member of my family has
admitted to reading that book,

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.990
has admitted to getting past page 5.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.583
And-- but, you know, I
wouldn't have read it either

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.710
if my relative had written it.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.533
So, you know, I did that
for several reasons.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.943
And actually "Ten Days in the
Hills" was one of my favorite books.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.630
And the official reason is that
it was based in "The Decameron."

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.643
Boccaccio had a lot of--
someone calling me--

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.053
oh Boccaccio had a lot
of sex in "The Decameron"

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.423
which was written in about 1350.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.833
And it was also based in Hollywood.

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:29.636
But it was also something
that I as a writer

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.733
and as a woman wanted to try.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.333
And I wanted to try a
new thing with the sex,

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:39.796
which was I wanted the reader
reading the book to come to the sex

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.853
and pause and think the usual
pornographic thought and then think,

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.000
"No, I wanna see what
happens and turn the page."

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.066
So that was my challenge.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:52.023
I wanted the reader to keep reading
no matter how hot the sex got.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.526
And it was a lot of fun for me,
but I think it was an iffy aspect

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.586
of the book for many
readers' point of view.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:04.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:06.276
&gt;&gt; I'm delighted you're
in Washington.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:08.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.450
&gt;&gt; Whenever your name comes up
with friends who love to read,

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.103
I mention your initial
book of short stories.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.910
I've loved your short stories.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.576
I love the way you talked

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:21.043
about Midwestern weather
and driving through it.

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:22.310
I loved Kirby [phonetic] all those--

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:24.910
&gt;&gt; Oh, thanks.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.243
&gt;&gt; And yeah, and also your
description of children.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:31.043
You have a way of seeing
into their darker side.

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:35.116
&gt;&gt; Well, I really-- I wrote about
my children very tentatively

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.550
when I was-- when they
were my children.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:40.070
But my favorite thing whenever I
wrote about any of the kids had

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:46.736
to do with a sleep over
where some kids came over.

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:49.536
And I think they were
all 7or 8 maybe.

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:53.380
And one of them woke up and
wanted to be read to sleep.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.846
And my husband was up.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.526
He was always up late
at night, and he said,

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:00.726
"Well, what should I read you?"

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.326
And she said, "TV Guide."

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:09.336
And so, he sat down next to where
she was sleeping and she laid back

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.830
and he read aloud from the TV Guide.

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:12.876
And I thought, I got
to put this in a story.

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:15.266
&gt;&gt; Well, I did not refer--
I'm sorry if it sounded like,

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.686
to your children, but the
children that you create

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:25.143
such in-depth personalities
in those short stories.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.230
&gt;&gt; Oh thanks.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:28.230
Thank you.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:30.096
&gt;&gt; I thought they-- I
saw a real gift there.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.230
Thanks.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:34.230
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.230
&gt;&gt; Hi!

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:38.230
&gt;&gt; Hi!

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:40.696
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what you
thought about something--

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.430
I had known you are a book critic

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:44.630
which is fantastic 'cause
you're also such a great--

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.830
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm a reviewer.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:47.430
I don't consider myself a critic.

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:49.563
I consider myself a reviewer, yeah.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.763
&gt;&gt; Cool. Well, recently with the
release of Jonathan Franzen's novel,

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.030
"Freedom," there's been a--

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.296
&gt;&gt; Is he around?

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:58.230
&gt;&gt; I doubt it.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:00.763
There's been kind of a
renewed kerfuffle about the way

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:02.896
in which women's literary
fiction is treated differently

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.096
than men's literary fiction.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.230
And since you've been a writer
for so long and a book critic,

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.430
I wondered if you've felt that
that was maybe just an artificial

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.363
distinction now or if
that was still a challenge

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.030
for serious female writers.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.706
&gt;&gt; It's not the most
important challenge.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:16.420
So, go for it.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.886
&gt;&gt; Oh, I wasn't worried
about it on a personal level.

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.553
&gt;&gt; Okay, alright.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.753
Here is-- the main thing I know
about this is that a few years ago

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.253
when the New York Times did a
survey of authors critic scholars

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.126
about the best book of the last
25 years, I was asked along

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.266
with Michael Cunningham and a couple
of-- and a scholar and a critic

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.086
and maybe one other person
to blog about the results.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.850
The results were Tony Morrison
was number one, it was all men

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:58.046
until number 11 and that was "Home",
what's her name, Marilyn Robinson.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:03.753
Women-- very few women.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.246
So, I called Greg Cowles,
and I said, "Okay, Greg,

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.000
tell me about the process
of picking this?"

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.496
And he said, "Well, we
send out 300 requests

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.473
to prominent literary types."

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.243
And I said, "Okay,
how many came back?"

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.396
He said, "From the men, almost all

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.403
of them came back,
from the women, no."

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.546
So 70 percent of everything that
came back, 69 percent was from men,

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.263
31 percent was from women.

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:35.993
I said, "How did they choose?

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:37.836
Or how did they vote?"

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:38.620
He said, "All the men voted for men.

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.253
The women voted for
half women, half men."

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.800
And I thought that
was really revealing,

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.430
because to me what
the women were saying

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.850
by not voting was this is
a meaningless exercise,

00:35:56.350 --> 00:36:01.016
that there is no such thing in the
world of literature as the greatest.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.016
I mean are you gonna
say if you have--

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.246
I mean I picked three books I
really love, "The Good Soldier",

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:15.163
"Anna Karenina," "Emma," and
then a fourth modern one,

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:22.016
"The War of the End of the
World" by Mario Vargas Llosa.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.386
These books are not comparable.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.373
You cannot say one is
greater than the other.

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.853
You could say one is fuller
or one is more perfect,

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.286
but thus characteristics
aren't gonna apply uniformly

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.990
to these books.

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.926
So that's why I thought maybe
the women didn't participate.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.920
But the other thing I
thought was okay, girls,

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:50.976
if you want to be considered great,
you have to step up to the plate

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:55.030
and play the game 'cause the
game isn't going away, you know.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.230
I sent mine in.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.230
I think I'm asked to
pick "Beloved", you know.

00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:04.696
But as I said in my blog or my part
of the blog, I'm gonna learn now

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.310
from Philip Roth, I'm
gonna pick me next time.

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:10.450
[ Laughter ]

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:12.580
[ Applause ]

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.900
&gt;&gt; It's not second grade anymore.

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.850
You know, you can vote for yourself.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.636
So, so anyway, that's one
of the things I learned.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:24.703
Concerning Jonathan
Franzen's book, you know,

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:27.950
I think this is a glancing blow
that happened to land on him.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.323
&gt;&gt; Oh, well, I don't think
anything to do with him.

00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:33.590
&gt;&gt; No, I don't think so.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.390
But it's a good thing to talk about.

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.703
And plenty of people are
happy to talk about it.

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:39.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.410
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.410
&gt;&gt; Hi, there.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:49.003
So when you're working on a book,
how do you decide when to start?

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.240
How do you decide when,
okay, this book is finished?

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.496
&gt;&gt; It really varies
from book to book.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.653
This book went through
a lot of drafts.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:04.290
And I decided that we were in
the last draft when I showed it

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.340
to my bookkeepers' book group.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.306
And they had maybe 10
extremely specific things

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:21.176
that they thought were
missing or needed to be fixed.

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.903
And I fixed them and I
fixed them in a way actually

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.160
that they had hoped
I would fix them,

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.413
and then I decided it was finished.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:35.253
"A Thousand Acres", I just
went until I was exhausted.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:40.306
I said, "I can't go no more," and
I decided it was finished then.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:41.360
But the "Greenlanders",
I decided it was finished

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.326
when I got to the last line.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:46.506
You know, there's something
about books that seemed to be--

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:54.813
some books seemed to be given to
you from outside, and they just come

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:58.690
in a rush, can you imagine
that book came in a rush?

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:05.670
But they come in a rush and they
have a kind of energetic integrity

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:11.230
to themselves, and you know, you can
fettle and you know you can fix this

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.653
and fix that, but it is of a piece,

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.796
it came to of a piece
and that there you go.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.133
So for me, it's always-- it's
always something different.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.983
I don't like to write too many
drafts 'cause I get really confused

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:32.710
about what's in and what's
not in various drafts.

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.803
So, three is optimum
for me, two or three.

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:41.970


00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:43.930
Anyone else?

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.490
Here's one.

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:48.490
Here's one now.

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:49.906
&gt;&gt; I'm wondering what contemporary
authors you like read, novelists.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:57.220
&gt;&gt; What contemporary
novelists I like to read?

00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:59.790
Oh, goodness.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:01.660
&gt;&gt; You know, I have to say that
I'm always either doing research

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120
or reviewing.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:07.320
And so the contemporary novelists

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.386
that I read are generally
ones that I'm reviewing.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.300
I reviewed Gary Shteyngart's
new book

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.613
and I thought it was
hilarious and I enjoyed it.

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:24.106
I reviewed Lydia Davis' new
translation of Madame Bovary

00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.020
and it's good enough that it is new.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:29.830
I really, really thought
it was great, and you know,

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.770
even if you've read Madame Bovary

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:38.043
in translations seven
times, this is a good one.

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:43.780
I really enjoyed "The Slap"
which is an Australian book

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.760
that won the Commonwealth
Prize and it's

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:50.846
up for the booker, wonderful book.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:55.643
And they sure are different in
Australia than they are here.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:00.356
So, those are three
that come to mind.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:02.910


00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:02.993
&gt;&gt; You alluded earlier to the
changing nature of publishing.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:07.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.880
&gt;&gt; Do you have a crystal ball?

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840
&gt;&gt; Nope.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.373
&gt;&gt; What does it mean to-- if you've
been starting out, at this point,

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.173
and young authors at this point seem
to be facing incredible pressure

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:27.880
to do extremely well
with their first books

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:28.620
if they're gonna have a second book.

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.020
&gt;&gt; So where you do think--
where do you think we're headed

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:34.450
and what does it mean
for young authors?

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.123
&gt;&gt; Well, my daughter
is a young author.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.870
And, you know, I think
her choice is to just keep

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:47.316
at it and hope for the best.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:52.730
To me, there'll always be a
market for narrative whether it's

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.800
in the shape of a book,
whether it will be published

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:57.480
by a publishing company, I
don't know, but is the appetite

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.120
for lengthy narrative really
gonna go away, I don't think so.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:09.556
Janet Evanovich just got 40 million
dollars for her next 10 books

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:10.540
or whatever it was, I
don't know how many it was.

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.693
So obviously, there's faith in her.

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.220
Is their faith in the literary ones?

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.706
Doesn't seem to be.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.440
Why is that?

00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.440
Don't know.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:23.490
So, I've been thinking
lately about--

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:29.590
I love the Icelandic Sagas
which are wonderful narratives.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:35.336
But sometime in the late 15th
century, they stopped writing sagas

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:40.936
and they began going to more
poetry song folk-tale type thing.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.520
Why was that?

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.453
Was it a technological thing?

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.163
Was it just an exhaustion
of taste about the sagas?

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.210
I don't know.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:54.610
But, you know, I have faith
that things come and go.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:02.963
And that the novel is of too
much interest to be superseded.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.896
You know, Henry James suddenly
done away with Charles Dickens.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:11.136
Virginia Woolf thought she'd
done away with Henry James.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.296
You know, so maybe there are those

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.916
that they are thinking
they're doing away with me,

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:20.333
but only future generations
will be able to say.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.593
&gt;&gt; I hope you're right.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.060
Thank you.

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:31.326
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us what the next
Jane Smiley novel will be about?

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.193
&gt;&gt; Well, I have two books
coming out this month.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:39.633
One is the second volume of
"The Georges and the Jewels".

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.773
One is the second volume of this
series of horse-- girls horse books.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:48.310
So, the second volume is
called "The Good Horse."

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.936
That will be out at
the end of the month.

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:56.870
And then I wrote a nonfiction book
about the invention of the computer

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:01.566
which is way more interesting
than you ever realized.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.996
It is full of characters.

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.663
It is full of drama.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.813
It is full of kind of
amazingly weird stuff happening,

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.780
amazing coincidences.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:17.060
And it doesn't seem that it was
inevitable at all that the computer

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.293
as we know it was going
to be invented.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.390
And it's a really interesting story.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.386
So that book is gonna be out in
the next couple of weeks also.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:30.926
And after that, just wait and see.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.866
I think that's all.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.860
Thank you for having me.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:42.670
[ Applause ]

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:47.536
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
