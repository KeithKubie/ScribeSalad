00:00:00.386 --> 00:00:06.186
Having to learn about something so
abstract and complicated as the cell,

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.376
being the smallest unit of
life, you know, I sorta wanted

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:09.626
to make it larger than life.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.866
So we literally went big.

00:00:11.976 --> 00:00:15.056
We went really, really big in
creating this giant cell model,

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:19.206
just to obviously give them
an experience to remember.

00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:20.706
My name is Rob Olazagasti,

00:00:20.706 --> 00:00:22.946
sixth grade science teacher,
School of the Future.

00:00:22.946 --> 00:00:27.026
&gt;&gt;How do you think the
lysosomes digests like--

00:00:27.846 --> 00:00:30.666
destroys bad bacteria, basically?

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.706
&gt;&gt;A big part of this project
was having them act as a teacher

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:36.686
and I wanted them to have a setting
in which they could teach from.

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:41.506
So, you know, we created this giant,
plastic cube, which we modeled

00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:45.086
after a cell, with their different
cell organo models in there.

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.176
And it's something that they
definitely never forget.

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:48.806
&gt;&gt;Anybody else?

00:00:49.086 --> 00:00:53.656
&gt;&gt;It's awesome to have my
class inside the giant cell,

00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:56.546
because it's a better
understanding of the cell.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.906
Like it's actually an experiment.

00:00:58.906 --> 00:01:00.526
Like we get to be there.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:03.086
We don't just write
and read about it.

00:01:03.086 --> 00:01:07.926
We get to experience
that life giant cell.

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:09.836
&gt;&gt;The artistic sense of the way

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:13.746
that he approaches science is really
unique, and kids really take to that.

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:18.396
And Rob's definitely a great
example of somebody who's had to--

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:22.796
he's always had creative projects,
always had really hands on science.

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:27.066
&gt;&gt;When you create something,
you also learn.

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:30.676
&gt;&gt;The kids have been learning
about the living cell.

00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:34.486
We started off our
studies with an analogy,

00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:36.466
using something that's
very common to them,

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.006
something that they all obviously
understand, New York City.

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.666
Looking at how New York City
can be structured as a cell.

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:48.246
So they represented various
organelles as metaphor,

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:49.516
using different parts of the city.

00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:53.126
So for example, they have the
subway system being representative

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:55.046
of the rough endoplasm reticulum.

00:01:55.256 --> 00:01:57.196
The nucleus being City
Hall and the Mayor.

00:01:57.386 --> 00:02:00.786
So they took the creative approach
to learning about the cell parts.

00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:04.976
So taking the different working parts
of New York City and applying them

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:08.276
to a cell model allows them
to understand the structures

00:02:08.276 --> 00:02:09.186
and the functions better.

00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:12.236
So as that project was
sort of on its tail end,

00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:15.776
the kids then became experts on
one specific part of the city,

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:18.896
or one specific part of the cell
itself and one specific organelle.

00:02:18.896 --> 00:02:22.816
So they researched, developed
lesson plans and created models

00:02:22.956 --> 00:02:25.866
that they were to use
to teach their students

00:02:26.056 --> 00:02:27.996
about the organelles
that they had created.

00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:32.346
They were required to have sort
of a structured lesson plan

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:35.356
with a driving question and an
objective, some sort of task

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:37.616
that the students would be
doing, and then some sort

00:02:37.616 --> 00:02:38.586
of assessment at the end.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:39.866
&gt;&gt;And the jump start.

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:43.906
&gt;&gt;This project specifically, I tried
taking a step back from, you know,

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:47.186
sort of the teacher role and really
helping my students develop their own

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:47.936
voice as teachers.

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:52.916
&gt;&gt;I kinda like it a lot,
'cause I like to teach people

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.166
but it also feels amazing inside,

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.376
like that you have
experience to be a teacher.

00:02:58.376 --> 00:03:00.156
&gt;&gt;All right, so for
the driving question,

00:03:00.776 --> 00:03:02.936
how do lysosomes protect
the living cell?

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:03.656
Daina?

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:07.516
&gt;&gt;They understand what it takes
to be a teacher, and what it is

00:03:07.516 --> 00:03:09.976
like to plan a lesson, what
it's like to execute a lesson.

00:03:10.096 --> 00:03:12.396
But also, I think, more
importantly for them,

00:03:12.396 --> 00:03:13.936
it builds their confidence
in the content.

00:03:14.546 --> 00:03:18.846
Having to know what you're doing
before you teach it really makes

00:03:18.846 --> 00:03:19.216
a difference.

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:24.736
So during their presentations, I was
assessing their overall presentation,

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:27.656
their confidence and their
comfort with presenting the lesson,

00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:31.756
and then the content itself, how
well they were hitting the facts

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:34.566
that they needed to hit, how well
they were expressing what we talked

00:03:34.566 --> 00:03:36.726
about in our individual
conferences with those groups,

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:39.886
how well they expressed that or
presented that to their students.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.116
Also, their creativity
and their effort.

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:44.576
I was sort of keeping a running
record throughout their lesson

00:03:44.576 --> 00:03:48.036
of things that they said, things
that they did, and suggestions

00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:49.566
on how they could improve
for the next time.

00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:52.876
So at the end of this, I'll have sort
of a sit down with them again to talk

00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:55.766
to them about the different elements
of their lesson, from my notes

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:57.676
and from my experience
with observing.

00:03:58.136 --> 00:03:59.836
&gt;&gt;People love Rob and love his class.

00:03:59.836 --> 00:04:02.336
To have such an intellectual
environment,

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:04.556
he doesn't baby down science words.

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.606
He uses sophisticated
vocabulary in his class.

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:09.766
He talks to them like scientists,
talks to them very seriously.

00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:12.976
&gt;&gt;So why did I go back and disagree
that it would be in a plant cell?

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.696
&gt;&gt;When you can change it up,
make it your own, you know,

00:04:15.696 --> 00:04:18.746
really make it personalized for
the kids, it comes from the heart.

00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:22.776
It's no longer, you know,
teaching curriculum from the book.

00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:25.646
It becomes, you know,
curriculum from the heart.
