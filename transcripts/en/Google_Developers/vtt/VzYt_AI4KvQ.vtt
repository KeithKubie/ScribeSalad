MARTIN OMANDER: Hello, and
welcome to "Root Access," the

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.030
show for startups on Google
Developers Live.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.480
I'm Martin Omander, and I'm
joined here by legendary

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.430
investor and Googler,
Don Dodge.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.340
Welcome, Don.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.690
Today we're going to talk
about Demo Day season.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.580
500 Startups and Y Combinator
two of the most well known

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.820
accelerators just had
their Demo Days.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.580
And I know, Don, that you
attended both of them.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.450
What trends did you notice
in the demos this year?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.670
DON DODGE: More conservative.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.310
More business focused.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.060
In years past, you saw lots of
consumer oriented companies,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.350
social kinds of applications,
and lots of mobile apps.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.680
This year, it was more focused
on business, more

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.640
conservative, some might say
boring kinds of ideas.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.160
But they make money.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.850
So all of them, you could
clearly understand the

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:04.680
business model.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.170
You can connect the dots from
where they are to a million or

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.960
so of revenue.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.020
And more focused on business
as the customer.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.590
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.630
Was that a difference between
500 Startups and Y Combinator,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.360
or what was the difference
that you noticed?

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.630
DON DODGE: No, both of them
were more business focused

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.790
than in the past.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.310
I think the difference I saw
at 500 Startups was a more

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.040
international flavor.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.300
So 500 Startups had about 32
companies, 35 companies.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.010
And I would guess that half of
them were from countries all

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.020
over the world.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.840
So a much more international
flavor from the founders, and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.690
even the business ideas were
things that you wouldn't

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.540
normally think of as
being a business

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.770
opportunity in the US.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.220
They were focused on those
sorts of things.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.680
And generating revenue
pretty quickly.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.370
Y Combinator was more Silicon
Valley focused.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.850
The founders, who all seem to
come from Silicon Valley or

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.840
the other tech hubs, but again,
more business focused

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.800
and that kind of thing.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.480
MARTIN OMANDER: Right, yeah.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.260
I noticed that the Y Combinator,
a lot of those

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.520
startups, while they were
still in the accelerator

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.020
program were cash flow
positive already.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.470
What's up with that?

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.560
DON DODGE: Well, I think when
you're focused on a business

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.950
to business kind of company,
you're selling to business,

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.810
businesses are more accustomed
to paying money for things.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.170
As opposed to consumer oriented
companies, where

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.630
you're either generating revenue
based on advertising,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.340
or on a subscription freemium
kind of thing, where it starts

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.700
out free and you pay
money later.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.980
Those consumer web app kind of
social businesses take longer

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.390
to generate revenue.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.710
Whereas business to business
type companies generate

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.660
revenue very early.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.550
So many of the companies at Y
Combinator, they're launching

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.920
on stage and already talking
about revenue streams that

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.740
they have in place.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.770
So I think that's the
major difference.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:13.980
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.830
How does all this play
into valuations?

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.780
Are the valuations higher,
lower, the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.270
same as previous years?

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.740
DON DODGE: More reasonable,
I would say.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:22.730
MARTIN OMANDER: Reasonable
That's good.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.840
DON DODGE: In the past couple of
years, we were in a bubble

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.740
where companies just launching
at Y Combinator were having

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.210
valuations in the $8 to
$12 million range.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.630
That's pretty rich for a company
with three or four

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.700
founders, and just launching
with negligible revenue to

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.260
have $8 to $12 million
valuations.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.330
This year I think we saw the
valuations come down to more

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.630
reasonable levels, like in the
$7 to $10 million range.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.810
So that's still pretty rich,
but down from the past two

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.916
years and a bit more
reasonable.

00:04:01.916 --> 00:04:03.040
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.000
Are these Silicon Valley
bubble valuations?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.740
How are valuations in
Boston, Austin,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.150
New York, other places?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.620
DON DODGE: I think the
valuations in other

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.340
locations are lower.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.390
So say more in the $4 to $7
million range than the $7 to

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.040
$10 million range that you
see in Silicon Valley.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.260
There are, of course,
exceptions to that.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.680
Great companies can start
anywhere and command very high

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.520
valuations.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.280
But in general, Silicon Valley
investors are more accustomed

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.490
to paying up, and paying higher
valuations than in

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.960
other parts of the country or
in other parts of the world.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.900
MARTIN OMANDER: So does that
mean that the good deals are

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.800
outside Silicon Valley?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.890
DON DODGE: Well, it depends on
how you talk about good deals.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.800
If you're talking about
valuation, yes.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.320
Valuations are lower in other
parts of the country or

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.860
outside of the US.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.410
But from an investor
perspective, a lot of times

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.970
valuation doesn't matter.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.670
Because if a company hits it big
and goes to $800 million

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.210
valuation, it really doesn't
matter if you paid $5 million

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.070
or $8 million on the
first investment.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.060
Conversely, if the company
fails, you lose 100% of your

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.760
money anyway.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.850
So it doesn't matter if you
put your money in at $3

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.850
million or $8 million.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.230
If you lose it all,
you lose it all.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.690
So I think Silicon Valley
investors, in general, are

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.390
less valuation sensitive,
and look more

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.240
at what is the upside.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.570
Because they know going in
they're going to lose half of

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.280
their money anyway.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.010
Meaning half of the investments
they make will be

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.460
total wipeouts.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.060
And the other half, one of them
hopefully will be that

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.180
$800 million or billion
dollar company.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.055
And that pays for all
the mistakes.

00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:57.730
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, I see.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.990
That's quite a bit different way
of managing money than I

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.820
manage my 401(k), I
can tell you that.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.650
DON DODGE: Me too.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.810
MARTIN OMANDER: Good.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.550
That's all for today.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.350
Please leave your comments
on the YouTube video, and

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.820
questions, and we'll
try to get back to

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.160
them in future episodes.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.750
Thank you for joining us,
and see you next week.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.000
Bye.
