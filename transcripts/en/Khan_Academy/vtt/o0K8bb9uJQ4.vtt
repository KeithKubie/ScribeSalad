00:00:01.144 --> 00:00:02.284
- [Instructor] When we talk about the big

00:00:02.284 --> 00:00:03.582
social movements of the early

00:00:03.582 --> 00:00:06.105
19th century in the United States,

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.432
you can't deny that the emergence

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:11.094
of Jacksonian democracy is one of the most

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:15.489
influential aspects of
early 19th century culture,

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.208
so what was Jacksonian democracy

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:19.601
and why do we care so much about it?

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:21.426
Well, I wanna make the
argument to you that

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:24.843
Jacksonian democracy was really the birth

00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:28.886
of modern American political culture.

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:36.675
By that, I mean that during this time,

00:00:39.214 --> 00:00:43.410
lots of practices emerged
that are still with us today.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.243
For example, the two party system.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.250
The spoils system.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.768
Even some aspects of
American political character

00:00:57.768 --> 00:01:01.765
that are still with us today
emerged in this time period

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:04.780
and by that, I mean the kinds of traits

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.446
that we like to see in our politicians

00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:09.251
to consider them electable.

00:01:09.251 --> 00:01:11.305
So in this series on Jacksonian democracy,

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:14.019
I'm gonna take you on a journey from

00:01:14.019 --> 00:01:17.102
the earlier American political culture,

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:19.889
some of the major changes that

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:23.136
came about in the Jacksonian period,

00:01:23.136 --> 00:01:24.681
and then just discuss some of the ways

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:27.789
that this still influences us today.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.688
All right, so if Jacksonian democracy

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:33.390
was a new thing, what came before it?

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.799
Well, in the very early era
of American political life

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.966
and I'm talking here from
approximately 1790 to about 1820,

00:01:44.748 --> 00:01:48.081
American politics was very aristocratic.

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:52.166
There were a couple of families

00:01:53.168 --> 00:01:56.517
that tended to dominate politics.

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:58.978
The Adams family, for example.

00:01:58.978 --> 00:02:01.666
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:04.702
and these men were kind
of considered to be,

00:02:04.702 --> 00:02:08.168
maybe a higher character of man.

00:02:08.168 --> 00:02:12.335
They were the quintessential
citizens of a republic

00:02:15.663 --> 00:02:18.163
and along with that came a certain amount

00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:21.233
of wealth and status and education.

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:25.076
In between George Washington
and Andrew Jackson,

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:28.216
every single person
who served as president

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:29.966
had a college degree.

00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:34.764
Many of them were Virginians

00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:38.358
and particularly Virginian planters.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:39.674
You see a lot of Virginians

00:02:39.674 --> 00:02:42.166
and a lot of people from Massachusetts

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:45.231
in the first couple of
years of the republic.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.337
Many of them kind of shared a concern

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:52.504
that there could be too much
democracy, shall we say,

00:02:54.672 --> 00:02:58.839
that even though the United
States was a democracy,

00:03:01.122 --> 00:03:04.478
many of the founders of the United States

00:03:04.478 --> 00:03:08.372
worried about the tyranny of the majority,

00:03:08.372 --> 00:03:11.039
the tyranny of the mob,

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.649
that they had set up this
democratic experiment

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:15.588
where many people could vote,

00:03:15.588 --> 00:03:20.271
but they were afraid of having
just too many people voting

00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:23.085
'cause they looked down on lower classes

00:03:23.085 --> 00:03:25.337
of society in that time period.

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:29.504
They worried that if you didn't
have a stake in the country,

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:34.043
usually shown by property ownership,

00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:39.324
either in terms of land
or in terms of wealth,

00:03:40.313 --> 00:03:44.314
then you wouldn't have
the proper investment

00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:47.213
in the fate of the nation in order to

00:03:47.213 --> 00:03:50.160
make a rational decision about what

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.264
sort of policies should be enacted.

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:54.211
So in the early years
of the United States,

00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:56.461
many states had voting laws

00:03:58.158 --> 00:04:00.575
that restricted the franchise

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:05.428
to just propertied men.

00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:11.130
So really, a quite small
proportion of the overall populous

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.942
of the United States could vote.

00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:15.265
Interestingly, this actually meant that

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:18.821
in some northern states,
both free people of color,

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:19.988
free black men

00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:24.188
and women could vote

00:04:26.612 --> 00:04:30.183
because they met the requirements
for property ownership,

00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:32.683
but in the early 1800s, 1810s,

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:38.446
these ideals of democracy
began to catch on more and more

00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:42.080
among the common people

00:04:42.914 --> 00:04:47.081
and as new states joined The
Union, like Ohio and Illinois,

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.788
they came in with state constitutions,

00:04:50.788 --> 00:04:54.705
saying that all white
male citizens could vote,

00:04:56.715 --> 00:04:59.645
regardless of whether or not

00:04:59.645 --> 00:05:02.895
they owned property or they paid taxes.

00:05:04.358 --> 00:05:08.191
So in this time period,
white male citizenship

00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:11.585
became associated with voting

00:05:11.585 --> 00:05:15.107
and some of the other
states began to rewrite

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:18.605
their state constitutions
to grant the vote

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:22.645
to all white males and it
probably won't surprise you

00:05:22.645 --> 00:05:24.816
that when they rewrote those laws,

00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:29.085
they managed to take
out the little loophole

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:31.523
for free people of color and women

00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:33.318
with certain amounts of property.

00:05:33.318 --> 00:05:37.557
So by the end of this
period, in the 1850s,

00:05:37.557 --> 00:05:40.195
all property requirements for
voting had been eliminated

00:05:40.195 --> 00:05:43.598
and any white male above the age of 21

00:05:43.598 --> 00:05:45.548
in the United States had the right to vote

00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:46.605
and we'll get to what that meant

00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:49.062
for American politics in the next video.
