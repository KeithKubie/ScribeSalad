[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.370
BRIAN MCCLENDON: And
there it goes.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.580
Hi.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.800
My name is Brian McClendon, and
I'm in charge of Google

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.840
Maps, Earth, and Street
View and the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.200
other Google Geo products.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.250
I'd like to welcome you here
today to talk about what's new

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.760
in Google Maps.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.860
But to start with, I need to
talk about some history.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.640
Hic sunt dracones.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.430
This is what they wrote on old
maps when they were drawing

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.800
them and they didn't know
where the borders were.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.260
It was to tell the people
looking the maps--

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.950
don't go there, you might
fall over the cliff.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.560
But our goal at Google has been
to try to remove as many

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.460
dragons from your maps as
possible and make it possible

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.100
for both our billion users and
all of the developers to have

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.350
as few dragons as possible.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.305
To do this--

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:00.750
we go forward--

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.910
the three principles at Google
Maps are comprehensiveness,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.520
accuracy, and usability.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.080
And this is what we do whenever
we think about what

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.229
projects we're going to work
on and how we're going to

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.910
improve our data and our
user experience.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.090
So the first is
comprehensiveness.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.510
Google has been working on
crawling the web for years.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.240
And as they were crawling the
web, they were getting more

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.520
and more data.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.070
In maps, in GEO here, we are
collecting as much data as we

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.420
possibly could.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.820
And so comprehensiveness and
completeness has always been

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.100
part of the product.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.130
But in the early days
we started here.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.500
This is the first Google
Maps in 2005.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.000
And it was really a revelation
of the time because before

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.660
then, you saw that map
providers would, when

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.510
[INAUDIBLE] request, they would
render a map and it

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.910
would take 10 seconds.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.330
You'd go pan and zoom and it
would be another 10 seconds

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.520
you'd have to wait.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520
It was good at the time.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.180
The Internet was amazing
at maps, but we

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.430
felt we could do better.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.760
And so we invented several
things to make

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.890
Google Maps in 2005.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.880
The biggest one was, we decided
to pre-render the map.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.440
We took all of the map data
for the world and baked it

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.280
into map tiles, many of which
you're very familiar with, and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.060
set it up so that we can serve
them very, very quickly.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.400
And this changed
the interaction

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.370
model for user maps.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.300
The dragging and zoom
was very fast.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.300
We also simplified the
search box up there.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.140
The single search box is much
better than the two, three, or

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.150
six entry search box
in the past.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.080
So getting this product, it was

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.480
amazing, but it was limiting.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.010
So this was our first actual
world map in 2005.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.300
And you'll notice that's not a
mistake-- that we actually

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.760
didn't have Western Europe, we
didn't have Central and South

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.110
America, or pretty much anywhere
else in the world.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.790
There were, in fact,
dragons on our map

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.870
in that first launch.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.920
And we spent time improving
the map.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.990
And by 2007, we had basically
the whole world covered.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.190
But there was still skeletal
little holes, countries where

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.840
we had the basics, but we didn't
have in-depth data.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.930
However, by 2008, we did have
licensed data for the entire

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.260
world and were able to show
a good world map.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.890
But it just the beginning.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.190
Imagery.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.790
Coming from Keyhole, we were
acquired by Google in 2005,

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.980
our goal was to get as much
satellite and aerial imagery

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.950
as possible.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.820
And we worked on that project
at Keyhole for many years--

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.200
pushing hard drives around.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.930
When we got to Google,
they gave us 1,000

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.540
servers and we started.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.670
Larry signed a check for
digital globe data, and

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.360
suddenly we had a large
amount of satellite.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.460
We were very excited about what
we'd achieved from the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.970
launch of Google Earth
in 2005 to 2006.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.960
And we had covered 37% of the
world's population with

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.240
high-res imagery.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.260
That was great, but there's a
long way from there to making

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.960
everybody happy.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.140
Because the main question
everybody asked when they

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.860
would look at Google Maps
and Google Earth was,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.280
can I see my house?

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.500
And the goal in 2012, we now
have over five billion people

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.990
who can say the answer
yes to that question.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.880
And today, every two weeks, we
push as much data as the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.520
entire database was in 2006.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.650
Another project, Street
View, started in 2007.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.130
We published five cities with
this panorama imagery--

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.960
about four and a half
megapixel panoramas.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.530
And it was a great hit.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.430
Everybody loved this
virtual tourism.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.870
They would jump in and drive
down the street, and it was

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.880
very exciting, but it was
just the beginning.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.410
And we took this project and
greatly expanded it.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:41.330
By 2012, we have 39 countries,
3,000 cities plus, we've

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.860
driven over 5 million
unique miles.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.150
We now have data in all
seven continents.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:55.290
The seventh one was added in
Antarctica by me in 2010.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.820
And so I actually went and took
these pictures with a

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.660
standard camera with a fish-eye
lens and gave it to

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.610
the Street View team, and they
added half of an island on the

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.820
Antarctic Peninsula.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:04.740
But we've just started there.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.890
We actually have some good
handle on getting even more

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.700
Street View data in
Antarctica, so

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.950
that's pretty cool.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.570
However that project, while
grand in scope and has taken a

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.940
lot of our time, led us to
think of something even

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.560
bigger, which was to
build our own maps.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.120
In 2008, we were somewhat
dissatisfied with the data

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.120
that we were able to license.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.150
It was not as accurate as we
liked, and we couldn't update

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.410
it very quickly-- sometimes
taking three months to a year

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.390
to get updates through
the system.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:35.490
And so we started embarking on
creating our own map data

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.980
using government data-- any data
that we could license in

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.050
and bring in to make part
of our own maps--

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.870
but basing it on Street View
and the power of having

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.000
ground-level checks on a lot
of this location data.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.190
We called the project
Ground Truth.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.010
And this is an example.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.520
This is a screen shot
of our internal

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.070
tool to make the maps.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.850
And you can see, we combine
Street View GPS tracks.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.670
We combine Street
View imagery.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.710
We took road data.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.820
We took the orthographic imagery
that we had from all

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.920
over the place.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.990
And we used Computer Vision to
extract data from Street View.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.190
So you can see pictures here of
like the 101 sign, also a

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.980
speed limit sign down there
on the bottom right.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.830
We would actually extract
those and show those to

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.860
operators, so they could improve
the attributes and

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.900
correct and detect issues as
we were going through and

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.600
making our own map data.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.110
And this led to incredibly
high quality maps that we

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.960
launched, initially, in the
United States in 2009.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.290
In parallel, we use Map Maker.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.290
So GT was a great story for the
developed world where we

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.080
had Street View data
and so on.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.770
But a lot of the maps were
completely blank.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.400
As you saw at the beginning of
this video, in 2008, there was

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.780
nothing in Faisalabad,
Pakistan.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.390
And over four years, they've
taken a blank map and turned

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.140
it into one of the best maps
of any city that I know of.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.160
This is all with local knowledge
and people who are

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.940
passionate about making maps.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.340
And Map Maker has allowed people
all over the world to

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:04.350
add and improve data and add
to the comprehensiveness in

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.480
Google Maps.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.170
And so, countries like Pakistan,
Romania, Vietnam,

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.070
Philippines--

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.700
by far the best maps anybody's
ever had are

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.950
currently in Map Maker.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.890
So 2008, we were
licensed data.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.350
Today in 2012, we have 187
countries with driving

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.500
directions, which is sort of our
min bar for claiming that

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.860
we have good data coverage.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.789
26 million miles of
navigable roads.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.490
You can see the contributions
of Google-sourced imagery,

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:42.590
Google-sourced data, and the
user data, along with still

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.840
some countries that
we do license.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.220
Accuracy.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:51.990
Making that data useful
and correct has been a

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.130
challenge for us.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.310
There's a lot of ways to
introduce error and a lot of

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.390
ways to fix them.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.800
My philosophy in building maps
at Google has been that

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.140
combining all this data together
and figuring out how

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.630
to make it improve each other
is a critical part.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.540
If you look at this here, we
have terrain data that we

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.470
actually generated from
imagery at times.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.830
We have map data.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.660
We have Street View.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.850
We have the GPS tracks from
Street View, the imagery from

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.820
Street View.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.240
We have the orthographic
imagery and now this 3D

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.050
imagery that Peter
will talk about.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.480
All combine, and if you think
about it as a collection of

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.380
semi-accurate data, you can use
the different layers to

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.050
correct each other.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.380
You can find out how the roads
align with the imagery, how

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.760
the terrain aligns
with the roads.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.370
You can see how the 3D building
data aligns with the

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.610
road data, so the overpasses--

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.920
are they in exactly
the right place.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.380
All of this leads to a much
more accurate map.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.050
And on top of that, we have
our local data, the local

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.190
businesses and POIs.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.480
And the ability to correctly
place those across the map

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.850
makes us a much better
map story.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.300
But we're still working on it
because there's so many

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.990
different things we can do.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.420
As an example, here's
Street View.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.500
Here's some of the stuff that
we do, both manually and

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.030
automatically.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.820
Computer Vision is able to
pick out street signs and

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:05.770
business names, also pick out
speed limits, detect whether

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.160
it's a bicycle lane or not.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.870
And what Computer Vision can't
do, it can provide data to our

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.880
operators to continue
to improve the map.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.150
But there's other
ways to do it.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.940
We use our users.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.030
Report a Problem--

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:23.160
it is very popular in both
desktop Google Maps and GMM.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.570
If a user sees a problem--

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.700
they don't like a direction
they're given because they

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.300
pretty much know that
it's wrong--

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.310
they can report it and
send it to us.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:34.140
We then take that report to
our operators who use this

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.330
very customized, back-end tool
that has much more access to

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:37.890
our database.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.180
And can look to see, not only
what our data shows on the

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.000
public map, but all of our
internal data structures with

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.550
a very high quality Street View
navigator that allows a

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.610
user to very quickly compare
what the user said to what we

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.220
see in Street View.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.160
So if it matches in that way,
we're done, it's easy.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.760
But if it doesn't match, we'll
go and investigate further

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.680
using whatever means possible.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.830
And the result is we get a much
more high quality map.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.780
But there's some reports we
can't do anything with.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:12.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.570
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Map Maker is
launched in 10 new countries

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.410
in the month of June.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.500
So we are also using Map Maker
to improve our high quality,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.290
developed world maps.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.280
And so people can add hiking
trails, biking trails, and

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.470
make the same kind of
corrections that

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.710
our operators do.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.000
And it goes through a moderation
pipeline, and we

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.570
can validate and publish the
data very, very quickly.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:33.940
Usability--

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.300
it's all great to have great
data but only if you can get

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.470
good access to it.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.080
So I talked to you a little bit
about the single box, but

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.890
I want to talk a lot more
about it because it's, I

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.950
think, one of the biggest
challenges we have.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.090
And a lot of our engineers spend
a huge amount of time

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.000
figuring out what to
do with your query.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.550
We have a geo-coding database,
that's easy.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.280
Figuring out how to parse it out
and make the best answer

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.820
for a user's intended question
is very hard.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.060
We have to deal with different
languages, right to left, left

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.540
to right, Arabic, Chinese,
Japanese--

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:04.780
all very difficult.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.980
We have to deal with
partial addresses--

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.130
a city name, street
name, without a

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.030
state or anything else.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.530
We can guess based
on proximity.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.810
Searching for category,
searching for specific

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.110
navigation, businesses--

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.040
finding those.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.860
Also being able to turn on and
off traffic and doing driving

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.960
directions, all from
the single box.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.340
The ability to take the user's
action and, in as many cases

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.210
as possible, get it right the
first time is very powerful.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.350
In addition, we have
Autocomplete down

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.330
there at the bottom.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.490
This provides not
just guesses--

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.720
what we think you want--

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.920
but suggestions of different
things you can do with Google

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.200
Maps today.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.510
And some of these features, we
have them in the API, but Thor

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.760
is going to tell you a lot
more in the near future.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.420
Another part of usability is
giving good performance and

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.460
delivering.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.760
We announced recently, one
billion monthly, active GeoMap

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.440
services users.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.110
And to deliver that kind of
service reliably, over the

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.560
past three years our tile
servers have had greater than

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.030
four nines reliability.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.150
We don't have scheduled down
time at Google, so that's 26

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.080
minutes a year.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.680
We have 1.6 million QPS peak
tile serving right now, but we

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.070
can probably go higher.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.690
All from eight data centers
which give you low latency no

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:20.940
matter where you are.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.380
However, that power allows us to
do some really cool things.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.210
I told you before that one of
our innovations in 2005 was to

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.790
pre-render the map tiles.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.480
And that really greatly
increased the speed.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.080
But over time, we've had some
crazy ideas where we could

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.100
actually render the map
tiles on demand.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.470
And doing so actually gave
us great improvements.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.650
Now you may not have noticed
because they're still raster

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.340
map tiles when they come to you,
but the fact is that we

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.500
render everything on demand.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.290
So road traffic is
a good example.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.360
Most people who do road traffic
will do an overlay

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.340
raster on top of the map data.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.380
And what that means is that it
obscures some part of the map.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.920
We're able to actually bake
the road data into the map

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.520
tile correctly layered under
the road labels.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.120
Better user experience--

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.210
that's just one small thing.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.730
We have several more--

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.800
maps in your language,
translated tiles.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.830
When you ask for map data, we'll
give it to you the best

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:15.010
we can based on who you are.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.750
In the API, we had
styled maps.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.620
And many of you are familiar
with this, the ability to

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.860
render specific styles to match
your website, match

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.080
nighttime needs, whatever
it takes.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.360
But the biggest thing, and
really the reason that drove

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.390
us to do it, was the ability to

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:31.240
publish map fixes instantly.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.630
And so once the moderators
approve an edit, you'll see

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.930
these edits go live within five

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.120
minutes or less worldwide.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.350
And so that ability is what
makes us able to turn and

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.370
correct maps and produce
maps in new

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.810
countries very, very quickly.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.310
So we have 800,000 developers
or more working at

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.110
Google Maps API today.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:58.380
And the amazing things they've
achieved, amazing things

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.950
you've achieved, have given us
all sorts of inspiration, but

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:03.910
we're continuing to grow.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.000
We think Google Maps API is
a critical part of our map

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.800
service, and even today, year
over year, it's greatly

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.780
increasing in use, counter
argument to some reports you

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.120
might have read.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.450
But with that, I would like to
introduce Thor Mitchell who is

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.850
going to talk about new features
in Google Maps API.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.170
Thanks.

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:25.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.960
THOR MITCHELL: OK.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.560
OK, good afternoon everybody.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.160
As Brian said, my name's
Thor Mitchell.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.500
I'm a product manager based in
the Sydney office focused on

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.370
the Google Maps API and
the Google Places API.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.510
Today I'm going to give you a
preview of some of the new

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.500
features that we're bringing to
these APIs for you, here at

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.750
I/O this year.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.120
Before we go into that though,
I just want to emphasize how

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.870
much of what I'm about to show
you has been driven by you.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.110
Your feedback is very
important to us.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:02.800
And we connect with developers
in many different ways, such

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.350
as through sponsor tags on Stack
Overflow, through events

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.450
like this, and through our
regular office hours Hangouts.

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:14.030
One of the most useful tools we
have for understanding your

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.790
needs is our Issue Tracker.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.250
So if you're not familiar with
our Issue Tracker, this is a

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.390
site you can go to to tell us
the features that you're

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.890
looking for and express interest
in ideas that others

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.850
have added for features
you'd like to see.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.570
And as you'll see as
we go through, we

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:28.480
take this very seriously.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.980
And if there's one takeaway from
this session I'd like you

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.790
to have, it's to make good
use of this tool.

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.640
So let's begin with
the Places API.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.700
Now if you were with us
at I/O last year,

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.530
you may recall that--

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:44.470
I think possibly in this very
room, at this very time--

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.680
we announced the broad
availability of the Google

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.340
Places API.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.490
If you're not familiar with the
Google Places API, it's

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.730
our developer offering for
access to our worldwide corpus

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:57.020
of local business listings,
points of interest, and

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.270
landmark data.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.860
At its heart, the Places
API is very simple.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.740
You provide us with a location,
you provide us with

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.440
a radius, and we'll
give you back the

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.300
20 best places nearby.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.609
And to tailor these results to
your specific application, you

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:19.300
can filter based on one of over
100 globally consistent,

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.170
high level categories
such as restaurants.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:24.690
You can also provide specific
keywords to focus in on

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.760
particular types of business,
such as a cuisine, or a

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.120
particular type of clothes
store, or such like.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.870
Another feature of the Places
API that we launched last year

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:37.280
is Autocomplete.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.330
Now Brian's touched on this
briefly already, but this

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.020
essentially brings that
type-ahead search

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.080
functionality that you see
on Google Maps into your

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.090
applications.

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.820
And Autocomplete is particularly
useful when

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.820
dealing with those infuriating,
multi-field

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.080
address forms that litter
the internet.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.310
There's no reason you should
have to force your users to

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.570
enter their details in all these
different fields over

00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:58.310
and over again.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.510
You can give them one, single
text field, they can just

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.420
type, we will complete
the address for them.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.980
And then we'll give you the
structured address components

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.870
that your application needs.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.230
It's such, such a better
user experience.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.725
Once you have used this, every
site you come across that asks

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.620
you to enter an address that
doesn't use it, it

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.078
just drives you crazy.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.320
OK, so there's nothing new
here, what is new?

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.360
Well as I mentioned earlier, one
of the things that we take

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.850
very seriously is
your feedback.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.640
And when we took a look at the
Issue Tracker for the Places

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.420
API, there's one issue that has
been way out in front in

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.270
terms of the amount of requests
we've had for it

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.230
since the day we launched--

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:44.150
that's access to
Google Reviews.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.150
So I'm happy to say that,
starting today, when you use

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.680
the Places API to get detailed
information about a business,

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.430
we'll return to you the top five
reviews for that place as

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:54.680
shown on Google+ Local.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.540
So, if you take a look at
Google+ Local and look at a

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.230
specific review, you'll notice
that there are-- it's made up

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.850
of certain elements.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:10.750
There's the text of the review,
there's the scores the

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.440
reviewer gave, and there's also
information about who

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.670
submitted that review--
if they have a

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.060
public Google+ profile.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.120
All of this information is now
returned in the Places API.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.350
You may also know that if you
log into the Google+ Local as

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:31.010
an a signed-in Google+ user,
there's some additional

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.850
information available to you
that is provided by Zagat.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.610
This includes scores across
three aspects of the business.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.280
And those aspects vary
depending on

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.050
the class of business.

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.350
So for a restaurant, it's decor,
food, and service.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.410
There's also the editorial
review which is a

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:50.220
human-crafted summary of the
best reviews that we've

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:52.060
received for that business.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:55.020
Now we're working on a new
option for our Maps for

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.540
Business customers that allow
you to get access to this

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.650
Zagat content as well.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.800
So if that's something that
might be interesting to you,

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.640
please do contact the Maps
for Business sales team.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.620
So up to now, the Places API has
been really very focused

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.650
on mobile, location-based
apps.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.570
And these apps have
one big advantage.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.290
They have access to a
fine-grained location signal

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.570
for the user based on GPS.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:25.530
And that allows us to give
you an easy way of

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:27.370
searching near the user.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.730
However, we recognize there are
many use cases for local

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.930
data which would benefit more
from the sort of a single,

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.400
one-box usability experience
that Brian mentioned.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.560
And so we're bringing that
to the Places API today.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.660
So now you can let your users
express their searches just in

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.730
simple text in any way they
like, and we will

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.030
interpret it for you.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.570
You can see that this could
be a what/ where query.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.840
This could be a query that just
contains a category, and

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.300
then we use the map to
infer the location.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:02.560
But also, it's just a single
address or a single business.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.290
So it's a very flexible model.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:06.040
Users can just say what
they're looking for.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.720
You all know this, you're
familiar with it from Google

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.580
Maps, but we're bringing that
into the API as well.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.910
We're also extending the
existing Autocomplete

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.810
functionality to be able to
suggest possible queries as

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.060
you type, as well as the places
it suggests today.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.920
So that's all I'm going to cover
on the Places API for

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.390
this morning.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.790
However, it's not the end of the
announcements we have for

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:29.420
the Places API.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:31.700
And if you'd like to hear more,
I recommend the session,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.820
Building a Business Around the
Google Places API, that is

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.330
happening next door towards
the end of today.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.800
Marcelo is our engineering lead
for the Places API, and

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.050
Andres manages our developer
relations team for Maps.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.820
OK, so now we will move
on to the Maps API.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.100
Now, as some of you may know,
the Maps API has been through

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.730
a significant transition
in the last few years.

00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.030
Back in 2009 at Google I/O, we
introduced version 3 of the

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:00.910
Google Maps API.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:04.770
And a year later, it became our
primary Google Maps API.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.480
And since then, we've been
working to bring over features

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.420
from v2 that people value
into the Maps API v3.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.730
And along the way, we've also
attempted to make improvements

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.970
where we can and also
bring new features.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:22.550
And there are many advantages
to Maps API v3 as a result.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.500
Now we reached a significant
milestone earlier this year

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.340
when we moved the last of the
v2 features that we want to

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.320
bring into v3 over.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.700
Which means that if you're
continuing to maintain or

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.150
develop a v2 application, now
really is the time to go and

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:35.960
make the migration.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.380
Especially as the end of the v2
application period is now

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.630
less than a year way.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.780
So what's new in Maps?

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:52.760
Well when we sat down and
tried to think about how

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.220
should we figure out what we
should develop that would be

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.480
new for you, we really realized
there were two key

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.730
questions that had
to be answered.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.680
Firstly, what do developers
want?

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.990
What is it you're looking
for in this service?

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.410
What can we offer you
that will help you?

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.810
What do you need?

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:16.400
Secondly, what could we do
that would be awesome?

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.310
What could we do that would be
new, innovative, maybe not

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.770
something you thought of, but
something that would have

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:20.390
broad appeal.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.760
Something that would really
increase the capabilities of

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.230
the Maps API to meet
its goals.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.870
And in doing that, we had to
answer questions like, what is

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.610
the Maps API for?

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.865
What is its purpose?

00:23:32.865 --> 00:23:35.050
So, I'm going to touch on one
feature from each of these two

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.230
categories this morning.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.890
Firstly, what do developers
want?

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.540
Well, once again this is easy
for us to determine.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.400
We simply go to the Issue
Tracker and we take a look.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.860
And if you look at the Issue
Tracker for the Maps API, you

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.270
discover that one feature--

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.390
across all of our APIs-- has
been way out in front for a

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.240
couple of years now.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.560
Which is why I'm very happy to
say that today we're bringing

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.750
Google Transit to
the Maps API.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:04.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.620
THOR MITCHELL: So we're
introducing Transit to the

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.150
Maps API in two ways.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.830
Firstly, we are adding the
Transit layer, which allows

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.010
you to visualize the transit
network for a city

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.330
on top of your map.

00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:17.380
Secondly, we're adding support
for Transit as a travel mode

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.100
in the Directions API in
the Direction Service.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.010
So you can route across
public transport.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.020
OK, so that's something
that developers want.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.680
What about something new?

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:38.140
So when we were thinking about
something new, we--

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.900
as I mentioned, we asked
ourselves, what is the goal of

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.060
the Maps API?

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.450
And really the Maps API, unlike,
say, Google Maps which

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.060
is about navigation, it's about
finding businesses, it's

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.000
about understanding the
world around you.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.130
The Maps API is about you.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:53.030
It's about your data, it's about
your stories, it's about

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.020
the message you want
to get across.

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:58.310
And so we wanted to find ways to
help you do more flexible,

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:01.880
interesting visualizations of
your data in the Maps API.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.950
But once again, the inspiration
for where we ended

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.910
up actually started with
our Issue Tracker.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.880
Because we saw this--

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.700
polylines with arrows.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.550
That seems easy.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:21.000
I mean, you take an arrow, you
stick a triangle on the end.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.640
How hard can it be?

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.120
Well, it turns out there's
some complexity to this.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:30.160
You see, what happens
if you move the map?

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.120
Our maps are panable, they're
dragable, you can zoom in, you

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.680
can zoom out.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.660
That arrowhead soon goes out of
view and then you lose all

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.910
about directional context.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.530
And what about the shape
of the arrowhead?

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.140
I mean, there are a lot
of different ways

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.700
you can draw an arrowhead.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.850
This is just a small sample of
the 130 different arrowheads

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.412
that are in the Unicode spec.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:54.740
And we didn't think necessarily
that trying to

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.480
give you a canned set
was sufficient.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.550
We wanted to give you
more flexibility.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.170
So we think it may be better if
we let you define the shape

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.780
of the arrowhead yourself.

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.160
But if we're going to let you
define the shape of the

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.650
arrowhead, why stop
at arrowheads?

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.980
So today, we're introducing
a simple--

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.410
a new simple but powerful new
concept into the Maps API.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.915
And we call it symbols.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.140
A symbol is an icon, much like
an existing marker image that

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.360
you might use today.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.820
But it is defined as a vector.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:30.150
And it's rendered by the
browser in the client.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.600
The consequence of this is that,
firstly, as a vector, it

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:37.190
can be re-sized easily without
any loss in quality.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.820
And secondly, that you can
control in your application,

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.990
how it's styled--

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.350
its stroke, its fill, its
opacity, et cetera.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.640
Critically, not only can you
control how it's styled, you

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.280
can change how it's styled--

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.010
dynamically.

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.640
So to give you an example of the
value of this, I'd like to

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.490
show you a Maps application that
uses symbols as a marker

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.645
rather than the existing
marker images.

00:26:58.645 --> 00:27:02.770
A few years ago, Walmart
released a data set that

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:05.345
included a list of all of their
stores and the dates at

00:27:05.345 --> 00:27:06.930
which those stores opened.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:11.000
So what we're doing here is
simply visualizing that

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.290
expansion of the Walmart chain
over time in the US.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.930
Now you can see that we
represent each store with a

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:18.130
small, red dot.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.160
That's a symbol.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.340
We also use another circle
around the dot to indicate

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:22.970
when the store has opened.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.810
That's another symbol but a
symbol that we grow, and we

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.080
changed the opacity to fade
it away over time.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:31.010
What you may also notice is that
we're not done with dots

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.520
once we plotted them.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.785
As time passes, we change the
color to illustrate how long

00:27:35.785 --> 00:27:36.290
that store's been open.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:40.680
And so you can see visually, not
just as an animation but

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.610
through color, how the
distribution of stores across

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.050
the US occurred over time.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.800
Just let it run because
it's quite pretty.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.910
So this is an example of using
a symbol as a marker.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.070
But what about those
arrowheads?

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.370
Isn't that where we started?

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.240
So as well as just using symbols
as markers, you can

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.380
also use symbols to decorate
polylines.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.170
So you can see here, I'm
using drawing tools.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.610
And this particular line has an
arrowhead attached to it I

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.270
can also configure the
arrowheads to be repeated

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.910
along the line to address the
problems I mentioned earlier.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.600
And there's a couple of
different ways of doing this.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.640
In this case, I've set it so
that the arrowhead density

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.970
remains constant as you
zoom in and out.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:27.830
Of course, it's not just
arrowheads, you can use any

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:29.800
symbol to decorate a polyline
in this way.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.940
Here's a few examples of the
sort of symbols you might use.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.030
And what you'll notice is that
the symbol styling is

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.710
independent of the polyline
styling it's attached to.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.190
Which raises an interesting
possibility because we can

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:42.990
just hide the polyline.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:44.620
And then we get to implement
another feature developers

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.930
have asked us for--

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.070
dotted lines and dashed lines.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.050
Now these lines are straight
just because it fitted neatly

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.060
on the slide, but the symbols
will follow the shape of your

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.820
line, even if the line
is geodesic.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.690
What's interesting is that, in
much the same way that I said

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.270
to you that the symbol
properties relating to the

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.540
style of the symbol can be
dynamically modified by your

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:07.070
application, so too can the
rules on how the symbols are

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:11.310
rendered on the line, where
they're rendered on the line--

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.620
which imagine you do
things like this.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:21.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.740
THOR MITCHELL: Now when I saw
this, I got quite excited.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.170
And I reached out to a colleague
of mine who works on

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.830
our flight search team and I
said, do you have any good

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.690
data on flights?

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.420
He said, we have all the
data on flights.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.316
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:35.316 --> 00:29:39.010
THOR MITCHELL:And he sent me
a file that contained the

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.270
schedule for every single
commercial flight on the

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.570
planet today--

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:46.380
from every airport, to every
airport, what time it leaves,

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.610
what time it arrives, what type
of plane it is, whether

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.190
they serve food.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.710
So using that, and combining it
with the Maps API support

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.970
for geodesic polylines
and symbols, I was

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.680
able to build this.

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.355
This demo shows--

00:30:00.355 --> 00:30:01.940
or will show, I hope,
in a second--

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.760
come on, going backwards
for some reason.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.600
Here we go.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.200
This demo shows every arrival
and departure from San

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.800
Francisco Airport
happening today.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.840
Each of these--

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.121
you can see the curfew lifts
at six and boom.

00:30:21.121 --> 00:30:24.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.890
THOR MITCHELL: Every single
plane on this map is simply a

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:30.600
symbol attached to a geodesic
polyline that runs from the

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.720
origin to destination.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.930
I don't have to worry about how
to calculate the location

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:34.890
of these planes.

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.640
I simply set a percentage offset
along that polyline

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.400
based on the difference between
the departure and

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.190
arrival time.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.380
The Maps API does everything
else for me.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:45.120
We even go as far as calculating
these distances,

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.110
these percentage distances,
along geodesics in meters to

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:51.590
make sure these positions
are accurate.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:55.050
So this is, I think, a simple
concept that really powers up

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:56.720
our data visualization
capabilities.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.180
But it's not the only data
visualization feature that

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.520
we're launching at I/O today.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.980
However--

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.870
oh, this really is going
backwards now--

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:09.300
I know it's nice but
we've seen it.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:11.380
However, I sadly
am out of time.

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.030
So I recommend you attend our
next session, which is right

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.470
next door immediately after
this one on spatial data

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:19.250
visualization.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.910
And with that, I'd like
to hand over to

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:21.630
my colleague Dylan.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:22.910
He's going to talk a
little bit about

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:24.160
our Enterprise efforts.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.150
DYLAN LORIMER: Hello, my name
is Dylan Lorimer and I'm a

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.940
product manager at
Google on the

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.580
Enterprise Geospatial team.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:46.980
And our mission on that team
is to make it incredibly

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.770
simple for any business or
government or enterprise

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:53.250
organization to use our
geospatial technology in the

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.780
context of their everyday,
business decision-making.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.140
And we see all kinds of really
interesting, varied use cases

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.100
of our technologies--

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.270
everything from the prototypical
store locator on

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.950
the web, to fleet tracking and
asset tracking solutions,

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:12.420
disaster response, humanitarian
response-- maps

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.270
that serve a great purpose
in this world.

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:18.740
We have organizations managing
their entire catalog now of

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.240
GIS data, or geospatial
data, in our cloud.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.450
We see maps embedded in planes,
maps embedded in all

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:28.440
kinds of vehicles, and then
all sorts of third party

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.380
software vendors embedding
our maps and our

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.440
services in their products.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.110
Our goal is to make this all
possible on the Enterprise

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.180
Geospatial team.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:42.260
And really the common
thread across these

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.060
use cases is data.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.000
Businesses and governments tend
to want to take their own

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.080
mapping data and put it on top
of Google Maps, or bring it

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.650
into Google Earth,
or distribute

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.680
it to mobile devices.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:57.370
And these businesses and
governments tend to have their

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:01.040
own types of data really
specific to what they do--

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.240
sometimes different data than
what Google would publish on

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.290
its Basemap.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:08.620
So for instance, private floor
plan data or data pertaining

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.340
to the infrastructure for
their jurisdiction--

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.400
might be more current imagery
or kind of false color or

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.890
derived imagery data sets.

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.000
Whatever it is, it's really
specific to how they conduct

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.990
their business day to day.

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:27.940
And historically, it's actually
really difficult, we

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:30.200
found, for governments and
businesses to be able to take

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.100
that data and actually
put it on the map.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.600
It's required a costly
investment in on premise

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.170
hardware, expensive software
licenses, dedicated

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.430
administration, specialists
to manage the data.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.340
It just hasn't been that easy.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.420
Google, on the other hand,
we built a lot of great

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.630
Infrastructure over the years.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.610
Brian kind of talked
about all of it.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:53.900
Great infrastructure, really
in support of our consumer

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:56.900
mission for Google Earth and
Google Maps, to take all the

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.670
relevant, geospatial data in
the world and provide it to

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:03.480
our consumer users to meet and
surpass their expectations for

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.550
the best, most authoritative
data.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:08.590
We built this great
infrastructure, and we

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:10.550
recognize that businesses
and governments could

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.290
benefit from it.

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.440
Why couldn't we provide them
with access to this cloud

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.460
platform, essentially,
or these tools to

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.719
process their own data.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:18.909
And so we did that.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:23.159
We launched Google Maps Engine
earlier this year-- really

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.810
late last year-- earlier
this year.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:29.580
And that's Google's GeoCloud
Platform, enabling businesses

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.909
and governments, and anyone to
upload their mapping data to

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:35.659
Google's Cloud, whether it be a
spreadsheet containing their

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:39.230
store locations, could be some
shape files or other data sets

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.860
pertaining to the Basemap, could
be terabytes of imagery.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.080
Whatever it is, upload
it to Google's Cloud.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.429
Securely manage it in our Cloud,
and then get access to

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:52.750
our processing technology
to build maps and

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.330
build layers with it.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:57.890
And then publish those to your
users who could access it

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.190
through simple-to-use desktop
applications like Google Earth

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:05.490
client, or a Google Maps-like
interface, or Google Earth on

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.640
mobile devices.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.210
Or also expose it to developers
to embed in their

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.930
own third party products.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.420
That's Google Maps
Engine today.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:16.480
We launched it as an
Enterprise product.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.140
It still is an Enterprise-only
product and we do intend,

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.620
later in the year, to provide
for an online trial that folks

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.670
can try out online without
having to speak

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.920
to our sales team.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.450
And we're really thrilled
with the use to date.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.920
We are actually now serving--
this is in addition to what

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.650
Google serves on its Basemap--

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:40.490
we're now serving through Maps
Engine almost 170 terabytes of

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:42.140
customers' own data.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.980
This is data they've uploaded,
raster data.

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.790
This is raster data they've
uploaded to Maps Engine and

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.930
they're serving securely to
their users, whether it's

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:53.060
their customers, their
employees, their constituents,

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:54.020
or the public at large.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.270
Whoever it is, it's their data
in Google's Cloud served out

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:00.510
through our technology.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:04.285
Almost 3 billion features--
vector features of data-- that

00:36:04.285 --> 00:36:07.640
are hosted in our cloud and
rendered into tiles on demand

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.100
for use in their mapping
applications.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.580
And we're now seeing greater
than 1,000 private maps from

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.280
our customers published
to their own users.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.060
So we're really thrilled
with the usage to date.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:25.940
And also really excited about
what we have in store.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:29.740
So for the past four or six
months since launch, we've

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:34.600
really been focused on a few key
areas of innovation based

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.140
largely on customer feedback
and what we're excited to

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.320
bring to market.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:43.040
Rich API to the platform is, by
and large, the thing we've

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.170
heard that most of our
customers have

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.430
requested from day one.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.980
So we're going to talk a little
bit about APIs today

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.070
and then also some next
generation ways to visualize

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.960
the data, sort of in line with
what Thor had demonstrated

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.210
with the Maps API.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.650
But by far, the number one
feature request from our

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:06.240
customers has been programmatic
access to the

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.670
Maps Engine Platform.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.080
Our users want to be able to
programmatically upload data,

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.410
download data, build maps,
process imagery, publish maps,

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:17.100
query data sets, append
features--

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.940
have a full set of programmatic
capabilities to

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.640
our platform.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.910
And so today I'm delighted to
announce that, a little bit

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:28.010
later this year, pretty soon,
we're going to release to all

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.860
Maps Engine customers, in sort
of a trusted, testing

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.230
capacity, this first release
of the APIs.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:37.920
And the APIs really offer
two broad categories of

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.440
capability--

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.490
programmatic data upload, data
query, the ability to find

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:46.920
data sets available to you as
a user, the ability to build

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.130
layers and so forth.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:51.310
And then also kind of vector
crud-type operations--

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:55.450
sort of queries, appends,
edits, and inserts into

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:57.500
individual vector data sets.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:01.060
So for instance, if you had a
set of store locations, you

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.720
could query those stores to
find stores that were open

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.530
between 10:00 AM and
9:00 PM that had a

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.680
handicap ramp, for instance.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.450
So we're excited about
these APIs.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:15.480
They'll be available soon to
our Maps Engine customers.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.285
And I thought it would be
helpful to actually make this

00:38:19.285 --> 00:38:21.920
a little more concrete, to
actually talk to an existing

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.370
application built
on Maps Engine.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.010
So this is by one of our
partners in Vista.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:30.040
They built a utilities
management mapping application

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.140
they provide to cities to help
them get an understanding of

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.960
what's going on below
their city streets.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:37.480
And the capabilities here that
sort of articulate what the

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.930
APIs will provide is
that users log in.

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:41.410
Based on their identity,
they get access

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.520
to different layers.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.700
You actually see a premium image
being distributed from

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.360
GeoEye, who also use Maps
Engine, right into the

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.940
application.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:52.370
Users can restyle layers based
on mouse clicks and events.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:56.140
They can get a tabular view of
the attributes, based on other

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.480
kinds of queries.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:00.640
And then even do more advanced
things like buffer lines or do

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.300
intersections.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.090
So this is just a good example
of the sort of prototypical

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:07.510
application that we expect a lot
of folks to build on these

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.760
Maps Engine APIs.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:17.050
The other area we've been
focused on is this next

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:20.210
generation of visualization
of your data in the cloud.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:24.050
Thor spoke at length about the
opportunity with modern

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:27.690
browser technology for
client-side rendering of

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:28.660
Google's data.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.320
And that's also, of course,
possible with customers' data

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.440
stored in Maps Engine.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.370
So I'm going to jump
into a video here.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:43.110
But what you're going to see is
that polygons for countries

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.710
of the world are sent
to the browser.

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:48.430
The developer, in JavaScript,
has structured access to them

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:49.530
and they can choose how
to render them.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.890
In this case, based on temporal
characteristics.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:56.210
They can style them a certain
way and create a time series.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:59.340
And this is just a really
basic example of what's

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:01.910
possible, but really anything's
possible when, on

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:04.390
the client side you have
this rich, structured

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:05.380
access to the data.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.040
So this will also be turned on
for Maps Engine customers for

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.290
their data later in the year.

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:17.760
Not all customers have their
own data, but many of our

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.380
customers have a big
thirst and appetite

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:20.420
for additional data.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:23.990
And so for these other data
types out there, beyond those

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:27.300
that Google publishes to our
Basemap, we're really excited

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.620
to announce that we're
relaunching the

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.850
Google Earth Gallery.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.740
We relaunched this last week.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.970
And this is Google's place to
organize and surface all the

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:38.150
rest of the world's
geospatial data.

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:40.550
So the data that doesn't
appear in our Basemap--

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:43.440
these are additional layers that
maybe don't make sense to

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.030
include in our Basemap for
typical consumer users.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.400
We intend to surface all
the rest of the world's

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.050
authoritative public data in
the Google Earth Gallery.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.060
And what's so cool about it is
it's built on Maps Engine.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.990
And so all the maps in it that
you discover are accessible

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:01.690
and serve kind of via all
these Maps Engine

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:02.330
capabilities.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.970
So you can easily view
it in Google Earth.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:08.220
You can bring it into a Google
Maps-like front end.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.680
You can actually get embed code
to stick it right in your

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.400
blog or your website.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.300
And then you could also get
access to the JavaScript.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.890
Actually take those layers in
those maps and put them right

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.750
in your own mapping
application.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.120
So we're enabling developers, in
this case, to get access to

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.950
all these great, additional
layers and bring it right into

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:26.200
their maps.

00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:33.090
And if you want to learn more
about Google Maps Engine and

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.600
the Gallery, you can go to a
session tomorrow put on by

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.850
some of our sales engineers.

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:43.310
Not all data is static
though, right?

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:46.300
The Gallery Maps Engine is
largely around contextual

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:48.340
layers that you style, and
that you can view in the

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:49.740
context of a map--

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.160
maybe update them periodically
through APIs.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.750
But there's just tremendous
amounts of data in this world,

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:57.030
geo-located data that's
dynamic in nature.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:00.800
For instance, the locations of
people or teams of people, or

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.420
animals, or packages, or
whatever it may be.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:05.360
There's just a lot of dynamic
data out there.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:09.850
And the IDC actually reports
that they anticipate, by 2015,

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:14.000
over 1.5 billion employees in
the world, in the global

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.160
workforce, will be mobile.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.210
They won't be at a desk, they'll
be out in the field

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.740
going to job sites.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.370
And there's just no easy way,
today, to manage that.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.780
It takes a lot of effort to
build a mobile application and

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.000
have a server that can take
those locations, render them

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.620
to users and to administrators.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.790
There's just no simple way for
organizations to manage this.

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:37.280
And so, earlier this week, or
last week, we were really

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:41.430
delighted to announce Google
Maps Coordinate, which is an

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:44.380
out-of-the-box, simple solution
for businesses to

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.300
equip their mobile
workforce with an

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.810
application on their phones.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:51.080
And to provide the workforce
with tools and capabilities to

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.730
capture data in the field, to
share that data with the

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:56.320
central organization, and for
that central organization to

00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.250
kind of manage those assets and
dispatch them to job sites

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:03.460
and other locations.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.350
DYLAN LORIMER: And you can
learn more about it at

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:12.420
maps.google.com/coordinate.

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:15.830
Coordinate is actually built,
though, on top of a new API

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:19.650
that was built from the ground
up to really support this

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:23.980
notion of rich, comprehensive,
asset tracking applications

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.240
built entirely out of
Google's Cloud.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.600
Historically, developers
building asset tracking

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.760
applications have had to have
their own database and go to a

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.710
lot of effort, essentially, to
store the locations of assets

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:37.030
in the world and to render
them on a map.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:41.060
And so, with the Google Maps
Tracks API, this is a great--

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:43.120
this is an opportunity for us
to really rethink what a

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.410
perfect asset tracking API could
be for our developers.

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:50.250
And it was purpose built from
the ground up to store the

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:53.720
locations of your dynamic
assets in the world, to

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.780
provide for query capabilities
on them, store their history,

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:00.450
provide some visualization
capabilities, and otherwise

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:03.960
let you manage those assets
in Google's Cloud.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.410
You can group them into
collections, you can define

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:11.470
geofences and be alerted when
they enter/exit those areas.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:14.170
And this is going to launch to
trusted testers right about

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.550
now, and will be available
later in the year.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.500
So, with that said, I wanted to
pass the mic here to Peter

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:22.080
Birch, who's going to talk about
Google Earth and the

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.190
future of 3D.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:25.158
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:25.158 --> 00:44:25.650
DYLAN LORIMER: This doesn't
work very well.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:29.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:29.340
PETER BIRCH: Thanks, Dylan.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:31.980
And as you can see we also have
a great talk coming up to

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.900
learn more about our Enterprise
Solutions.

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.340
So those of you who are actually
got a chance to see

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:44.780
our event a few weeks ago, we
talked about a lot of great

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:50.000
new things, including the next
dimension of Google Maps.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.790
And in that, I actually talked
to you about coming soon for--

00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:57.610
on Google Earth for
Android and iOS.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:00.330
And just to get straight to the
punchline, today I'm proud

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.480
to announce that this is
available today in the market

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.220
on Android.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:08.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.430
PETER BIRCH: And will be coming
very soon for iPhone as

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:11.680
well, an iPad.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.850
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:18.510
-Throughout history, we've
pushed boundaries to expand

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:19.760
our view of the world.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.345
Today a new frontier is
at our fingertips.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.650
Introducing a new way
to soar above your

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:47.210
favorite cities in 3D.

00:45:57.435 --> 00:45:59.870
With the Tour Guide,
exploring the world

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:01.130
has never been easier.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.610
Take flight in Google Earth
on your mobile device.

00:46:15.052 --> 00:46:15.920
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:22.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:24.870
PETER BIRCH: And with
that, we are--

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:35.160
one second.

00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:43.930
So here we are.

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:47.280
This is Google Earth with the
latest version 7.0 that's in

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.730
the market today.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.400
And let's just dive right in.

00:47:08.112 --> 00:47:15.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.385
PETER BIRCH: Now one of the
things that we've always had

00:47:16.385 --> 00:47:18.040
with Google Earth is that--

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:20.300
with a lot of our Google
products like Google Search

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.060
and Google Maps--
we've really--

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:23.695
we want to help people
find information.

00:47:23.695 --> 00:47:26.810
And in Google Maps we wanted to
help people find their way.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:28.900
Well, with Google Earth,
we really want

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.970
to get people lost.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:34.810
We really want you to go out
in the world and explore

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.130
because that's really what the
wonder of the world is.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:38.890
And that's what we try to
bring to our users.

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:42.310
So with that, we've also
introduced this fantastic, new

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:44.320
feature that we call
the Tour Guide.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:48.750
And what this is, is actually,
for any given view, I can just

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:49.960
open it up.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.810
It will give me a list of
locations in the current view

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:56.350
that might be of
interest to me.

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:58.200
So let's take a look and
see what we got here.

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.220
So let's, for example,
click in on the

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:09.090
Massachusetts State House.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:11.570
And then again here, you can
see some useful information

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:15.150
showing up on the screen.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:17.510
And it's actually taking us on
a little bit of a tour here.

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.940
And I can close that.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.450
And let's go check out
Boston Common.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:49.860
So today we have approximately
a dozen metropolitan areas

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.770
that are going to be live which
include pretty much all

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:55.930
of the San Francisco Bay Area,
we have Boston, we have Rome,

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:59.030
we have Tampa, we
have Charlotte.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:02.340
We have Bryan's favorite place,
Lawrence, Kansas.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:04.230
We have Portland.

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:05.880
That's just a start.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.120
By the end of this year, we
expect to have coverage for

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.820
over 300 million people and
that's not the end.

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.700
We're just going to keep growing
from there because

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:18.370
we're really excited about
bringing this new 3D image

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:22.100
technology to users
around the world.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.600
And if you want to learn more
about this technology, we have

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.510
a blog post out on the Google
Lat Long Blog right now.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:29.190
And also.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.560
If you go back and look at our
next dimension of Google Maps,

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.340
you can see some more
information about some of this

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.020
fantastic technology.

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:38.350
And with that, I'd like to bring
up Brian McClendon to

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:39.960
wrap us up.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.800
BRIAN MCCLENDON: Thank you.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.690
Thank you very much, Peter.

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:47.870
Am I on now?

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:48.410
Testing.

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.550
So, I wanted to thank Peter.

00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:55.090
The Geo Team at Google has been
working extremely hard on

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:55.690
many projects.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.650
Today, as you know, is one of
the big days at Google where

00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:59.730
we get to launch many things
that have been in the works

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:00.300
for a long time.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:03.140
But the amount of work that our
team has put in to make

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.130
this and all the other launches
you've heard about,

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:06.750
both here and on
the main stage,

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:08.330
possible, has been amazing.

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:11.500
I think we have the strongest
engineering team working on

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.900
Maps today and I'm extremely
proud of them.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:17.420
To add to that, he announced
that we have the 3D imagery

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.450
available on Google Earth
in the store today.

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:23.510
We also did, just right now,
launch GMM 6.9 which has the

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:25.570
offline Maps that was
also talked about.

00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:28.750
So think, we've delivered on
those two major launches.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:31.020
And I would like to--

00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:33.170
get the slide back--

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:35.800
coming momentarily.

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.310
And we'll talk about the rest
of the GEO Track because we

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:41.240
have a lot of teams that want
to talk to you, in much more

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.330
depth, about what we've done and
help you understand how to

00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:46.200
use some of the features.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.200
The animated symbols is just
incredible, I think from a

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:49.940
programmer's perspective.

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:52.010
I'm so excited about using that
because it allows you to

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:55.820
visualize large amounts
of data.

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:57.730
So offline Maps available.

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:01.680
And the last thing I want to say
is, we're trying to reduce

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.300
all the dragons.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.540
OK, it's my fault.

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:08.510
We're trying to reduce all the
dragons, but there is one last

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:11.120
dragon that probably
we won't take out.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:14.700
And so that, I thank the team
in Japan who did the April

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.550
fool's joke, it was
incredible--

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.480
getting Google Maps in 8-bit was
one of the most fun things

00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.190
I think we've had inside
Google in a long time.

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:25.790
So with that, I'd like to say
thank you very much and go on

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:27.760
with the rest of Google
I/O. Thank you.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.517
[APPLAUSE]
