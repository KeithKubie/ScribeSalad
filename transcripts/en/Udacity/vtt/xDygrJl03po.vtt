00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, let's think. What happens when this object hits the ground?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, now it's no longer accelerating, so Galileo's statement doesn't make any sense.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In fact, Galileo didn't spend too much time thinking about objects at rest.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
He was much more interested in motion. So, let's think.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What would Newton be saying now?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now that the balls are at rest, the acceleration is 0.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
According to this equation, which is a law of physics, it must always be true.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
A 0 acceleration must correspond to a force of 0.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, what happened? Did gravity just turn off all of a sudden?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
No, of course not.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The ball is still being pulled down by gravity,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and I'm going to label gravity as mg from now on

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
where m is the mass of this ball and g is the acceleration due to gravity, that 10 m/sÂ².

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
What's going on?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
According to this force diagram, the ball ought to be accelerating downwards.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There's a force downwards.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Well, here we're saved by the fact that force is what's called a vector.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm representing this force with an arrow, because this force

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
has a direction associated with it--downwards.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
By adding a force in the opposite direction, we can actually cancel this force.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Which of the following arrows do you think best represents the force needed

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to cancel this downwards mg.

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Choose what you think is the best answer.
