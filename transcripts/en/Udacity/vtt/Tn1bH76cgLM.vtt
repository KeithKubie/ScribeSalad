00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.180
In lesson one, we built a new project with a basic UI backed with mock

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.730
data. In this lesson, we'll hook sunshine up

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.140
with the Cloud, replacing the mock data with

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.397
real weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.320
To do that, we'll learn about the Android

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.860
permission system, Network I/O, and how to move

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.460
time consuming tasks off the main UI thread.
