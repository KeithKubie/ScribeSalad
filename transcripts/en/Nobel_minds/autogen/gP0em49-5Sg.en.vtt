parasail macroeconomics seems to be a
 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.110
parasail macroeconomics seems to be a
common term here that what is the main

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120
common term here that what is the main
 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:13.160
common term here that what is the main
question of macroeconomics textbook in

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170
question of macroeconomics textbook in
 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.359
question of macroeconomics textbook in
basic economics it usually talks about

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369
basic economics it usually talks about
 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.340
basic economics it usually talks about
business cycles about short-run

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350
business cycles about short-run
 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.950
business cycles about short-run
fluctuations in economic activity like

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
fluctuations in economic activity like
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.259
fluctuations in economic activity like
unemployment is up or inflation is up or

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
unemployment is up or inflation is up or
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.390
unemployment is up or inflation is up or
down

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400
down
 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.220
down
this type of macroeconomics is a little

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
this type of macroeconomics is a little
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.880
this type of macroeconomics is a little
different you find it in textbooks but

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890
different you find it in textbooks but
 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.229
different you find it in textbooks but
it's very different because it's about a

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239
it's very different because it's about a
 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.660
it's very different because it's about a
longer run where economic growth comes

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
longer run where economic growth comes
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.750
longer run where economic growth comes
from so so actually the textbooks have

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
from so so actually the textbooks have
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.530
from so so actually the textbooks have
been changed quite a lot since Romer did

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540
been changed quite a lot since Romer did
 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.150
been changed quite a lot since Romer did
his work and so that yes actually the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
his work and so that yes actually the
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.520
his work and so that yes actually the
the part of the book that is about the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
the part of the book that is about the
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.220
the part of the book that is about the
long-run issues has become longer and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
long-run issues has become longer and
 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470
long-run issues has become longer and
many textbooks start with that now where

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
many textbooks start with that now where
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.240
many textbooks start with that now where
when they used to start with business

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
when they used to start with business
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.639
when they used to start with business
cycles well what was Paul Romer say

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
cycles well what was Paul Romer say
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.540
cycles well what was Paul Romer say
about that

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
about that
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.350
about that
oh he asks where it comes from I mean he

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
oh he asks where it comes from I mean he
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.240
oh he asks where it comes from I mean he
wanted to understand why some countries

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
wanted to understand why some countries
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.250
wanted to understand why some countries
grow and other countries don't grow and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
grow and other countries don't grow and
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.620
grow and other countries don't grow and
also why though why the world grows at

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
also why though why the world grows at
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.510
also why though why the world grows at
the rate it does and what explains

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
the rate it does and what explains
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820
the rate it does and what explains
technological progress and I think it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
technological progress and I think it
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.570
technological progress and I think it
was by asking the question that he came

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
was by asking the question that he came
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.100
was by asking the question that he came
up with ways of thinking about it that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
up with ways of thinking about it that
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109
up with ways of thinking about it that
influenced a lot of other researchers

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
influenced a lot of other researchers
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.020
influenced a lot of other researchers
and it led to both empirical work and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
and it led to both empirical work and
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.760
and it led to both empirical work and
theoretical work and actually an

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
theoretical work and actually an
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.149
theoretical work and actually an
explosion in research so what is the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
explosion in research so what is the
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.660
explosion in research so what is the
main motor of economic growth it I think

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
main motor of economic growth it I think
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.880
main motor of economic growth it I think
almost all economists would say its

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
almost all economists would say its
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.490
almost all economists would say its
technological change but the question is

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
technological change but the question is
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.140
technological change but the question is
where does that come from like what why

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
where does that come from like what why
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.429
where does that come from like what why
does it happen and when does it happen

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
does it happen and when does it happen
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.230
does it happen and when does it happen
you know nothing happened during the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240
you know nothing happened during the
 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.969
you know nothing happened during the
many hundred years before the Industrial

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979
many hundred years before the Industrial
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.859
many hundred years before the Industrial
Revolution in terms of technological

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869
Revolution in terms of technological
 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.020
Revolution in terms of technological
change and then it all exploded but it

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
change and then it all exploded but it
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.050
change and then it all exploded but it
hasn't been totally even and but it's

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
hasn't been totally even and but it's
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.609
hasn't been totally even and but it's
been ongoing since the Industrial

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619
been ongoing since the Industrial
 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.270
been ongoing since the Industrial
Revolution and and a 2 percent per year

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
Revolution and and a 2 percent per year
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370
Revolution and and a 2 percent per year
the the leading countries are just kind

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
the the leading countries are just kind
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.380
the the leading countries are just kind
of growing and growing and it's because

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
of growing and growing and it's because
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.020
of growing and growing and it's because
of technological change and in what way

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
of technological change and in what way
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.080
of technological change and in what way
did Paul Romer explain think about why

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
did Paul Romer explain think about why
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.410
did Paul Romer explain think about why
it occurs and what are the good

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420
it occurs and what are the good
 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.740
it occurs and what are the good
preconditions for healthy growth and he

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
preconditions for healthy growth and he
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.000
preconditions for healthy growth and he
thought about things like how societies

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010
thought about things like how societies
 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.449
thought about things like how societies
organized in terms of patent systems in

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459
organized in terms of patent systems in
 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.640
organized in terms of patent systems in
terms of subsidies to oranjee so it's

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650
terms of subsidies to oranjee so it's
 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.830
terms of subsidies to oranjee so it's
not enough to have universities because

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
not enough to have universities because
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.370
not enough to have universities because
universities are crucial and there there

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
universities are crucial and there there
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.560
universities are crucial and there there
are people there at universities like

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570
are people there at universities like
 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.440
are people there at universities like
Romer himself they are rewarded by this

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450
Romer himself they are rewarded by this
 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.600
Romer himself they are rewarded by this
wonderful prizes but you also need

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610
wonderful prizes but you also need
 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.300
wonderful prizes but you also need
research in the market and that's what

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
research in the market and that's what
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.190
research in the market and that's what
he focused on so what makes it happen in

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
he focused on so what makes it happen in
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.290
he focused on so what makes it happen in
the market what what are the

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300
the market what what are the
 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.110
the market what what are the
circumstances you know judicial system

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120
circumstances you know judicial system
 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.479
circumstances you know judicial system
all kinds of things that create the

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
all kinds of things that create the
 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.920
all kinds of things that create the
conditions for technological growth

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930
conditions for technological growth
 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.570
conditions for technological growth
that's what he was interested in then

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580
that's what he was interested in then
 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.690
that's what he was interested in then
you have to realize that once you come

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
you have to realize that once you come
 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.210
you have to realize that once you come
up with great ideas it's important that

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
up with great ideas it's important that
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.770
up with great ideas it's important that
they spread that they spread to other

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780
they spread that they spread to other
 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.380
they spread that they spread to other
countries so so many countries I think

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390
countries so so many countries I think
 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.710
countries so so many countries I think
or or not original innovators but they

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720
or or not original innovators but they
 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.490
or or not original innovators but they
adopt technical ideas different kind of

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500
adopt technical ideas different kind of
 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.960
adopt technical ideas different kind of
products and ideas are different yes

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970
products and ideas are different yes
 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.870
products and ideas are different yes
exactly and by thinking deeply about why

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880
exactly and by thinking deeply about why
 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.740
exactly and by thinking deeply about why
ideas are so different than regular

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750
ideas are so different than regular
 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.259
ideas are so different than regular
shoo-shoo type products its then you get

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269
shoo-shoo type products its then you get
 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.840
shoo-shoo type products its then you get
some other clue to how to think about it

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850
some other clue to how to think about it
 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.140
some other clue to how to think about it
and it was led to think about many ideas

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150
and it was led to think about many ideas
 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.380
and it was led to think about many ideas
are super cheap to replicate once you

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390
are super cheap to replicate once you
 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.720
are super cheap to replicate once you
get them but it's it's all about getting

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730
get them but it's it's all about getting
 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.280
get them but it's it's all about getting
the ideas and then that's when all these

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
the ideas and then that's when all these
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.300
the ideas and then that's when all these
institutional preconditions come in that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310
institutional preconditions come in that
 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.190
institutional preconditions come in that
allow some profits but not too much

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
allow some profits but not too much
 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.690
allow some profits but not too much
profits because you don't want to

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700
profits because you don't want to
 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.180
profits because you don't want to
restrict it too much and how to manage

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190
restrict it too much and how to manage
 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.890
restrict it too much and how to manage
that is a central problem and I think

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900
that is a central problem and I think
 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.199
that is a central problem and I think
all the people who are at governments

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209
all the people who are at governments
 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.840
all the people who are at governments
around the world these days they think

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850
around the world these days they think
 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.330
around the world these days they think
about it the way he thinks about it we

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
about it the way he thinks about it we
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.160
about it the way he thinks about it we
save read the textbooks now and they

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170
save read the textbooks now and they
 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.020
save read the textbooks now and they
they understood that ideas are different

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030
they understood that ideas are different
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.740
they understood that ideas are different
and and and that's just a framework for

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750
and and and that's just a framework for
 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.819
and and and that's just a framework for
thinking so somehow you have to give

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829
thinking so somehow you have to give
 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.159
thinking so somehow you have to give
birth to ideas but who has the

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169
birth to ideas but who has the
 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.900
birth to ideas but who has the
responsibility for that

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910
responsibility for that
 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.080
responsibility for that
well they if you live in market

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090
well they if you live in market
 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.780
well they if you live in market
economies it's not that this anybody

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790
economies it's not that this anybody
 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.060
economies it's not that this anybody
responsible you need to happen by itself

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070
responsible you need to happen by itself
 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.250
responsible you need to happen by itself
and that's what the market does these

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260
and that's what the market does these
 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.860
and that's what the market does these
things and it does it usually fairly

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870
things and it does it usually fairly
 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.110
things and it does it usually fairly
well but he also pointed to how it

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120
well but he also pointed to how it
 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.940
well but he also pointed to how it
doesn't do it enough maybe I'm in a case

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950
doesn't do it enough maybe I'm in a case
 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.159
doesn't do it enough maybe I'm in a case
of ideas so if he emphasizes that you

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169
of ideas so if he emphasizes that you
 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.350
of ideas so if he emphasizes that you
need to give people patents that last

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360
need to give people patents that last
 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.790
need to give people patents that last
for a while to give them proper

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800
for a while to give them proper
 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.730
for a while to give them proper
incentives to do things to to innovate

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740
incentives to do things to to innovate
 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.240
incentives to do things to to innovate
and and and you may also need to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250
and and and you may also need to
 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.909
and and and you may also need to
subsidize research and development ideas

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919
subsidize research and development ideas
 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.150
subsidize research and development ideas
and so I think governments are to some

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160
and so I think governments are to some
 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.520
and so I think governments are to some
extent responsible but a lot of it

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530
extent responsible but a lot of it
 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.700
extent responsible but a lot of it
happens by just market activity so it's

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710
happens by just market activity so it's
 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.120
happens by just market activity so it's
both and the other part of the price has

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130
both and the other part of the price has
 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.640
both and the other part of the price has
to do with climate change and this is

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650
to do with climate change and this is
 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.130
to do with climate change and this is
really a very hard problem that involves

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140
really a very hard problem that involves
 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.779
really a very hard problem that involves
so many different parts of society

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789
so many different parts of society
 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.980
so many different parts of society
everything so how can one model with

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990
everything so how can one model with
 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.020
everything so how can one model with
well I think what what what Nordhaus did

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030
well I think what what what Nordhaus did
 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.350
well I think what what what Nordhaus did
was that he became very interested in

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360
was that he became very interested in
 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.570
was that he became very interested in
other sciences after his PhD degree

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580
other sciences after his PhD degree
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.650
other sciences after his PhD degree
maybe even before I don't know but he

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660
maybe even before I don't know but he
 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.100
maybe even before I don't know but he
did this interdisciplinary thing which

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110
did this interdisciplinary thing which
 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.500
did this interdisciplinary thing which
is very fashionable today but I think in

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510
is very fashionable today but I think in
 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.490
is very fashionable today but I think in
the 1970s it was a very common that an

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500
the 1970s it was a very common that an
 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.980
the 1970s it was a very common that an
economist would dig deep into Natural

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990
economist would dig deep into Natural
 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.610
economist would dig deep into Natural
Sciences and also discover climate

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620
Sciences and also discover climate
 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.440
Sciences and also discover climate
change as a potentially big problem I

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450
change as a potentially big problem I
 

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.270
change as a potentially big problem I
mean most people for sure most

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280
mean most people for sure most
 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.800
mean most people for sure most
economists didn't think about it and

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810
economists didn't think about it and
 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.440
economists didn't think about it and
many others didn't either so so I guess

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450
many others didn't either so so I guess
 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.270
many others didn't either so so I guess
you had the early realization that you

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280
you had the early realization that you
 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.570
you had the early realization that you
needed to connect all these things and

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580
needed to connect all these things and
 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.860
needed to connect all these things and
build a framework for thinking about

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870
build a framework for thinking about
 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.020
build a framework for thinking about
them together so I think a lot of what

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030
them together so I think a lot of what
 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.800
them together so I think a lot of what
he did was to simplify the natural

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810
he did was to simplify the natural
 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.029
he did was to simplify the natural
science bits to the point where he could

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039
science bits to the point where he could
 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.710
science bits to the point where he could
think about them jointly with economics

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720
think about them jointly with economics
 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.450
think about them jointly with economics
so there is sort of you need to take

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460
so there is sort of you need to take
 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.920
so there is sort of you need to take
existing knowledge

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930
existing knowledge
 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.930
existing knowledge
make it digestible digestible for for

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940
make it digestible digestible for for
 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.520
make it digestible digestible for for
people like himself and for other

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530
people like himself and for other
 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.410
people like himself and for other
economists and ultimately for

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420
economists and ultimately for
 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.170
economists and ultimately for
policymakers so that that was a quite an

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180
policymakers so that that was a quite an
 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.860
policymakers so that that was a quite an
effort and in the in the early days he

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870
effort and in the in the early days he
 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.920
effort and in the in the early days he
he he asked limited questions but still

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930
he he asked limited questions but still
 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.540
he he asked limited questions but still
super interesting questions like what's

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550
super interesting questions like what's
 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.910
super interesting questions like what's
the best way of not exceeding two

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:44.920
the best way of not exceeding two
 

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.920
the best way of not exceeding two
degrees of warming a question that most

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930
degrees of warming a question that most
 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.570
degrees of warming a question that most
people are super interested in today he

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580
people are super interested in today he
 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.050
people are super interested in today he
asked like 40 years ago but then he

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060
asked like 40 years ago but then he
 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.760
asked like 40 years ago but then he
asked more ambitious questions which is

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770
asked more ambitious questions which is
 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.740
asked more ambitious questions which is
okay but what is the best thing to do

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:55.750
okay but what is the best thing to do
 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.570
okay but what is the best thing to do
overall let's not restrict attention

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580
overall let's not restrict attention
 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.910
overall let's not restrict attention
just to a particular temperature goal

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920
just to a particular temperature goal
 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.550
just to a particular temperature goal
how should we think about maybe what's

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560
how should we think about maybe what's
 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.650
how should we think about maybe what's
the right temperature golden and so on

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660
the right temperature golden and so on
 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.890
the right temperature golden and so on
so he he needed to invest for decades

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900
so he he needed to invest for decades
 

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.560
so he he needed to invest for decades
before he was ready to adjust these more

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570
before he was ready to adjust these more
 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.840
before he was ready to adjust these more
difficult questions and as I said in my

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850
difficult questions and as I said in my
 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.130
difficult questions and as I said in my
presentation today in the press

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140
presentation today in the press
 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.590
presentation today in the press
conference it's we don't have final

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600
conference it's we don't have final
 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.390
conference it's we don't have final
answers but now can if we can just

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400
answers but now can if we can just
 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.910
answers but now can if we can just
follow in his footsteps and if you don't

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:20.920
follow in his footsteps and if you don't
 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.680
follow in his footsteps and if you don't
like exactly what it did on this we

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:22.690
like exactly what it did on this we
 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.270
like exactly what it did on this we
change it and and that's what

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280
change it and and that's what
 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.070
change it and and that's what
everybody's doing now around the world

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080
everybody's doing now around the world
 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.970
everybody's doing now around the world
and the most last report from this night

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:29.980
and the most last report from this night
 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:34.140
and the most last report from this night
is the IPCC says that we have to stop

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150
is the IPCC says that we have to stop
 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.340
is the IPCC says that we have to stop
the growth of temperature to at 1.5 yeah

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.350
the growth of temperature to at 1.5 yeah
 

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.560
the growth of temperature to at 1.5 yeah
I haven't I haven't had time to read it

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:42.570
I haven't I haven't had time to read it
 

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.650
I haven't I haven't had time to read it
because it just it came out at midnight

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660
because it just it came out at midnight
 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.720
because it just it came out at midnight
so not too many hours ago so I have to

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:48.730
so not too many hours ago so I have to
 

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.250
so not too many hours ago so I have to
look carefully and see what it says 1.5

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:53.260
look carefully and see what it says 1.5
 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.020
look carefully and see what it says 1.5
degrees is it okay idea there was to say

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.030
degrees is it okay idea there was to say
 

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.020
degrees is it okay idea there was to say
what would it take to get us to not

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.030
what would it take to get us to not
 

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.980
what would it take to get us to not
exceed one and a half so it's I don't

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:04.990
exceed one and a half so it's I don't
 

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.710
exceed one and a half so it's I don't
think that the point was we mustn't

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:07.720
think that the point was we mustn't
 

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.470
think that the point was we mustn't
exceed one and a half it was more what

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:10.480
exceed one and a half it was more what
 

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.360
exceed one and a half it was more what
would it take is it even possible and I

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:12.370
would it take is it even possible and I
 

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.000
would it take is it even possible and I
think they that's my reading without

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.010
think they that's my reading without
 

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.560
think they that's my reading without
having studied it carefully and the

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:16.570
having studied it carefully and the
 

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.140
having studied it carefully and the
question is they say it's possible it's

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.150
question is they say it's possible it's
 

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:23.870
question is they say it's possible it's
very very hard and it takes things like

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:23.880
 
 

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.400
 
special efforts to remove carbon dioxide

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:26.410
special efforts to remove carbon dioxide
 

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.870
special efforts to remove carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere relying on future

may guess is that you should also figure

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:19.450
may guess is that you should also figure
 

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.690
may guess is that you should also figure
out how much it costs to do that it's

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:21.700
out how much it costs to do that it's
 

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.910
out how much it costs to do that it's
not just a matter of doing it at any

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:23.920
not just a matter of doing it at any

cost
 

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.150
cost
so there is still a cost benefit

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160
so there is still a cost benefit
 

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.030
so there is still a cost benefit
calculation there I think it would

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:30.040

the details but what are the policy

for a long time been pushing the idea of

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:46.780
for a long time been pushing the idea of

for a long time been pushing the idea of
just using global carbon tax I mean try

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:50.710
just using global carbon tax I mean try
 

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.610
just using global carbon tax I mean try
to agree that all countries or large

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:53.620
to agree that all countries or large
 

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.430
to agree that all countries or large
regions of countries should tax carbon

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440
regions of countries should tax carbon
 

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.520
regions of countries should tax carbon
and as an economist this is can obvious

00:09:59.520 --> 00:09:59.530
and as an economist this is can obvious
 

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.060
and as an economist this is can obvious
solution I think it's gaining momentum

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.070
solution I think it's gaining momentum
 

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.420
solution I think it's gaining momentum
the notion of using carbon taxes I think

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:06.430
the notion of using carbon taxes I think
 

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.740
the notion of using carbon taxes I think
the ideas a little bit that if you have

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:10.750
the ideas a little bit that if you have
 

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.790
the ideas a little bit that if you have
a sizeable carbon tax it will do several

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800
a sizeable carbon tax it will do several
 

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.680
a sizeable carbon tax it will do several
things but one of them is to eliminate a

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:16.690
things but one of them is to eliminate a
 

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.050
things but one of them is to eliminate a
lot of fossil fuel that's not really so

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.060
lot of fossil fuel that's not really so
 

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.750
lot of fossil fuel that's not really so
productive anyway where it's it's

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760
productive anyway where it's it's
 

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.130
productive anyway where it's it's
marginally profitable and then it will

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.140
marginally profitable and then it will
 

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.020
marginally profitable and then it will
not be used if it there's a tax on top

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.030
not be used if it there's a tax on top
 

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.060
not be used if it there's a tax on top
of that and that that's a good thing but

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:27.070
of that and that that's a good thing but
 

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.880
of that and that that's a good thing but
it might also induce more new

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:29.890
it might also induce more new

fuel that will be out competed so I'm

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:35.890
fuel that will be out competed so I'm
 

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.530
fuel that will be out competed so I'm
guessing that this is what he would say

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:37.540
guessing that this is what he would say
 

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.390
guessing that this is what he would say
but I want to emphasize that the prize

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:39.400
but I want to emphasize that the prize
 

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.769
but I want to emphasize that the prize
is not given for

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:41.779
is not given for

is not given for
any particular policy conclusions this

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:43.819
any particular policy conclusions this
 

00:10:43.819 --> 00:10:46.269
any particular policy conclusions this
boy it's more methodological price so

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279
boy it's more methodological price so
 

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.999
boy it's more methodological price so
it's really kind of the tools we need to

00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:49.009
it's really kind of the tools we need to
 

00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:50.650
it's really kind of the tools we need to
answer the kind of questions you were

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:50.660
answer the kind of questions you were
 

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.960
answer the kind of questions you were
asking me now no not to kind of say what

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:52.970
asking me now no not to kind of say what
 

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.059
asking me now no not to kind of say what
to do and that's it

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:55.069
to do and that's it
 

00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:57.189
to do and that's it
so in part I'm just speculating and

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:57.199
so in part I'm just speculating and
 

00:10:57.199 --> 00:10:58.480
so in part I'm just speculating and
we'll see what he has to say when it

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:58.490
we'll see what he has to say when it
 

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.879
we'll see what he has to say when it
comes to Stockholm thank you very much

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:00.889
comes to Stockholm thank you very much
 

00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:03.459
comes to Stockholm thank you very much
back yourself
