00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:06.473
In Alaska's remote
White Mountains--

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.141
All right.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.210
Nice big mail martin.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.778
Marty's first
catch of the season

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.014
is already on the line
after just a few hours.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.183
This the kind of nice
because I just made this set.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.719
It's always a good
feeling to make a set

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:22.689
and catch em the first
time you check it.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.957
Beautiful.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:27.127
It's a promising sign
that the follow trapline may

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.562
have bounced back,
and that the land

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.730
will provide for the future.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.070
This is one of my favorite
spots on the whole trapline.

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:44.477
You can see a big chunk of
God's creation from up here.

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.846
And the neat thing
is, in 30 years,

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:49.883
I'm the only human
that's been in here.

00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:52.485
You stand in a place
like this and you think,

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:58.658
man, if I could get a trail
cut in up that valley,

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:01.995
just go see the new country.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:06.232
Trap country that's never
been trapped, probably.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:09.402
See things nobody
else has ever seen.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.772
That's why I do this.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:15.708
God did all right when he built
this country, put martin in it.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.454
It's good trapping weather
in Alaska's White Mountains.

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.223
Marty's racing to
complete an epic mission--

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:35.195
to clear and run all 150
miles of his original line.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:39.399
But only 25 miles in,
there are signs of trouble.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:40.900
A wolverine.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.603
And he went in that way.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.539
I'm going to make a
cubby for wolverine,

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.043
because there's wolverine signs
around, and they'll be back.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.346
It's not the first time Marty
has tangled with a wolverine.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.849
Four years ago, a
voracious predator

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:58.384
plundered his line
in the revelations,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:01.054
costing hundreds of
dollars in damage.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.857
Now trying to rebound from
his worst season ever,

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.992
Marty can't afford a repeat.

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.394
I'm going to use the
base of this spruce right

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:10.830
here, and build my cubby.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.332
Marty's only
hope for protecting

00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:16.169
the viability of his line
is to eliminate the threat.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:20.840
Like any trap, you want to get
the animal to get to the bait,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.876
he has to go into the trap.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.979
So basically, you've
got something they want,

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.281
and there's only one
way to get to it.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:32.352
Stopping a 50 pound animal
requires a heavy duty trap.

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.287
I'm going to take my 330.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:39.526
So the way that the
330 works is the animal

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:43.530
hits the trigger,
which is this, and then

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.134
these springs close to the
trap, and it snaps on him.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:51.738
I'm going to set it, tap it
down so it's good and tight.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:52.338
There.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.977
This line-- it's
really important to me

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.479
it's successful.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.581
So getting the line
set is a huge job,

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:05.051
and the sooner you get it,
the trail broke out and set,

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.888
the sooner you can
start catching fur.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:10.356
Wow.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.824
It's different.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.294
This is all ripped off by fire.

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:16.262
Marty's future
earnings depend on

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.932
whether he can protect
the line he first opened

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.234
more than three decades ago.

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.536
When I first came up
here many years ago,

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:28.107
this was just all
green spruce forest.

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:30.143
And though fur
prices rise and fall,

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:34.280
the land always has potential.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.982
This can be a
good producing line.

00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:40.119
You get this fringe of the burn
once the fire comes through,

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.987
rips through.

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:43.923
And then grasses
start coming up.

00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:46.426
And the voles and lemmings
move in there, and eat those.

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.528
And then that's what
the martin feed on,

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:51.965
so then the martin come
in, and that's good

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:55.535
for me as far as trapping goes.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.337
We gotta keep moving.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:59.105
Light's fading.
