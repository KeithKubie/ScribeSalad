00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
 

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.990
At this point I think you
know a little bit about

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.050
what multiplication is.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.740
 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.900
What we're going to do in this
video is to give you just a ton

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.660
of more practice and start you
on your memorization of the

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.940
multiplication tables.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.450
And if you watch enough Khan
Academy videos, and hopefully

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.520
you will in the future, you'll
realize that I'm normally not

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.550
a big fan of memorization.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.610
But the one thing about
multiplication is if you

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.240
memorize your multiplication
tables that we'll start to do

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.860
in this video, it'll pay huge
benefits the rest of your life.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.570
So I promise you, do it now,
you'll never forget it, and the

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.270
rest of your life everything
will be-- well, I don't want to

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.640
make false promises to you, but
they'll be better than if you

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.800
didn't memorize your
multiplication tables.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.300
So what are the
multiplication tables?

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.740
Well that's all of the
different numbers

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.860
times each other.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.600
So let's actually do a
little bit of review.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.910
So if I say what is 2 times 1?

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.280
That is equal to 2
plus itself one time.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.010
So this is equal to just 2.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.070
That's 2 plus itself one time.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.290
I don't have to say plus
anything because there's

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.430
only one 2 there.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.470
I could also write this as
1 plus itself two times.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.400
So that's also 1 plus 1.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.590
Well that also equals 2.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.220
Fair enough.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.690
So 2 times 1 is 2.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.445
And if you watched the last
video, what's 2 times 0?

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:23.480
Well that's 0.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.670
So you don't have to memorize
your 0 multiplication tables

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.560
because everything times 0 is
0, or 0 times anything is 0.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.100
So let's see.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.430
What's 2 times 2?

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.750
 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.910
Well, this is equal to--
we're going to add 2

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.470
to itself two times.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.850
So that's 2 plus 2.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.780
And there's only a
way to do that.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.490
I could say take this 2 and
add it to itself two times,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.690
but it's the same thing.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.620
And what's 2 plus 2?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.460
That's equal to 4.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.410
What's 2 times 3?

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.910
2 times 3 is equal
to 2 plus 2 plus 2.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.370
It can also be
equal to 3 plus 3.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.120
We learned in a previous video
this statement can be written

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.165
either of these ways.

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:09.390
And in either case,
what's it equal to?

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.000
Well, 3 plus 3 is the same
thing as 2 plus 2 plus 2,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.780
and that's equal to 6.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.670
All right.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.440
Now what is 2 times 4?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.670
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.060
Well that's equal to 2
plus 2 plus 2 plus 2.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.880
And notice, it's exactly
what 2 times 3 was.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.620
2 times 3 was that.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.490
I have that here, but now I'm
just adding another 2 to it.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.740
So if we're too lazy to sit
here and add 2 plus 2 is 4.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.720
4 plus 2 is 6.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.740
Instead of doing that, we could
say, hey look, we already know

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.690
that this thing over
here, this was 6.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.320
We figured it out in the
previous line right there.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.560
We figured out this is 6, so we
could just say, oh, 2 times 4

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.610
is going to be 2 more than
that, which is equal to 8.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.490
And you should hopefully
see that pattern.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.640
As we go from 2 times 1,
to 2 times 2, to 2 times

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.770
3, what's happening?

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.510
How much are we going up by?

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.130
From 2 to 4 we're going plus 2.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.310
From 4 to 6 we're going plus 2.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.340
And then from 6 to 8
we're going plus 2.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.270
So you could figure out what
2 times 5 is, even without

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.960
doing the addition.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.440
2 times 5 is equal to 2 plus
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.080
It could also be
written as 5 plus 5.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.120
2 times 4 could've been
written as 4 plus 4 as well.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.500
And what's that equal to?

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.100
We could add all of these up
or we could add these two up.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.882
Or we could just say it's going
to be two more than 2 times 4.

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:39.210
So it's going to be 10.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.790
I'll finish the 2 times tables.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.290
And I think you see all of the
patterns that emerge from it.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.720
So 2 times 6.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.590
That's going to be 2
plus itself six times.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.820
Let's see.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, which
should also be equal to

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.700
6 plus itself two times.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.630
This could be
interpreted either way.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.990
And that's going to
be equal to 12.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.170
Once again, two more than 2
times 5 because we're adding

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.720
2 to itself one more time.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.300
So it's going to be two more.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.890
Let's keep going.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.550
So 2 times 7.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:23.450
2 times 7 is equal to-- well, I
could write 2 plus 2 plus 2

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.240
plus 2-- this is getting
tiring-- plus 2 plus 2.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.810
Is that 7?

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.210
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.480
And that's the same thing as 7
plus 7, which you may or may

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.380
not know is equal to 14.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.560
You could just say hey, that's
going to be two more than 12.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.640
So 12 plus 1 plus 2
is-- 12 plus 1 is 13.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.540
12 plus 2 is 14.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.590
All right, let's
just keep going.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.750
2 times 8.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.820
I could do all of this business
here where I add the 2's or I

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.670
could say look, it's just going
to be two more than 2 times 7.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.790
So I could say it's
going to be 14 plus 2.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.480
I'm just adding
two to that one.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.930
So I could say it's 16.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.620
Or I could also say
that's 8 plus 8.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.810
That's also 16.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.420
I could have done all the 2's
out, but if you like you

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:15.040
could do that for your
own benefit and learning.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.150
We're almost-- well, we could
go forever because there

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.370
is no largest number.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.520
I can keep going.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.980
2 times 9 times 10 times 100
times 1,000 times 1,000,000.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.590
But I'm going to stop at 12
because that tends to be what

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.780
people need to memorize.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.340
But if you really want
to be a mathlete you

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.670
want to go up to 20.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.790
But let's go to 2 times 9.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.815
That's going to be two
more than 2 times 8.

00:05:38.815 --> 00:05:40.995
It's going to be 18.

00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:42.700
Or that's 9 plus 9.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.070
Also 18.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.950
What's 2 times 10?

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.950
And 10 times tables
are interesting.

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.560
And we're going to see a
pattern there in a second

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.040
when we try to complete
an entire times tables.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.650
So 2 times 10?

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.810
Two more than 2 times 9.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.050
It's 20.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.060
Or we could also say
that's 10 plus 10.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.360
10 plus itself two times.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.070
Now what's interesting
about this?

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.140
This looks just like
a 2 with a 0 added.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.700
And you're going to see
that anything times 10.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.310
You just put a 0 on the right.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.140
And you can think
about why that is.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.420
You can view this
as two 10's is 20.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.010
That's what 20 is.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.550
We're almost done.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.830
Let's do 2 times 11.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.930
2 times 11 is going to be 2
more than this right here.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.840
It's going to be 22.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.540
Another interesting pattern.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.220
I have the number repeated
twice-- a 2 and a 2.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.170
Interesting.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.680
Something to watch out
for as we look at other

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.700
multiplication tables.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.000
And then finally-- it's not
finally, we could keep going.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.750
2 times-- that's too
dark of a color.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.140
2 times 12.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.550
2 times 12 is going to be
two more than 2 times 11.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.390
That's 24.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.170
We could have also written
that as 12 plus 12.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.320
Or we could've said 2 plus
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.850
2 twelve times.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.670
It all gets you to 24.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.340
So that's the 2 times
tables and I think

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.980
you see the pattern.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.950
Every time you multiply it by
one higher number you just

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.680
add 2 to that number.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.810
So now that we see that
pattern, let's see

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.960
if we can complete a
multiplication table.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.280
So what I want to do, I'm going
to write all the numbers.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.685
Let's see.

00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:19.340
I hope I have space for this.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:29.440
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.920
Actually, I'll just
do it till 9.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.840
I'll just keep going.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.580
9.

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.465
Actually I won't have space to
do that because I want you

00:07:34.465 --> 00:07:35.690
to see the entire table.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.660
So I'm just going up till
9 here, but I encourage

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.600
you after this video to
complete it on your own.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.890
Maybe if we have time I'll
complete it here as well.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.225
So these are the first numbers
that I'm going to multiply.

00:07:45.225 --> 00:07:52.070
And I'm going to multiply
it times 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:57.270
5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.950
 

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.280
Actually I should have
written this 1 under-

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.720
well, what's 1 times 1?

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.120
So this is the way I'm
going to view it.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.730
Whatever is 1 times 1 I'm
going to write here.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.970
Well that's 1.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.520
What's 1 times 2?

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.410
That's 2.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.740
What's 1 times 3?

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.360
That's 3.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.220
1 times anything is that
number, so I can just

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.370
write 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.540
1 times 9 is 9.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.540
Fair enough.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.310
Now let's do the
2 times tables.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.580
I'll do that in a blue.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.070
Actually, let me do 1 in that
color and now in maybe a

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.990
darker blue I'll do
the 2 times tables.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.260
What's 2 times 1?

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.440
That's 2.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.700
It's the same thing
as 1 times 2.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.010
Notice, these two numbers
are the same thing.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.710
What's 2 times 2?

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.010
That's 4.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.620
2 times 3 is 6.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.840
We just did this.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.600
Every time you increment or
you multiply by a higher

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.190
number, you just add by 2.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.850
2 times 4 is 8.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.120
Same thing as 4 times 2.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.270
2 times 5 is 10.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.020
2 times 6 is 12.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.680
I'm just adding 2 every time.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.980
Up here I added 1 from every
step, here I'm adding 2.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.830
2 times 7, 14.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.496
2 times 8, 16.

00:09:09.496 --> 00:09:12.980
2 two times 9, 18.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.620
All right, let's do
our 3 times tables.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:18.410
I'll do it in yellow.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:21.700
 

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.820
3 times 1 is 3.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.360
Notice, 3 times 1 is 3.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.920
1 times 3 is 3.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.750
These are the same values.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:33.430
3 times 2 is the same
thing as 2 times 3.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.650
3 times 2 should be the
same thing as 2 times 3.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.690
So it's 6.

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.480
And that makes sense.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.690
3 plus 3 is 6 or 2
plus 2 plus 2 is 6.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.790
So every time here we're
going to increase by 3.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.890
You see the pattern.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.020
3 times 3 is 9.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.870
3 plus 3 plus 3.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.710
So we went from 3 to 6 to 9.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.000
So 3 times 4 is going to be 12.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I'm just adding 3 every time.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.690
12 plus 3 is 15.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.230
15 plus 3 is 18.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.580
18 plus 3 is 21.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.090
21 plus 3 is 24.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.510
24 plus 3 is 27.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.120
So 3 times 9 is 27.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.840
3 times 8 is 24.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:19.550
So if you were to say 8 plus
8 plus 8, it would be 24.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.800
So now I'm going to speed it
up a little bit now that

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.840
we see the pattern.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.350
And you should do this on your
own and you really should

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.970
memorize everything
we're doing.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.000
You should actually go
all the way up to 12

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.510
in both directions.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:30.870
So let's see.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:35.330
4 times 1 is 4.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.650
I'm just going to go up
by increments of 4.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.090
So 4 plus 4 is 8.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.970
8 plus 4 is 12.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.930
12 plus 4 is 16.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.460
16 plus 4 is 20.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.460
20 plus 4 is 24.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.470
4 times 6 is 24.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.980
4 times 7, 28.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.260
I'm just going up by 4.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.750
32 and 36.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.490
All right, 5 times 1.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:06.680
5 times 1 is going to be 5.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.790
Actually, we know that
anything-- well, I want to keep

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.420
changing colors, so I'll just
do it in rows like this.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.580
5 times 1 is 5.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.790
5 times 2 is 10.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.270
5 times 3 is 15.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.440
I'm just going to
increase by 5.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.210
5 times tables are very fun as
well because every number

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:24.130
you're going to add-- if we
multiply 5 times-- well, we'll

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.890
learn about even and
odd in the future.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:29.620
But every other number in its
times tables is going to end

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.250
with a 5, and then every other
one's going to end with a 0.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:34.800
Because if you add 5
to 15 you get 20.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:41.450
You get 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.390
Fair enough.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.130
6 times tables, let
me do it in green.

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.220
6 times 1 is 6.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.080
That's easy.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.810
You add 6 to that, you get 12.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.500
You add 6 to that, you get 18.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.250
You add 6 to that, you get 24.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.220
You add 6 to that, you get 30.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:01.220
Then you go 6 more, 36, 42, 48.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:04.630
48 plus 6 is 54.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.630
So 6 times 9 is 54.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.010
All right, we're almost there.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.620
7 times 1, that's 7.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.530
7 times 1 is 7.

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.620
7 times 2 is 14.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.740
7 times 3, 21.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.050
7 times 4, 28.

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.670
7 times 5, what's 28 plus 7?

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.140
Let's see.
If you add 2 you get to 30.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.710
Then you have 5, 35.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.490
7 times 6, 42.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.650
7 times 7, 49.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.990
7 times 8.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.830
Seven times is going to be
7 plus this, so it's 56.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.590
I always used to get confused
between 7 times 8 being 56

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.620
and 6 times 9 being 54.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.690
So now that I pointed out to
you that I always got confused

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.230
between those two, it's your
job not to be confused

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.400
by those two.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.620
7 times 8 you could
say has the 6 in it.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.850
6 times 9 doesn't
have the 6 in it.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.080
That's the way I think of it.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.580
Anyway, 7 times 9.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.320
We're going to add
another 7 here.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.665
It's going to be 63.

00:13:00.665 --> 00:13:04.840
I'll do it in the same color.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.360
All right, we're at
our 8 times tables.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.670
8 times 1 is 8.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.530
8 times 2 is 16.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.100
24.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.690
8 times 3 is 24.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.310
And if we go to 3 times 8
we should also see the 24.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.510
Yep, it's there.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.120
These values are the same.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.810
So we're actually
doing things twice.

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.150
We're doing it when you do
8 times 3 and we're doing

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.480
it when we did 3 times 8.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:27.790
Let's see.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.220
8 times 4, you're going
to add 8 to it-- 32.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.490
40.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.690
Add another 8, 48.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.280
Notice, 8 times 6, 48.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.240
6 times 8, 48.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.450
All right, 8 times 7.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.870
Well, we already pointed
that one out, that was 56.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.200
8 times 8, 64.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:52.020
8 times 9, add 8
to this, is 72.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.660
Now we're at the
9 times tables.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.270
I'm running out of colors.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.540
Maybe I'll reuse
a color or two.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.110
I'll use the blue again.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.290
9 times 1 is 9.

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.710
9 times 2, 18 9 times 3-- we
actually know all of these.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.425
We could look it up in the rest
of the table because 9 times 3

00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:11.300
is the same thing as 3 times 9.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.290
It's 27.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.510
Add 9 to that.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.400
27 plus 9 is 36.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.540
36 plus 9 is 45.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.910
Notice, every time you add
9, you go almost up by

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.250
10, but 1 less than that.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.970
So up by 10 would be 46, and
then one less than that is 45.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.380
But anyway, notice, the
1's-- well, I'll talk more

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:33.900
about it in the future.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.530
But we go from a 9, 8,
7, 6, 5 on this digit,

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.250
on the second digit.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:42.520
And on this digit here
you go 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.030
So it's an interesting pattern.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:47.250
Another interesting pattern is
the digits will add up to 9.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.280
3 plus 6 is 9, 2 plus 7 is 9.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.010
We'll talk more about that
in the future and maybe

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.640
prove that to you.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.350
9 times 6, 54.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.160
That was this one as well.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.730
9 times 7, 63.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.860
9 times 8, 72.

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.920
9 times 9 is 81.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.050
I don't know if
you can see that.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:08.370
81.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.480
There you go.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.080
Now, I could keep going.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.790
Actually, I should keep going.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.550
Well, I realize this video
is already pretty long.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.680
I want you to memorize this
right now because this is

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:21.210
