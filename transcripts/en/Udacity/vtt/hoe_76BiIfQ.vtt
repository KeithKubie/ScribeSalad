00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.492
Since we love fractions so much, let's just maximize our use of them. We have a

00:00:05.492 --> 00:00:10.958
fraction on the left side, 6x minus 5 over the quantity 7 minus 3x. And we also

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:16.015
have one on the right, 4 minus 8x over the quantity 4x plus 2. We just saw how

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:19.922
effective it is to try to get rid of our denominators, that at least, leads us

00:00:19.922 --> 00:00:23.642
to a point where we can start to manipulate this in ways that we can get x by

00:00:23.642 --> 00:00:27.385
itself. But here, we have two denominators, we have one on the left and one on

00:00:27.385 --> 00:00:31.052
the right. I'd still like us to get rid of them and we know that we do that

00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:34.906
through multiplying by them. So in this box, I'd like you to write out the

00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:38.938
entire equation you'll get at the very first stage, where you no longer have

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:43.436
fractions in this equation. So I don't want you to multiply anything out I don't

00:00:43.436 --> 00:00:47.762
want you to distribute or simplify on either side. I just want you to get this

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:50.322
to a place where there are no more fractions.
