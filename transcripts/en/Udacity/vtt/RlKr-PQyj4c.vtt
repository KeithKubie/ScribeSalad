00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here is my answer. Here is the expand command.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It takes the omega vector and turns it in to a 4 x 4

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and assigns the existing coordinate to 0, 1, and 2

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and expands to make xi vector of 4 x 1

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
where it uses the previous dimensions of 0, 1, 2, and 0.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That turns out to make a larger matrix and larger vector.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, I go and add in the measurement constraints.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In all of those, I have to relate to the last coordinate,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which is my measurement coordinate from the first, the second, and the third pose.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I have to subtract -z0, 1, and 2 from the corresponding robot poses

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and add them all up back to the last pose.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
If you implement this correctly, then you get a omega and xi

00:00:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that, once you implement this solution equation, gets you this solution over here.
