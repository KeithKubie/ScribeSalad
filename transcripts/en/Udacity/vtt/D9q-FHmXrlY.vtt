00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.940
Now, hopefully you were able to breeze right through

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.350
this if you had some slight understanding of these

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.150
terms over here. Now, if we compare this first

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.920
sequence to the original up here, we see the only

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.450
difference is a one letter change right here. That

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.150
means that this is going to be a single nucleotide

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.330
chain. The second sequence actually looks the same as

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.030
the original, except that it's missing a CA right here.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.460
So there's been a deletion. The next one

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.420
has actually had an insertion added in for

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.810
have been a number two. This fourth one. Notice there was a TAC and then it got

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.520
repeated and repeated again. This is what we

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.450
call a Trinucleotide repeat. We have three in

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:51.180
a row. And in this last one turned out to be a complete duplication end to end.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.335
The sequence was just duplicated over. So would be number three.
