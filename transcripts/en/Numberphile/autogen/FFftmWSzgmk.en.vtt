basics I need your help though can you

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810
basics I need your help though can you
 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.940
basics I need your help though can you
think of a number 7 good can you square

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
think of a number 7 good can you square
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.940
think of a number 7 good can you square
that number 49 can you do this while

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
that number 49 can you do this while
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.320
that number 49 can you do this while
filming you've done it correctly so far

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
filming you've done it correctly so far
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.730

okay next question you're gonna get

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740
okay next question you're gonna get
 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.120
okay next question you're gonna get
upset Square 49 no okay good answer the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
upset Square 49 no okay good answer the
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.170
upset Square 49 no okay good answer the
thing is I don't really care about the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
thing is I don't really care about the
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.310
thing is I don't really care about the
answer what I'm caring about is an

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
answer what I'm caring about is an
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.590
answer what I'm caring about is an
iteration I can't keep asking you to do

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600
iteration I can't keep asking you to do
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.300
iteration I can't keep asking you to do
the same thing again and again and if I

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
the same thing again and again and if I
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.529
the same thing again and again and if I
ask you to pick a number and keep

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
ask you to pick a number and keep
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.390
ask you to pick a number and keep
squaring it you already know what's

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
squaring it you already know what's
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.179
squaring it you already know what's
gonna happen right it's gonna get big

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189
gonna happen right it's gonna get big
 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.360
gonna happen right it's gonna get big
blowout is it square one okay okay good

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370
blowout is it square one okay okay good
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.299
blowout is it square one okay okay good
now square half sometimes it blows up

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
now square half sometimes it blows up
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.889
now square half sometimes it blows up
and actually that happens when it's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
and actually that happens when it's
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.180
and actually that happens when it's
bigger than one and it becomes quite

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
bigger than one and it becomes quite
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.979
bigger than one and it becomes quite
obvious when you try it but one doesn't

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
obvious when you try it but one doesn't
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.900
obvious when you try it but one doesn't
blow up so once different and numbers

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
blow up so once different and numbers
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.410
blow up so once different and numbers
less than one like 1/2 actually become a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420
less than one like 1/2 actually become a
 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.369
less than one like 1/2 actually become a
quarter when you square them and that

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
quarter when you square them and that
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.900
quarter when you square them and that
becomes a 16th and so on but then

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
becomes a 16th and so on but then
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.310
becomes a 16th and so on but then
numbers much less than one like minus

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
numbers much less than one like minus
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.830
numbers much less than one like minus
six and that one's blown up as well so

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
six and that one's blown up as well so
 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.240
six and that one's blown up as well so
what I'm really talking about and what

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
what I'm really talking about and what
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.980
what I'm really talking about and what
iteration is quite often talking about

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
iteration is quite often talking about
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.100
iteration is quite often talking about
is when iterations are stable when they

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
is when iterations are stable when they
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.660
is when iterations are stable when they
sort of head towards somewhere you can

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
sort of head towards somewhere you can
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.700
sort of head towards somewhere you can
see and when they're not and it's best

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
see and when they're not and it's best
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.960
see and when they're not and it's best
to see this on a diagram so have a look

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
to see this on a diagram so have a look
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.399
to see this on a diagram so have a look
at my screen here

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
at my screen here
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.810
at my screen here
you picked the number seven which is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
you picked the number seven which is
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.789
you picked the number seven which is
kind of off my screen here but these red

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
kind of off my screen here but these red
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.670
kind of off my screen here but these red
arrows we're moving them around this is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
arrows we're moving them around this is
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.170
arrows we're moving them around this is
not the greatest diagram let me get this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
not the greatest diagram let me get this
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.340
not the greatest diagram let me get this
clear in this to start with it's just a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350
clear in this to start with it's just a
 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320
clear in this to start with it's just a
line but the arrows are head in that way

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
line but the arrows are head in that way
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.670
line but the arrows are head in that way
because when I square this number I'm

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
because when I square this number I'm
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.440
because when I square this number I'm
moving around they go that way and they

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
moving around they go that way and they
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.090
moving around they go that way and they
never come back much like your son did

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
never come back much like your son did
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.249
never come back much like your son did
but if I go less than this number one

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
but if I go less than this number one
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.929
but if I go less than this number one
they don't go that way anymore they go

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
they don't go that way anymore they go
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.630
they don't go that way anymore they go
that way in fact they head towards zero

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
that way in fact they head towards zero
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940
that way in fact they head towards zero
and they're stable there so for the sake

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
and they're stable there so for the sake
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.170
and they're stable there so for the sake
of moving it around it's kind of nice to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
of moving it around it's kind of nice to
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.550
of moving it around it's kind of nice to
see the difference is a really sharp

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
see the difference is a really sharp
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.170
see the difference is a really sharp
line then it completely changes behavior

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
line then it completely changes behavior
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060
line then it completely changes behavior
but that way they're unstable that way

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
but that way they're unstable that way
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.679
but that way they're unstable that way
they're stable stable unstable stable

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
they're stable stable unstable stable
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.420
they're stable stable unstable stable
unstable they want stable unstable you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
unstable they want stable unstable you
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.550
unstable they want stable unstable you
get the idea in fact if you go negative

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
get the idea in fact if you go negative
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920
get the idea in fact if you go negative
they still stable their head positive

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
they still stable their head positive
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.969
they still stable their head positive
because we need to go a number that's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
because we need to go a number that's
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.530
because we need to go a number that's
negatively get positive still head

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
negatively get positive still head
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.969
negatively get positive still head
toward zero until you hit minus 1 and

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
toward zero until you hit minus 1 and
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.700
toward zero until you hit minus 1 and
then unstable stable stable unstable

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
then unstable stable stable unstable
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.429
then unstable stable stable unstable
stable now despite all my commentary

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
stable now despite all my commentary
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.639
stable now despite all my commentary
it's not Maddox I think yet and if you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
it's not Maddox I think yet and if you
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.859
it's not Maddox I think yet and if you
know anything about the theory of

know anything about the theory of
 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.089
know anything about the theory of
iterations and the consequences of them

not gonna give you an introduction to

not gonna give you an introduction to
complex numbers here because I don't

can still do it in one dimension just by

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
can still do it in one dimension just by
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.660
can still do it in one dimension just by
sliding along here and the other dot

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670

that's moving around this tiny one is

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
that's moving around this tiny one is
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.150
that's moving around this tiny one is
the square of the other dot so one

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160
the square of the other dot so one
 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.800
the square of the other dot so one
squared is about one bigger than one it

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810
squared is about one bigger than one it
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.240
squared is about one bigger than one it
heads off that way lower than one goes

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250
heads off that way lower than one goes
 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.650
heads off that way lower than one goes
that way but I can move off the line now

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
that way but I can move off the line now
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.690
that way but I can move off the line now
and it has a weirdly circular flavor to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700
and it has a weirdly circular flavor to
 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.610
and it has a weirdly circular flavor to
it which I kind of like it's like

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620
it which I kind of like it's like

chasing the number around it moves

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420
chasing the number around it moves
 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.490
chasing the number around it moves
quicker than you expect and that's

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500
quicker than you expect and that's
 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.990
quicker than you expect and that's
already quite pleasing if you're a nerd

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
already quite pleasing if you're a nerd
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.090
already quite pleasing if you're a nerd
like me but what I really interested is

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100
like me but what I really interested is
 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.150
like me but what I really interested is
the iteration if you keep doing the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160
the iteration if you keep doing the
 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.610
the iteration if you keep doing the
interruption square it square a-square

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620
interruption square it square a-square
 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.200
interruption square it square a-square
we saw what happened on the real line in

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210
we saw what happened on the real line in
 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.180
we saw what happened on the real line in
two dimensions it looks different so it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190
two dimensions it looks different so it
 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.280
two dimensions it looks different so it
looks like this

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290
looks like this
 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.930
looks like this
so this line indicates if we start there

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
so this line indicates if we start there
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.100
so this line indicates if we start there
it goes to there when you square it and

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110
it goes to there when you square it and
 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.570
it goes to there when you square it and
then to there and there and so if I move

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580
then to there and there and so if I move
 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.250
then to there and there and so if I move
this around the picture is kind of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260
this around the picture is kind of
 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.250
this around the picture is kind of
pleasing kind of wobbles around but it's

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
pleasing kind of wobbles around but it's
 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.530
pleasing kind of wobbles around but it's
always heading towards the center which

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540
always heading towards the center which
 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.670
always heading towards the center which
I'll say is stable and there's a reason

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680
I'll say is stable and there's a reason
 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.110
I'll say is stable and there's a reason
there's a circle on the screen because

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120
there's a circle on the screen because
 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.420
there's a circle on the screen because
anytime I'm inside this circle it looks

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430
anytime I'm inside this circle it looks
 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.890
anytime I'm inside this circle it looks
like it's stable even if it's kind of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900
like it's stable even if it's kind of
 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.850
like it's stable even if it's kind of
pretty as it moves but if I go near the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860
pretty as it moves but if I go near the
 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.550
pretty as it moves but if I go near the
edge of the circle it's less obviously

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560
edge of the circle it's less obviously
 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.110
edge of the circle it's less obviously
stable it takes a lot longer to get to

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120
stable it takes a lot longer to get to
 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.310
stable it takes a lot longer to get to
the center and then if I go outside the

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320
the center and then if I go outside the
 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.920
the center and then if I go outside the
circle unstable

on a line you've got picture but it gets
 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.970
on a line you've got picture but it gets
better right instead of just squaring it

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980
better right instead of just squaring it
 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.619
better right instead of just squaring it
what would happen if you did square it

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629
what would happen if you did square it
 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.390

just one dimension but I feel like we

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789
just one dimension but I feel like we
 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:19.740
just one dimension but I feel like we
should just go straight into two

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750
should just go straight into two
 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.420

star shape what's interesting though is

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160
star shape what's interesting though is
 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.189
star shape what's interesting though is
not just a star shape although I kind of

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199
not just a star shape although I kind of
 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.620
not just a star shape although I kind of
like it is the stability so all around

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630
like it is the stability so all around
 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.450
like it is the stability so all around
here is stable it always gives you the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460
here is stable it always gives you the
 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.860
here is stable it always gives you the
same sort of stability like a starry

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870
same sort of stability like a starry
 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.140
same sort of stability like a starry
stability even if it's expanding or

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150
stability even if it's expanding or
 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.000
stability even if it's expanding or
shrinking but you kind of get the

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010
shrinking but you kind of get the
 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.200
shrinking but you kind of get the
feeling that sometime it's gonna blow up

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210
feeling that sometime it's gonna blow up
 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.689
feeling that sometime it's gonna blow up
and it's not obvious where because if I

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699
and it's not obvious where because if I
 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:05.040
and it's not obvious where because if I
go near the circle you think that's kind

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050
go near the circle you think that's kind
 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.810
go near the circle you think that's kind
of like it's gonna blow but doesn't oh

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820
of like it's gonna blow but doesn't oh
 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.219
of like it's gonna blow but doesn't oh
so there with a moment there so outside

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229
so there with a moment there so outside
 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.740
so there with a moment there so outside
the circle still stable but somewhere

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750
the circle still stable but somewhere

else outside the circle unstable and in
fact it's not obvious where this

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070

inside the circle always stable and I go

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930
inside the circle always stable and I go
 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.360
inside the circle always stable and I go
there I keep saying the circle as if

it's important it's really not important
 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.689
it's important it's really not important
or the boundary is clearly not circled

or the boundary is clearly not circled
but it's kind of nice to move this

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870
but it's kind of nice to move this
 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.689
but it's kind of nice to move this
around I think that some places are

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699
around I think that some places are
 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.370
around I think that some places are
unstable that some are stable what I'd

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380
unstable that some are stable what I'd
 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.830
unstable that some are stable what I'd
really like to see and I hope you were

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840
really like to see and I hope you were
 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.969
really like to see and I hope you were
too is the boundary of stability so

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979
too is the boundary of stability so
 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.740
too is the boundary of stability so
let's see that in fact let's look at the

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750
let's see that in fact let's look at the
 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.870
let's see that in fact let's look at the
boundary if the number I choose to add

boundary if the number I choose to add
 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.210
boundary if the number I choose to add
each time is 0 you get the circle that's

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220
each time is 0 you get the circle that's
 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.529
each time is 0 you get the circle that's
like the simple iteration if you choose

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539
like the simple iteration if you choose
 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:50.700
like the simple iteration if you choose
to add something different by the way

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710
to add something different by the way

the Mandelbrot set however I'm going to
 

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:20.340
the Mandelbrot set however I'm going to
do it anyway so the original Mandelbrot

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:20.350
do it anyway so the original Mandelbrot
 

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:22.310
do it anyway so the original Mandelbrot
set that Mandelbrot saw was two colors

I did black and blue the colors you're

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:27.220
I did black and blue the colors you're
 

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.579
I did black and blue the colors you're
seeing in this are an arbitrary decision

00:13:29.579 --> 00:13:29.589
seeing in this are an arbitrary decision
 

00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:31.410
seeing in this are an arbitrary decision
but they're not as arbitrary as you

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:31.420
but they're not as arbitrary as you
 

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.610
but they're not as arbitrary as you
might think so let's go back to the

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:32.620
might think so let's go back to the
 

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.890
might think so let's go back to the
original which is out here black for

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:34.900
original which is out here black for
 

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.110
original which is out here black for
stable but the colors indicate that it's

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120
stable but the colors indicate that it's
 

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.750
stable but the colors indicate that it's
unstable but the color indicates how

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760
unstable but the color indicates how
 

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.820

unstable and so if you think back to the

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:41.830
unstable and so if you think back to the
 

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.410

very first question I asked you I said

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:43.420

two iterations you like no because it's
 

00:13:49.089 --> 00:13:51.150
two iterations you like no because it's
big and that's an indication that you

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:51.160
big and that's an indication that you
 

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.820

don't need to ask any more iterations to

of the orbits are complicated so all you
do with the computer is you ask it to

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.400
because it kind of looks like you've got
loads of seahorses spiraling around but

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:53.410
loads of seahorses spiraling around but
 

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.350
loads of seahorses spiraling around but
if I switch to a Julia set around this

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360
if I switch to a Julia set around this
 

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.400
if I switch to a Julia set around this
point it looks the same but am i zoom

00:15:59.400 --> 00:15:59.410
point it looks the same but am i zoom
 

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.069
point it looks the same but am i zoom
out the Julia set you don't degenerate

00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079
out the Julia set you don't degenerate
 

00:16:02.079 --> 00:16:04.650
out the Julia set you don't degenerate
into Mandelbrot you just get the

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:04.660
into Mandelbrot you just get the
 

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.480
into Mandelbrot you just get the
seahorse Julia set there it is that's as

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:06.490
seahorse Julia set there it is that's as
 

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.790
seahorse Julia set there it is that's as
big as you get so if you zoom in on the

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800
big as you get so if you zoom in on the
 

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.559
big as you get so if you zoom in on the
Mandelbrot set you get little sort of

00:16:10.559 --> 00:16:10.569
Mandelbrot set you get little sort of
 

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:11.999
Mandelbrot set you get little sort of
like regions which are like the Julia

00:16:11.999 --> 00:16:12.009
like regions which are like the Julia
 

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:14.129
like regions which are like the Julia
set from that area it's like a map it's

00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:14.139
set from that area it's like a map it's
 

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:17.009
set from that area it's like a map it's
a geography or or vitter ative stability

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:17.019
a geography or or vitter ative stability
 

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:18.629
a geography or or vitter ative stability
when you say it like that it sounds

00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639
when you say it like that it sounds
 

00:16:18.639 --> 00:16:19.980
when you say it like that it sounds
complicated but you just do something

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:19.990
complicated but you just do something
 

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.689
complicated but you just do something
again and again and find out what

00:16:21.689 --> 00:16:21.699
again and again and find out what
 

00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:23.699
again and again and find out what
happens in the long term and the fact

00:16:23.699 --> 00:16:23.709
happens in the long term and the fact
 

00:16:23.709 --> 00:16:24.780
happens in the long term and the fact
that it makes something so beautiful I

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:24.790
that it makes something so beautiful I
 

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.019
that it makes something so beautiful I
mean it's it's become so cliche from a

00:16:28.019 --> 00:16:28.029
mean it's it's become so cliche from a
 

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:29.370
mean it's it's become so cliche from a
petitions to get excited about but I

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:29.380
petitions to get excited about but I
 

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.870
petitions to get excited about but I
still get excited about it because it's

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880
still get excited about it because it's
 

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:31.230
still get excited about it because it's
lovely

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240
lovely
 

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.210
lovely
I didn't design it it's just there we

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:33.220
I didn't design it it's just there we
 

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.799
I didn't design it it's just there we
can explore it I mean just sittin stare

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:34.809
can explore it I mean just sittin stare
 

00:16:34.809 --> 00:16:37.079
can explore it I mean just sittin stare
hypnotize at it for hours and you can

00:16:37.079 --> 00:16:37.089
hypnotize at it for hours and you can
 

00:16:37.089 --> 00:16:38.699
hypnotize at it for hours and you can
program it in ten seconds on a

00:16:38.699 --> 00:16:38.709
program it in ten seconds on a
 

00:16:38.709 --> 00:16:40.970
program it in ten seconds on a
spreadsheet if you want

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980
spreadsheet if you want
 

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.220
spreadsheet if you want
so as you said it's not in the

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:43.230
so as you said it's not in the
 

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.890
so as you said it's not in the
Mandelbrot set right and what that means

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:45.900
Mandelbrot set right and what that means
 

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.130
Mandelbrot set right and what that means
so let's call this number say well I've

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:49.140
so let's call this number say well I've
 

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:50.660
so let's call this number say well I've
already used C but let's call it C

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:50.670
already used C but let's call it C
 

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.030
already used C but let's call it C
anyways
