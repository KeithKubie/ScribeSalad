HIREN PATEL: Hello,
and welcome, everyone,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.690
to the Google Developers
Africa Hangout, episode 3.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.500
On the panel today,
we have a couple

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.830
of GDEs-- Google
Developer Experts--

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.110
as well as some
Googlers as well.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.160
Just to remind you
about the GDE program,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.640
it is a program that is
open to all developers.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.980
It involves two
basic requirements--

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.210
a technical expertise
in a certain product

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.280
or technology from
Google, and a passion

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.690
to share this technology
with other developers locally

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.520
or in the community around you.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.750
So as a benefit of
this, you basically

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.880
get support for your
activities from Google,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.720
speaking at conferences
and the like.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.656
You also get a close
relationship with Google.

00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:51.030
As a big benefit
of this program,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.520
especially for me, is that we
have quite a close relationship

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.930
with some technical
leads at Google.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.240
And as we know, Google is
at the forefront of pushing

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.459
technologies in web and mobile.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.410
We get good access to
this amount of information

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.280
and experience out of this.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.630
So just to remind you, this
show is a monthly show.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.946
We try to run it
as often as we can.

00:01:17.946 --> 00:01:20.460
We provide it as
a recorded video

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.650
for viewing afterwards as well.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.910
We provide a
downloadable mp3 as well.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.250
The show is theme based.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.510
So we pick a theme,
we discuss the theme,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.320
and then we take some
questions on this.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.340
So if you have any
specific themes

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.910
that you'd like us to
cover in some episodes,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.560
please reach out to
us and let us know.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.560
So I'm going to hand
it over to GDE Kenneth

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.820
to introduce the panel
some more for us.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.500
KENNETH KINJANJUI: Hi, everyone.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.021
So welcome to this show.

00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:51.520
First of all, I'm
going to introduce

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.090
the panel, which comprises of
a couple of GDEs and Googlers.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.710
First up is Johann
du Toit, who's

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.732
a cloud GDE from Cape
Town, so he raise his hand.

00:02:03.732 --> 00:02:08.539
We also have Hiren Patel,
a cloud GDE from Cape Town.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.010
We have Dale Humby, also a cloud
GDE from Cape Town, and myself.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.790
We have Mercy Orangi, who's the
developer ecosystem community

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.760
manager for sub-Saharan
Africa, and she's

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.960
more focused on the
Google Launchpad program.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.380
We have Charles Odili, who's
a Googler based in the Nigeria

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.180
office.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.224
We have Liz Yespen,
who's also a Googler,

00:02:35.224 --> 00:02:37.390
and she's been supporting
this show since the start.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.270
As since Hiren told us that
this show is theme based,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.327
this show will focus
on material design,

00:02:48.327 --> 00:02:50.660
and specifically, we'll be
talking about material design

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.310
on the web with
Material Design Lite.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.690
So we always have a
spotlight segment,

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.230
and this show, we will have
Charles Odili on the spotlight.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.750
We'll also be taking a couple of
questions after Hiren presents,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.640
and also we will be
closing up and wrapping up.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.530
So I'd like to jump into the
spotlight section with Charles.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.135
So hi, Charles.

00:03:27.266 --> 00:03:28.640
Could you tell us
about yourself?

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.074
CHARLES ODILI: My
name is Charles Odili.

00:03:36.074 --> 00:03:40.890
And I am a Google [INAUDIBLE]
in the Lagos office in Nigeria.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.100
Before joining Google,
I was a web developer

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.640
for five or six years with
the University of Benin

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.640
and University of
Lagos in Nigeria.

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:52.320
KENNETH KINJANJUI: OK, Charles.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.530
So could you tell us your
current role at Google,

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.510
and what you actually focus on?

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.260
CHARLES ODILI: OK.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:09.820
So I'm the Google
developer community

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.940
manager for sub-Saharan Africa,
the same team that Mercy.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.450
Mercy's based in
the Kenya office,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.170
and I'm based in
the Nigeria office.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.510
I'm basically focused
on developer communities

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.942
in sub-Saharan Africa,
including GDGs.

00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:26.900
KENNETH KINJANJUI: Wow.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.330
Awesome.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.610
So you mentioned GDGs.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.350
Could you tell us a
little bit about GDGs,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.340
since we've been hearing about
them, and some of the events

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.897
that they have in the community?

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:42.730
CHARLES ODILI: Yeah.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.165
So GDG stands for
Google Developer Group,

00:04:46.165 --> 00:04:49.650
and they are groups
or communities

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.850
of developers, who share like
minds, share passion, come

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.495
together, meet from time to
time, to learn and share ideas,

00:04:59.495 --> 00:05:04.160
collaborate, and therefore,
improve their skill from one

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.000
level to the other.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.450
These communities now
spread across several cities

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.070
in different countries
across sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.770
We currently have
over 100 of them,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.810
and they have very well spread.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.430
So we have several
in major cities,

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.380
not like [INAUDIBLE]
is a non-major anyway,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.740
but yeah, most of the
major cities in Africa

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.240
have a GDG [INAUDIBLE], and they
are communities of developers.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.890
I would encourage
everyone to participate

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.370
in the community effort
that's going on in Africa.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.220
KENNETH KINJANJUI: OK.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.200
So there's been a little
buzz on Google+ with the GDGs

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.970
especially, something
about the DevFest series,

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.680
and I've also been seeing
a couple of hashtags going

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.656
through about the
Google developer kits.

00:05:52.656 --> 00:05:56.310
Could you tell us something
about what the DevFest

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.650
series is all about,
and maybe also mention

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.377
what the Google developer
offline kits are all about.

00:06:04.377 --> 00:06:05.460
CHARLES ODILI: Yeah, sure.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.750
So the GDGs have several events.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.590
They have meet-offs, they
have code lab sessions,

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.980
they have tech calls,
they have hackathons,

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.900
they have study jams.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.730
A very big part of this event
series are called the DevFest.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.190
So the DevFests are
generally larger GDG events

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.815
that involve, like, hands-on
and deep-dive sessions, where

00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:30.490
developers can have
the opportunity

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.870
to get their hands
dirty on code,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.590
get their hands on the latest
technologies from Google

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.360
or from other open
source initiatives.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.810
The DevFest series are starting
about now, through November,

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.745
goes the group, and the same
thing's happening with SSE.

00:06:48.745 --> 00:06:50.120
So we are seeing
several DevFests

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.830
across several GDGs
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.210
We encourage developers to join
these events for an opportunity

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.424
to, like, get your hands dirty
on the latest Google techology.

00:07:00.424 --> 00:07:01.965
KENNETH KINJANJUI:
You're killing me.

00:07:01.965 --> 00:07:03.340
CHARLES ODILI: In
line with that,

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.720
we also have the
offline developer kits,

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.270
the initiative from Google to
help the African developer make

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.022
the most of technologies,
irrespective of the challenges

00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:17.230
that we have in Africa,
including power and internet.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.240
So the average developer,
or most developers,

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.640
who have challenges
of internets can

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.557
route through the
offline developer kit,

00:07:23.557 --> 00:07:26.500
because the packages
offline, packages

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.555
contains including
SDKs, including APIs,

00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:31.689
including documentation.

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:33.355
It brings all of these
from the internet

00:07:33.355 --> 00:07:35.770
and puts them in a digital
format, like, on a CD

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.450
and on a USB, such that the
developer will have access

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.330
to these resources,
and they can learn,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.450
they can watch the
videos, they can

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.810
view the accordion
without necessarily

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.910
having to be online.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.952
This keeps available right
now through the GDGs.

00:07:51.952 --> 00:07:54.160
And we encourage developers
to join these communities

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.300
and avail themselves of the
opportunity if they're offline.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.900
KENNETH KINJANJUI: OK.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.950
Charles, since you started
working with Google

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.220
and working with GDGs,
what's your view on what you

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.410
experience from GDG
members or developers

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.170
in sub-Saharan Africa in the
next couple of months or one

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.047
year?

00:08:14.047 --> 00:08:15.922
CHARLES ODILI: OK, so
a lot has been going on

00:08:15.922 --> 00:08:18.880
in GDGs for some time now,
particularly this year,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.450
for example, [INAUDIBLE] would
be the study jams [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.160
that allowed GDGs to
have a series of events

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.320
on other development.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.950
Some GDGs [INAUDIBLE]
study jams.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.152
[INAUDIBLE] too.

00:08:35.152 --> 00:08:36.610
And we also have
put in [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.020
let's say, the hands-on
deep dive series of events,

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.320
so in the coming months, up to,
let's say, the next one year,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.860
we expect our developers
to have better skills,

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.100
have more experience, to
have collaborated more.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.637
We expect to see more apps
on the [INAUDIBLE], even

00:08:53.637 --> 00:08:55.220
those who already
have apps, we expect

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.860
them to improve these
apps with the APIs

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.635
on the technology [INAUDIBLE],
from all these events

00:09:00.635 --> 00:09:01.135
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:01.135 --> 00:09:03.976
So we can expect more apps, and
we expect more polished apps

00:09:03.976 --> 00:09:04.790
from the GDGs.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.060
Yeah.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.280
KENNETH KINJANJUI: Also, coming
up from a web development

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.880
background, as you mentioned,
at the University of Benin,

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.344
what's your viewpoint
on Material Design Lite?

00:09:19.344 --> 00:09:21.760
CHARLES ODILI: So Material
Design Lite is a great library.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.390
I love it.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.470
I've used it a couple
of times on projects.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.250
Material design is the new
design language from Google,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.550
and Material Design Lite
has helped me to implement

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.260
material design on my projects.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.476
So I love it, and I encourage
developers to embrace it,

00:09:38.476 --> 00:09:41.492
because it will give them cool
new experiences in their apps.

00:09:41.492 --> 00:09:43.147
It works really good now.

00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:44.400
Go check it out.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.000
KENNETH KINJANJUI:
That's amazing.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.846
So now we will be jumping to
the main session, where we'll

00:09:49.846 --> 00:09:53.890
be having Hiren taking us
through material design

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.490
on the web using
Material Design Lite.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.441
Hiren.

00:09:57.441 --> 00:09:59.190
HIREN PATEL: Thank you
very much, Kenneth.

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.165
So I'm just going to
quickly share my screen.

00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:19.040
All right.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.780
So material design-- quite an
exciting design spec or design

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.430
language by Google.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.860
The full spec of the language
is at design.google.com,

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.300
and pretty much, in a
nutshell, in this presentation,

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.170
if you look to the
screenshot on the right,

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:39.080
material design involves using
complementing in bold colors,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.150
a beautiful typography,
supporting elements,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.970
as well as floating
elements-- floating papers--

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.320
and it brings together all
these elements of the UI

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.720
into one user experience
that's meant to,

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.560
at the end of the
day, make the user

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.200
experience for this specific
app, or this specific page,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.800
really beautiful.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.419
So it combines the different
elements, and interactions

00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:04.710
between the elements, to give
the user a beautiful user

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.596
experience.

00:11:06.596 --> 00:11:08.470
So you're encouraged to
see the entire design

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:09.553
spec at design.google.com.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.450
We've see material
design before, mostly

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.770
on Android up till now.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.700
And over here, you can
see in the screenshots,

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.760
the bold colors, the beautiful
typography, in the calculator

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.070
app for Android.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.510
In the last screenshot,
that's a dialer app,

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.200
and you can see the beautiful
call to action floating

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.266
button for the hang-up there.

00:11:31.266 --> 00:11:33.140
And so this is what
material design is about.

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.970
It's about making a
really beautiful user

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.320
interface and
interactions for the app,

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.010
and giving your user a beautiful
experience as a result.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.890
So this is great on Android,
and so I asked myself,

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.570
if I were to build a
new user interface,

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.590
be it on Android
or anything else,

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:52.215
why would I use
material design and how?

00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:53.590
And the first
thing to note there

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.050
is that material design
is not just for Android.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.080
Even though you primarily
see it on Android today,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.460
it's not locked into
the platform in any way.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:04.260
In fact, Google is
pushing huge efforts

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.234
into making it
available on the web.

00:12:06.234 --> 00:12:08.400
But you can use material
design pretty much anywhere

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.490
you need a beautiful
user experience, really.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.760
So another reason
I would use it is

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.690
that Google has whole teams
doing research around user

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.980
experience and user interfaces.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.020
For me, as a small developer
team or a lone developer,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.990
I would rather leverage
off this research

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:31.900
that's already been done and
not have to do it myself.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.510
Another reason is the
tooling is also done for me,

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.380
so on Android in the
form of libraries,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.530
and these days on the web in
the form of material design

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.730
libraries as well,
you're not having

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.650
to bold the elements and parts
of the UI manually yourself,

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.900
There's libraries that
give you this already,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.430
so a lot of the tooling
is done for you.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.600
And pretty much the main reason
I would use material design

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.280
in a user interface
these days is

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.150
to give the user a
beautiful experience.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.070
Even if you're a lone
developer or have a small team,

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.426
you're now able to give users an
amazing experience, leveraging

00:13:10.426 --> 00:13:12.300
not just the tools, but
all the research that

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.866
comes behind material design.

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:17.740
So what options do we
have when we're looking

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.480
at material design for the web?

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.380
There's Polymer,
which we've heard of,

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.380
and Polymer's been having
material design elements

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.610
for a while now,
although Polymer includes

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.560
a lot of new web
technology as well,

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:38.880
and Polymer is about more
than just material design.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.090
Polymer's also a fairly large
component, and sort of not

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.360
as easy to integrate
into smaller new apps

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.300
compared to other libraries
that are out there.

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.020
So the next one--
and a really nice one

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.390
to get into, if you're starting
out-- is Material Design Lite.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:59.990
And so this is a library
provided by Google--

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.660
open source as well.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.120
The library, firstly, depends
on no JavaScript framework

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.190
as such, so it's a
really light library

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.180
and doesn't depend on anything.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.570
It is optimized for
cross-device use, which

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:15.430
is really important these days.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.680
With mobile being really
important within Africa itself,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.480
you definitely want
to use something

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.180
that's optimized for mobile.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.590
It degrades gracefully
in all the browsers,

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.330
so it doesn't break.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.944
And it offers an immediately
accessible experience

00:14:30.944 --> 00:14:32.610
starting out with
material design, which

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.010
was quite important for me.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.460
So what do you get with
Material Design Lite?

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.160
Firstly, everything
you need to know

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:44.160
is at www.getmdl.io-- the
documentation lives there,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.020
the example, the
templates, and everything

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.260
pretty much getting started.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.240
And what you get by
using this library

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.920
is new UI controls that
conform to material design.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.170
So these are check boxes,
buttons, and the usual controls

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:01.430
you're used to in
HTML already, that

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.210
have been sort of revamped to
conform to the material design

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:06.910
spec.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.320
But you also get some
specialized features--

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.100
among them are cards, column
layouts, sliders, spinners,

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.350
and some beautiful typography.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.860
But what else do you
get with this library?

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.990
You get some templates, with
GitHub links to the templates,

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.620
so if you're needing to
adjust the templates,

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.250
they can be done easily.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.890
And let me show you quickly
what some of these templates

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.100
look like.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.460
So over on the MDL--
www.getmdl.io--

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.950
there's some
templates for a blog.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:43.340
We have some templates before
dashboards, text heavy web

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.964
pages, and standalone articles.

00:15:45.964 --> 00:15:48.130
So you can leverage some
of these templates as well.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.780
So you also get a theme builder.

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.070
Material design is about
using a primary color

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:59.720
and a supporting accent
color in your UI,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.230
and they make it really easy
to choose these colors well.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.680
So if you head over to
www.getmdl.io, one of the links

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.010
is around customizing
your theme.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.030
And so you'll pick
a primary color,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.050
you'll pick a
supporting accent color,

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.630
and you can see to the
right of the screenshot,

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.190
as I pick my colors,
this basically

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.760
changes to show me what
my UI might look like.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.580
And lastly, there's a really
active and vibrant GitHub

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:33.290
and StackOverflow community
around this project,

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.460
or this library.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.460
So if you get stuck or you
have any issues around this,

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.310
be sure to check out
the GitHub issues link.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:44.900
Be sure to check StackOverflow
for the project as well.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.000
So let's look at a simple
example for Material Design

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.540
Lite.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.040
I was chatting to
a friend recently

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.840
who was looking to build
a simple web survey,

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.260
and I thought, why
don't I throw together

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.790
a simple web survey for him.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.960
It was regarding a
product at a store,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.430
so I thought, why not just have
a mock survey around avocados

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:08.480
at a store called MyStore.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.060
And so I began to put
together a simple web survey

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.579
for him using Material
Design Lite to see what this

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:18.150
could come out and look like.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.310
So there were two
requirements from him on this.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.000
The first is that it needs
to be mobile friendly, mostly

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.060
because the primary
audience for this

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.139
was going to be mobile
users, and it must offer

00:17:28.139 --> 00:17:29.650
a beautiful user experience.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:34.960
So there are many survey tools
and web frameworks out there.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.910
This needs to sort
of set itself apart

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.760
by giving a better
or a more beautiful

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.400
user experience as such.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.340
So in doing this, I used
a couple of the components

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.960
from the Material
Design Lite library.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.330
Some of these are cards,
the drawer-- which I only

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.910
wanted on smaller screens--
then I used the slider on one

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.100
of the questions, I used the
radio box, check box, and text

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.100
boxes for other
questions, and then

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.890
I used the button for
the submit of the survey.

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:09.250
So let's quickly have a look
at what this looks like.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.910
And basically, my page
came out to look like this.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.740
You can see that I've
got a question per card.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.170
I then have a header at the top.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.140
I have some links on
the header to the right.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.050
I've used the controls
within each card,

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.605
so I've used the slider, I've
used the radio boxes, the check

00:18:28.605 --> 00:18:31.640
boxes, et cetera.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.270
And then just to show you
how this is sort of geared

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.695
toward any screen size, if I
minimize this window for you,

00:18:38.695 --> 00:18:41.090
you will see how the elements
sort of arrange themselves

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.590
nicely.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.260
So we can see that, firstly, the
links on the header are gone,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.520
and they folded into a drawer,
which I can access by clicking

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.280
on the hamburger icon.

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.120
Each of my cards has
folded to, , basically,

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.240
settle one beneath each other.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.710
And just to quickly show
you what these elements are

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.320
like in material design, if
you click around on the slider,

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.690
you can see that it animates
in a really beautiful way.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.800
If I click on the
radio box, you can

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.720
see that there's a beautiful
ripple effect on the radio box.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.100
The same goes for
the check boxes.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.610
And you can see
that it's conforming

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.520
to the color of
the theme as well.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.950
You can see on the text box that
the hint text sort of floats

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:32.530
beautifully to the
top as I click it,

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.095
and then the button sort of
gives you the material design

00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:36.030
ripple.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:39.090
So it's worth noting that all
these work on touch as well

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:42.910
as normal web clicks as well.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.437
So this is what it
turned out to be like.

00:19:46.437 --> 00:19:48.020
And I'm going to
walk you through what

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.240
I needed to do to, basically,
get that page running

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.750
in the way that it looks.

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.140
So firstly, every
HTML page, you will

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.900
need to include four things.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.930
The first one is the CSS file
based on your choice of colors

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.510
for the material design UI.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.606
The second one is
the JavaScript file.

00:20:04.606 --> 00:20:06.480
It is pretty small, as
you know the library's

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.050
built to be light.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.140
The third one is the
material design icons,

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.460
which are open source icons
for you to make use of,

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.710
and the last one is
the viewport metatag,

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.960
which is really important
to enable this to work

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.010
across different screen sizes.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.210
So the first thing I did
after putting those four in

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.850
is getting some sort
of layout together.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.900
And what I did here
was, of course,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.020
so I needed to put
a header in there,

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.262
and Material Design
Lite gives you

00:20:34.262 --> 00:20:36.720
choices of a couple of headers,
so you can have a scrolling

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.740
header, a fixed header,
a header that always

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.970
has the nav bar shown, so on.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.470
So I've picked the
fixed header over here,

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.170
which means if I scroll,
the header stays there.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:50.270
And you can have as many
header rows within the header

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:52.950
as you want as well.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.180
So the next thing I
did was define a grid.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:58.625
And over here, all I
did was-- I have a div,

00:20:58.625 --> 00:21:01.800
and I've given it a
CSS class of mdl-grid.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.620
And material design grids
work sort of in the same way

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.430
that Bootstrap grids work.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.430
You have 12 columns,
and as you shrink

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.920
the size of the screen
in terms of the width,

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.830
the columns decrease
to eight and four.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.410
And so what I've
got here is I've

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.360
defined my cells being
four columns wide,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:27.940
which is why, on a large screen,
I have three cards in a row.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.860
If I reduce this, it goes
down to two and one card.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.350
So the next thing I have is,
in every cell, I've got a div,

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.100
and I've turned
the div into a card

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:40.760
by putting some CSS classes
on here-- mdl-card-- which

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.586
we can see in the
third line of the code,

00:21:43.586 --> 00:21:44.960
and that gives me
the card affect

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.960
you see on the
screenshot on the right.

00:21:50.177 --> 00:21:52.510
So in some of the cards I've
used the different elements

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.750
from-- the control
elements from the library,

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.710
and here I'm just inserting
a CSS class called mdl-slider

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.730
on my input element, and you'll
see that this, basically,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.550
provides me with a beautiful
slider and the animations

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.630
on the slider we saw.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.260
This is the radio buttons.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.210
Here again, as well,
the input element

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:17.220
simply has a class
of mdl-radio_button.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.520
The label for the radio
has a class of mdl-radio,

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.240
and this sort of gets
them to work together

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.610
in the material design
way, and gives them

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.040
the ripple effect as well.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.780
So for the rippling,
you'll see I've got

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:34.670
the mdl-js-ripple-effect of
CSS class on this element.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.320
With the checkboxes, it's
pretty much the same story.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.190
I've just got mdl-checkbox
on my label as a CSS class,

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.855
and for my input box, I've
got mdl-checkbox_input.

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:54.190
And for my input box, I've
also just assigned some classes

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.340
to the CSS--
mdl-textfield-- and you

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:02.520
can see that in the hint there,
I've got mdl-textfield_label.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.730
So pretty much the common
thing you've seen from this

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.410
is that this library
pretty much involves

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:12.010
you putting CSS classes in
your already built-up elements

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:14.400
to give them this material
design effect and look,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.191
and this is how easy and
what the library's all about.

00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:19.690
There's nothing
fancy involved, it's

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.510
just a matter of
putting the classes

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.280
within your already
defined elements

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.140
to give you these effects.

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.640
So here I've got
the button-- again,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.850
a simple button--
and I've given it

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:35.050
mdl-button and the
mdl-js ripple classes,

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.040
and this turns it into a
rippling material design

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.109
button.

00:23:40.109 --> 00:23:41.900
So at the end of this,
this is what I have.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:47.480
On the full screen page, it
looks with three cards per row.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.680
The moment you shrink that
down to the mobile size,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.320
it arranges beautifully
in a single column.

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.040
And lastly, some resources.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.470
So you will get started
at www.getmdl.io.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.800
The frequently asked
questions page on that site

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.390
has some really interesting
stuff for beginning out.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.080
I found it quite useful.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.330
And then the GitHub
and StackOverflow pages

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.610
are really useful as well.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:14.170
If you run into
any issues, I think

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.950
those are the first places you
would go and have a look for.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.370
And that pretty much
wraps up the presentation.

00:24:30.464 --> 00:24:32.380
KENNETH KINJANJUI: Thank
you very much, Hiren,

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.110
for that awesome presentation.

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:38.270
So we'll be taking
questions, and we'll

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:44.450
have Dale and Johann answering,
and monitoring questions

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.590
from live attendants.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.035
You can post your questions on
the Q&amp;A that's on the right.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.865
On Google+ as well.

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:08.280
DALE HUMBY: While we wait
for-- sorry, Johann--

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.360
while we wait for some of
those questions to come in,

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.120
I wanted to know from Hiren,
how big is the library?

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.830
I know some of these frameworks
and libraries get quite big.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.799
How much is it going to add
to my page if I put this on?

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:22.340
Bearing in mind,
though, I'm probably

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.131
going to be using this
on my mobile device,

00:25:24.131 --> 00:25:26.152
I don't want it to
charge too much.

00:25:26.152 --> 00:25:26.860
HIREN PATEL: Yep.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.195
So it touts itself
as a light library,

00:25:29.195 --> 00:25:33.020
and so I've looked into this,
and the three pieces you need

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.910
are the CSS, the JS, and
the icons, and combined,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.830
they work out to under
30 kilobytes in size.

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.030
And I found that once I had them
and they were cached, it was,

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.610
that was that, so really small.

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.578
Under 30 kilobytes in total.

00:25:47.578 --> 00:25:48.203
DALE HUMBY: OK.

00:25:48.203 --> 00:25:48.910
That's great.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.260
Thank you.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.130
JOHANN DU TOIT: So
question from me on that,

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.730
is do you need the
entire libraries,

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.360
or is it a framework
that you use

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.776
one shot just in
the entire thing,

00:25:58.776 --> 00:26:01.200
or can you use parts of it?

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.950
HIREN PATEL: Yeah.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.490
So it wasn't designed
to be split into pieces

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.060
and selected by piece.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.160
Pretty much,
there's three pieces

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.850
you need-- it's, as
I mentioned, the CSS

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.950
file, the JS, and the icons,
and that's the entire library,

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.310
so you wouldn't
pick pieces of it.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:19.970
You would include
those three, and you

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.070
get the entire--
everything it has to offer.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:32.460
DALE HUMBY: And can we
use Material Design Lite

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.284
on our mobile apps?

00:26:35.284 --> 00:26:36.700
HIREN PATEL: Yes,
most definitely.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.910
So one of the main
goals of the library

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:42.760
was to allow sort of
a seamless experience

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.650
across different screen sizes,
and we saw from the demo

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.590
that as I shrunk the size,
everything folded over

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:50.905
beautifully, so one
of the main cases

00:26:50.905 --> 00:26:53.630
is being able to use this
across different screen

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.130
sizes and different devices.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.980
It'll support all the latest
browsers, up to two versions

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.220
back, and it will
gracefully degrade

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.040
on older browsers, so a definite
yes for mobile use cases

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.585
as well.

00:27:05.585 --> 00:27:06.210
DALE HUMBY: OK.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.909
That's fantastic.

00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:09.700
JOHANN DU TOIT: OK.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.290
So we have a question in on
the live page, from Gary.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.780
So for Angular apps,
should we continue

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.790
to use Angular Material, or
would you recommend to use MDL?

00:27:23.796 --> 00:27:25.310
HIREN PATEL: So
from my perspective,

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.020
if you're already
using Angular Material,

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.760
I would continue using that.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.660
I think Material
Design Lite is meant

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.675
to be something really simple
and easy to get started out

00:27:34.675 --> 00:27:36.880
with on material
design, and I see

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.430
it more as a library you would
use in a framework that's not

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.160
doing material design
already that you

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.450
want to incorporate it into.

00:27:49.197 --> 00:27:50.280
JOHANN DU TOIT: Thank you.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:50.780
Dale?

00:27:54.626 --> 00:27:56.176
DALE HUMBY: How
easy is it to change

00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:57.300
the colors of the branding?

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.800
HIREN PATEL: So
that's really simple.

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.815
I'm going to quickly show
you via screen share.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.945
The page provided
on the www.getmdl.io

00:28:11.945 --> 00:28:13.320
will allow you to
customize this.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.810
So this is the
customization page

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.980
for the primary and the
supporting accent color.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.510
And you can see
here that if I've

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:26.510
chosen two colors--
firstly, as mentioned,

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.040
it does update the
UI to the right

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.960
so you can immediately
see what it is,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:35.389
and the moment you like
that, it puts the HTML link

00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:36.680
tag at the bottom here for you.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.400
So all you would need to do is,
once you're happy with the UI,

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.620
you take the link tag and copy
and paste that into your HTML,

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.450
and you get the new look.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.544
So really simple.

00:28:47.544 --> 00:28:48.460
DALE HUMBY: Thank you.

00:28:56.847 --> 00:28:59.430
KENNETH KINJANJUI: We also have
another question that has just

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.420
come from Moey from Niger.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.050
So she asks, how is the theme
sets for the different colors?

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.842
HIREN PATEL: How
is the theme set?

00:29:13.842 --> 00:29:14.800
KENNETH KINJANJUI: Yes.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.890
HIREN PATEL: So
once you've chosen

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.420
the primary and the
supporting accent color,

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:25.310
basically, your UI will
conform to the spec as such,

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:29.080
so in any cases where the spec
is using the primary color,

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.850
your UI is going to
use the primary color,

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.171
and in cases where it's
using the supporting colors,

00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:34.920
it would use that.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.378
So it's going to
apply your primary

00:29:36.378 --> 00:29:43.680
and your supporting color as
per the spec throughout your UI.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.663
KENNETH KINJANJUI: OK.

00:29:44.663 --> 00:29:45.162
Thank you.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.144
JOHANN DU TOIT: I think
we have one-- sorry.

00:29:50.144 --> 00:29:51.059
KENNETH KINJANJUI: Oh.

00:29:51.059 --> 00:29:52.270
We have another question?

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:53.340
JOHANN DU TOIT: Yes.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.310
So just last one probably.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:59.650
So we know there's an
Android design guideline,

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:03.580
and a question in is,
is there any equivalents

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.230
for material design on the web?

00:30:08.072 --> 00:30:09.780
HIREN PATEL: Not that
I have come across.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.600
I'm not sure if any of
the other GDEs are aware.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:29.420
I would think that a lot of the
guidance offered over the UI

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.290
within Android
might be applicable

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:35.850
as well for mobile, especially
for mobile use cases.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.734
The design language is
pretty much the same,

00:30:37.734 --> 00:30:39.275
so I would go with
that for starters.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.220
JOHANN DU TOIT: Thank you.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.220
KENNETH KINJANJUI: OK.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.775
So thank you Dale and
Johann for helping us

00:30:49.775 --> 00:30:53.880
in moderating the questions
and answering them.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.140
And also Hiren,
for the nice job.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.950
Now we will move to
Dale, who will spotlight

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:06.550
a couple of local events, and
the cool stuff that the GDE

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:12.690
program has been working on, and
so I'll let Dale tell you more.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.666
DALE HUMBY: Hey, everyone.

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:19.250
A few weeks ago, we had
the Google Developer Summit

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.750
in Africa, and that was held
in three cities-- in Lagos

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.850
on the 19th of August,
in Nairobi on the 22nd,

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.500
and in Cape Town on
the 25th of August.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.220
And this was an event
hosted by Google,

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.780
and a lot of the Google
developer experts

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.370
from around Africa.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.850
It was a two track
conference over one day,

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:44.030
and the first track was focused
on material design for Android,

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:49.410
and the second track
was cloud and web track.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:53.270
And, you know, for me, I
attended the cloud and web

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.210
track, being a cloud
GDE, and I think

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.030
one of the-- what was made
really exciting for me was

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:02.030
that most people in Africa,
they access their internet

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:04.630
through the phones, or
through their cell phones,

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:10.860
and it's a barrier to entry,
having to download and install

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.840
applications if you're
an app developer,

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:19.430
and so having really great
mobile web apps on your phone

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.450
is-- well, being able to attract
an audience on that is good,

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.690
because it means you
don't have to worry

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.760
about doing the installation.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:29.600
And these two talks
focused on new tools

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.710
for web developers, which bring
web app functionality closer

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:37.370
to that of mobile applications.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.820
The first talk was on push
notifications for Chrome,

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:45.920
and this allows web apps to send
notifications-- or a website

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.120
to send notifications-- down
to the website on your Chrome

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.600
browser, just as, as it were,
like on the Android devices,

00:32:55.600 --> 00:33:00.610
like native Android
push notifications.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:04.020
The second talk was on
offline page caching,

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:07.930
which is one of my favorite
technologies at the moment.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.640
This allows your web
app to cache data

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.250
so it can still work even
when the app's offline,

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:19.230
and then synchronize when
you get your connection back,

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.770
and that could be because
you choose to switch off

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.440
your data because
you're roaming,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:27.220
or it could be because you're
just on a poor data connection.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.930
So those are the two talks
that I attended while there,

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:35.230
and if you would like a
summit-- a Google summit--

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.630
to come to one of your cities,
please post on the Google+

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.705
page, and we'll also be
putting up links to the slides

00:33:42.705 --> 00:33:45.350
and the code labs that we
had, so you guys can do them

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.006
yourselves.

00:33:47.006 --> 00:33:48.130
KENNETH KINJANJUI: Awesome.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.860
Thank you very much, Dale.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:55.690
Just to add on that,
on the DevFest series,

00:33:55.690 --> 00:34:00.740
be aware that you might see
a Google Developer Expert

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:04.190
speaking about the technology
such as service workers,

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:08.120
so you can make sure you
attend one of those sessions.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.639
So right now, this brings
us to the end of this show,

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:16.489
but before that, I would
like to tell you the mediums

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.949
that we use to share
our content mostly.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:24.670
We have the Google Developers
Africa Google+ community,

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:32.000
which can be just found on this
short URL-- g.co/dev/africa--

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.179
and that automatically
brings you to the community,

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:36.219
just join it.

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:39.170
GDEs have been always
monitor anything

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.540
that comes through
that channel, and also

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.770
we post our event links there.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:51.100
We'll also be posting a
feedback link for this show,

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:57.200
and also we like to hear
good feedback about the show.

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.480
Tell us what you
want to improve,

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.220
tell us some of the sessions
you like to hear about

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:05.410
from the GDG side.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:09.500
So thank you very much for
joining us in this show.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.227
See you next month.

00:35:11.227 --> 00:35:12.060
Thank you very much.

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:13.910
Bye bye.
