When Mobile browers first came along the content on

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.090
the Web wasn't designed for narrow small screen devices. It

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.700
was designed for Windows that were around 1,000 pixels wide

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.180
and wider than they were tall with easy scrolling. To

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.059
Shoehorn this content into a tiny Mobile screen since

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.890
rendering a Web Page designed for 1,000 pixels across and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.200
a 320 pixel wide screen would mean you'd be scrolling

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.740
a lot. Mobile browsers basically lied about the Window width.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.520
They made the Window act as if it were

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.230
980 pixels wide, even though the original iPhone was only

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.260
320 pixels across. This enabled sites that were designed for

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.460
a 1024 by 768 screen, that is, that were around

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.890
980 pixels wide to fit on the Mobile screen. Although

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.370
you needed to a do a lot of Zooming to

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.920
read the text sometimes. Unfortunately if your site did not

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.200
happen to match that 980 pixel width you were either

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.350
going to overflow or underflow the screen. Either wasting

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.370
space or forcing the User to Zoom. In order

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.640
to control this, Apple provided a viewport meta tag

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.690
to be added to your HTML to control the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.830
default For how big should my screen act on

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.780
this page? The default is 980. So, if you

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.520
put 980 here, it would have no effect. The

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.430
Mobile browser already defaults to 980. But setting a viewport

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.500
tells the browser how wide the content is

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.170
intended to be, and then the browser scales

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.930
to make that size fit on the device's

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.660
screen. There are two ways to use this tag.
