program the Nobel week dialogue is very
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.850
program the Nobel week dialogue is very
much about this sort of discussion and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
much about this sort of discussion and
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.130
much about this sort of discussion and
the day is mostly devoted to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
the day is mostly devoted to
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.459
the day is mostly devoted to
conversations between varying groups of

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469
conversations between varying groups of
 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.529
conversations between varying groups of
participants and this topic of

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
participants and this topic of
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.240
participants and this topic of
scientific truth is one that we'll

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
scientific truth is one that we'll
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850
scientific truth is one that we'll
revisit in various forms throughout the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
revisit in various forms throughout the
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.240
revisit in various forms throughout the
day we'll be talking about uncertainty

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
day we'll be talking about uncertainty
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.439
day we'll be talking about uncertainty
and trust and evidence in panels later

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
and trust and evidence in panels later
 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.380

on but for now we just have a few

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
on but for now we just have a few
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.200
on but for now we just have a few
minutes to talk about what scientific

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
minutes to talk about what scientific
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.929
minutes to talk about what scientific
truth is and perhaps to respond a little

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
truth is and perhaps to respond a little
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.940
truth is and perhaps to respond a little
I think we've we're done thank you

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
I think we've we're done thank you
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.600
I think we've we're done thank you
perhaps to respond a little to david's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
perhaps to respond a little to david's
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.690

theoretical physicist you are a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
theoretical physicist you are a
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.289
theoretical physicist you are a
biologist do you have any different view

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
biologist do you have any different view
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.600
biologist do you have any different view
perhaps of scientific truth well not

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
perhaps of scientific truth well not
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.530

really I mean

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
really I mean
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.319
really I mean
David's exposition was great because

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
David's exposition was great because
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420
David's exposition was great because
what it brings it back to his reality I

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
what it brings it back to his reality I
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.149
what it brings it back to his reality I
mean what we're trying to do is deal

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159
mean what we're trying to do is deal
 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.370
mean what we're trying to do is deal
with reality and understand reality and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
with reality and understand reality and
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.550
with reality and understand reality and
reality is real there's no doubt about

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
reality is real there's no doubt about
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.249
reality is real there's no doubt about
that as a biomedical scientists I'm

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
that as a biomedical scientists I'm
 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.260
that as a biomedical scientists I'm
interested in basically climate disease

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
interested in basically climate disease
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990
interested in basically climate disease
and death person a very careful position

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
and death person a very careful position
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.670

to be in I work on infection and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
to be in I work on infection and
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.980

immunity I'm concerned with cancer and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
immunity I'm concerned with cancer and
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.050
immunity I'm concerned with cancer and
the realities are there if you've got

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
the realities are there if you've got
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.850
the realities are there if you've got
colon cancer it's a reality if you've

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
colon cancer it's a reality if you've
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.010
colon cancer it's a reality if you've
got melanoma it's a reality if you have

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020
got melanoma it's a reality if you have
 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.170
got melanoma it's a reality if you have
pancreatic cancer to reality and you'll

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
pancreatic cancer to reality and you'll
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.889
pancreatic cancer to reality and you'll
soon be dead so we understand that truth

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899
soon be dead so we understand that truth
 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.400
soon be dead so we understand that truth
is not a word

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410
is not a word
 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.760

science I've never stood up in front of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
science I've never stood up in front of
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.410
science I've never stood up in front of
an audience and said the truth is what I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420
an audience and said the truth is what I
 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.510
an audience and said the truth is what I
say is our best understanding is that

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520
say is our best understanding is that
 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.340
say is our best understanding is that
now our what the data tells us is that

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350
now our what the data tells us is that
 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.140
now our what the data tells us is that
now through that process that David

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150
now through that process that David
 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.870
now through that process that David
discussed which is the process of

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880
discussed which is the process of
 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.730
discussed which is the process of
particularly in biomedical science not

particularly in biomedical science not
 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.310
particularly in biomedical science not
so much big theory as you have in

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320
so much big theory as you have in
 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.780
so much big theory as you have in
physics because you have the laws of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790
physics because you have the laws of
 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.700
physics because you have the laws of

biology is beset by evolution and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780
biology is beset by evolution and
 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.490
biology is beset by evolution and
evolution is a process where as as the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500
evolution is a process where as as the
 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.800
evolution is a process where as as the
creatures have become more complex we've

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
creatures have become more complex we've
 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.160
creatures have become more complex we've
built on pre-existing structures so it's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170
built on pre-existing structures so it's
 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.380
built on pre-existing structures so it's
like an old house in gottenberg that's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390
like an old house in gottenberg that's
 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.840
like an old house in gottenberg that's
built in the 16th century and in the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850
built in the 16th century and in the
 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.370
built in the 16th century and in the
20th century you have to install

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380
20th century you have to install
 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.980
20th century you have to install
plumbing I mean you're not doing it the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990
plumbing I mean you're not doing it the
 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.200
plumbing I mean you're not doing it the
ideal way if we did it the ideal way

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210
ideal way if we did it the ideal way
 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.270
ideal way if we did it the ideal way
we'd have four hearts so we don't die of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280
we'd have four hearts so we don't die of
 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.160
we'd have four hearts so we don't die of
a heart attack okay but we don't do it

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170
a heart attack okay but we don't do it
 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.490
a heart attack okay but we don't do it
that way so so basically what we try to

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500
that way so so basically what we try to
 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.740
that way so so basically what we try to
understand is that underlying reality of

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750
understand is that underlying reality of
 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.960
understand is that underlying reality of
this particular situation and often what

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970
this particular situation and often what
 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.330
this particular situation and often what
we get to in science in biomedical

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340
we get to in science in biomedical
 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.150
we get to in science in biomedical
science through experimentation through

science through experimentation through
 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.300
science through experimentation through
testing often through rather ad hoc type

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310
testing often through rather ad hoc type

theoretical concept behind it is a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350
theoretical concept behind it is a
 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.440
theoretical concept behind it is a
solution or what looks like a possible

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450
solution or what looks like a possible
 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.240
solution or what looks like a possible
solution and the solution is whether you

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250
solution and the solution is whether you
 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.400
solution and the solution is whether you
live or you die and that's a pretty good

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410
live or you die and that's a pretty good
 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.680
live or you die and that's a pretty good
solution for most of us and we don't

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690
solution for most of us and we don't
 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.180
solution for most of us and we don't
have a lot of quarrels with that even

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190
have a lot of quarrels with that even
 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.240
have a lot of quarrels with that even
mr. Trump doesn't quarrel with the idea

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
mr. Trump doesn't quarrel with the idea
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.260
mr. Trump doesn't quarrel with the idea
of being live or dead I don't want to

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270
of being live or dead I don't want to
 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.449
of being live or dead I don't want to
expand on that but basically often when

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459
expand on that but basically often when
 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.960
expand on that but basically often when
we get a solution we we don't we don't

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970
we get a solution we we don't we don't
 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.640
we get a solution we we don't we don't
fully understand what's happening when

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650
fully understand what's happening when
 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.070
fully understand what's happening when
we move on mm-hmm because that problem

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080
we move on mm-hmm because that problem
 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.830
we move on mm-hmm because that problem
is no longer imaginary for us so that's

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840
is no longer imaginary for us so that's
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.140
is no longer imaginary for us so that's
that's a kind of a bit different from

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150
that's a kind of a bit different from
 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.420
that's a kind of a bit different from
the physicist who's got an overarching

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
the physicist who's got an overarching
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.280
the physicist who's got an overarching
theory and of course in the end

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290
theory and of course in the end
 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.510
theory and of course in the end
everything comes back to the laws of

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:03.520
everything comes back to the laws of

going in one is the role of ideology
that

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:44.990
that
 

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.160
that
that at the core of economics is a

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.170
that at the core of economics is a
 

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.449
that at the core of economics is a
belief does the market work and that's

00:08:52.449 --> 00:08:52.459
belief does the market work and that's
 

00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:56.079
belief does the market work and that's
very ideological and those who want to

00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:56.089
very ideological and those who want to
 

00:08:56.089 --> 00:08:58.570
very ideological and those who want to
believe in free market do not want to

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:58.580
believe in free market do not want to
 

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.300
believe in free market do not want to
look at evidence that's contrary to that

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:01.310
look at evidence that's contrary to that
 

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.430
look at evidence that's contrary to that
so you have a strong ideology a little

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440
so you have a strong ideology a little
 

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.610
so you have a strong ideology a little
bit like the evolutionary ideology and

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:06.620
bit like the evolutionary ideology and
 

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.660
bit like the evolutionary ideology and
in the United States there's a

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:07.670
in the United States there's a
 

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.329
in the United States there's a
particular problem a very large fraction

00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:10.339
particular problem a very large fraction
 

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:13.030
particular problem a very large fraction
of Americans still do not believe in

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040
of Americans still do not believe in
 

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.920
of Americans still do not believe in
evolution just like they don't believe

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:14.930
evolution just like they don't believe
 

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.519
evolution just like they don't believe
in climate science so you have to

00:09:18.519 --> 00:09:18.529
in climate science so you have to
 

00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:22.090
in climate science so you have to
overcome this ideology and finally there

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:22.100
overcome this ideology and finally there
 

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.510
overcome this ideology and finally there
is this populism today in the United

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:25.520
is this populism today in the United
 

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.920
is this populism today in the United
States where you want to use that word

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:26.930
States where you want to use that word
 

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:30.490
States where you want to use that word
this notion that a large fraction of

this notion that a large fraction of
 

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.360
this notion that a large fraction of
Americans have been left behind and they

Americans have been left behind and they
 

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.480
Americans have been left behind and they
associate that with an establishment

associate that with an establishment
 

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.000
associate that with an establishment
next you know what you said and they

you have a problem as a society so
 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.620
you have a problem as a society so
that's fast I do yes please for quickly

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:08.630
that's fast I do yes please for quickly

good so Joe you know what seems to me to

00:10:12.699 --> 00:10:12.709
good so Joe you know what seems to me to
 

00:10:12.709 --> 00:10:14.440
good so Joe you know what seems to me to
drive the American dynamic more than any

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:14.450
drive the American dynamic more than any
 

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.300

other thing I mean obviously there's a

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:16.310
other thing I mean obviously there's a
 

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.370
other thing I mean obviously there's a
bad actors who are you know like the

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:18.380
bad actors who are you know like the
 

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.130
bad actors who are you know like the
Koch brothers because of its a financial

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:21.140
Koch brothers because of its a financial
 

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.230
Koch brothers because of its a financial
interest but really it seems to me that

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:23.240
interest but really it seems to me that
 

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.480
interest but really it seems to me that
the thing that is most critical is the

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:25.490
the thing that is most critical is the
 

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:28.569
the thing that is most critical is the
belief system there no tax no regulation

00:10:28.569 --> 00:10:28.579
belief system there no tax no regulation
 

00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:31.360
belief system there no tax no regulation
free market economies and that basically

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:31.370
free market economies and that basically
 

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.860
free market economies and that basically
if you're going to do something about

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:32.870
if you're going to do something about
 

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.350
if you're going to do something about
climate change firstly you need taxes

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360
climate change firstly you need taxes
 

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.120
climate change firstly you need taxes
and secondly you need regulation and

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.130
and secondly you need regulation and
 

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.460
and secondly you need regulation and
this is why it is so deeply threatening

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:39.470
this is why it is so deeply threatening
 

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.370
this is why it is so deeply threatening
to the to the basic business American

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:42.380
to the to the basic business American
 

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:49.680

psyche and that to me is a religion and

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:49.690
 
 

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.960
 
almost immune to evidence

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:52.970
almost immune to evidence
 

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.560
almost immune to evidence
so right now we've been through this big

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:56.570
so right now we've been through this big
 

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:00.910
so right now we've been through this big
thing about tax cuts people appeal to

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:00.920
thing about tax cuts people appeal to
 

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.880
thing about tax cuts people appeal to
supply-side measures that this will

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:03.890
supply-side measures that this will
 

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.160
supply-side measures that this will
stimulate the economy we had an

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.170
stimulate the economy we had an
 

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.170
stimulate the economy we had an
experiment not a controlled experiment

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:08.180
experiment not a controlled experiment
 

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.940
experiment not a controlled experiment
in the way that we were talking about

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:09.950
in the way that we were talking about
 

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.190
in the way that we were talking about
earlier today but you might say an

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.200
earlier today but you might say an
 

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.920
earlier today but you might say an
experiment under Reagan where we lower

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:14.930
experiment under Reagan where we lower
 

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.380
experiment under Reagan where we lower
taxes there were predictions made what

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:17.390
taxes there were predictions made what
 

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.990
taxes there were predictions made what
would happen both of the macro-level

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000
would happen both of the macro-level
 

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.210
would happen both of the macro-level
what would happen to GDP at the micro

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:22.220
what would happen to GDP at the micro
 

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.850
what would happen to GDP at the micro
level in terms of savings and labor

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:24.860
level in terms of savings and labor
 

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.520
level in terms of savings and labor
supply all those predictions were

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:27.530
supply all those predictions were
 

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.910
supply all those predictions were
refuted and yet after all the evidence

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920
refuted and yet after all the evidence
 

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.990
refuted and yet after all the evidence
comes in they the same arguments are

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000
comes in they the same arguments are
 

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.300
comes in they the same arguments are
brought out and you say how could they

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:37.310
brought out and you say how could they
 

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.970
brought out and you say how could they
do that and it comes to a religion where

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:39.980
do that and it comes to a religion where
 

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.040
do that and it comes to a religion where
it can't be refuted yes

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.050
it can't be refuted yes
 

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.740
it can't be refuted yes
you know and here reality comes back in

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:44.750
you know and here reality comes back in
 

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.970
you know and here reality comes back in
again reality will also hit this kind of

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:48.980
again reality will also hit this kind of
 

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.480
again reality will also hit this kind of

in with all its interconnected financial
streams etc at one point it takes time

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600
streams etc at one point it takes time
 

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.530
streams etc at one point it takes time
but at one point it will hit back yeah I

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:05.540
but at one point it will hit back yeah I
 

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.510
but at one point it will hit back yeah I
I hate to be a pessimist because my life

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:07.520
I hate to be a pessimist because my life
 

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.130
I hate to be a pessimist because my life
has been about optimism and change but

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:11.140
has been about optimism and change but
 

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.460
has been about optimism and change but
we had the reality of the 2008-2009

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:15.470
we had the reality of the 2008-2009
 

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:16.810
we had the reality of the 2008-2009
crisis I mean that you couldn't have

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:16.820
crisis I mean that you couldn't have
 

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.100
crisis I mean that you couldn't have
more reality than that and yet the large

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.110
more reality than that and yet the large
 

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.260
more reality than that and yet the large
number of particularly macro economists

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:23.270
number of particularly macro economists
 

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.810
number of particularly macro economists
who believe in the same models that

who believe in the same models that
 

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.270
who believe in the same models that
brought us this crisis that has not

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:28.280
brought us this crisis that has not
 

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.240
brought us this crisis that has not
changed that religion has been dented

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.250
changed that religion has been dented
 

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.640
changed that religion has been dented
but not fundamentally changed some of

the sign find things about economist

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:38.380
 
 

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.990
 
it's very interesting I think it's kind

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000
it's very interesting I think it's kind
 

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.440
it's very interesting I think it's kind
of an attack on science and but also I

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:44.450
of an attack on science and but also I
 

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.960
of an attack on science and but also I
think there's an assumption within that

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:46.970
think there's an assumption within that
 

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.360
think there's an assumption within that
whole establishment that science will

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:49.370
whole establishment that science will
 

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.910
whole establishment that science will
solve the issue will solve the problem

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:51.920
solve the issue will solve the problem
 

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.860
solve the issue will solve the problem
that's what's expected a medical science

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:53.870
that's what's expected a medical science
 

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:55.840
that's what's expected a medical science
you don't get much problem getting

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:55.850
you don't get much problem getting
