1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Right. Well, I'm going to blow your mind
with my technology in this conversation,

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,070
which I just read an article
yesterday that in uh,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,200
China face recognition is the thing that's
gonna stop your fantasy of everybody

4
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:17,550
just loving each other and going around
in China there with face recognition,

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:22,551
they're able to recognize and
categorize Muslims in the country.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,010
There's like this one sector of Muslim
in China and they're with all this face

7
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:32,040
recognition that they're seeing, you
know, from your phone, from everything.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,400
They're starting to catalog
the enemy and they're,

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,110
and they're going to be able to police
or sharing information and hotels and

10
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:44,430
everybody and they're all
now through this network. No.

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,080
What type of person just walked into this
building and whether they're friendly

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,690
or they're the enemy and that thing,

13
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:56,370
that face recognition thing is PR could
end up splitting us apart even more.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,460
Hmm.
Oh,

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,100
Tommy Tommy with his
technological facts here,

16
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,210
China's big brother
surveillance technology isn't
nearly as all seeing as the

17
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,550
government wants you to think.
This is kind of like a,

18
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,840
they might be able to upgrade
it though, can't for sure.
Yeah. That's one point. Oh,

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,830
when your phone unlocked
with your fingerprint and
it blew your mother fucking

20
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:21,150
mind, you're like, bro,
it's roots. My Fan Guard.

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,780
Even worse. My pinkie five
fingerprints on this motherfucker.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,990
It'd be like I said,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,650
as I get to do the side of my thumb
and it's still knows she has glasses.

24
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:32,484
The Cop,

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,550
what do you mean with that is a cop.
It's a cop with Google last,

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,060
it's got some sort of
face recognition thing.

27
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,490
It's like that time Tom Cruise movie

28
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,360
minority report. Whoa. Was that
real? Yeah. Nope, not Tom Cruise.

29
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,180
Tom Cruise is definitely in there. I
don't know, but it looks real. That's,

30
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,080
you know, I, I try to Google
glass on once I actually oh yeah.

31
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:00,010
Through a whole UFC weigh ins wearing
Google glass. How was filming it? I guess?

32
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,850
Um, ah, it wasn't ready.

33
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,970
It wasn't ready and I think that's
why they haven't upgraded it. Oh yes,

34
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,010
let's hold off because this is not
working like it's been a while.

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,350
It's not new to that Dorky shit and
people got super uncomfortable when you

36
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,860
around them.

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,460
It's like holding a camera and everybody
walked around with a fucking camera

38
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:21,610
everywhere.
I think they'll have something eventually,

39
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:25,380
but I have a feeling it'll be
something where there's a technology,

40
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:30,070
like we were the outside.
You can't see things from the inside.

41
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:33,970
You can and then they'll show you images
like directly in front of you on the

42
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:36,700
Lens. So like you wear
glasses like your glasses,

43
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,800
but it'll show you things right, right
in front of you, like right. Yeah.

44
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,340
I got one that I heard that I don't know
if I understand and believe that this

45
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:45,761
is real,

46
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:48,880
but I've just googled it and I found
something that makes it seem like it's so

47
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:52,600
the next version of the VR headsets are
supposed to have brain tracking in them

48
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,130
and that sounds super scary,

49
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,840
but it's already like being implemented
and tested and get a knock on your door.

50
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,950
Are you think about as beating
off what is wrong with you, man?

51
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,270
We thought you were a regular person,

52
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,160
but you're beaten off
a hundred times a week.

53
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,270
You imagine if they wanted to
have a talk to you like Mr Papa,

54
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:17,890
you watched 14 hours of pornography
this week. That seems a lot. Yeah.

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,190
I think your mother would think
that. It seems like a lot. I mean,

56
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,740
I don't want to talk to her. Well they
say employers are going to do that.

57
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:26,390
Insurance companies are going to do that
and they're going to be able to tell

58
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:29,230
them much or beaten or how much you're
beating off, how much you're working out,

59
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:31,780
how much you're sleeping,
whether and what. Look at that,

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,720
whether we choose to
share only good stuff.

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,610
That's like Google when they said
don't be evil. Yeah, abandon that.

62
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,640
Once you start making money,
they fucking pain right over that side.

63
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,410
Maybe a little evil. What is
evil man? I mean what is evil,

64
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,560
evil Schmiegel we're going
in that direction. Yeah, man.

65
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,640
It's going in that direction.

66
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,820
It's all go into some sort of a
wearable thing that connects you,

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,760
but a weird thing that like everywhere
you're going and they're picking off your

68
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:00,220
face and then you're going to be able to,

69
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:04,030
they're going to know exactly what
you are and who you are and you know,

70
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:06,760
it's a strange,
it's strange,

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
but it isn't any more strange than our
lives today in comparison to people that

72
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:15,490
lived in 1920 like we were talking about
earlier. Yeah. This is way weirder.

73
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,930
Weightless, super weird. Way weirder.
We're in a weird town already for sure.

74
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,371
You just don't,

75
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,700
it doesn't get into the hands of people
that can really mess with you. Oh yeah.

76
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:28,390
The people at the money put the
money and all the control. Yeah.

77
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,670
They are going to be cool with
it, right? Yeah, that'd be great.

78
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,370
That'd be all right. Yeah, that'd be
fun. Everything's going to be fine.

79
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,410
Do you have a Alexa in your house?
All the, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My kids do.

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,630
My from my one friend is
always trying to tell me,

81
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,580
just get that out of your house.

82
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,460
It's listening to everything that you
say and everything that he's doing bad in

83
00:04:45,461 --> 00:04:49,300
that room.
It's,

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,780
I had a question about the neuro link
might be coming on soon or whatever.

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,040
I was thinking about like if,

86
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,910
if it got to the point where like say
we all got it and then everyone you knew

87
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,950
had it and there's like a
thousand people that have it.

88
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,490
When we hit a oh like a threshold
point, we were like, eh,

89
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,120
not everybody should have this.
We're good at this point right here.

90
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,530
How would you ever deny people
something like that? The cost.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,920
It might be really expensive to know.
How would you,

92
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,780
I know you can't deny people that won't
like say if someone's coming up and they

93
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:19,180
want to try it and everyone else has it,
that would,

94
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,950
that would create a giant problem.

95
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,950
That'd be like if you said that with
cell phones too many people have cell

96
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:26,440
phones. We have to stop you no
more buying cell phones. I know.

97
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,110
That's why I sort of think
like that. There might become
a big problem with that.

98
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,800
Why? What is, but hold on a second.
I don't understand why you think,

99
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,540
I just sort of think that if,
uh,

100
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:38,710
in the theory that you're really going
to let thousands of people have instant

101
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:41,750
access to the world's knowledge
at their fingertips, at a,

102
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,780
at a thoughts like instant,

103
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,180
that becomes too powerful in the wrong
hands and the people that might have at

104
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:52,780
first might see the future problems
of that. I'm just, I was wondering,

105
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,460
I was thinking way too
far. Jamie goes high. Yeah.

106
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,500
[inaudible] you got high watch superman.
She answer. You say it was like,

107
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:04,750
no, that probably won't be a problem or,
well, no, I can't stop it though. I don't,

108
00:06:04,751 --> 00:06:07,740
that's what I'm wondering.
I don't think that anyone can say that.

109
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,390
Not going to be a problem. Yeah. I don't
know. I mean, what is a problem though?

110
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,150
It's going to be something, it's
going to be a something, yeah.
