[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:08.100
SERGE KASSARDJIAN: So what
we're going to look at

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.460
is how to engage more
users on Android TV

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.890
and earn more revenue
on Android TV,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.440
and look at all the new features
around Android TV and all

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.900
the things that
we're doing with it.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.880
So a quick overview of the
topics for today's discussion.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.800
First, we're going
to look at when

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.960
we're doing as Android
and Google Play

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.159
in the living room and our
overall strategy around that.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.680
Then we're going to look
at the importance of having

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.670
a really, really good TV
strategy and why that's

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.510
important for your business.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.810
And then finally, we're going
to look at specific ways

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.580
where you can drive
engagement and grow revenue.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.430
So that third bullet, that's
the most important, juicy part.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.000
So stay until then.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.186
So to begin, we're going to show
you all the different things

00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:00.060
that we're doing with
Android and Google Play

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.460
and walk you through a little
update of our business.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.430
And walk you through all
the new announcements

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.030
that we've made recently here
at I/O, and in previous months

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.530
from there.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.010
So taking a step back, we look
at how Android has evolved.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.780
We started off with phones.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.760
We expanded to tablets.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.970
We moved to watches,
cars, and TVs.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.150
And we went into virtual
reality headsets.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.330
And the concept behind it
is one unified platform

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.460
for our developers to build
on and to easily interact

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.290
with their audiences on.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.610
So when we think
about this platform

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.700
how do we distribute content?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.180
Well, Google Play's the
consistent place where you

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.900
can distribute your content.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.280
One interface, it's
consistent for your audiences,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.961
and one developer console
where you can push out

00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:54.960
all of your updates and
all the different things

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.210
that you need to do within it.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.570
So how do we think about
our living room strategy?

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.690
Well, to be honest, there
are many form factors.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.190
And the reason that
we do this is we

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.889
want to make sure that
different people have exactly

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.030
what they need.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.280
So when we think about
how we discuss this

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.350
with our developers,
we tell developers

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.410
you can create one app
for both experiences that

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.300
will vary for our
users, who have

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.100
different needs
and different ways

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.560
that they can get content
in the living room.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.480
So when you think
about Android TV,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.200
we have a deeper experience.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.160
We think of use of remote
control, native elements

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.420
to navigate.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.555
And content is
searchable in a TV UI.

00:02:34.555 --> 00:02:36.460
Similarly, when we
think about Comcast,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.820
you take your existing app,
you take a simpler interface,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.670
and you easily push that
content onto the big screen.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.340
It's available both
on iOS and Android.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.400
So when we think about
that living room strategy,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.750
you have an Android app.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.270
You can turn that Android
app into a TV app.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.650
You can supplement that Android
app into a cast-enabled app.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.380
This is something for everyone,
and something for everyone's

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.421
different viewing habits.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.790
So the focus of this
talk is Android TV.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.640
So we want to take
a quick step back

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.190
to tell you how we've extended
Android TV into the living

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.120
room.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.390
So Android TV initially launched
[INAUDIBLE] Nexus player back

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.790
at the end of November 2014.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.700
It helped extend Android
into the living room.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.610
With that, we use that
exact same reference

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.770
across all of our different
OEMs to deliver a successful UX.

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.960
Different hardware for
OEMs for different people,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.520
depending on their choice.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.250
Just like we initially
had for phone and tablet.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.500
And again, the Play
Store was there,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.170
and all of our great Play
apps and our Google apps

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.550
were all within there.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.744
So all of the
elements for Android

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:44.910
were hitting the big screen.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.807
So as we've gone
through this journey,

00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:51.390
there have been
partnerships with some

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.460
of the top global
brands in the world,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.210
across different countries and
across multiple form factors.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.640
Our ecosystem is really focused
on three different areas.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.490
First, we have smart TVs.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.320
Then we have streaming players.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.472
And then we have operators.

00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:06.930
So we have some of
the partnerships

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.950
with some of the top OEMs in
each vertical, as you see here.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.130
Sony is a big partner
on our smart TV side.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.920
Arus is another one in our
streaming player set-top box

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.410
that we initially announced.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.570
And Sling TV and DISH
Network is another one

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.610
that we announced last at CES.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.350
And there's many
others that are coming.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.530
20 of our top operators will
be launching later in 2017.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.170
So one of the things that you
heard about in the keynote

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.210
was the growth of Android TV.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.630
So Android TV activations,
over the last 12 months,

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.260
have more than doubled on a
year-over-year monthly average.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.899
And we have 1 million activated
Android TVs for every 60 days.

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:54.440
So a lot of this
growth is attributed

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.100
to the great OEMs that
have come on our platform,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.640
and they've distributed
a platform for us.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.790
And with that, we have
a number of great apps

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.830
for every type of user.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.570
Personally, I love sports.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.090
So we recently had ESPN and NFL
joining our ecosystem of apps.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.270
But we have others, from
European apps like Canal

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.770
to news apps like CNBC,
and 3,000 plus apps

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.350
across the ecosystem
that we're very, very

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.540
proud of for our developer
partners to bring.

00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:30.780
ALBERT REYNAUD:
Thank you, Serge.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.140
So, thank you, as
you can see, it's

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.910
been a great year
for Android TV.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.970
And moving forward,
Google will continue

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.985
to invest in these different
living room solutions.

00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:45.750
Since we launched Android
TV three years ago,

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.340
we've also seen
that the users are

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.800
becoming more and
more demanding when it

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.840
comes to their TV experience.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.140
They expect TV everywhere,
with seamless access

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.810
to their accounts on
all their devices.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.080
They also expect high quality
content with 4K resolution.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.280
They expect the ability to
get that content anytime

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.320
with on-demand services.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.220
But this tells us
also that TV still

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.570
continues playing an essential
role when it comes to how

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.330
people consume media content.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.610
Among others, here are
a number of reasons

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.270
why we believe that TV should be
at the center of your strategy.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.930
So first of all,
while mobile viewing

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.150
are growing
exponentially, we also

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.910
see that TV still
dominates when it

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.880
comes to Leanback experiences.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.570
Studies from
[INAUDIBLE] in 2016 show

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.880
that average user interaction
time is three times higher

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.490
on TV than it is on smartphone.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.790
In other words, TV
has a unique ability

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.850
to engage deeply
with your users,

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.270
with longer session length.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.920
And these statistics
are confirmed

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.880
with the performance of Google
Play Movies on Android TV.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.900
If you look at Google
Play Movies in 2016,

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.090
the average session lengths were
2.5 times higher on Android TV

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.250
than they were on smartphone.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.010
More interestingly, if you
look at the average revenue

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.990
per user, it was
five times higher

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.770
on Google Play Movies on Android
TV than it is on smartphone.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.400
So we've seen that TV
gives longer interactions,

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.990
higher revenue per user.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.000
But it also influenced,
positively, retention.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.980
These data, shared by Netflix,
compare the importance

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:45.080
of different form factors at
sign-up and after six months.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.460
And what it tells us is
really interesting to me.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:54.130
While 80% of the acquisition
takes place outside of TV,

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.910
TV becomes the primary
device for 2/3 of the users

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.440
after six months.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.130
According to Netflix the
usage of a living room device

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.730
directly translates into
an increase in retention

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.440
and, obviously, lifetime value.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.180
This means that for you, early
on, very early in the user

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.880
journey, you need to
encourage and promote

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.430
the activation of a
living room device

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.730
in order to increase
your lifetime value.

00:08:24.985 --> 00:08:26.560
SERGE KASSARDJIAN: Great!

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.200
Now that we've gone through the
various reasons why you should

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.830
have an important
living room strategy,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.250
we're going to look at ways that
you can specifically improve

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.425
engagement on Android TV.

00:08:39.425 --> 00:08:41.799
And one of the big announcements
that we've made recently

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.680
is Google Assistant is
coming to Android TV.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.710
As you heard from I/O this
week, Google Assistant's

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.632
very, very important to Google.

00:08:49.632 --> 00:08:51.340
Every single one of
our products is being

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.050
touched with Google Assistant.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.160
We believe, specifically on TV,
this brings a new opportunity

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.860
to increase engagement and
bring your best content

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.170
right in front of your users.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.480
We are going to show you
all the capabilities that

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.640
come with Assistant
on TV, and what

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.210
makes it a unique opportunity
to improve discoverability.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.590
And as a result, the
engagement with your content.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.450
So beyond connecting
people to information,

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.530
the Assistant will also help
a wide range of our developers

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.930
complete many kind
of actions for users.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.372
That will occur across
contexts and devices.

00:09:28.372 --> 00:09:30.830
Any Assistant should be able
to help you in two [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:31.950
ways.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.920
Just do what you need
with Direct Actions,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.440
or connect you to an expert
with Conversation Actions.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.260
So what we've done
with Google Assistant

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.220
is we've built on 17 years of
history of helping our users.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.980
The Assistant is
made for our user.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.390
Their own Google.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.920
It has four elements.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.000
Conversational,
personal, fast, and fun.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.370
The Google Assistant
allows you to talk or text

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.170
with Google in a natural way.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.750
Think of it as you're having
a conversation with Google

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.130
in order to help you get
things done in your own world.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.990
So before we dive in on the
details of Assistant with TV,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.530
we want to discuss that the
core of this product integration

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.630
is your content
feed, which works

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:19.830
not just on Assistant, but
across all of your surfaces.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.510
We hope that our
development partners

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.570
will maximize their content
reach across all services

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.690
and products that enable
our consumers to engage

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.920
with this content.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.180
By taking one feed of catalog
metadata and merchandising,

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.750
we will see the experience that
provides the following four

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:37.590
things.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.640
Consistency of search across all
Google products and services,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.280
visibility as an option
for content titles

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.890
available across all these
multiple services that you see

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:50.730
here, customizability of
the metadata for content

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.970
available on a specific
service, and merchandising

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.700
across all these multiple
platforms and products.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.120
You'll see here that the
reach goes across Assistant,

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.290
Android TV, the Google Home
app, and search results as well.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.030
That one feed populates all of
these different surfaces, which

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.440
your users touch Google on.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.570
So how does this relate
specifically to Android TV?

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.530
Well, Assistant allows you
to do three things on TV.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.040
First, you have discoverability.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.790
Assistant on TV is all
about content and control.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.400
By searching using
Assistant on TV,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.340
users can find their favorite
shows and some services

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.830
with a simple, "OK, Google.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.900
Show me Sci-Fi shows."

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.780
And suddenly, you'll see all
the different Sci-Fi shows

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.860
that are available across
all of your different apps.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.870
Secondly, you have engagement.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.530
So once you have an app
that is already installed,

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.720
Assistant is a great way
to re-engage the audience

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.560
by invoking very
specific shows to play,

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.180
and content that lives
within your apps.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.210
Pick your favorite show,
ask Assistant to play it,

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:01.665
and get ready to watch.

00:12:01.665 --> 00:12:03.180
"OK, Google.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.220
Continue watching" put your
favorite shows name in there.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.910
Finally, Assistant
gives you control on TV.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.200
You want to give users the most
that they can do and control.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.830
So by using a Media Session
API to make easier playback

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.280
control, you can say
things like, "OK, Google.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.720
Pause playback."

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.070
Or, "OK, Google.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:27.780
Go back five minutes."

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.170
Or even more informational
things, such as, "OK, Google.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.850
When does this air?"

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.660
So in order to do
this integration,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.630
we have two specific parts.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.010
Part one is transport controls
for voice control of playback.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.040
And then part two is
metadata for Assistant's

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.360
intelligent responses.

00:12:49.008 --> 00:12:50.520
ALBERT REYNAUD: Thank you.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.070
So as we saw, thanks to a more
natural voice integration,

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.630
Google Assistant will
allow you to improve

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:02.220
how your user will discover
and engage with your content.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.380
But there's another
update on Android TV.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.570
And for those who were at
the keynote on Wednesday,

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.480
we were really
excited to announce

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.530
the launch of the new
Android TV home experience.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.750
This new Android
TV interface will

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.990
be available on all Android
TV devices that will upgrade

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.390
to O starting this summer.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.530
So let's take a look at it

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.870
Before I jump into the
site, how many of you

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.200
here have an Android TV app?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.580
OK, so you're not just here
because it's too hot outside.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:35.370
That's good.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:40.190
And how many of you are just
thinking about building one?

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.050
OK, so it's already
convinced people.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.470
OK, good.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.470
So you're probably familiar
with this interface, which,

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.540
like a lot of
other devices, like

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.615
streaming devices in the market
is what we call app-centric,

00:13:51.615 --> 00:13:53.490
which means that really
the app as the center

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:55.020
of the experience.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.310
But since we launched
Android TV three years ago,

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:01.620
we realized that
things were changing,

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.190
and user were consuming
entertainment differently

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.700
in their living room.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.480
Well, of course, we
realized that the user

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.890
gets more and more content.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.840
They have more and
more content available.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.120
And it's increasingly
difficult for them

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.070
to make a decision
on what to watch.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.580
They have to compare
content sources from live TV

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.700
to [? SVO ?] to TiVo to UGC.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.610
And also compare
content providers.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:29.340
Go into the app, browse
the content, going out

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.970
and change providers, it's
increasingly difficult.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.960
This is why, with Android's
O, we have completely

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.270
redefined the experience on
the home screen of Android TV.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.950
We made it channel-based.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.050
But more importantly, we
made it content-centric.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.010
This means that we're giving
more and more prominence

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.760
to your content in the
discovery experience.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.030
We basically want the user
to spend more time watching

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.870
your content, as opposed
to simply looking for it's.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.970
Not only do we think that
this will significantly

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.710
improve discovery.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.530
We also think that this
will impact positively

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.040
the way you're going to
reengage with your users.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.150
To get them to come back to
your app and watch your content.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.270
So let's take a
closer look at it.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:20.730
So at the top, you
have quick access

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.340
to the search
functionality, which

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.420
now becomes Google Assistant,
as Serge was explaining.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.090
Just below, you have
the favorite app row,

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:34.290
which basically allows users to
launch into their favorite app

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:35.430
really quickly.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:40.260
On the right, a red button,
which is basically the app

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.300
view page, which includes
all the apps that

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.400
are installed into the device.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.570
But here is where it
becomes interesting.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:54.040
Continuing down, we had several
rows that we call channels.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.340
These channels are
made of cards that we

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.240
call programs, that basically
give maximum prominence

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.830
to your content.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:06.510
These channels are the core of
the new home screen experience.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:10.110
Each developer will be able
to create his own channel

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.080
and benefit from a
greater real estate

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.240
to promote their content.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.110
When a user selects one
program, well, obviously ,

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.990
it launches the app
and immediately starts

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.010
the playback.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.140
But interestingly,
if the user decides

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:28.050
to press the Back button,
instead of coming back

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.450
to the homepage of
Android TV it will

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:33.480
be taken to a higher-level
screen of your app

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.480
and continue browsing
within your own app.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.267
As a developer, of course,
you have full control

00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:42.600
of what you put in your channel.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.670
You can decide
what content you're

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.580
going to put, what programs
you're going to put,

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.800
what order you
want to show them,

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.620
all the content metadata,
as well as the channel

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.350
names and the branding.

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.990
One of the features
I'm more excited about

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:02.250
is video previews that are
played, as you can see here,

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.119
whenever one particular
program is on focus.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.970
As a developer,
you can decide what

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:12.950
to include in this video
preview, like live TV.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.369
Either trailers
or video previews.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.400
By default, only
one primary channel

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.700
will be displayed into
the Android TV interface.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.440
But as a developer,
you can decide

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.940
to add additional channels
that the user will

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.470
be able to add into
their interface

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.480
according to their preferences.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.140
So let's say you are, for
example, a pay TV provider,

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.520
and you create a primary channel
that aggregates all the best

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.060
content you have.

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.880
You can also think
about creating

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.170
additional secondary channels
based on specific topics,

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.370
like sports, kids' content,
or series that the user will

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:56.190
be able to add
into his interface,

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:58.940
according to his preferences.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.250
So as mentioned
earlier, Android TV

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.240
is, of course, about discovery.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.540
The new Android TV home
is about discovery,

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.600
but it's also a lot
about re-engagement.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.630
We really want to make
sure that your user can

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.740
come back to your app and
consume that content again

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.000
and again.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.350
This is why we created what
we call the watch next row.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.830
All the content that the user
has been previously engaged

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.940
with will be consolidated,
aggregated into this watch

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:33.470
next channel that will always
appear in second position

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.380
below the favorite app row.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.804
Studies show that a large
majority of watched sessions

00:18:40.804 --> 00:18:44.240
are links to
previously-engaged content.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.400
And this is the whole
thinking around it.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.000
As a developer, this will
help you drive re-engagement

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.200
and improve your retention,
as your content will

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.300
be seen in this channel
whenever, for example,

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.130
a user plays a video
and doesn't finish it,

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.600
or a new episode of a
series is newly available,

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.150
or just simply because the
user can add your content

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.570
into the watch list.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.180
So in the previous
two sections, we

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:18.470
gave you an overview of the most
recent evolution of Android TV.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.170
If you think about it,
both Google Assistant

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.630
and the new Android
TV home screen

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.630
aim at improving
discoverability of the content,

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.840
but more importantly,
re-engagement longer-term

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.420
with your existing customers.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.318
But beyond these two
platform evolutions,

00:19:35.318 --> 00:19:37.692
there are a lot of things that
you can do inside your app

00:19:37.692 --> 00:19:39.920
in order to improve
the experience.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.770
But remember, as
a form factor, TV

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:46.550
is unique in the way
we interact with it.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.670
The use of a remote control
makes it often quite tedious

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.100
and difficult to navigate.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.950
This means that you should
pay even more attention

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.810
to making sure that
the experience is

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.100
as frictionless as possible
at each critical point

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.260
of your user journey.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:10.080
So typically, identification,
discovery, and payment.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.470
So let's start with
authentication.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.800
While identification
is obviously

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.080
a precondition for
the personalization

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.900
of your experience
inside of your app,

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.080
it's also a critical moment
where developers, like you,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.339
lose a lot of users.

00:20:26.339 --> 00:20:28.130
That's why we introduced,
a couple of years

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.600
ago, Smart Lock for passwords in
order to remove this friction.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.670
So by integrating with
Smart Lock for passwords,

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:37.700
you can automatically
sign up users

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.610
into your app using the
credential that they

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.840
have already saved on other
Android devices, or on Chrome.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:49.190
So in this example with
myCanal, it has automatically

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.430
recognized and logged in
the user that was accessing

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.870
the app for the first time.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.410
This is especially
relevant knowing that,

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.590
as we said, during the
identification process

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.650
on TV with a remote control
is particularly painful.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.570
So now, let's talk
about discovery.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.810
As we all know, discovery
is a very complex process

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:16.850
that involves internal, external
factors that will determine

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.290
what the user wants to watch.

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:22.580
But also, how precise is the
idea of what you want to watch.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.430
So if you're
commuting, it won't be

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.280
similar to if you are
nicely, comfortably

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.900
sitting on your sofa.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.160
How much time do you have?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.450
How many people are part
of the watching group?

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:36.530
Your mood and your mindset
at a particular time

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.980
will determine
directly the discovery,

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.590
and position you
differently in what

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.325
we call the certainty spectrum.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:50.070
So across the industry,
research tells us

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.430
that when deciding
what to watch,

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.390
the user operates in four
different modalities.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:01.570
Find, select, browse, and surf.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:04.260
Often, people can jump from
one modality to the other.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.750
Like as soon as, for example,
some content finishes,

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:10.290
or a new person comes into
the watching group, etc.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.000
But the goal for
you is to make sure

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.840
that your app addresses
each of these modalities

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.090
with a minimum effort.

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.430
So let's start with search.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.540
We estimate that's
around 20% of the viewing

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.910
comes from a search
functionality.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.150
So that means that
you should really,

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:34.050
there's real value for you
to make sure that this works.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.990
Beyond content and titles,
you should make sure

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.200
that the search
functionality also

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.740
takes into account all your
metadata, such as actors,

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.400
categories, genres, etc., etc.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.244
Are you able to address
and solve queries?

00:22:50.244 --> 00:22:51.660
We realize that a
lot of users are

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.630
making queries that actually
don't lead to any results.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.520
There's something to
be done around this.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.730
Also, could you improve the
search experience using what

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.010
we call natural
language processing,

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.330
in order to make the
experience even more natural.

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.570
Similarly, make sure that
the user has the ability

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:14.370
to access his favorite content
with functionality such as DVR,

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.800
watch list, or add to favorites.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.420
And moving down to the
certainty spectrum,

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.270
there are different ways
to inspire your users

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.710
so they can find their content.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:30.850
The usage of most popular
collection, content, category,

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.150
genre, etc., etc.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:35.070
And even more
editorial collections

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.770
that can really inspire
the user in what to watch.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:39.800
So think about all these
different modalities,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.883
and think within your app
what you can do in order

00:23:41.883 --> 00:23:44.900
to address each of them.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.720
So once the user
shows some interest

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.670
in a particular
content, you want

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.800
to make sure that
he also has access

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.960
to all the relevant
information that

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.060
would help me take the decision
to actually watch this content.

00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:58.480
So, of course, title.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.570
Also, a short and
long description.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:06.250
Don't undermine the importance
of beautiful images and video

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:08.020
trailers.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.380
Finally, third-party
ratings, review

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.887
are also critical when it
comes to taking a decision.

00:24:15.887 --> 00:24:17.470
Another aspect that
I find interesting

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:22.030
is this idea of making
your experience even more

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:23.410
linear inside your app.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:29.050
So the benefits of on-demand
consumption is undeniable.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.150
People are no longer forced
to come back to their house,

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.890
rush into their living room to
watch their favorite program.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:39.190
They can just take their
replay and on-demand service,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.330
and watch it.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:44.680
However, we believe
that users still love

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.080
what linear TV has to offer.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.180
If you turn on your
TV, you can be passive.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.010
You get some moving images.

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:55.010
You enjoy the
serendipity of discovery.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.640
And you also enjoy the
fluidity of the experience.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.730
As a result, as an
on-demand content provider,

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.340
you should think
about all the ways

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:09.850
you can recreate certain aspects
of this linear experience

00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:12.910
by adding functionality,
such as watch next, that

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.630
are famously at the
origin of binge watching,

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:17.800
related content.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.610
But also picture-in-picture and
background playing and animated

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:22.570
carousel.

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:25.630
All this functionality
really makes the experience

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.010
within your app linear again.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.930
Last but not least,
obviously, payments.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.470
With the rise of millennials
and cord cutters,

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.230
many media partners
have launched

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.220
their own what are called
direct-to-consumer experiences

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:45.790
and service.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:48.250
Which means that now,
all these partners

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:53.350
need to handle the
payments directly.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.980
As mentioned earlier, more
than in any other form factor,

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.250
friction on TV can
be prohibitive.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.740
Being such a critical step
of your user's journey,

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.080
you really want to
make sure that payments

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:09.400
is handled correctly and
is as simple as possible.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.550
By integrating with
Google Play billing,

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.280
users can complete that
payment in only three clicks.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.240
They can benefit from having
already their details saved

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.310
into the accounts, and
benefit from having

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.600
the different options in
terms of form of payments,

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.870
including credit
cards, PayPal, and DCD.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.920
Subscription is a huge
opportunity for subscribers.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.850
And over the last
year, in Google Play,

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.450
we've doubled our revenue
associated to subscription.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.970
As a consequence, we've
multiplied the number

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:46.030
of useful tools
and functionality

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.920
inside the console
in order to manage

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.230
for you the subscription.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.440
Subscription Dashboard, that
was presented yesterday.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.420
Flexible payment periods.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.100
And of course,
promotional tools.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.220
That includes intro
pricing and free trial.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.470
All these [INAUDIBLE]
should, again,

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.800
remove the friction
within the TV experience

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.850
to execute the payments.

00:27:09.435 --> 00:27:11.290
SERGE KASSARDJIAN: All right.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.425
Well, thank you for taking the
time to attend our talk today.

00:27:14.425 --> 00:27:16.300
Hopefully, you've learned
a couple of things.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.810
And we showed you a little
bit of how to achieve success

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.910
on Android TV.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.580
But before we jump
into the questions,

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.270
we wanted to leave you
with a few key takeaways

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.220
around our talk.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:34.330
So first, we explored how
Android and Play can empower

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:37.870
our living room strategy through
an overview of the platform,

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.970
and how we are
positioned to succeed

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.730
with the growth of the
ecosystem of both Android

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:46.439
and our OEMs and Play
and our app developers.

00:27:46.439 --> 00:27:48.730
We showed you how having the
right living room strategy

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.920
is important for app success.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.100
We showed you how
this strategy shapes

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:57.040
deeper interactions, higher
retention, and improved

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.270
lifetime value.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.960
Finally, we showed you
some of the best practices

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.860
that we recommend to drive
engagement and grow revenue.

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.260
Some examples of
these integrations

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:11.350
were for Google Assistant,
Android O for content

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:15.730
discovery, frictionless
sign-up, and other various user

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.530
experiences in your app.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:22.228
So thank you for coming, and I
will take some questions now.

00:28:22.228 --> 00:28:25.714
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:25.714 --> 00:28:30.860
