00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
The electron is to chemistry what money is
to capitalism.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.529
It's all about who has it, who wants it, and
what they're willing to do to get it.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.139
Electrons are what make it possible for an
atom to bond with other atoms to form molecules.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.690
And when that happens, a tremendous amount
of energy can be exchanged in the process.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.760
But not all chemical reactions involve electrons
changing hands.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.790
Acid base reactions, you recall, are more
about swapping protons.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.010
But because electrons are the real coin in
the realm of chemistry,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.160
the most important reactions to take place
on Earth involve the transfer of one or more

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.380
electrons from one atom to another.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.320
These are redox reactions. Redox, which is
a portmanteau of 'reduction', 'oxidation'.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:47.660
[Theme Music]

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.960
But what's up with those words? You know what
reduction is, making less of something.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.280
And then oxidation maybe has something to
do with oxygen. Well, sometimes, not always.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.149
These are actually super terrible choices
for what is actually happening in redox reactions,

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.899
but we are stuck with them.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.159
Reduction is when a substance gains electrons.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.819
Yes, it gains, which is the opposite of what
the word 'reduce' means, fantastic.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.240
And yes, sometimes I want to punish the people
who name these things so inaccurately

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.640
but they didn't know any better and they're
all dead, so we can't do anything about it.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.140
Proto chemists would make pure metals by heating
or smelting their ores.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.950
And they notice, during the smelting, that
these substances would become lighter.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.350
So I guess it's not crazy that they decided
to say these substances were being reduced.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.500
Our old French friend, Antoine Lavoisier,
figured out that this was

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.090
because oxygen gas was actually leaving the
compound, making it lighter.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.810
What he didn't know, was the actual chemistry
involved.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.440
Oxygen is, unsurprisingly, the quintessential
oxidizer.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.150
It pulls electrons off of one molecule to
make itself more stable.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.500
But if you heat it up enough, it gets all
energetic.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.329
Today, we understand that oxidation and reduction
are all about electron transfers.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.450
So you might think that we'd rename them.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.409
And some chemists have tried, using terms
like electronation and de-electronation.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.420
But once a set of terms is decided upon and used for a while, it's pretty difficult to uncreate it, so we're stuck.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.700
To keep these seemingly nonsensical names
straight, I rely on the phrase 'OILRIG':

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.420
"Oxidation is loss of electrons, reduction
is gain of electrons."

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.020
We just gotta know these stuff, because it's
everywhere.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.380
When your cells convert sugar into energy so you can move and breathe and think? That's redox.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.640
When plants photosynthesize sunlight into
food? That's redox.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.069
The battery powering your laptop? Redox. Fire?
Also redox!

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.560
Since electron swapping is the name of the
game here, when you study redox reactions,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.349
it's important, critical, absolutely essential,
to keep track of the electrons.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.360
Think of them as dollars or pesos or pounds
or euros.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.110
In any transaction, one person is going to
gain them and the other is going to lose them.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.710
And to stay on top of things, you have to
keep tabs on who's ahead and who's behind.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.680
Atoms are fond of sharing electrons though,
forming covalent bonds,

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.640
so sometimes keeping track of where they are and where they're gonna end up isn't quite so simple.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.599
Let's think of every covalent compound like
a marriage.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.839
Though it's gonna be weird marriage, because
like, there might be like six people in it.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.100
Sometimes the same person several times.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.930
Without commitment, no commitment and also
no emotions. Don't think too much about it.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.080
Like in a marriage, where money gets shared,
covalent compounds share electrons.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.260
The trick, is figuring out who get the cash
when the vows break.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.739
So we've created a useful little system assigning
electrons 100% to atoms that are, actually

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.390
at the moment, sharing them.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.330
The number that we assign is the atoms' 'oxidation
state' or oxidation number.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.540
Even though we are of course aware of covalent
bonds and the sharing of electrons,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.620
the processes are easier to follow if we imagine the atoms are already splitting up the bank account,

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.280
as if they were in an ionic or non-sharing
bond.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.099
So an atom's oxidation number is basically
what its charge would be,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.480
if it actually owned all its electrons exclusively like the newly-minted bachelors that they may become.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.820
So to figure out those oxidation states, or oxidation numbers, we have some simple rules for some atoms:

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.159
First, the oxidation number for any element by itself, whether it's monatomic, diatomic, or polyatomic,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:19.480
like an atom of calcium or molecule of H2 or even bigger molecule of sulfur (S8), the oxidation number is 0.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.550
Atoms, by definition, do not have a charge.
If they had a charge they would be ions.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.330
And if they're sharing with themselves, they
share it equally.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.820
Second, for a monatomic ion, basically a charged atom, it's simply the size or number of its charge.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.020
So the iron (II) in Fe2+ has an oxidation state of plus two, while the chloride ion is minus one.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.800
Third, oxygen, which is unsurprisingly all
over redox chemistry,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.539
almost always has an oxidation of negative
two,

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.129
unless it happens to be in a peroxide molecule
like hydrogen peroxide.

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:53.069
Fourth, hydrogen, is plus one.
And fifth, fluorine, is negative one.

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.020
As are all the other halogens most of the
time.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.259
Pretty much, unless they're bonded to fluorine
or oxygen,

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.259
cause fluorine or oxygen are so bad that they
could make anybody's oxidation number a positive,

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:03.599
if you know what I mean?

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.140
And those are the rules!
That's all you need to know.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.420
Now, the total of all the oxidation numbers of all the atoms in a neutral compound will add up to zero.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.779
Like water: with one oxygen, with a negative two oxidation state; two hydrogens of plus one;

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.629
and voila, a neutral compound has an oxidation
number of zero.

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.920
A polyatomic ion, on the other hand, has to work out to have an oxidation state that matches its charge.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.039
So SO42-, the sulfate ion, has four oxygens
for a total of negative eight,

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.119
but we don't have a rule for sulfur so I guess
we just give up and walk away, who cares anymore?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.500
No!
We use like, third-grade algebra.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.920
Because we have to end up with an oxidation
number of negative two for the whole compound,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.520
we know that sulfur, in this particular compound,
has an oxidation state of plus six.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.529
But, sulfur's oxidation state isn't always
plus six,

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:55.770
and that's why we don't have a rule for sulfur
or a lot of other elements for that matter,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.689
because oxidation states of most elements
change depending on what they're bonded with.

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.289
Now we can use the same logic to figure out
what happens

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.609
when these compounds interact in redox reactions.

00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:10.779
Molecular divorce courts of electrons: changing
hands, being haggled over, and traded,

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.620
with some players taking big profits while others lose nearly everything. Them's the breaks.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.300
Let's start out with a simple example:

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.160
a chemical reaction that I believe has saved more lives than any other in the history of chemistry,

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.980
created by a war criminal to blow people up
during WWI: the Haber process.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.240
The Haber process removes the ultra-stable
elemental nitrogen from the air

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:39.159
and combines it hydrogen to form NH3, ammonia
for use in bombs and also in fertilizer,

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:42.569
increasing the carrying capacity of the Earth
by billions.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:48.920
Nitrogen in the air exists as elemental diatomic nitrogen, and hydrogen, likewise, is also diatomic H2.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.580
So we know that starting out all of the atoms
have an oxidation state of zero.

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:57.689
Product of the reaction, ammonia, is a neutral
compound with one nitrogen and three hydrogens.

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:01.529
The hydrogens, each have an oxidation state
of plus one -- remember the rules --

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:04.740
so nitrogen must have an oxidation state of
minus three.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:09.789
Nitrogen thus gained electron, its oxidation
state went down and so it was reduced.

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.100
So at least when talking about what oxidation states are doing, the word 'reduced' make sense.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.080
Hydrogen lost electrons, the oxidation state
went up and it was oxidized.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:23.740
Now this is pretty simple equation to balance, but redox equations can be a huge headache sometimes

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:29.249
because the number of individual atoms involved,
so we often have to balance them in half-reactions.

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:32.440
So even though we don't really need to do the half-reactions, because this is a pretty simple equation,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.879
we're going to do them anyway, just because
it's an example that's simple to start with.

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:39.169
So we start out with nitrogen getting reduced.

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:44.659
We have N2 with an oxidation state of zero becoming NH3 with an oxidation state of negative three.

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:46.639
First we balance the number of nitrogens,

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:51.120
then add the number of electrons that we need to have to have there be the same number of electrons on each side.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.239
Do the same with the oxidation half of the
reaction

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:56.799
and then combine them to get your whole reaction
with the electrons cancelling out.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.120
Now yes, maybe that seems like an unnecessary
step,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.600
but allow me to show you a more complicated
example that will prove how necessary it may be.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.340
In this flask, is silver diamine.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.700
We're going to use some redox chemistry to get the elemental silver out of it nice and clean and shiny,

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:14.369
and it's not gonna be no simple Haber process.

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:19.351
The silver diamine is going to react with an organic
aldehyde. Any aldehyde actually.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.809
The business end of the aldehyde is the CHO

00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:25.869
and the R in organic chemistry is a symbol
for some organic group of atoms

00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:28.240
and in this reaction those atoms don't matter.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.640
Silver diamine reacts with the aldehyde and hydroxide to create a carboxylic acid, ammonia, and water.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.279
First, let's assign ourselves some oxidation
states.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.240
The silver is in a complex with two neutral ammonias that are going to remain unreacted throughout the equation,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.420
so we can treat them like a single species
with an oxidation state of zero.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:50.760
Since the silver diamine has a charge of plus
one and the ammonias don't affect that,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.740
silver's oxidation state must also be plus
one.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.140
The aldehyde has one hydrogen at plus one
and one oxygen at minus two

00:08:58.149 --> 00:09:02.349
but is neutral overall so the carbon must
be plus one as well.

00:09:02.349 --> 00:09:04.259
The hydroxide ion is simple:

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.960
minus two for the oxygen plus one for the hydrogen and an overall charge and oxidation state of minus one.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.399
On the reactant side, the silver is now atomic,
so its oxidation state is zero.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.660
The carboxylic acid has two oxygens and one hydrogen so the carbon now has an oxidation state of plus three.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.980
NH3 remains at zero and the hydrogen and oxygen
of water also haven't changed oxidation states.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.399
So silver's oxidation state decreased, or
was reduced, from plus one to zero,

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:33.379
while carbon was oxidized from plus one to
plus three.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.900
Half-reaction time!

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.940
Silver was reduced, gaining one electron, forming elemental silver and ammonia from silver diamine.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.360
The aldehyde was oxidized, forming carboxylic
acids and requiring two electrons.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.920
With the help of those electrons,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.120
we know that at the very least we have to double the reduction half of the equation entirely

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.930
in order to get the right number of electrons
on both sides.

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.970
We do that and oh god, that's Good Stuff!

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:59.720
Then we combine them together, for a perfectly
balanced redox equation.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.790
And now, watch me take those electrons and
turn them into money.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:08.209
And there you have it folks. That is pure
silver coating the inside of a flask.

00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:10.610
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.990
If you were paying attention, you'd learn
that:

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.149
any reaction where electrons move around from
atom to atom is a redox reaction,

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:21.569
that oxidation is the loss of electron and
reduction is the gain of electrons,

00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:25.720
and that oxidation numbers are assigned to
atoms to take part in reactions

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.250
in order to keep track of what their electrons
are up to.

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.500
You'd also learn a few simple tricks to help figure out what an atom's oxidation state is

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.340
and got a little practice figuring out how to assign oxidation states and balance oxidation reactions,

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.740
with two examples: one pretty simple and another
a little less so.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.139
