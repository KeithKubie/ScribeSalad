Hey, Vsauce2, Michael here, and this is episode
2 of BOAT.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.029
This one covers weird celebrity body things
that make you say WTF, and, I did it with

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.340
my friends over at Barely Political.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.900
So, this video is part 2 of the two-parter-
we've got that many.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.090
So, click here to go check out part 1 on Barely
Political, and I'll see you back here for

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.810
the rest of the Body WTF's.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.810
Welcome back.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.759
The answer to the question: Kate Hudson...but
not really.

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.350
Actually, her things is that all of her toes
are so shifted to the right that she's got

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.540
all this extra foot, and it makes it look
like a 6th toe from certain angles.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:38.540
"Extra foot?"

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.080
"I was actually thinking that if celebrities
are doing it, I was gonna get a toe-implant

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.080
on my right foot."

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.480
"Yeah, I was gonna say, 6 toes- that's 5 more
toes than good movies usually have in it."

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480
(Laughter)

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.850
"I don't even get that!"

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.300
Oh, but this, look guys, I'm gonna kill the
mood with Tina Fey's story.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.540
You've seen this scar before.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.690
It's got the weirdest story.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.710
When she was 5 years old she was cut but a
stranger.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.900
Just came up to her, cut, left.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.400
I don't think the ever even caught the guy.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.640
It's like Bed Intruder but really sad...

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.320
Denzel Washington broke his finger when he
was a kid playing basketball and he never

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320
had it reset.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.100
So, as you can see, he's got a nice little
crookedness to it.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.100
"This one.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.870
Him and I are twins."

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.750
"It did not effect his jump shot in "He Got
Game."

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.050
Guys, look, it's about time for us to start
talking about third nipples- Lily Allen and

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.660
Mark Wahlberg both have them.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.580
And in this video clip she shows it off.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.390
Look at that little guy.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.270
Here's my question: do I sensor that?

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.560
I don't think I do.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.850
"It looks like a birthmark."

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.850
"I love her."

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.979
Well, Mark Wahlberg has one and I guess I
don't have to sensor him.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.820
Carrie Underwood also used to have a third
nipple, but had it removed.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.820
Lame.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.090
"She had it donated to Mark Wahlberg."

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.400
So now he's got 4.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.890
It's part of his plan to become like a pig.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.740
Remember in Happy Gilmore where Bob Barker
totally punches out Adam Sandler?

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.590
That whole fight there was not a single stunt
double for Bob Barker, he trained in karate.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.660
Guess with who.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.470
"Bruce Lee?"

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.030
Chuck Norris.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.489
Bob Barker and Chuck Norris worked together.

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.110
Bob still has it- check out what he does to
Craig Ferguson's desk.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.099
This was just like, 3 or 4 years ago.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.420
'Cause no one believes me!

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.849
"This is when Bob Barker was 106."

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:21.849
"Whaaaat"

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.010
"He had the skinniest microphone, the girliest
microphone of all time, and he just chopped

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.010
a desk in half??"

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.860
Thanks for watching there at home, thanks
for coming to Vsauce2.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.439
Be sure to subscribe for more BOAT and a show
called LÃ¼t where you can buy everything that

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.439
I cover in there.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.620
So, anyway, thanks for watching, thank you
guys for helping me cover the fact that celebrities

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.230
are just as weird as everybody...if not weirder.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:51.909
And, as always ("I didn't know that"), thanks
for watching.

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:59.599
Ok, hey guys, I promised that I would show
you my weird thing.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.209
Look at your hand, and then when you look
at your hand and you crease it like this,

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.529
do you see two lines?

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.410
Probably, because you're a normal homo sapien.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.930
But, on my left hand, when i crimp it down,
I've got one line.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.019
It's called a Simian line, and I think it
means my DNA is more like a monkey.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.809
So...hooray?
