having big surges in ability and so
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.560 align:start position:0%
having big surges in ability and so
that's<00:01:02.280><c> kind</c><00:01:02.670><c> of</c><00:01:02.730><c> interesting</c><00:01:02.879><c> there's</c>

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 align:start position:0%
that's kind of interesting there's
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
that's kind of interesting there's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 align:start position:0%
another product called think that sits
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.660 align:start position:0%
another product called think that sits
on<00:01:06.600><c> the</c><00:01:06.750><c> forehead</c><00:01:07.170><c> right</c><00:01:07.380><c> here</c><00:01:07.710><c> and</c><00:01:07.890><c> it</c>

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 align:start position:0%
on the forehead right here and it
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.289 align:start position:0%
on the forehead right here and it
stimulates<00:01:09.510><c> the</c><00:01:09.689><c> peripheral</c><00:01:10.229><c> nerves</c><00:01:10.650><c> and</c>

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 align:start position:0%
stimulates the peripheral nerves and
 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.289 align:start position:0%
stimulates the peripheral nerves and
sort<00:01:12.299><c> of</c><00:01:12.390><c> could</c><00:01:13.229><c> replace</c><00:01:13.530><c> a</c><00:01:13.590><c> cup</c><00:01:13.920><c> of</c><00:01:14.070><c> coffee</c><00:01:14.299><c> so</c>

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
sort of could replace a cup of coffee so
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
sort of could replace a cup of coffee so
it<00:01:15.600><c> sort</c><00:01:15.780><c> of</c><00:01:15.840><c> stimulates</c><00:01:16.409><c> you</c><00:01:16.680><c> and</c><00:01:17.009><c> wakes</c><00:01:17.759><c> you</c>

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 align:start position:0%
it sort of stimulates you and wakes you
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.929 align:start position:0%
it sort of stimulates you and wakes you
up<00:01:18.030><c> so</c><00:01:18.750><c> there's</c><00:01:18.930><c> a</c><00:01:18.990><c> lot</c><00:01:19.200><c> of</c><00:01:19.229><c> focus</c><00:01:19.680><c> on</c><00:01:19.939><c> things</c>

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
up so there's a lot of focus on things
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.810 align:start position:0%
up so there's a lot of focus on things
that<00:01:21.060><c> are</c><00:01:21.659><c> taking</c><00:01:22.320><c> feedback</c><00:01:23.189><c> from</c><00:01:23.460><c> the</c><00:01:23.610><c> body</c>

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
that are taking feedback from the body
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
that are taking feedback from the body
and<00:01:24.150><c> then</c><00:01:24.390><c> stimulating</c><00:01:25.380><c> the</c><00:01:25.500><c> body</c><00:01:25.680><c> and</c><00:01:26.009><c> so</c><00:01:26.640><c> it</c>

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 align:start position:0%
and then stimulating the body and so it
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.870 align:start position:0%
and then stimulating the body and so it
could<00:01:26.850><c> be</c><00:01:26.880><c> the</c><00:01:27.060><c> body</c><00:01:27.570><c> or</c><00:01:27.900><c> the</c><00:01:27.930><c> brain</c><00:01:28.759><c> one</c><00:01:29.759><c> of</c>

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
could be the body or the brain one of
 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
could be the body or the brain one of
