00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:02.081
- [Instructor] We're
now in the home stretch.

00:00:02.081 --> 00:00:04.049
We just have to evaluate the curl of f

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.116
and then this dot product

00:00:05.116 --> 00:00:07.252
and then evaluate this double integral.

00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:08.728
So let's work on the curl of F.

00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:12.145
So the curl of f is going to be equal to,

00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:15.710
and I just remember it as the determinant,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.543
so we have our i, j, k components,

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:21.363
and it's really you could imagine

00:00:21.363 --> 00:00:26.119
it's the del operator crossed
with the actual vector.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.176
So the del operator, I'll
write this in a different color

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:31.219
just to ease the monotony,
so this is partial

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.084
with respect to x,
partial with respect to y,

00:00:35.084 --> 00:00:37.251
partial with respect to z,

00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:40.423
and then our vector field, I copied

00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:42.317
and pasted it right over here.

00:00:42.317 --> 00:00:47.317
It is just equal to negative
y squared, is our i component,

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:51.393
x is our j component, and Z
squared is our k component.

00:00:51.393 --> 00:00:54.741
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:57.208
this is going to be equal to i,

00:00:57.208 --> 00:01:00.449
is going to be equal to i times

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.032
the partial of Z squared
with respect to y.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.750
Well, there's the Z
squared is just a constant

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.472
with respect to y so
the partial of Z squared

00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:12.594
with respect to y is
just going to be zero,

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:13.789
so this is going to be zero.

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.578
Minus the partial of x with respect to z.

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.179
Well, once again this is just a constant

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.706
when you think in terms of z,

00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:22.676
so that's just going to be zero.

00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:24.683
So that's nice simplification,

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:27.316
and then we're gonna have minus j,

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:29.086
we need our little checkerboard patterns,

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:30.437
we put a negative in front of the j,

00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:34.472
minus j and so we'll
have the partial of x,

00:01:34.472 --> 00:01:37.247
the partial of z squared
with respect to x,

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.016
that's zero again, and then minus

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:43.349
the partial of negative y
squared with respect to z,

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.478
well that's zero again,
and then finally we have

00:01:47.478 --> 00:01:50.561
our k component, k, so plus, plus k,

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:58.500
and k, we're gonna have the
partial of x with respect to x,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.777
well that actually gives us a value

00:01:59.777 --> 00:02:02.650
that's just gonna be one minus

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.329
the partial of negative y
squared with respect to y.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.622
So the partial of negative y
squared with respect to y is

00:02:10.622 --> 00:02:13.221
negative two y and we're subtracting that,

00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:17.103
so it's going to be plus, plus, two y.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:19.325
So curl of f simplifies to just,

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:21.376
all of this is just zero up here,

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:25.836
is just one plus two y times
k or k times one plus two y.

00:02:25.836 --> 00:02:28.087
And so if we go back
to this right up here,

00:02:28.087 --> 00:02:31.754
if we go back up to
that, we're going to get

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:36.419
let me re-write the
integral so zero to one

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.285
and that's our r, our
r parameter is gonna go

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:42.410
from zero to one, theta is
gonna go from zero to two pi.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.125
And now curl of f has simplified to,

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.511
and I won't skip any steps
although it's tempting,

00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:51.184
it's one plus two y, and actually
instead of writing two y,

00:02:51.184 --> 00:02:53.239
let me write it in
terms of the parameters.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.406
We saw it up here, y was r sine theta,

00:02:57.315 --> 00:03:00.186
if I remember correctly,
right, y was r sine theta.

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:01.994
So let me write y that way.

00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:04.077
Two times r sine theta k.

00:03:08.078 --> 00:03:10.010
And we're gonna dot this, we're gonna take

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.177
the dot product of that
with this right over here,

00:03:15.057 --> 00:03:18.640
with r times j plus r
times k, d theto d r.

00:03:23.481 --> 00:03:24.314
And so we take the dot product,

00:03:24.314 --> 00:03:26.350
this thing only has a k component,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.062
the j component is zero, so
when you take the dot product

00:03:29.062 --> 00:03:31.484
with this j component
you're gonna get zero.

00:03:31.484 --> 00:03:34.436
And neither of them you actually
even have an i component.

00:03:34.436 --> 00:03:37.437
And so the inside is
just going to simplify

00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:41.012
to this piece right over
here is going to simplify

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.362
to, we're just gonna have to
think about the k components,

00:03:43.362 --> 00:03:45.501
cause everything else is
zero, so it's gonna be

00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:49.244
r times this and we're
done! So it's gonna be

00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:53.994
r plus two r squared sine
theta, d theta d r, d theta d r

00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:06.512
and, once again, theta
goes from zero to two pi

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.180
and r goes from zero to one.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.073
And now this is just a
straight-up double integral.

00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:12.839
We just have to evaluate this thing.

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.388
And so, first we take the antiderivative

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:18.475
with respect to theta,
so the antiderivative

00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:21.763
with respect to theta is going to give us,

00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:23.079
so this is going to be giving,

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.966
so we're going to focus on theta first,

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:27.429
so the antiderivative of r
with respect to theta is just

00:04:27.429 --> 00:04:30.600
r theta, you can just do r as a constant,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.533
and then the antiderivative of this,

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:36.108
antiderivative of sine of theta
is negative cosine of theta.

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:41.108
So this is gonna be negative
two r squared cosine of theta.

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:44.743
And we're gonna evaluate
it from zero to two pi.

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:46.552
And then we have the outside integral,

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:51.552
which I will, I'll re-color
in yellow, re-color in yellow,

00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:54.439
so we'll still have to
integrate with respect to r

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.656
and r's gonna go from zero to one.

00:04:56.656 --> 00:04:59.357
But inside right over
here, if we evaluate all

00:04:59.357 --> 00:05:01.579
of this business right
over here at two pi,

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:06.246
we get two pi r, two pi r,
that's that right over there,

00:05:07.657 --> 00:05:10.782
minus... Cosine of two pi is just one.

00:05:10.782 --> 00:05:14.499
So it's minus two r
squared and then from that,

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:17.990
we're going to subtract from that,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.367
we're gonna subtract this evaluated zero.

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:22.965
Well r times zero is just zero,

00:05:22.965 --> 00:05:25.181
and then cosine of zero is one.

00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:26.864
So it's just minus two r squared,

00:05:26.864 --> 00:05:28.509
or negative two r squared,

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:30.518
negative two r squared.

00:05:30.518 --> 00:05:32.456
And at this negative and this negative,

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:34.011
you get a positive, and but then you have

00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:36.353
a negative two r squared and
then a plus two r squared

00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:38.075
it's just going to cancel out,

00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:39.638
that and that cancel out,

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:43.170
and so this whole thing
has simplified quite nicely

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.170
to a simple definite integral,
zero to one of two pi,

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:51.849
two pi r dr, and the
antiderivative of this

00:05:53.412 --> 00:05:55.598
is just going to be pi r squared,

00:05:55.598 --> 00:05:58.805
so we're just gonna evaluate pi r squared

00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:01.467
from zero to one, when you
evaluate it at one, you get

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:04.503
pi; when you evaluate it
at zero, you just get zero,

00:06:04.503 --> 00:06:06.925
so you get pi minus
zero, which is equal to,

00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:09.431
and now we deserve a drumroll
'cause we've been doing

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:13.764
a lot of work over many
videos, this is equal to pi.

00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:16.412
So just to remind ourselves
what we've done over

00:06:16.412 --> 00:06:20.245
the last few videos, we
had this line integral

00:06:21.223 --> 00:06:22.249
that we were trying to figure out,

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:24.220
and instead of directly
evaluating the line integral,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.318
which we could do and I
encourage you to do so,

00:06:26.318 --> 00:06:28.331
and if I have time, I might
do it in the next video,

00:06:28.331 --> 00:06:31.248
instead of directly
evaluating that line integral,

00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:32.771
we used Stokes theorem to say,

00:06:32.771 --> 00:06:34.955
oh we could actually instead
say that that's the same thing

00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:38.487
as a surface integral over
a piecewise-smooth boundary

00:06:38.487 --> 00:06:40.871
over piecewise-smooth surface that this

00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:44.852
path is the boundary of,
and so we evaluated this

00:06:44.852 --> 00:06:47.606
surface intergal and
eventually, with a good bit of,

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:51.268
little bit of calculation,
we got to evaluating it to be

00:06:51.268 --> 00:06:52.351
equal to pi.
