hello good morning my name is Adam Smith

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190
hello good morning my name is Adam Smith
 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.340
hello good morning my name is Adam Smith
calling from nobelprize.org the website

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350
calling from nobelprize.org the website
 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.290
calling from nobelprize.org the website
of the Nobel Prize in Stockholm yeah

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300
of the Nobel Prize in Stockholm yeah
 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.820
of the Nobel Prize in Stockholm yeah
very good I already talked some of your

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830
very good I already talked some of your
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.709
very good I already talked some of your
with your colleagues this morning well

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719
with your colleagues this morning well
 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.999
with your colleagues this morning well
first of all congratulations on the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
first of all congratulations on the
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.350
first of all congratulations on the

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.920
award another penguin
it must be very special in particular

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
it must be very special in particular
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.960
it must be very special in particular
because you came up with the idea of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
because you came up with the idea of
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.720
because you came up with the idea of
this detector well be careful with that

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
this detector well be careful with that
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.240
this detector well be careful with that
other people also had sort of detectors

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
other people also had sort of detectors
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.310
other people also had sort of detectors
that don't be careful with that I mean

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
that don't be careful with that I mean
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.189
that don't be careful with that I mean
in fact there was a group in Russia and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
in fact there was a group in Russia and
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.750
in fact there was a group in Russia and
in 1962 Ashton Stein and push hobbits I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
in 1962 Ashton Stein and push hobbits I
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.750
in 1962 Ashton Stein and push hobbits I
can't pronounce it for you well they

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
can't pronounce it for you well they
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.610
can't pronounce it for you well they
wrote a little paper in a Russian

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
wrote a little paper in a Russian
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.830
wrote a little paper in a Russian
Journal which none of us knew about that

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840
Journal which none of us knew about that
 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.450

not to do this do it by the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
not to do this do it by the
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250
not to do this do it by the
interferometry so much but that's a used

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
interferometry so much but that's a used
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.190
interferometry so much but that's a used
light as a way of doing this and then it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
light as a way of doing this and then it
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.529
light as a way of doing this and then it
turns out you're Webber which are

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
turns out you're Webber which are
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.639
turns out you're Webber which are
unbeknownst to us but also with your

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
unbeknownst to us but also with your
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.869
unbeknownst to us but also with your
Webber who was sort of the way first

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
Webber who was sort of the way first
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.660
Webber who was sort of the way first
person to start thinking about this with

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
person to start thinking about this with
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.580
person to start thinking about this with
his Webber balls so Webber yellow the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590
his Webber balls so Webber yellow the
 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.930
his Webber balls so Webber yellow the
Webber bar but and at the end of the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
Webber bar but and at the end of the
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.450
Webber bar but and at the end of the
Webber bars he also has some notes about

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
Webber bars he also has some notes about
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399
Webber bars he also has some notes about
that maybe we should do this with with

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
that maybe we should do this with with
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.590

world tried to reproduce the Webber

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
world tried to reproduce the Webber
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.510
world tried to reproduce the Webber
experiments I don't know if you you're

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
experiments I don't know if you you're
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.920
experiments I don't know if you you're
probably young too young to know that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930
probably young too young to know that
 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.999
probably young too young to know that
but but the thing is that in 60 we've

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
but but the thing is that in 60 we've
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.570
but but the thing is that in 60 we've
ever made his big announcement in 69 and

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580
ever made his big announcement in 69 and
 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.850
ever made his big announcement in 69 and
where he showed that he had within three

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
where he showed that he had within three
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.319
where he showed that he had within three
bars he had seen gravitational ways and

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329
bars he had seen gravitational ways and
 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.899
bars he had seen gravitational ways and
then that got virtually everybody in the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
then that got virtually everybody in the
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.580
then that got virtually everybody in the
well of many many groups both in Europe

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
well of many many groups both in Europe
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.859
well of many many groups both in Europe
and Asia and in the United States try to

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
and Asia and in the United States try to
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.929
and Asia and in the United States try to
reproduce this and - everybody's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939
reproduce this and - everybody's
 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.819
reproduce this and - everybody's
disappointment nobody saw the same thing

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
disappointment nobody saw the same thing
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.450
disappointment nobody saw the same thing
that Joe did Joe whoever did and the way

it happened in my life as I was teaching

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
it happened in my life as I was teaching
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.100
it happened in my life as I was teaching
a course in general relativity in the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
a course in general relativity in the
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.069
a course in general relativity in the
middle of that epoch in sort of 1967 and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079
middle of that epoch in sort of 1967 and
 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.780
middle of that epoch in sort of 1967 and
I couldn't explain the way a Weber barb

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
I couldn't explain the way a Weber barb
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.520
I couldn't explain the way a Weber barb
worked at it mostly because I just

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
worked at it mostly because I just
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.499
worked at it mostly because I just
didn't know enough okay but it it was

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
didn't know enough okay but it it was
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.090
didn't know enough okay but it it was
that I thought there would be an easier

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
that I thought there would be an easier
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.889
that I thought there would be an easier
way to explain well how a gravitational

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
way to explain well how a gravitational
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.190
way to explain well how a gravitational
wave interacts with matter if one just

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
wave interacts with matter if one just
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.660
wave interacts with matter if one just
looked at the most primitive thing of

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670
looked at the most primitive thing of
 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.890
looked at the most primitive thing of
all 3d floating masses

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900
all 3d floating masses
 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.649
all 3d floating masses
yes out in space and look at how the

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:14.659
yes out in space and look at how the
 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.440
yes out in space and look at how the
space between them changed because of a

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450
space between them changed because of a
 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.819
space between them changed because of a
gravitational wave coming between them

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829
gravitational wave coming between them
 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.819
gravitational wave coming between them
and I gave that as a problem in the

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829
and I gave that as a problem in the
 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.160
and I gave that as a problem in the
course you know and the kids in this

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170
course you know and the kids in this
 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.780
course you know and the kids in this
course did it because it's a fairly

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790
course did it because it's a fairly
 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.390
course did it because it's a fairly
straightforward calculation and that was

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
straightforward calculation and that was
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.780
straightforward calculation and that was
sort of 67 and by the about 70 to 71 it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790
sort of 67 and by the about 70 to 71 it
 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.580
sort of 67 and by the about 70 to 71 it
turned out that many people were not

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590
turned out that many people were not
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.710
turned out that many people were not
seeing I mean it was already quite clear

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720
seeing I mean it was already quite clear
 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.860
seeing I mean it was already quite clear
that the bar to technique and and

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870
that the bar to technique and and
 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.899
that the bar to technique and and
Weber's experiments were not being seen

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909
Weber's experiments were not being seen
 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.539
Weber's experiments were not being seen
by others and so I spent a summer

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549
by others and so I spent a summer
 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.180
by others and so I spent a summer
thinking about maybe this idea that I

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190
thinking about maybe this idea that I
 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.240
thinking about maybe this idea that I
gave is a exercise in a course would be

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250
gave is a exercise in a course would be
 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.099
gave is a exercise in a course would be
a nice way to try to do this because it

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109
a nice way to try to do this because it
 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.440
a nice way to try to do this because it
was so easy to understand it and that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
was so easy to understand it and that
 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.750
was so easy to understand it and that
then turned into like oh but other

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760
then turned into like oh but other
 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.039
then turned into like oh but other
people had thought of it I didn't know

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049
people had thought of it I didn't know
 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.720
people had thought of it I didn't know
that nevertheless a journey from the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730
that nevertheless a journey from the
 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.149
that nevertheless a journey from the
early 70s to now the sense of

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:04.159
early 70s to now the sense of
 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.699
early 70s to now the sense of
achievement and excitement oh no no I

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709
achievement and excitement oh no no I
 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.990
achievement and excitement oh no no I
mean look the other thing I'll be

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000
mean look the other thing I'll be
 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.580
mean look the other thing I'll be
letting has nothing to with pride it has

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590
letting has nothing to with pride it has
 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.869
letting has nothing to with pride it has
to do what I did something which others

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879
to do what I did something which others
 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.199
to do what I did something which others
didn't do I actually do the calculation

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209
didn't do I actually do the calculation
 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.670
didn't do I actually do the calculation
of what might be all the things that get

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680
of what might be all the things that get
 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.770
of what might be all the things that get
in the way of being able to do it which

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780
in the way of being able to do it which
 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.420
in the way of being able to do it which
actually turned out to be very useful

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430
actually turned out to be very useful
 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.339
actually turned out to be very useful
you know the different noises that would

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349
you know the different noises that would
 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.199
you know the different noises that would
make it impossible to see it you are

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209
make it impossible to see it you are
 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.580
make it impossible to see it you are
possible to see it you had to solve a

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590
possible to see it you had to solve a
 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.250
possible to see it you had to solve a
whole set of problems and and that was

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260
whole set of problems and and that was
 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.140
whole set of problems and and that was
my contribution to it in the early days

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150
my contribution to it in the early days
 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.220
my contribution to it in the early days
well that's it I mean it's quite

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230
well that's it I mean it's quite
 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.559
well that's it I mean it's quite
mind-boggling to think of how precise

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569
mind-boggling to think of how precise
 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.770
mind-boggling to think of how precise
this piece of equipment is yeah that's

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780
this piece of equipment is yeah that's
 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.479
this piece of equipment is yeah that's
true and it took that's what took by the

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489
true and it took that's what took by the
 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.849
true and it took that's what took by the
way I think the easiest way to say it is

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859
way I think the easiest way to say it is
 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.979
way I think the easiest way to say it is
that the concept is very straightforward

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989
that the concept is very straightforward
 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.020
that the concept is very straightforward
you measure the time it takes light to

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030
you measure the time it takes light to
 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.539
you measure the time it takes light to
go between two orthogonal directions in

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549
go between two orthogonal directions in
 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.449
go between two orthogonal directions in
the gravitational wave and and you go

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459
the gravitational wave and and you go
 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.270
the gravitational wave and and you go
and you measure that time very carefully

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280
and you measure that time very carefully
 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.490
and you measure that time very carefully
and that ideas sort of tripping I mean

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500
and that ideas sort of tripping I mean
 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.199
and that ideas sort of tripping I mean
most people who know a little bit of

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209
most people who know a little bit of
 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.050
most people who know a little bit of
physics can make that calculation on the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060
physics can make that calculation on the
 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.309
physics can make that calculation on the
other hand what happens to make it

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319
other hand what happens to make it
 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.619
other hand what happens to make it
actually happen because the sizes of

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629
actually happen because the sizes of
 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:03.819
actually happen because the sizes of
things are so small and I think the

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829
things are so small and I think the
 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:04.780
things are so small and I think the
easiest way to say it

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790
easiest way to say it
 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.460
easiest way to say it
are you familiar with the exponential

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470
are you familiar with the exponential
 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.860
are you familiar with the exponential
notation can I use that you can yes yeah

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870
notation can I use that you can yes yeah
 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.140
notation can I use that you can yes yeah
well okay I think the best way of saying

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150
well okay I think the best way of saying
 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.580
well okay I think the best way of saying
it is this way there are two factors of

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590
it is this way there are two factors of
 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.930
it is this way there are two factors of
10 to the 12 that had to be solved one

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940
10 to the 12 that had to be solved one
 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.060
10 to the 12 that had to be solved one
of them was that the light wavelength

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070
of them was that the light wavelength
 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.129
of them was that the light wavelength
itself is ten to the minus six meters

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139
itself is ten to the minus six meters
 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.490
itself is ten to the minus six meters
and so you had to devise a way to make

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500
and so you had to devise a way to make
 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.540
and so you had to devise a way to make
light which has

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550
light which has
 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.839
light which has
wavelength of 10 to minus 6 to go to be

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849
wavelength of 10 to minus 6 to go to be
 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.189
wavelength of 10 to minus 6 to go to be
good enough so you could measure 10 to

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199
good enough so you could measure 10 to
 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.490
good enough so you could measure 10 to
minus 18 meters and that is a factor of

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500
minus 18 meters and that is a factor of
 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.619
minus 18 meters and that is a factor of
10 to the 12 and that was not the

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:35.629
10 to the 12 and that was not the
 

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.300
10 to the 12 and that was not the
hardest problem but that was one of the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310
hardest problem but that was one of the
 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.960
hardest problem but that was one of the
major problems between let's say 1972 to

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970
major problems between let's say 1972 to
 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.350
major problems between let's say 1972 to
1982 2015 but the other one is another

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360
1982 2015 but the other one is another
 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.240
1982 2015 but the other one is another
factor of 10 to the 12 which is just as

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250
factor of 10 to the 12 which is just as
 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.010
factor of 10 to the 12 which is just as
serious and that's much harder to solve

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020
serious and that's much harder to solve
 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.010
serious and that's much harder to solve
and that's what longer and that that

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020
and that's what longer and that that
 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.499
and that's what longer and that that
took more effort and that was that you

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:53.509
took more effort and that was that you
 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.089
took more effort and that was that you
even though you may have this wonderful

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099
even though you may have this wonderful
 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.640
even though you may have this wonderful
method of now breaking up a light fringe

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650
method of now breaking up a light fringe
 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.439
method of now breaking up a light fringe
so you could do a part in 10 to the 12

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449
so you could do a part in 10 to the 12
 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.930
so you could do a part in 10 to the 12
of it you still don't know that the

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940
of it you still don't know that the
 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.760
of it you still don't know that the
thing that you're measuring is not being

move much much more that are not

the different things that can that

factors 10 to the 12 about because it

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090
factors 10 to the 12 about because it
 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.240
factors 10 to the 12 about because it
turns out the ground motion it's about a

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250
turns out the ground motion it's about a
 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.029
turns out the ground motion it's about a
few micron 10 minus 6 meters again so

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039
few micron 10 minus 6 meters again so
 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.980
few micron 10 minus 6 meters again so
you have to devise a wonderful way to

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990
you have to devise a wonderful way to
 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.659
you have to devise a wonderful way to
get rid of the ground motion and then

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669
get rid of the ground motion and then
 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:38.980
get rid of the ground motion and then
get rid of the thermal noise and now

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990
get rid of the thermal noise and now
 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.330
get rid of the thermal noise and now
it's video at the point where we were

it's video at the point where we were
 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.529
it's video at the point where we were
worrying about the quantum noise so but

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539
worrying about the quantum noise so but
 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.999
worrying about the quantum noise so but
it was all pretty well organized

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009
it was all pretty well organized
 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.439
it was all pretty well organized
I mean intense that people knew what the

fact you could just about hear it in

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130
fact you could just about hear it in
 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.580
fact you could just about hear it in
your ear but the amount of power that

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590
your ear but the amount of power that
 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.950
your ear but the amount of power that
went to you through you is something

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960
went to you through you is something
 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.170
went to you through you is something
like 10 to the 24 watts per centimeter

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180
like 10 to the 24 watts per centimeter
 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.320
like 10 to the 24 watts per centimeter
squared huge in other words it's it's

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330
squared huge in other words it's it's
 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.210
squared huge in other words it's it's
you know the Sun puts out about 10 to

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220
you know the Sun puts out about 10 to
 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.650
you know the Sun puts out about 10 to
the 4 watts not into what that yeah yeah

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660
the 4 watts not into what that yeah yeah
 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.330
the 4 watts not into what that yeah yeah
in fact almost all we did translate that

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340
in fact almost all we did translate that
 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.850
in fact almost all we did translate that
in that initial paper into the amount of

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:23.860
in that initial paper into the amount of
 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.590
in that initial paper into the amount of
power was sort of brighter than anything

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600
power was sort of brighter than anything
 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.600
power was sort of brighter than anything
in the universe but 50 times brighter

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610
in the universe but 50 times brighter
 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.580
in the universe but 50 times brighter
for the few moments in which that

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:29.590
for the few moments in which that
 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.560
for the few moments in which that
gravitational wave was that was actually

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:31.570
gravitational wave was that was actually
 

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.530
gravitational wave was that was actually
you know traveling through you they say

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:34.540
you know traveling through you they say
 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.870
you know traveling through you they say
it's an enormous lease this the system

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880
it's an enormous lease this the system

just does not like to make you can't

00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919
just does not like to make you can't

just does not like to make you can't
distort space very much but you do get a

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960
distort space very much but you do get a
 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.390
distort space very much but you do get a
little bit and that's what we measure

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400
little bit and that's what we measure
 

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.909
little bit and that's what we measure
that that is a really beautiful concept

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:44.919
that that is a really beautiful concept
 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:46.560
