00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.030
bone butter to dote.
Um,
oh,

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.190
that's actually Hollywood with the fuck am I thinking?
It's not a New York Song,

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.413
right?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.840

That's Hollywood right?</v>

12
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.130
That's in New York side.
Start spreading the news.

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.620
Right.
I don't fucking know.
I'm all over the map here.
Um,

14
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.420
I'm winding down this trip.
I just wrapped up my acting gig on front runner.

15
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.620
Uh,
I want to thank everybody that,
that allowed me to be on that movie.

16
00:00:56.621 --> 00:01:00.640
I had such a great time.
I met so many great people on that shoot.
And,
uh,

17
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.140
the last night of the shoot,

18
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:05.530
I actually got to do a scene with the star of the movie

19
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.170
<v 0>Jackman.
And um,</v>

20
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.850
<v 1>I can't even tell you how great that experience was.
He might,
he might be the,</v>

21
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:17.530
not one of the nicest guys I've ever met in my life.
Uh,
totally cool.

22
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.730
Big Guy too.
He's like six,
four or something.
Big Guy.

23
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.370
Totally cool.
Nicest fucking dude ever.
Then you start doing the scene right.

24
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.810
And it's his character in the scene was getting,

25
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.700
was getting mad and like frustrated with us dude.

26
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.260
And he went into that wolverine thing a little bit.
I was just like,
Jesus Christ,

27
00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:39.460
I will not fuck with this guy.

28
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.910
Just an amazing,
amazing actor.

29
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.010
And uh,
I was the coolest thing like on the last night,

30
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.470
um,
we had like two things to shoot,

31
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.760
like one quick thing in a car and then the whole rest of the thing was,
uh,

32
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.200
us,
you know,
like me and two other actors and Hugh Jackman.

33
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.350
And it was just like,
it was a,
yeah,

34
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:07.750
we shot that the whole night and was one of those things where you're like,

35
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.960
I wouldn't really care if we continued shooting the scene tomorrow.

36
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.880
I'm having so much fun.
You know,
I found out,
I actually,
I like to run when I act,

37
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.690
this scene involves me running into running before I t I delivered the uh,

38
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.700
my lines or whatever and I found that I really liked that.
And I was just like,

39
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:29.830
wow,
no wonder.

40
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:32.890
I always like William Shatner and Tj Hooker.

41
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.240
I know I've talked about this before,
but if you ever watched TJ hooker,

42
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.320
I don't think in the history of television they ever,

43
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.090
they ever made an actor run farther than they made William Shatner who's well

44
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:49.840
into his 50s by then they would just have like this,

45
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:54.400
the master shot of the scene and I want to get all old Hollywood here on yet,

46
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.420
but the master is just,
when you go to shoot the scene is you're just,

47
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.860
it's a wide and you're capturing every character in it or you're establishing

48
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:06.490
the place,
the setting.
I have no fucking idea.
I think that's what it is.
Right?

49
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.390
They would just,
they would just be standing on the other side of a wharf,

50
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.330
a runway like William Shatner.

51
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:17.850
He chased after planes and they would just start and he would come running

52
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.910
around the corner and he would always be like 70 yards away and they'd be

53
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:25.570
playing this fucking music with the Bongos in the background and you would watch

54
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:29.770
him just full speed running a man in his 50s.

55
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.970
All right.
And this is like the 80,
so no guys stretched

56
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.290
unless you were on like,
you know,
you had to be like in the Olympics.

57
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.960
And even then if you watch like the old NFL films,

58
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.480
the way that they would stretch,
you know what I mean?

59
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:46.030
They weren't doing like any,
just sort of doing a forward bend,

60
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.570
none of that Yoga Shit.
It was like touch your toes,
touch your hips,

61
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.460
touching shoulders,
do a jumping jack,

62
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.230
come back down or whatever the fuck they would do for that type of stuff.
Um,

63
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.080
running and cop's shoes,
full speed for a good 80 yards.

64
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.730
There's actually a great youtube video that I think I posted before we have TJ

65
00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:09.560
hooker running.
Um,
so anyways,
I had the,

66
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.170
I had the best time and uh,

67
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.940
did the perfect amount of time on the movie cause right when it ended I came

68
00:04:16.941 --> 00:04:20.030
right here to New York and then I'm going to go back and the rest of my year,

69
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.280
other than like two road gigs,
I am done.

70
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.060
And I'm going to get to spend this ridiculous amount of quality time with my

71
00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:28.430
wife and daughter and I can't wait.

72
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.330
I'm totally getting into the Christmas spirit this year.

73
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.070
Not to the point of sacrificing thanksgiving.
Um,

74
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.470
you know,
I don't know,

75
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.670
I might even put up a couple of little like cut out turkeys in my house.

76
00:04:43.671 --> 00:04:46.280
I had out thanksgiving just gets passed over,
you know what I mean?

77
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.330
Gets passed over like a,
a,

78
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:53.200
I dunno like a person that should have got the job but didn't write,

79
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.260
but I'm totally getting into it.
And I am,
I'm still sober.

80
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.180
Was that he was 84 days on Thursdays.
So 85,
86,
87,
88.

81
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.020
Eric Lindros 88 Lynn Swann.

82
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.540
I wasn't [inaudible] 88.
Yeah.
Um,

83
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.970
88 days,
not Busan.
And,
uh,
I think I'm going to go for the a hundred.

84
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.800
I don't know.
You know,
I think I will be,
let's see,

85
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:23.230
I'll be 91 on Thursday a week from Thursday.

86
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:26.770
It'll be 98 and then there'll be thanksgiving.
And what,

87
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:28.860
I'm not going to have a little brandy and my Eggnog,

88
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.660
they're big with the brandy in the egg knock,
you know?
Um,

89
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.520
that's what I would have added to the great opie and Anthony bit the Eggnog.

90
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.200
Ope,
Anthony Little Jimmy.
Right.

91
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.260
Do you think those guys love to get back together?
Do like a reunion tour?

92
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.420
They should have like a one off.

93
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.050
You don't even like a in like the police got back together.

94
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.850
They should do that with great radio shows where everybody eventually,
you know,

95
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.800
just got sick of each other and went the other way.

96
00:05:56.801 --> 00:06:01.370
But fans are still sitting there like,
come on man,
just to one more tour,

97
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:04.010
man.
They should all get together.
You know,

98
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.330
I think it will have guns and roses can get back together.

99
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.973
<v 0>Right.</v>

100
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.330
<v 1>I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
plowing ahead here.</v>

101
00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:18.010
I'm totally going to get into the holidays.

102
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:20.563
<v 0>Uh,</v>

103
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.030
<v 1>and I dunno,
I dunno about the drinking thing.
I think I'm done for awhile.</v>

104
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.310
Like I said,
I want to go staying in my fifties.
I'm turning 50 in June

105
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.280
<v 0>and um,</v>

106
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.440
<v 1>I want to make sure,
uh,
I dunno,
that's a critical fucking decade,</v>

107
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.293
<v 0>right?</v>

108
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.370
<v 1>That's that one.
They may,
you know,
people like fucking die in their 50s.
So I get</v>

109
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.790
that
you just had some people just start dying.

110
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.800
I mean,
people,
I've,
Oh God,

111
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.070
I've already lost like I've lost count how many fucking friends I actually,

112
00:06:57.071 --> 00:07:00.820
I have a list on my phone so I don't forget all the comics that I've known that

113
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:01.654
have died.

114
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.210
<v 0>Um,
by the way,
all men,</v>

115
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.350
<v 1>all men out of the 25,
they're all meant,
so all these women out there,</v>

116
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:13.280
like you don't understand how difficult it is to be a woman.
It's like,
lady,

117
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:17.930
I got 25 dead friends.
They were all guys,
okay,

118
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.540
I don't know what the fuck is going on with us.
But whatever you guys,

119
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.070
that there's something that you guys,
something in your life is easier.

120
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.700
I know in this age of feminism where it just has to be,

121
00:07:29.701 --> 00:07:34.050
everything is so fucking much harder for a woman.
There is one easy thing,

122
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:39.060
one easier thing for a woman and it really is the most important thing and that

123
00:07:39.061 --> 00:07:40.560
is staying alive.

124
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.930
I wouldn't fuck is my phone.

125
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.480
I got them all like I got and I'm probably going to forget a few people.

126
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.810
All right,
let's see here.

127
00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.430
These are all the fucking people that I knew that had gone here.

128
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.770
All right.
It all started with Mitch Hedberg in like March I think at 2005.

129
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.450
Mitch Hedberg,
Freddy Soto,

Those are all the people that I knew really well our worked with as a comedian

135
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.130
that have all died since 2005 [inaudible] Dave Fitzgerald,
he died earlier.

136
00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:46.060
He doesn't like 2001.
It was a Boston comic.
Um,

137
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.800
and I probably forgot a few people,

138

Manny Dorman,
elution hope.

141
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.670
fucking unbelievable.

142
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.670
You just don't understand sometimes what it's like to be,
I know.

143
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.540
I absolutely,

144
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:17.010
I'm sure it's fucking a much more difficult than a lot of ways,

145
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:20.790
but I'll tell you the most important way.
Staying alive.

146
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.570
Let's not forget that.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

147
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:29.010
so I did the,
uh,

148
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.090
the new west side comedy club and it was,

149
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.840
I just the perfect layout.
And I also love to,

150
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.060
it's right around the corner from the,
uh,
the beacon theater.
So,
uh,

151
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.780
I've gotten to play,
there are a couple of times,

152
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:46.800
but what I also love is if I was a young comedian starting out,

153
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.750
it's really like this motivational thing where you walk out and then you walk

154
00:09:51.751 --> 00:09:54.480
around the corner and there's the beacon theater and you can kind of be
thinking,

155
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:56.640
you know,
someday,
maybe I'll be able to play that place.

156
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.630
That's the type of shit that used to get me.
Um,

157
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.300
used to get me motivated when I'm starting out,

158
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.130
although I don't know about playing theaters.

159
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.190
I think it was just seeing Caroline's comedy club because when I was starting

160
00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:13.520
out,
like nobody played theaters.
It was like Cosby played theaters.

161
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.680
George Carlin like you had to be like a legend.
Um,

162
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.510
Joan Rivers,
um,

163
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.880
those people played like theaters and um,

164
00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:30.640
you know,
for most comedians when I started,
I think it was,
um,

165
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.210
the dream was to just sell out clubs.

166
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.670
The dream was to sell our clubs and to get an a sitcom built around your act.

167
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.740
Uh,
that was the dream.
And then somewhere along the line it's switched.

168
00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:51.600
And a lot of people talk about,
you know,
social media and blah,
blah,

169
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:54.980
Blah and all that.
I think the biggest thing that is created,

170
00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.440
one of the big things that people forget as far as like how all of these

171
00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:02.020
comedians now are,
are,

172
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.500
are big enough of a draw to play theaters.

173
00:11:06.501 --> 00:11:11.501
I think one of the best things that happened for comedians that nobody brings up

174
00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.493
is Napster.

175
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.590
An online file sharing air quotes,
sharing of music,

176
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:23.591
which was really stealing music that completely destroyed the music business and

177
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:28.800
their ability to make stars.
Um,

178
00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:30.320
you remember virgin records member,

179
00:11:30.321 --> 00:11:32.780
you would go in there and they had that little CD listening thing and they had

180
00:11:32.781 --> 00:11:37.550
like the top 10 of the top 20 cds and they'd always be like a new band in there.

181
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.050
It's like they were feeding,
you know,
bring in New People in.

182
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.760
And once Napster came out and then it was the lime wire and all of that shit,

183
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:51.680
and then iTunes and all of that,
what happened was,
um,
oh,

184
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:55.090
am I gonna use this term?
There was an development of new,

185
00:11:55.091 --> 00:11:59.980
like when you look at like the amount of bands that broke through and like the

186
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:03.220
last 10 years that was suddenly able to sell out arenas.

187
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.540
It's like a handful of bands or people like lady Gaga,

188
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.800
Bruno Mars was that 21 pilots is very few

189
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.070
<v 0>that got that big.</v>

190
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.020
<v 1>Um,
at least not as much as,
uh,
as they used to.</v>

191
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.410
I feel my might be completely wrong on this,
but if I'm,
if I'm not mistaken,

192
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.940
there was like,
like the MTV music or had like the five,

193
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.600
the same five artists for a long time.

194
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:34.270
We're with a few new ones but like,

195
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:40.070
like Jay z Kanye and I'm like,
I don't know,
I'm not so good with all the,

196
00:12:40.071 --> 00:12:41.830
all the youngest people stuff,

197
00:12:41.831 --> 00:12:46.831
but they stuck around forever at those music awards because there was not these

198
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:49.060
new people coming in.

199
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.820
<v 0>MMM.</v>

200
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.960
<v 1>Usually for somebody to stick around in a music award for over 10 years,</v>

201
00:12:55.961 --> 00:12:58.540
I feel like there was only a couple of bands that could do it,

202
00:12:58.541 --> 00:13:01.630
but they had to keep those people from 10 years previous cause they all got

203
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:04.240
knocked out.
And then I'm going to get to a point here.

204
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.670
So everything became a quick little bullshit.
I don't want to pay for it online.

205
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:14.500
And I think in everybody went online,
either wanted to fucking,
uh,

206
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.690
watch someone do something incredible on a skateboard,
some x games,

207
00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:22.990
shit.
Or you wanted to watch people fail and you wanted to laugh.

208
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:27.700
And I feel like standup comedy fit into that set up punch,
set up,
punch.

209
00:13:27.701 --> 00:13:30.370
It was quick.
They made you laugh,
you fucking moved on.

210
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:35.320
And then I think comedians slid into all of these theater gigs that were,

211
00:13:35.321 --> 00:13:38.200
all of these bands would have been playing.
I'm not talking arenas,

212
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:43.060
I just mean like,
like theaters.
I might be wrong on that one,
but I think,
um,

213
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.350
if you look at the graph as the music business imploded,

214
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:51.100
comedy went through the fucking roof.
Then also with technology,

215
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.240
I'll comic comics could just keep putting out these specials and then Netflix

216
00:13:55.241 --> 00:13:58.240
was another big thing.
But everybody talks about that.
But nobody seems,

217
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.340
I don't know.
I think the music business,

218
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.680
I'm completely imploding also helped out stand up.

219
00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:08.560
It created a void.
Um,

220
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.150
I don't know you like that you'd like me discussing the fee,
the ins and outs

221
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:19.390
of ticket sales in stand up comedy.
So anyway,
so I was working at the,

222
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.180
uh,
west side comedy club.
You got to go there.

223
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.720
Some old friends of mine opened the place up.
That's why I did it.

224
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:29.440
I the best time.
And what was really cool is it mostly,
you know,

225
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:30.491
podcast listeners,

226
00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:35.491
so I could say whatever the fuck I thought essentially in these times,

227
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.960
you know what I mean?
Everything that's going on,
you know,

228
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:42.730
I heard like those fucking people were going down to the comedy cellar and then

229
00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:46.750
writing down what other comics were saying about Louis C K and all of that type

230
00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:51.170
of stuff was just,
it's just so fucking,
it's such a crazy time right now.

231
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:56.330
Um,
and uh,
you know,
I don't know.

232
00:14:56.331 --> 00:15:00.230
I Love Louis C K and that was really obviously just fucking hard thing to see

233
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.490
happen to somebody.
And he was definitely 100% wrong.
I'll just say this,

234
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:05.540
he was 100% wrong.

235
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.640
He did own up to it and I think he will definitely be back.

236
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:12.343
Um,

237
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.360
<v 2>yeah,</v>

238
00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.960
<v 1>I will say that.
And I also knew a couple of the women that he did this shit too.</v>

239
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.400
And I just feel bad for everybody.
It's just fucking terrible.
And uh,

240
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.510
I dunno.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what else to say about it.

241
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.080
I feel like I'm in a divorce where,
you know,
both the mom and the dad,

242
00:15:31.081 --> 00:15:34.470
you need just,
you've got to like pick a fucking side here.
Uh,

243
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.260
you know,
I dunno all,
I think that just this new thing though is like,

244
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.480
like the level of witch hunt that happened when the Louis thing came out.

245
00:15:42.481 --> 00:15:45.120
Like the amount of fucking people that they went after was just fucking,

246
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.570
it was like six degrees of Louise Dick,
you know,

247
00:15:48.571 --> 00:15:51.420
to the point that even the fucking Huffington post was even trying to like,

248
00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.333
you know,

249
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.310
list people that clients have the same manager that he had and stuff.

250
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.070
Who by the way is one of the great people I've ever met in life.

251
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.180
I stand by my fucking manager and I'm never firing the guy.

252
00:16:06.181 --> 00:16:08.040
I've been with this guy since 2006 date.

253
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.270
Becky's one of the great people that I've met in this business.
I love that guy.

254
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.700
It's still have him over my house for fucking dinner watching everybody just,
Oh,

255
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:18.990
I think I remember this happening 15 fucking years ago and then watching

256
00:16:18.991 --> 00:16:23.220
everybody tried to burn down this guy's life.
It's just fucking predicts people.

257
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.040
This is America.
You remember due process,

258
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.390
like the whole thing is just like,
it's fucking insane.

259
00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.860
I wouldn't be surprised if they're going after Louis C K mailman saying if you

260
00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:39.670
deliver his mail,
you're part of the problem.
Um,

261
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.400
you know,
and it doesn't seem to be like there's any sort of like,
you know,

262
00:16:45.401 --> 00:16:50.020
in the judicial system where this,
like if you steal a bike,

263
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:54.160
you get this sentence.
If you rob a bank,
you get this.
If you kill somebody,

264
00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:57.460
if you kill a whole bunch of people all the way up to the death penalty.
Yeah.

265
00:16:57.461 --> 00:17:01.450
This kind of seems like it's become,
um,

266
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.870
it doesn't make a difference if it's sexual misconduct all the way to sexual

267
00:17:07.091 --> 00:17:11.050
assault slash rape,
you know,

268
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.870
you're getting the exact same,
uh,

269
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:20.250
like level of punishment.
Um,
so that's only my question.

270
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.030
Okay.
Out of all of this,
because he was definitely wrong.

271
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.960
Obviously I'm betting this is all obvious shit that I'm saying,
but uh,

272
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.290
does the punishment matched the crime because you know,

273
00:17:31.291 --> 00:17:35.800
sexual misconduct and you talk about sexual misconduct?
Like I,
I don't,
I would,

274
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:40.380
I don't know how many podcasts I would have to do to tell you all the stories of

275
00:17:40.381 --> 00:17:45.381
sexual misconduct with just women as a standup comedian who used to go out after

276
00:17:46.021 --> 00:17:50.310
his shows,
selling his posters all and taken pictures

277
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.270
<v 3>with just the fucking women.
Okay.
And I'll tell you,</v>

278
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:56.340
it was never any of the young ones.

279
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.080
It was always these middle aged fucking women.

280
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:03.870
Couple of glasses of red wine.
Oh God.

281
00:18:03.871 --> 00:18:08.040
And they'd come at you with their Vava boom energy and you'd be like,
oh no,

282
00:18:08.041 --> 00:18:11.520
here we go.
You know,
that's my advice.

283
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.350
Young male comics out there,

284
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.180
young female comics is plenty of information out there for you now about

285
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:19.740
watching out for creepy guys.

286
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:23.190
But I don't think there's anything out there for young male comics.

287
00:18:23.191 --> 00:18:25.620
I will tell you this,
okay,

288
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.540
if you're going to go out and meet a crowd afterwards,
when middle aged women,

289
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.530
you can tell they've had too much wine beyond the fact that they sort of

290
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:39.060
teetering on their high heel shoes with their old feet sticking out of them,

291
00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.780
just looked for the gray teeth.
All right.

292
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:45.720
And a little bit too much makeup and then you know,

293
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:50.130
they got the girls out a little bit.
Just fucking watch yourself.
Okay.

294
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:51.190
Cause that's the,
uh,

295
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:56.190
that's the old cheerleader who is not aging well and is freaking out that guys

296
00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:59.370
don't,
you know,
find her attractive anymore and I'm telling you,

297
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:03.450
they're going to come up to you,
you know,
Covey.

298
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.520
A junk.
That's all I'm going to say.

299
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:09.301
Dude.

300
00:19:09.301 --> 00:19:13.350
I had a woman licked my neck one time and I'll tell you worse than the touch of

301
00:19:13.351 --> 00:19:14.580
her tongue,

302
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.470
her old ass disgusting wine breath tongue on my fucking neck.

303
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:24.450
Worse than that was,
I felt her breath right before the eagle landed.

304
00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.310
I will,
ugh.
Oh Gee.
Oh and forget about gay guys.

305
00:19:29.311 --> 00:19:33.240
Jesus Christ.
I got to do another half podcast on that one.

306
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:37.020
We were just talking about sexual misconduct.
Um,

307
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.620
I always wanted to rub your chest.
The fuck did you just do,

308
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.340
I remember one time,
this is the thing about a guy,
when it happens to a guy,

309
00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:54.300
it's just funny just for the simple fact that,
you know,
generally speaking,

310
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.590
you can overpower whoever the fuck is coming at Ya.
I'm not a,

311
00:19:57.591 --> 00:19:58.860
I'm not a little boy.

312
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.770
So I get why nobody gives a shit when this happens to a guy,

313
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.360
I get it.
Um,

314
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.340
I remember I was dating this absolutely lovely woman,
beautiful woman.

315
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.220
She danced on Broadway.
She was such a sweet out.

316
00:20:14.221 --> 00:20:17.430
I loved him to death and I completely fucked it up cause I was an angry young

317
00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:20.550
man,
so I'm sorry to her.
Right.

318
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.440
So she was dancing in this thing,
um,

319
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.220
called Broadway bears,
which was like,
they used to do this thing to raise money.

320
00:20:29.221 --> 00:20:33.360
It was like a burlesque show.
So it wasn't like this creepy titty bar thing.

321
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:37.440
It was just,
uh,
you know,
if you ever go to a burlesque show,

322
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.400
which my wife took me to one to see that Dita von Teese.
I was just like,

323
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:45.940
are you fucking kidding me?
She's going to take me down here to go to go see,

324
00:20:45.941 --> 00:20:50.200
basically go do a rated PG 13 strip club.

325
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.940
I have the coolest wife ever.

326
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:55.060
And then I got down there and I think I was the only straight guy there and it

327
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:59.710
was like mostly
gay guys.
Right.

328
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.360
And uh,

329
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.880
that's what this Broadway bears thing was that it wasn't like the creepy who's

330
00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.520
five.
So it's actually better if there's a bunch of gay dudes there.

331
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.150
Cause I always did that whole,
I like holders,
strip clubs,

332
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.780
titty bars and all that shit.
It's just like,

333
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.710
that's something that's like fascinating when you're like in your twenties I

334
00:21:17.711 --> 00:21:20.770
think.
And then somewhere,
you know,
if you're progressing,

335
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.160
if you're maturing at some point it just becomes gross.

336
00:21:24.161 --> 00:21:27.730
Or at the very least like this is fucking stupid.
You know,

337
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.770
I want to go out and get laid.

338
00:21:30.771 --> 00:21:34.430
I'm going to sit here looking at naked women who aren't gonna fuck me.
You know,

339
00:21:34.431 --> 00:21:39.350
this is stupid while losing a ton of money,
paying for watered down drinks.

340
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:42.230
What now I don't want to eat it here.
You're in the sex industry.

341
00:21:42.231 --> 00:21:45.020
Get away from me.
I want to order some food,
right?

342
00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.700
So I go down to this Broadway bears thing,
right?
And uh,

343
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.700
you know,
there's all these fucking lyrics.

344
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.730
There's all these smoking hot women doing their dances and stuff.

345
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.440
And then there's all these shredded dudes.

346
00:21:57.441 --> 00:21:59.630
So all the gay guys that go nuts about the dude's,

347
00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.480
and I'm looking at all these women going like,
oh my God,
right?

348
00:22:02.481 --> 00:22:06.380
Fucking dancer legs.
They were incredible.
Right?
Oh,
by the way,

349
00:22:06.381 --> 00:22:10.370
they also were really talented.
All right,

350
00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:12.920
so the fucking show ends

351
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.820
and I'm waiting for my girlfriend at the time to come out and this fucking out

352
00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:23.650
of nowhere,
this guy came up and just smacked me on the ass.
And it wasn't like,

353
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:26.680
like,
it was like if you were playing football,
it was good game,

354
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:30.340
but at that place it wasn't.
This guy wanted to fucking hook up.
Dude,

355
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:31.540
he hit me so hard,

356
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:36.541
like I almost fucking got whiplash and I fucking turned around and I can't say

357
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:39.470
what I said to the guy.
Um,

358
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.880
but I made it clear to him that I wasn't gay and I'll never forget,

359
00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:46.150
he just like put his hands up and was like backing away.

360
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.650
I remember when he put his hands up like,
dude at these fucking guns.

361
00:22:49.651 --> 00:22:53.790
And I was just like,
you know,
I don't know what this guy's thinking right now,

362
00:22:53.791 --> 00:22:55.380
but if he wanted to do something,

363
00:22:55.381 --> 00:22:59.880
I don't know if there's anything I could do about it.
I'll never forget is,

364
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.560
is big hairy gay arms just coming out?
Oh,
I'm sorry.

365
00:23:04.561 --> 00:23:08.040
I just fuck no,
you didn't even talk like that.

366
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.570
I'm doing like the hacky gave voice.

367
00:23:09.571 --> 00:23:13.140
He had just like a regular dude voice and um,

368
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.350
oh,
do I get a zillion of those fucking zillion of those fucking stories if we're

369
00:23:18.351 --> 00:23:22.250
talking sexual misconduct here and um,
and you know,

370
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:27.430
it's funny is the reason I stopped going out after my shows wasn't all of those

371
00:23:28.701 --> 00:23:33.701
fucking witches of Eastwick drunk bitches coming up to me doing God knows what,

372
00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.900
right.
Just crossing all kinds of fucking lines.

373
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.360
Like literally like you're a cartoon character.

374
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:45.650
What made me finally stop was that time that guy went to take the camera to take

375
00:23:45.651 --> 00:23:50.370
the picture of his girlfriend or wife and a loaded nine millimeter fell on

376
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.033
fucking proud.

377
00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:53.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

378
00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.280
<v 3>And it was right on the ground and I should have kicked it away.
You know,</v>

379
00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:01.450
all the episodes is staff eight Hutch.
I watched,
I didn't,
I just froze.

380
00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.420
I pointed at the gun,
I went,
Dude,
what the fuck?

381
00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.870
And I let them bend down and pick it up.
And I just stood there.

382
00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:13.020
I've never felt more white in my life,
you know what I mean?

383
00:24:13.021 --> 00:24:17.940
Just classic Culdesac like a,
Hey Frank d,
I believe you dropped your pistol.

384
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:23.040
Thanks.
Bell blows my fucking brains out.
Oh,

385
00:24:23.041 --> 00:24:27.600
you hear that?
That's my alarm.
I get up a little early.
So anyways,

386
00:24:27.601 --> 00:24:28.241
people,
uh,

387
00:24:28.241 --> 00:24:32.510
I think it's a great thing that all of this stuff is coming out because there's

388
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.940
no way that women should have to be tolerating this.

389
00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:37.530
They've tolerated it way too long.

390
00:24:37.531 --> 00:24:41.010
But can we stop short here of like,

391
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.410
um,
then trying to literally destroy everybody around the fucking person.

392
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:49.230
<v 0>MMM.</v>

393
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.980
<v 3>Over social media and no burden of proof whatsoever.</v>

394
00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.750
These are like real people that should going after,
okay.
You know,

395
00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.470
these people that are around these people that have done horrible things.

396
00:25:02.471 --> 00:25:06.700
They have wives,
they have kids,
they have families,
they have mortgages,
you know,

397
00:25:06.701 --> 00:25:09.850
and just to just fucking,
just Willy Nilly,
oh,

398
00:25:09.851 --> 00:25:11.920
somebody just said this on Twitter.

399
00:25:11.921 --> 00:25:16.921
It has to be true and just pile on and blow on the ashes and try to turn it into

400
00:25:17.441 --> 00:25:19.150
fuck a fucking inferno.

401
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:21.673
<v 0>MMM.</v>

402
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.030
<v 3>It's is also not right.</v>

403
00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.473
<v 0>Okay.</v>

404
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:29.621
<v 3>And,
uh,</v>

405
00:25:29.621 --> 00:25:33.130
I feel really bad for my manager and what the hell he's going through right now.

406
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.060
I really do.

407
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:36.643
<v 0>MMM.</v>

408
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.880
<v 3>And I'm not going to be one of these fucking people and I hate how this,</v>

409
00:25:38.881 --> 00:25:42.030
this whole fucking day.
And it don't say anything,
man.
It's not worth it.

410
00:25:42.031 --> 00:25:42.720
Don't say things.

411
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.780
So I'm just going to lead this guy who's been a friend to me for fucking 11

412
00:25:45.781 --> 00:25:48.780
years,
guided me through my career,
my career,

413
00:25:48.781 --> 00:25:52.920
went through the fucking stratosphere with this guy.
I'm just going to leave.

414
00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.980
I'm twisting in the wind.
Go Fuck Yourself.
They'd,
Becky's a great guy.

415
00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:58.563
<v 0>MMM.</v>

416
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.950
<v 3>Anyways,
plowing ahead.
What do we got here?
Uh,
but Buh,</v>

417
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.520
Buh,
Buh,
Buh Buh.
Let's read a little bit.
Uh,
no,
I,
you know what I missed,

418
00:26:08.521 --> 00:26:09.600
I missed the,
uh,

419
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.300
I missed the Formula One race in it sounded like it was amazing evidence.

420
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.270
I don't know how Lewis Hamilton ended up,

421
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:17.723
<v 0>uh,</v>

422
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.500
<v 3>starting in last place,
but he worked his way all the way up to first,</v>

423
00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:26.360
which I have never seen somebody must've crashed
because,
uh,

424
00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.930
I dunno the way Max for staffing was running during the last race.

425
00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:33.020
Once somebody gets out in front of,
you know,

426
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.370
when they're driving through the clean air,

427
00:26:34.371 --> 00:26:36.920
there was that little thing I know about aerodynamics and racing.

428
00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:38.330
No one can never catch himself.

429
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.010
They must've had a brilliant strategy plus like slash somebody else that was

430
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:48.030
plush plus and slash plash.
Um,

431
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.030
somebody's car must have broken down or uh,

432
00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:54.720
they must've been an accident or something.
I have no idea.
But,
uh,

433
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:57.720
can somebody say,
I know you guys have sent me this link before.

434
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:02.610
Can somebody try and find a,
or send me the link to where,
um,

435
00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.230
where I can rewatch the races.
Um,

436
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.590
the replay of Brazil's a grant.
What did you see?

437
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:13.890
Fucking the Mercedes Benz team got robbed at gunpoint.

438
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.860
Lewis Hamilton wasn't there and,

439
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.510
but he's quote was basically this happens every time we come down here.

440
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.430
How bad is that for tourism in Brazil?
You know what I mean?

441
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.920
Every time we come down here,
the Illuminati sport gets fucking robbed.

442
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.970
Can we do something about security?
Um,

443
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:44.790
you know,
thank God.
Like,
you know,
I,
if I was like the president of Brazil,

444
00:27:44.791 --> 00:27:47.910
I actually wouldn't be too nervous because Brazil has arguably the most

445
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:51.060
beautiful women in the world down there.
You know what I mean?

446
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:55.440
And that will keep people coming despite the fact that even the Mercedes Benz

447
00:27:55.441 --> 00:28:00.441
Formula One team gets robbed at gunpoint and they weren't there on vacation.

448
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.400
They came down there with the entire sport and somebody still finally got

449
00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:10.070
through.
I guess when you got a pistol,
you don't really need a laminate.
The,

450
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.800
uh,
can we see your credentials?
Yeah,
yeah.
Right here,
buddy.
Okay.

451
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.430
Lewis Hamilton saw over there and I believe he's still has his diamond earring

452
00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:21.720
it have at it.
Um,
all right,
let's read a,

453
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.400
let's read some,
uh,
some advertising here for this week.
Saucy.

454
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.150
Everybody thought the,
um,

455
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:31.440
everyone at some point has which wish they could have just have a beer,

456
00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:35.820
wine or liquor delivered while someone finally decided to do something about it.

457
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:40.280
Next,
please mention all the talking points below.
Introducing Southie.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.870
Low bag moto to beyond the ego.

478
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.090
Beyond the why did you lick my neck to,

479
00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:57.550
to the beyond days me on days.
But I'm a get part of,
I'm a guy.

480
00:29:57.551 --> 00:30:01.480
So what the heck does a fucking count if you have a deck?

481
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.930
So if you grabbed my junk really quick,
you're not going to jail in your,

482
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:12.610

Bah,
Bah Bah Bah booboo.
All right,

483
00:30:12.611 --> 00:30:14.860
let me tell you about me undies.
The only underwear,

484
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.930
this is the only one to wear that makes for an amazing gift.
Uh,

485
00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.490
feel free to improvise.
Um,

486
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.060
Jesus Christ a soft,
that's what they just wrote there.

487
00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:26.910
Talk about why you love me undies.

488
00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.350
You know I love me on these cause I love singing this song.

489
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.820
That's why plus I evidently,
they're also so soft,

490
00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.060
flexible waistband,
three times softer than cotton.

491
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.950
Cotton just takes a beating during these,
these,
these fucking,
you know,

492
00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.010
these reeds,
they're always getting trashed.

493
00:30:45.011 --> 00:30:47.410
I'm waiting for them to have like an answer song.
You know,

494
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.590
on naturally sustainable sourced fiber.

495
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.680
Mandy's has made me undies made underwear.

496
00:30:53.681 --> 00:30:57.420
The perfect gift that everyone is going to love you for.

497
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:02.440
It's a great stocking stuffer.
It's a Goddamn holiday miracle this year.

498
00:31:02.441 --> 00:31:03.430

502
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.750
Go to me undies.com/ [inaudible] that's [inaudible] dot com slash burr.

503
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:20.800
All right,
dollar shave club.
Um,

504
00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:25.720
as soon as I heard dollar shave club had stuff other than their razors,

505
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:30.130
I was sold evidently.
Why do they always try to write what I'm thinking?

506
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.840
All right.
I actually think that they're really smart.
Like why stop there?

507
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.240
They get it.
Guys want to shit,

508
00:31:37.241 --> 00:31:39.520
shower and shave and they're giving them everything to do it,

509
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:43.420
but with it right at the store there are too many options and you can't tell the

510
00:31:43.421 --> 00:31:46.630
difference between any of them.
Then if you have any questions,

511
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:50.650
the clerk usually doesn't know the difference either or can't really help you.

512
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:54.040
Since they are not experts on products just like their razors,

513
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:58.840
everything is super high quality and left me looking and feeling amazing

514
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:03.040
evidently from premium ingredients to sophisticated fence,

515
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.850
sophisticated sense.

516
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.840
You know like before you put it on everybody thinks you're a moron and all of a

517
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:15.400
sudden you put on their fucking body spray though.
Did you go to Grad School?

518
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:20.850
Dollar Shave Club is changing the game status set to new members for only $5 to

519
00:32:21.761 --> 00:32:23.440
start a set features there.
Ix,

520
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.500
executive razor and three trial size versions of their most popular products

521
00:32:28.721 --> 00:32:30.490
that help you stay fresh and clean.

522
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:35.710
And your first box you received this shave butter bodywash and one wipe

523
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.460
Jahrese but wipes.
Oh Chari uh,

524
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:44.570
you will also receive their executive razor,
which includes their premium,

525
00:32:44.571 --> 00:32:48.050
weighty handle and focus set of cartridges.
By the way,

526
00:32:48.051 --> 00:32:51.410
when you get a razor that as a weighty handle,

527
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.940
do not pull it down and drag it across your face,
okay?
You just let it,

528
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.780
you just lightly hold it and you let gravity pull it down across your face.

529
00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:02.870
That's,
that's the way you do it.
All right.
Trust me,
if you do it the other way,

530
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.720
you're going to cut your face if you do it the way I just said,

531
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:08.810
you're going to get the smoothest shave you have and your life after the first

532

it's flexible,

551
00:34:16.551 --> 00:34:18.890
Just like that cool chick up the street that doesn't want to be in a

552
00:34:18.891 --> 00:34:19.724
relationship.

553
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:24.470
I use stamps.com because anytime I send out my fucking posters,
you know,

554
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.820
and I want to go out there and be a,

555
00:34:27.821 --> 00:34:31.550
I have some sexual misconduct with some women who are far too old to be acting

556
00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:33.770
in that way.
I send them out

557
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.500
through stamps.com dude,

558
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:42.380
I've actually been telling his story of by the letter of the law is something

559
00:34:42.381 --> 00:34:46.820
that happened to me last year,
which was sexual assault,
which was by a woman,

560
00:34:46.910 --> 00:34:50.840
but it's a lady,
so no one gives a shit.

microphone@thetopofthehomepageandtypeinbirthatstamps.com stamps.com never go to

570
00:35:29.571 --> 00:35:33.020
the post office again.
All right,
what are we up to here?
All right,
35 minutes.

571
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.980
All right.
So the f one of the other two reasons why I'm here in New York.
Okay.

572
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.010
Reasons I

573
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.720
<v 1>did the west side comedy club,
Bam.</v>

574
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.730
A on Saturday night I did a Michael J.

575
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:49.410
Fox is charity.
The uh,

576
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:52.620
the Fox Foundation.
I did a benefit for them.

577
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:57.390
One of the coolest gigs I've ever got to do in my life.
I,
uh,

578
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.960
I show up,
right?
First of all,
it's Michael J.
Fox,
right?

579
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.250
I mean that guy's comedic timing.
You know,

580
00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:09.150
like when they say somebody has like a perfect pitch when they go to sing or

581
00:36:09.151 --> 00:36:10.770
whatever.
I always felt like,
you know,

582
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:15.030
grew up watching him on family ties and of course all the back to the future

583
00:36:15.031 --> 00:36:19.710
movies.
Um,
and I just piss,
timing was just like,

584
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:23.220
was impeccable.
Right?
And it makes it really,
really easy.

585
00:36:23.221 --> 00:36:27.400
But just as a fan of comedy and everything,
I always loved the guy.
So I,

586
00:36:27.401 --> 00:36:30.870
I realized I was going to get to meet him and I show up to the Gig and I'm

587
00:36:30.871 --> 00:36:33.540
always nervous whenever I have to do a benefit cause it's,
you know,

588
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:36.420
it's a benefit.
People are going to be in this,
you know,

589
00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:41.880
they're going to be in a certain mindset or it's just like,
you know,

590
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.830
wow,
I'm really lucky that you know,
I'm healthy,
I have my family,
blah blah,
blah,

591
00:36:46.831 --> 00:36:48.180
blah,
blah,
and other,

592
00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:51.360
these other people are going through this really difficult thing.
These are,

593
00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:55.440
there's a sense of like guilt that you feel,
um,

594
00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:56.850
just all of that type.

595
00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:00.900
It just puts the crowd in a certain mood where then all of a sudden they go from

596
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:04.320
laughing to everything that you say is just like,
ah,

597
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:07.910
<v 4>oh Bo,</v>

598
00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.790
<v 1>you know,
those are the sounds I usually here at benefits.
So I was,</v>

599
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.510
I'm always a little apprehensive and in my head I'm sitting there going like,

600
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.950
alright,
how can I navigate this situation?

601
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.720
Cause there's what I want to talk about.

602
00:37:21.721 --> 00:37:24.990
And then there's what I should talk about just to get through this.
Right?

603
00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:29.490
So I show up in the front of the first people I saw was Eugene Mirman who hadn't

604
00:37:29.491 --> 00:37:32.790
seen in awhile and I was so relieved to see another comedian.
I was just like,
oh,

605
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.660
thank God.
So we both would just sort of laugh and talking about how,
all right,

606
00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:41.010
it's a benefit.
How is this?
What's going to happen?

607
00:37:41.011 --> 00:37:44.850
How is this one gonna go down?
Hopefully this is going to be good.

608
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.140
And as I was talking to him,

609
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:49.740
I heard this amazing band playing in the background was like,
it sounded so good.

610
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.830
I'm like,
is that live?
That's unreal.
But we were back in the green room.

611
00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:54.240
I was like,
I got to check them out and raise.

612
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:58.980
I went to go out this like guy comes walking by and goes,

613
00:37:58.981 --> 00:38:01.980
hey bill burr.
I don't.
He was like,
ah,
you know,
ah,
you know,

614
00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:05.700
I've seen your stuff man.
You funny.
And I said,
oh,
thanks a lot.
I appreciate it.

615
00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:09.120
I go,
look at you,
you're addressed all sharp.
I'm like,
are you going up tonight?

616
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.910
He goes,
yeah.
I go,
what do you,
what do you do?
You're a comedian.
Egos die.

617
00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:17.250
Cause I play a little guitar,
you know,
I love musicians.
I'm like,
Holy Shit Man.

618
00:38:17.251 --> 00:38:19.080
You play in a band.
That's fucking great.
Right?

619
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.600
It turned out that guy was Brad Paisley.

620
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.160
I'm old.
I don't know who the kids are.
Right.
I have no fucking idea.

621
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.360
He went on in the end and was one of the greatest entertainers I've seen in a

622
00:38:33.361 --> 00:38:38.350
long fucking time.
APPS.
He goes,
I play a little guitar,
right?
Shreds.

623
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.310
Absolutely shreds on guitar.
Amazing voice.

624
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:46.450
I said to him after,
cause I felt like an asshole that I didn't know who he was,

625
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.710
but I'm also,
I'm old.
You know what I mean?
We 50 next year,
right?
I loved,

626
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.090
and I'm loving turning 50.
Now.
This is when you start to have excuses.
I'm 50,

627
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:58.040
I don't know things.
Um,
I said to him,
I seen you,

628
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:02.200
I love about you country guys.
All you guys get can play.
You know,

629
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:04.550
I'm not into all the country music,
but they can,

630
00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:08.590
they can fucking play and they can sing.
And it reminds me of hair metal.

631
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.810
As much as people trashed me for listening to that,

632
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.370
those guys could play and they could sing.
They could,
they could do it live.

633
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:20.260
We'll do it lot.
Fuck it.
Right?
So anyways,
I'm hearing all this band.

634
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:25.310
So I,
uh,
I go,
I gotta go check these guys out.
Right.

635
00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.940
I thought the third song or heard.
So I go to walk out there

636
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:30.990
to see the,
um,

637
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.110
to see the band playing and I looked at it and I'm looking at the drummer,

638
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.510
this is giant like,
you know,

639
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:41.470
banquet hall room and I'm just looking at the drummer and I just fucking staring

640
00:39:41.471 --> 00:39:43.900
at him for like five seconds of disbelief.

641
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.620
And I look at the woman next to me who was working for the foundation.

642
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:52.600
I was like,
is that Steve Jordan?
She goes,
yeah.
He's like really good.
I'm like,

643
00:39:52.601 --> 00:39:55.480
really good.
He's one of the greatest fucking drummers of all time.

644
00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:00.880
This is like a bucket list for me to ever see this guy play live.
I can't,

645
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:04.470
I couldn't believe it.
My jaw was on the ground.
Like you gotta understand like I,

646
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.480
I've been listening to Steve Jordan since like,

647
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:13.060
I guess when I first started watching Letterman and I didn't even realize at

648
00:40:13.061 --> 00:40:15.190
that point that he played on those blues brothers albums.

649
00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:16.031
Then I discovered those,

650
00:40:16.031 --> 00:40:18.670
I even bought the second blues brothers album made in America.

651
00:40:18.671 --> 00:40:21.250
And then nobody bought.
I have all of that shit.

652
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:23.500
All of his Keith Richards expensive.
Why?
No Shit.

653
00:40:23.501 --> 00:40:27.640
I watched him on the leg with the Letterman band.
Um,
I go on youtube,

654
00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:29.830
there's a fusion album that he put out

655
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.580
the fuck was the name of that band that you can't find.

656
00:40:33.581 --> 00:40:37.660
I can't find the album anywhere where he's really young.

657
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:44.170
Um,
plan on,
on that one a way busier than he,
he plays on a lot of other stuff,

658
00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.990
right through all the John Mayer stuff.
And I was always thinking,
okay,

659
00:40:46.991 --> 00:40:51.100
when John Mayer comes to town with his trio,
I'm definitely gonna go see that.

660
00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:53.980
And I'll finally get to see Steve Jordan playing live,
you know,

661
00:40:53.981 --> 00:40:57.960
switching out the snares and all of that,
that whole,
all that hope.

662
00:40:57.961 --> 00:41:00.220
That's his whole thing that he does that.
It's just so incredible.

663
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.530
But every time John Mayor would come to la,

664
00:41:02.531 --> 00:41:04.510
I would always be on the road and I'd always miss it.

665
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:09.670
So I actually got to see him play.
And,
um,
so anyways,

666
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:14.530
I'm sitting there and at the banquet thing and I meet Michael J.

667
00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.570
Fox and he's just like the nicest guy ever.
Him and his wife,

668
00:41:16.571 --> 00:41:20.770
just a couple of sweethearts,
you know,
just one of those amazing couples too,

669
00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:23.800
you know,
both good looking people and then they,
they,
they formed,

670
00:41:23.801 --> 00:41:28.780
when they get together they form an even more amazing person,
you know,
and I'm,

671
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.890
I'm sitting there and like,
I'm literally nervous.
Like I'm a brand new.

672
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.100
Whenever I get,
whenever I do benefits,
I get like that nervous cause like I've,

673
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:41.940
I've had some that have not gone well.
I've done some Christmas parties.

674
00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:46.580
The reason why I don't do Christmas parties,
I don't do private gigs,

675
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:47.841
you know,

676
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:52.841
which are basically rich people or rich companies or something,

677
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.370
uh,

678
00:41:55.370 --> 00:42:00.370
get to together and they will literally hire anyone from like fucking you too,

679
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.500
all the way down to some no name comic.

680
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:07.190
Like I was back when I used to do those fucking things and you would go up there

681
00:42:07.191 --> 00:42:11.900
and nobody would know that there was a show and the Dick omic bless the one I

682
00:42:11.901 --> 00:42:15.500
did.
Yeah.
Like they had me go up.

683
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.800
It was in like a restaurant in these people had rented out the restaurant and

684
00:42:18.801 --> 00:42:23.000
everybody was eating and talking and I went up there and I was,

685
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.900
no one was listening and I got defensive.

686
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:29.510
So my already angry material back then.

687
00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.260
It was coming off even angrier and people just literally stopped eating or just

688
00:42:33.261 --> 00:42:37.520
sort of staring down at their plates.
And um,

689
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:43.360
I tried every trick that I knew in the book to turn it around and I couldn't do

690
00:42:43.361 --> 00:42:48.040
it and I just fucking bombed.
I ruined their dinner.
I ruined,

691
00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.390
they're not at least that part of it.

692
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:53.660
And I just walked out of there with my agent at the time

693
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.990
and God bless him,

694
00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:02.050
he had to listen to me walk 12 blocks with them with absolutely absolute

695
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.460
Tourette's,
just going like,

696
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:08.120
I am never fucking doing one of those fucking things again.

697
00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:13.400
Who the fuck bring somebody up when everybody's fucking everyday like I did
that.

698
00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:15.321
I was going,

699
00:43:15.321 --> 00:43:18.980
Casey case him and I was supposed to go on and talk about a fuck a dog die in,

700
00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:23.300
right.
I went into that mode,
you know,
but by the end,

701
00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:27.800
after 12 blocks,
I,
by the end of it,
we were both laughing and I was just like,

702
00:43:27.801 --> 00:43:31.160
should we give them their money back?
You know,
that was like,
fuck,
I feel bad,

703
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:34.610
but this is the real reason why I was flipping out.
You know,
I was embarrassed.

704
00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.780
And then I also felt like I stole money cause I just wasn't,

705
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.730
I wasn't the guy for that Gig.

706
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:45.950
It should have been like somebody like a who was happy with themselves.

707
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.720
All right.
So anyways,
let's get on with the,
uh,
not off.

708
00:43:53.721 --> 00:43:55.670
I'll finish telling the story.
So anyways,
uh,

709
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.980
fortunately the great Dennis leary was,

710
00:43:57.981 --> 00:44:02.981
was hosting this event and he went up and immediately turns it into a comedy

711
00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:08.420
show,
you know,
he was up there doing what he does and he dropped,
you know,

712
00:44:08.421 --> 00:44:11.510
a couple of f bombs.
And then with every joke he told,

713
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:16.130
I got more and more and more and more relaxed.
And I was like,
ah,
thank God.

714
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.280
And then,
uh,
I went up on stage and I just,

715
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.360
I just fucking went off and,
uh,

716
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:24.940
<v 2>yeah,</v>

717
00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:27.600
<v 1>told all these.
I just,
I,
I dunno,
I,</v>

718
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:31.770
I did all those stories telling all those fucking stories of all shit that women

719
00:44:31.771 --> 00:44:32.520
have done to me.

720
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.760
And at first people didn't want to laugh and then they just started laughing

721
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.520
cause you know,
sexual misconduct,
like I said to a guy,
I'm,
I'm,

722
00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:42.850
and I'm agreeing with this.
It's kind of funny.
It's not right,
but it is,

723
00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.713
it's funny.

724
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:46.753
<v 0>MMM.</v>

725
00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.430
<v 1>And at first they were like,
what the fuck?</v>

726
00:44:49.431 --> 00:44:52.880
And then they just sort of went with it and then all the rest of my shit just

727
00:44:52.881 --> 00:44:53.510
flowed.

728
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:57.500
And I ended up having one of my favorite sets I've had in such a long time.

729
00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.290
And then in the end I got to watch,
uh,

730
00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.510
this new great musician that I did,

731
00:45:04.511 --> 00:45:08.410
wasn't aware of Brad Paisley playing with Steve Jordan's band.

732
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.250
And um,
and then in the end they brought Michael J.

733
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.960
Fox out and they all played Johnny be good.
I mean,
it was just,
it was,
I was,

734
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:20.940
I was just standing there like going,
how to fuck is this?
My life was amazing.

735
00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.540
Um,
then I just end up having,

736
00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.700
then it just turned out it was also the New York comedy festival.

737
00:45:26.701 --> 00:45:27.890
So all these guys were in town.

738
00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:32.190
I got to run into brand Brian Regan who just played Carnegie Hall hanging out

739
00:45:32.191 --> 00:45:36.750
with him.
I just had like the best.
I had the best fucking night and uh,

740
00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:40.560
and the Great New York run here continues where tomorrow I'm going to be on

741
00:45:40.561 --> 00:45:43.200
inside the NFL.
I don't know what I'm going to be talking about.

742
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:47.670
God knows I haven't watched nearly as much NFL football as I would've liked this

743
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:51.990
year.
I just got so busy with the cartoon,
my little acting Gig there.
Oh,
Bill,

744
00:45:51.991 --> 00:45:56.970
what do you think?
You're an actor now.
Every once in a while I am.
Um,
all right,

745
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:58.140
my screen went dark here.

746
00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:02.490
Let's type in the fucking pass where the password.

747
00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.420
Um,
all right,
let's,
uh,
let's read some of your questions here.
All right.

748
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:13.110
Not enough women or gays at the cellar table.
Oh boy.
Here we go.
Oh,

749
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.340
read Dick Billy.
All the controversy in stand up comedy.
He goes,

750
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:20.820
I was hoping to get your take on an article I came across on Facebook called

751
00:46:20.821 --> 00:46:25.821
tear down the boys club that protected Louis C K that set witch hunt thing that

752
00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:28.860
I'm saying like we had fucking meetings every week.
All right.

753
00:46:28.861 --> 00:46:32.460
What am I going to do here is say,
hey mom,
I'm going to find are you know,

754
00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.440
and how everybody else,
the second that God,

755
00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.380
evidently everybody else on the other side,

756
00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:41.210
the second that Gawker article came out,
you know,

757
00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:45.060
immediately took a criminal justice course and just became some gum shoe and

758
00:46:45.061 --> 00:46:48.960
went out and bought a giant magnifying glass and walked around looking for
clues.

759
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:52.411
All right.

760
00:46:52.411 --> 00:46:56.340
It's written by a gay comic who figures basically going after Louis wasn't

761
00:46:56.341 --> 00:47:01.010
enough.
So he is trying to go after his peers also.
Yeah.
The which on a,

762
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:05.490
the author cries about a certain table at the comedy cellar where elite comics,

763
00:47:05.491 --> 00:47:07.900
like Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld sit.

764
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.133
<v 0>MMM.</v>

765
00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:12.700
<v 1>Like when the table came about,
by the way,</v>

766
00:47:12.701 --> 00:47:16.820
Jerry Seinfeld was still doing Seinfeld.
You know what I mean?

767
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.240
I don't know if they actually had a place called the table.

768
00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:21.970
<v 0>MMM.
When</v>

769
00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:25.180
<v 1>I first started going to the comedy cellar,
there wasn't a table.</v>

770
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.130
Comics just went upstairs and they sat all over the place and I am convinced

771
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:35.130
<v 3>that the reason why the table was started was because of Patrice,</v>

772
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:41.650
because portrays was so loud and so funny and he was just all over the upstairs.

773
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:46.270
They were trying to somehow contain him.
He was like,
Jordan,
you know,

774
00:47:46.271 --> 00:47:49.360
you're not going to stop them.
Let's just see if we can contain them.

775
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.850
So I think they just tried to get us all in,
sit,

776
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:56.950
sit it in one seated in one area so they could at least be like,
okay,

777
00:47:56.951 --> 00:48:00.580
sit down and fold your fucking hands and listen to the teacher.
Right.

778
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.660
Um,
that's how I remembered.
Anyways,
so he goes,

779
00:48:04.661 --> 00:48:09.340
he also has never even tried to perform at the co at the cellar himself.

780
00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.940
It's kind of like a fourth grader crying to the teacher because the cool kids

781
00:48:12.941 --> 00:48:17.500
won't hang out with them.
The article implies that by not speaking up about it,

782
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:21.730
the sell a comics were somehow protecting Louis even though they were just

783
00:48:21.731 --> 00:48:25.090
rumors until recently.
Also the owner of the cellar,

784
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:28.450
where are we fucking screaming at dark.
Sorry,
I'll see you on his cell.

785
00:48:28.451 --> 00:48:30.610
I had some great things to say in the comments.

786
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.480
Here's the link to the article and go fuck yourself.
Yeah,
I read it.
And um,

787
00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.820
you know,
to be honest with you,
considering this guy,
he's also a fellow comedian.

788
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:41.920
I feel bad that that was his perception.

789
00:48:41.921 --> 00:48:46.420
I feel filled yet that that was his perception of what the table was because um,

790
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:51.080
you know,
the table was like,
uh,

791
00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.460
and I didn't even know how to explain it.

792
00:48:54.461 --> 00:48:59.380
Like that was something like the level of pounding that you had to take.

793
00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:05.610
You had to go there and just basically get ripped to shreds and then what

794
00:49:07.331 --> 00:49:10.900
everybody at the table wanting to do.
And it wasn't even,

795
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.700
it wasn't doing it to just be mean.
It was just,

796
00:49:15.790 --> 00:49:19.960
I don't,
it was just this comedian thing.
So you'd sit down and like you already,

797
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:24.820
you'd sit down with like whatever you were hung up about with the itself and

798
00:49:24.821 --> 00:49:28.240
they would give another 40 things about you physically that you didn't even

799
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:32.560
notice,
that you should also be self conscious about.
However,
in the end,

800
00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:36.640
all they wanted you to do was come back at them and trash him back.

801
00:49:36.641 --> 00:49:40.930
And if you did urn regardless,
all right.

802
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.940
And there was some epic fucking

803
00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:48.100
back and forths at that table,
you know,

804
00:49:48.101 --> 00:49:50.680
and people definitely got mad sometimes,
but,
uh,

805
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:55.780
the table wasn't like what a lot of people who didn't go to it think it was like

806
00:49:55.781 --> 00:49:58.540
this big bullying thing.

807
00:49:58.541 --> 00:50:01.480
It was also this amazing thing where like,
uh,

808
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.190
I listened to Jewish people and Arab comics going at it,

809
00:50:06.191 --> 00:50:10.420
talking about the Middle East.
I'd listened to Patrice and,
uh,

810
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:15.250
you know,
Manny dwarven,
um,
their debates,

811
00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:18.100
calling Quinn was there and if I remember correctly,

812
00:50:18.101 --> 00:50:21.400
tough crowd came out of those conversations at the table.

813
00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.130
And if you watched tough crowd,

814
00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:28.460
it'd be these comedians talking about these deep issues trashing each other.

815
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:33.830
And,
um,
I always felt that the table was inclusive.

816
00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:36.920
As long as you are willing,
you had to,

817
00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:39.020
you had to fucking walk the gauntlet,

818
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:41.420
you just had to fucking do and you had to survive it.

819
00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:44.003
<v 0>MMM.</v>

820
00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.290
<v 3>And then if you did,</v>

821
00:50:46.291 --> 00:50:50.400
you actually became a better comedian because once you got in at the table,

822
00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:54.180
then there was this thing,
you could not sit at the table.
You'd come in and be,

823
00:50:54.181 --> 00:50:54.541
hey bill,

824
00:50:54.541 --> 00:50:57.090
come when they wanted you to sit the table because they wanted you to trash you.

825
00:50:57.091 --> 00:51:00.090
And then they also wanted you to trash him back.
But you know,

826
00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:04.830
I wasn't even part of the elite crew.
I wasn't funny enough.

827
00:51:04.831 --> 00:51:09.390
I just wasn't the,
like the,
the,
as far as,

828
00:51:09.391 --> 00:51:10.320
this is just my,

829
00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:15.060
my perception of it was the table was

830
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:21.060
Patrice Norton Vos,
Keith Robinson,
Collin Quinn,

831
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:26.430
a later on,
Kevin Hart,
Kevin Hart.
Right.

832
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.780
And even he was sort of like a,
just like a rookie,

833
00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:36.120
but he also made it so fast and he didn't have time to fucking stay there.
So,
um,

834
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.960
those were the,
that was like the Mount Rushmore of the table.

835
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:44.990
And when you showed up and they will all there and somebody had something on you

836
00:51:45.841 --> 00:51:48.480
like that time,
you know,
I for 24 hours set,

837
00:51:48.481 --> 00:51:52.140
I would do the stand up on a bus on the weight of a world series game to get a

838
00:51:52.141 --> 00:51:54.690
world series ticket.
And I never even ended up doing the Gig.

839
00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:58.200
I took a headlining set pounding that is still legendary.

840
00:51:58.201 --> 00:52:03.030
They told the fucking story on um,
opie and Anthony,

841
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:07.830
I believe Kevin Hart and them all told this story,
man,
I got fucking destroyed,

842
00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:13.320
destroyed.
So this guy like suggesting that it was all,
like everybody was like,

843
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:18.690
there was this team of people,
it wasn't,
it was fucking cannibalistic.

844
00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.390
All right.
Everything that they said,

845
00:52:21.391 --> 00:52:24.930
an opening Anthea was 100% true except for the fact that I did the Gig because I

846
00:52:24.931 --> 00:52:25.710
didn't do the Gig.

847
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:30.390
I actually gave the Gig to somebody else and I w with a vow of silence.

848
00:52:30.391 --> 00:52:30.751
I said,

849
00:52:30.751 --> 00:52:33.930
I will never tell anybody that you did this gig because I don't want you to go

850
00:52:33.931 --> 00:52:35.010
through what I just went through.

851
00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:37.183
<v 0>MMM.</v>

852
00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:41.230
<v 3>I think the guy who did the Gig actually might've said that he was the one who</v>

853
00:52:41.231 --> 00:52:44.050
did the Gig all these years later.
But I still am not saying shit who it was.

854
00:52:44.051 --> 00:52:44.884
So anyways,

855
00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:50.040
once you got in at the table then you would go downstairs to go do your set and

856
00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:52.720
one night they,
everybody at the table be like,

857
00:52:52.721 --> 00:52:56.050
you know what we're watching you set tonight.
And you'd be like,
Oh fuck.

858
00:52:56.051 --> 00:52:57.430
And you would go downstairs,

859
00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:02.290
you'd go on stage and the crowd couldn't see all these fucking asshole comics.

860
00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:07.630
I remember they'd be all be backlit standing in the hallway.
Patrice is big,
dumb,

861
00:53:07.631 --> 00:53:12.631
stupid head and you'd have to go up there and like just commit to your jokes as

862
00:53:13.781 --> 00:53:17.170
they will all stand in there making faces of disgust,

863
00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.510
heckling making noises.
And one time I told that joke and it went good.

864
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:24.190
And as I was telling the joke,

865
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:28.680
I had the nerve to actually try to say something in a joke and Patrice would

866
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:33.600
just go,
just do that fucking noise.
And then they would all crack up laughing.

867
00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:35.770
Then the crowd would laugh like,
what the fuck?

868
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:38.910
And get a sense of like other comics are laughing at this guy,

869
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.570
should we be laughing at him and not respect him as a human being?

870
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.230
And then you would just start bombing and never forget.

871
00:53:46.231 --> 00:53:51.231
I remember Kevin Hart went down stairs and he went up as a 20 year old comic and

872
00:53:51.331 --> 00:53:55.840
survived it and was barely affected.
I mean,

873
00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.830
I know.
And then looking at all this stuff that he's doing now,

874
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.130
like you really saw what he was made up.
It was a great thing.

875
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:05.520
The seller table is not what this person perceived it to be.

876
00:54:06.240 --> 00:54:09.660
And I feel bad that that person,
because having a fed gig guy comic,

877
00:54:09.661 --> 00:54:12.120
that would have been great.
That would've been a whole other angle.

878
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.680
It was actually a really inclusive thing.

879
00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:18.560
It's just a lot of people weren't tough enough to get through it.

880
00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:21.410
And that's the truth.
And it took me,
like I said,

881
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:26.590
like a half dozen attempts because I was not a mentally strong person back then.

882
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:31.370
And,
um,
but if you see what came out of it,
Colin Quinn's tough crowd,

883
00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.570
that was one of the most inclusive shows of all time as far as like,

884
00:54:35.571 --> 00:54:40.571
he gave almost like two and a half generations of standup comics,

885
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.750
a TV credit,
a lot of them,
their first TV credit.
Yeah.

886
00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.093
<v 0>MMM.</v>

887
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:48.680
<v 3>So I don't know.
And I'm now at,
someone's going to sit down and watch tough,</v>

888
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.140
probably who's mainly white males will blah,
blah,
blah,

889
00:54:51.141 --> 00:54:52.670
Blah and all that fucking shit.
So I don't know,

890
00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:55.760
there's no way to win this type of stuff,
but um,

891
00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:59.840
I can tell you that I don't agree with this person's perception of it,

892
00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:02.780
but I don't have any anger towards that person for writing that if that's what

893
00:55:02.781 --> 00:55:05.450
they feel,
think it was.
But,
uh,

894
00:55:05.451 --> 00:55:10.280
it's a little melodramatic burn the table down like this,

895
00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:15.620
these meetings going on and we're all sitting there trying to hold back his,

896
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:20.650
his career or whatever.
I mean I don't,
I don't fucking,

897
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.690
I'll remember as far as like Trans Comics,
I just remembered there was,

898
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:25.070
I don't know what the proper term was,

899
00:55:25.071 --> 00:55:29.390
but there was a guy who dresses like a woman and went on stage and went by the

900
00:55:29.391 --> 00:55:31.940
name.
She went by the name of Sharon needles

901
00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:37.430
and she used to go up at the Boston comedy club and she was fucking hilarious.

902
00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.760
And the last time I looked her up,
I believe she was still doing shows.

903
00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.590
I think she just got out of the standup scene.
But nobody,
I don't know.

904
00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:48.010
There's no comics
going good.

905
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.520
What the fuck is this fucking person doing here?

906
00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:56.320
Like this all comic,
Oh,
comedy is is if you're fucking funny.

907
00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:59.030
Other comics that are going to laugh and you get their respect in your in.

908
00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:01.993
<v 0>MMM.</v>

909
00:56:02.550 --> 00:56:05.660
<v 3>Uh,
you know,
everybody has a different fucking road,</v>

910
00:56:05.661 --> 00:56:09.770
but everybody's just sitting there going like,
just,
I dunno what,
what there,
it's,

911
00:56:09.771 --> 00:56:12.530
everybody's looking out their own head and it becomes,

912
00:56:12.531 --> 00:56:17.531
their experience is fact in truth in anybody else's experience is bullshit or

913
00:56:19.251 --> 00:56:23.710
something like that.
So all I'm doing here is I'm telling my of,

914
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:28.450
that's how I perceived it.
And,
um,
I just remember for the longest time,

915
00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:29.284
like we would,

916
00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:35.320
I'm a one night we fucking were outside the comedy cellar.

917
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:39.130
We trashed each other for so fucking long.
And it was so god damn funny,

918
00:56:39.131 --> 00:56:44.131
it was so late in the night that this woman in an apartment above the comedy

919
00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:48.940
cellar poured water down onto us to get us to shut the fuck up.

920
00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:57.130
And,
uh,
going back,
you know,

921
00:56:57.131 --> 00:57:00.670
like a lot of moments like that in life.
I wish I could have,
um,

922
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:06.210
I wish I could have realized how amazing that was during that time.

923
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.580
Cause that's as far as I was concerned,
that table,
this,

924
00:57:08.581 --> 00:57:12.450
this table that this guy wants to burn down.
That died.

925
00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:17.030
The table died when Manny died because,
you know,

926
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:21.270
he was the creator of it.
And,
um,

927
00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:22.351
he was the,

928
00:57:22.351 --> 00:57:27.351
one of the great conversationalists that I ever met and he was so God damn

929
00:57:27.511 --> 00:57:30.830
funny.
And,
um,

930
00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:36.790
and what I loved the bottom is he wasn't a malicious guy as much as I got,

931
00:57:36.791 --> 00:57:39.430
I used to fucking argue with that guy.
You know what I mean?
I was just,

932
00:57:39.431 --> 00:57:43.800
I was a young,
angry man and I used to argue with that guy and,

933
00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.050
and he was always the next day it was always over.

934
00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:48.970
And I actually kind of learned from him,

935
00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:54.160
I learned from him and Bobby Kelly how to squash in argument where like how

936
00:57:54.161 --> 00:57:56.620
you'd be like the next day just,
you know,

937
00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:57.970
cause I didn't grow up in a family like that.

938
00:57:57.971 --> 00:58:00.970
It was just basically you didn't talk about it and then you didn't talk for

939
00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:03.550
three days and then fucking four days later you'd say,
Hey,

940
00:58:03.551 --> 00:58:05.860
you see the cell just giving us a good,
good,
good.

941
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:09.760
And then everything was lingering.
Um,
those two people,

942
00:58:09.761 --> 00:58:14.260
I learned how to have a functional end to an argument.
So,
um,
yeah,

943
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:15.430
I dunno what that Shit's about,

944
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:18.640
but it's unfortunate that that person feels that way about it,
but you know,

945
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:23.350
everybody's entitled to their opinion.
All right.
Uh,
Patrice,
a Billy Ray,
no fun.

946
00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:28.630
Um,
after hearing you along with so many other comics,
universally laud Patrice,

947
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:31.860
I finally watched elephant in the room special.
Uh,

948
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:33.370
within minutes he had me in stitches.

949
00:58:33.371 --> 00:58:36.610
It's so easy to see why he was so revered within the comedy community.

950
00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.540
I know you hold him both as a comedian,
as a person person,

951
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:42.070
and an incredibly high regard.

952
00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:45.100
I would love to hear some of your insight into him.

953
00:58:45.101 --> 00:58:48.760
I recently heard that he was permanently banned from performing at the stand in

954
00:58:48.761 --> 00:58:52.450
New York.
What was that about?
No,
he was never banned from the stand.
The stand

955
00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:58.960
and the stand came out or opened right around when Patrice got sick.
Um,

956
00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:02.410
he wasn't banned from there anyways,

957
00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:05.680
really big fan of the show and we'd love to see come to Australia against soon.

958
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.680
Um,
yeah,
know Patrice,

959
00:59:08.681 --> 00:59:12.940
Patrice was getting banned from comedy clubs all the time.

960
00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:20.470
All the time,
but he was so fucking good.
They had to let him back in.
Uh,

961
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:24.860
it reminds of when I read this does miles Davis Book and he was talking about

962
00:59:24.861 --> 00:59:28.070
Charlie Parker and when he would party to much and pawn his horn.

963
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.420
And these clubs would kick them out.

964
00:59:29.421 --> 00:59:33.980
They'd eventually have to fucking bring them back in because he was the best and

965
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:37.520
Patrice was the best.
And you know,

966
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:41.870
as much as he would drive them nuts,
you wanted them around,

967
00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.680
you wanted them around you.
It's like the,

968
00:59:45.681 --> 00:59:48.380
like the comedy dropped by 40%,

969
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:51.200
even with all the other comics still go in there if he wasn't there.

970
00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:55.400
And just the fun.
And then they also knew that if they banned him,

971
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.100
that none of the comics were going to hang out at the clubs.

972
00:59:58.101 --> 01:00:01.230
We were all going to go to where he was.
Um,

973
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.380
yeah.
So then they would let them back into the club.

974
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:07.110
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

975
01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:09.830
<v 3>And then they created the table.
That's how I remember it.</v>

976
01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.840
That's how I thought that they,
let's,

977
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.910
we'll have them all these fucking loan it takes,

978
01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.580
just have him sit in the back at the goddamn table.

979
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.790
So then we was sitting down and it just,
you know,

980
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.100
it's just a bunch of dogs in a fucking pit.

981
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:25.160
And then that's how the trash in the trash can was already happening.

982
01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.190
I remember one night,
you know,

983
01:00:30.191 --> 01:00:33.670
after I took the pound in for fucking the bus Gig that I never even did.

984
01:00:33.671 --> 01:00:35.710
I remember when Bobby first shaved his head,

985
01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:40.060
he came in and I always respected him for this.
He came in,

986
01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:45.090
he had like a hat on and he sat down right at the fuck and the fat gay Guy Comic

987
01:00:45.461 --> 01:00:46.750
here,
listen to this story.

988
01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:50.680
He didn't shy away from the table.

989
01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.580
He fucking walked right in,
sat down,

990
01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:59.230
took his hat off and looked at everybody like,
all right,
give it to me.

991
01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:02.500
Let's say it and fucking everybody just looks like a def jam.

992
01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:05.770
Betty took his hat off and everybody does La have you?
What the fuck?

993
01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:11.280
He took this fucking pounding and everyone was getting them and he was just

994
01:01:11.411 --> 01:01:14.260
sitting there taking it laughing and all that type of stuff.

995
01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:18.160
And I actually thought he looked good with the shaved head.
Right.
And um,

996
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.910
what's his face?
Uh,
Oh,
who said it?

997
01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:24.730
I think it was SDSD finally got him with one.

998
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.860
I think she said you look like David Wells.
I think that that's what she said.

999
01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:32.630
And everybody fucking died laughing.

1000
01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.250
And Bobby literally just stood up and just walked out.

1001
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:42.380
And I remember thinking like,
you could,
I didn't know you could do that.

1002
01:01:42.381 --> 01:01:46.940
I don't know.
You can block out.
I saw Keith Robinson do that one time too.

1003
01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:49.970
We would trash in his clothes so fucking bad.

1004
01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.980
It was gay and he was trying to fight back and he was just feeling that way,

1005
01:01:54.981 --> 01:01:57.920
was going to crash over him.
He just fucking ran out the door,

1006
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.350
got in his car and drove home to Jersey.
We,

1007
01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:05.090
we kept texting him and calling him go,
and you can't do that.
You can't do that.

1008
01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:05.841
He like,
Oh yeah.

1009
01:02:05.841 --> 01:02:10.580
Well I just did stupid fucking hung up on is laughed and hung up on us.

1010
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:15.710
Um,
oh my God.

1011
01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:20.680
I remember that the fucking time Patrice,
you know,
somehow we found out he,
he,

1012
01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:22.500
he was home on a Saturday night.

1013
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.190
He just took like a night off and uh,

1014
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:30.300
Jim Norton fucking came in and said,
you know where Patrice is right now?

1015
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:35.301
He said home on a Saturday night and they all called him up and on speakerphone.

1016
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.340
Patrice just picks up.
He's like,
hello.
And Jim's like,

1017
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:41.640
what the fuck are you doing home on a Saturday night?
You don't have any gigs.

1018
01:02:41.641 --> 01:02:46.641
And Patrice just fucking roared laughing and we all over speaker phone trashed

1019
01:02:49.201 --> 01:02:50.034
him.

1020
01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:54.640
He was at home getting trashed at the table and I just remember him law.

1021
01:02:54.641 --> 01:02:56.400
He loved every fucking second of it.

1022
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:59.700
It was at the table is one of the great things ever.
So you know,

1023
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:04.650
don't listen to that guy.
All right.
I lied to my girlfriend.
Um,

1024
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:07.020
all right.
I lied to my girlfriend.
Hey Bill.

1025
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:11.400
I really could use some advice right now I'm an 18 year old male and I have been

1026
01:03:11.401 --> 01:03:12.990
with this girl for seven months now.

1027
01:03:12.991 --> 01:03:16.290
I really care about her and she makes me truly happy.

1028
01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:19.500
About a year ago I used to smoke weed and do some drugs,

1029
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.420
other drugs a lot.
Uh,
I used to smoke about three or four times a week,

1030
01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:26.160
but I quit a little under a year ago.

1031
01:03:26.161 --> 01:03:29.490
My girlfriend is really against drug use and has told me that she would leave me

1032
01:03:29.491 --> 01:03:32.400
if I ever did it again.
Well,
a couple months ago,

1033
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:34.920
me and my girl were kind of on a break,

1034
01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.080
not because we don't want to be with each other,

1035
01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:40.830
but because of some other shit going on in our lives.
All right.

1036
01:03:40.831 --> 01:03:43.650
That's pretty vague.
A while we were on this break,

1037
01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:47.250
I smoked some weed with a buddy of mine.
Um,

1038
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.490
I really regret doing so because I know how this is.

1039
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:53.040
This means a lot to her.
Um,

1040
01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:59.320
she is later asked me when was the last time I did any drugs and I just lied and

1041
01:03:59.731 --> 01:04:02.430
told her the last time was when I told her I quit.

1042
01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:06.150
I can't stop thinking about this and I feel really bad about lying to her,

1043
01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.740
but I am afraid she's going to leave me or stop trusting me if I tell her now,

1044
01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:16.110
since I had already lied about it several times in the past.
Um,

1045
01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:20.880
all right.
What do you do here?
Uh,
just do what you want to do.
All right.

1046
01:04:20.881 --> 01:04:25.380
If you can't live with it,
I would tell her,
if not,
I mean,
you fucking smoke.

1047
01:04:25.381 --> 01:04:28.720
You took a hit off a joint.
If you're not going to,

1048
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.080
she really committed and you're not going to do it again.

1049
01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:33.480
Is it really worth putting you in her through this?

1050
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.690
It's kind of hard for me to give you advice here cause I don't know what you

1051
01:04:36.691 --> 01:04:39.330
broke up for you.
I mean,
you did it while you were broken up.

1052
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.150
It's not like you went out and you bang some other woman.

1053
01:04:42.151 --> 01:04:46.020
You just went out and you just took a hit and you didn't fucking do it again.

1054
01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.480
Um,
and you know,
that's it.
But at the end of the day,
you know something,

1055
01:04:51.481 --> 01:04:55.260
if you come clean and she's still breaks up with the over that,

1056
01:04:55.261 --> 01:04:58.920
then you know what fucker she,
if she can't accept you,

1057
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.490
it's not like you went out and you started using heroin and you stole all the

1058
01:05:02.491 --> 01:05:03.990
money out of our fucking purse.

1059
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:07.290
She can't handle one hit of a joint and then you feel bad about it.

1060
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:11.010
And he can't even lie to her about it without fail and terrible and that you

1061
01:05:11.011 --> 01:05:11.850
have to tell her.

1062
01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:15.210
You tell her that the reason why you didn't tell her it's because you care about

1063
01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:17.920
her and you didn't want to lose her.
If she still leaves you after that,

1064
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:22.240
then you know she was going to find something.
Right.
Okay.

1065
01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:26.620
Jim Girl,
uh,
you know something.
I don't know if I have time to read all of these.

1066
01:05:26.621 --> 01:05:30.410
I,
I gotta I gotta fucking get out of here.
Here be okay.

1067
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.040
This is the worst thing ever.
I'm going to try to read this quickly.

1068
01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:38.080
I already read bad when I'm reading at a normal pace here.
Hey,
Billy,

1069
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.990
cue ball.
A couple of months back,
I started going to another gym,

1070
01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:44.250
a town over for a change of scenery.
Uh,

1071
01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:46.770
after a couple of weeks I've run into this tall athletic girl.

1072
01:05:46.771 --> 01:05:50.230
She didn't talk to anyone and had that,
I'm not trying to talk to anyone.

1073
01:05:50.231 --> 01:05:54.840
Look going on because of this,
me and virtually because of what?

1074
01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:58.630
Because of this and me virtually never called approaching a girl before I left

1075
01:05:58.631 --> 01:06:02.260
her alone.
Over the next few weeks.
I noticed she would be in my area a lot.

1076
01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:06.200
And when moving between exercises,
we would cross paths a lot.
Uh,

1077
01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:10.420
sounds like you're doing that fucking whatever that workout is.
Crossfit.
Well,

1078
01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.120
you've got to run down the street.
You know,
look at us,
everybody,

1079
01:06:13.121 --> 01:06:16.450
we're working out.
Hey,
look at us,

1080
01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.180
you know,

1081
01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:23.050
leaving your gym and running around and fucking seven 11 parking lot and coming

1082
01:06:23.051 --> 01:06:26.350
back we'd get it.
You're working out.
Jesus Christ.
All right.

1083
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:32.350
Over the next few weeks I noticed she would be in my area a lot and when,

1084
01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:37.390
all right,
I already said that.
Okay.
Uh,
we crossed paths.
All right.
So,

1085
01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:40.210
um,
I said fuck it.
And started talking to her.

1086
01:06:40.211 --> 01:06:43.270
We had a couple of good combos and I eventually got a number.
Look at you.

1087
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:45.310
You're in the gang.
We didn't text much,

1088
01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:48.940
which is fine because I've learned that texting should be mainly for planning

1089
01:06:48.941 --> 01:06:49.774
meetups.

1090
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:54.670
I still try to a couple of techs Convault's for some rapport since,
uh,

1091
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.870
I'd only seen it one to three times a week,
sometimes just in passing.
Now,

1092
01:06:58.871 --> 01:07:03.190
the issue is every time I've messaged her,
she randomly stops messaging.

1093
01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.410
They'll probably cause you're bugging her at that point,

1094
01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.520
no matter how good the conversation was going or she's busy.
Uh,

1095
01:07:09.521 --> 01:07:13.930
I didn't see her for a week before I left for vacation,
uh,

1096
01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:16.090
for another two weeks and no contact.

1097
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:19.600
It's been a week since I've been back and I haven't seen her in the gym.

1098
01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.700
Was marginally interested.

1099
01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:26.080
Was she marginally interested or did I not come on strong enough?

1100
01:07:26.081 --> 01:07:30.730
Should I text her again or just move on and wait til I see her again?

1101
01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:33.450
Well if you're still into or just Texas,
just say,
Hey,

1102
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:37.840
I haven't seen yet the gym and what the,
where's the harm in that,
you know,

1103
01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:39.970
this day and age,
you know,

1104
01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.800
make sure there's a lawyer there when you're doing thank you.

1105
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:46.960
Cause who knows with the,
uh,
the,
the,

1106
01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:51.940
what the next fucking thing is going to be.
Um,
yeah,

1107
01:07:51.941 --> 01:07:54.460
I would just,
I would text her and just say,
hey,
you know,
back,
you know,

1108
01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:56.560
would you like to go out?
Sometimes it gives a fuck,

1109
01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:01.890
fuck her and our cold fucking vibe.
Just say what you want to do with that.

1110
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:06.190
She wants to do it.
Go do it.
If she doesn't move on,
that's it.
Easy one.

1111
01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:11.710
All right.
But I wouldn't question yourself,
you know,
fuck all that.

1112
01:08:11.711 --> 01:08:14.650
Don't be in your head.
Um,

1113
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:18.080
don't be like John Fabro in swingers.
You know?
That's what I always think.

1114
01:08:18.081 --> 01:08:22.420
Just never get into that fucking mode.
Just,
uh,
you know,

1115
01:08:22.421 --> 01:08:26.050
it's normal to be nervous.
Both men and women when you're dating or whatever.

1116
01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.020
Men and men,
women and women,
everybody included.

1117
01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:31.283
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1118
01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.680
<v 3>Whenever you get into that,</v>

1119
01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:36.160
I would say don't ever send a text when you're in that mode.
I would sit down,

1120
01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.430
relax,
and just think,
what do I want?

1121
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:43.240
I want to go on a date with this person.
Well,
that's what you ask them.

1122
01:08:44.210 --> 01:08:44.340
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1123
01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.410
<v 3>I would love to take you out sometimes senior a minute.</v>

1124
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.020
I'd love to take you out sometime.
Right?

1125
01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:51.383
<v 0>That's it.</v>

1126
01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:55.410
<v 3>What's she going to say?
How dare you fucking ask me out?</v>

1127
01:08:55.411 --> 01:09:00.270
She's either going to say yes or no.
Okay.
And if she says no,
who gives a fuck?

1128
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:03.480
You don't have any regret you asked.
But if you don't ask,

1129
01:09:03.481 --> 01:09:04.314
then you've got to be like,
oh,

1130
01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:08.010
well you wouldn't have been all right for some gone wrong.

1131
01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:09.360
This is the last one and I'm done.

1132
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:13.550
I recently visited my friend at his big time college for his schools,

1133
01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:15.050
school rivalry weekend.

1134
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:17.593
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1135
01:09:17.670 --> 01:09:18.750
<v 3>I'm going big time.</v>

1136
01:09:18.751 --> 01:09:22.900
That's what they said when they went to Notre Dame versus a USC and they were

1137
01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.830
like big time college football.
Uh,

1138
01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:30.860
speaking of Notre Dame got a big Tam as kicking against Miami holds shit.

1139
01:09:31.221 --> 01:09:33.720
The convicts kicking the shit out of the fucking,
I like that.

1140
01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:36.800
It's still called the Catholics and not the pedophiles.
You know what I mean?

1141
01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:39.170
I mean,
not everybody at the University of Miami

1142
01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:43.480
and has gone to jail or been arrested.
Okay.

1143
01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.250
But if you're going to call them convicts,
God dammit,

1144
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:49.560
we've got to go pedophile with Notre Dame.
Right.
Um,

1145
01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:54.690
it was a great tan and his school was one.
It's school one,

1146
01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:58.870
and at the last second and at the last second.
So the atmosphere is crazy.

1147
01:09:58.871 --> 01:10:01.360
Later that night,
I attended a party at the fraternity.

1148
01:10:01.361 --> 01:10:04.480
He is a member of any wage.

1149
01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:09.550
We meet these two girls and decide to tell him we were actually real real life

1150
01:10:09.551 --> 01:10:14.410
brothers and we somehow tricked slash convinced these girls into having a

1151
01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:15.244
foursome.

1152
01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.460
How do you tell them that you're related and that they want to do it?

1153
01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:21.760
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1154
01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.390
<v 3>Tricked is a very dangerous world word to use right now,
buddy.</v>

1155
01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:27.490
<v 0>MMM.</v>

1156
01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:29.390
<v 3>All right.
We all go into this room.</v>

1157
01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:36.010
Well,
what do you mean trick?
What do you do?
Did you do the old quarter?
Hey,

1158
01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:37.480
go make a quarter disappear.
Hey,

1159
01:10:37.481 --> 01:10:41.410
where's the quarters it behind your ear hears my Dick.
Uh,

1160
01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:45.820
we all go into his room and start hooking up and since he had a large bed,

1161
01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.780
we had girls on it and we're banging them side by side.

1162
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:54.580
Doggy style after what seemed like a while,
but was probably six minutes.

1163
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:57.400
I unfortunately released my champagne of victory.

1164
01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:01.750
So now it's my buddy and both the girls in the bed and I'm just in the corner of

1165
01:11:01.751 --> 01:11:04.690
the room.
I really wanted to come back in there.

1166
01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:05.920
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1167
01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.530
<v 3>But I knew it would take a little bit of time to get back up.</v>

1168
01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:13.000
So I decided to look for something to use to start jerking off.
Oh.

1169
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.090
I found out were turned out to be my buddy's contexts solution and applied it

1170
01:11:18.091 --> 01:11:21.600
and started tugging.
After a few minutes Olympic tugging,

1171
01:11:21.601 --> 01:11:25.490
I started to feel movement and thought I'd be back in the game soon.

1172
01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.550
You're like an injured player that went out for a play.
At that moment,

1173
01:11:32.551 --> 01:11:33.700
my buddy and the two chicks,

1174
01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:37.200
so he was nailing turn around and face me and catch me jerking off.

1175
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:40.800
From their perspective,
they think of jerking off to them.
Oh,

1176
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:44.220
now when in reality I'm jerking it so I can bang the second girl.

1177
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:46.500
One girl sort of freaks out.

1178
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:51.390
I love that she freaks out if they have to fucking thinking that she's having a

1179
01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:53.370
fucking force him with two brothers.

1180
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.900
One girl sort of freaks out of my buddy's screams,
what the hell are you doing?

1181
01:11:59.380 --> 01:11:59.890
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1182
01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:01.600
<v 3>At that point I didn't know what to say,</v>

1183
01:12:01.601 --> 01:12:04.750
so I ran out of the room naked and just stood outside the door until they

1184
01:12:04.751 --> 01:12:07.270
finished.
Eventually the girls left and my buddies,

1185
01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:11.170
let my buddy let me back into the room where he proceeded to ask why I was

1186
01:12:11.171 --> 01:12:14.950
jerking off to him.
Oh No.
He goes,

1187
01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:19.450
I tried to plead my case and give rash and give a rational explanation,

1188
01:12:19.451 --> 01:12:22.840
but he's continuing to be persistent that I was jerking off to him and now he's

1189
01:12:22.841 --> 01:12:27.520
being extremely distant from me and has told all of our friends who have

1190
01:12:27.521 --> 01:12:31.480
constantly been berating me for jerking off while my buddy bang two chicks.

1191
01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:36.340
Do you have any advice on how I can somehow spin this story?
I mean,

1192
01:12:36.341 --> 01:12:41.110
at the end of the day I did get laid to,
um,
all right,

1193
01:12:41.111 --> 01:12:44.140
here's what's hilarious bottle at that the woman gets offended.
Like,

1194
01:12:44.141 --> 01:12:46.630
what are you doing?
It's like,
what are you doing?

1195
01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.950
You're having like a fucking force them with two people that you think are

1196
01:12:50.951 --> 01:12:54.320
related.
Uh,
and secondly,

1197
01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:56.540
I don't know how guys do that.

1198
01:12:56.541 --> 01:13:00.160
I don't know how you could bang a woman with your buddy next to you also banging

1199
01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.580
,
you know what I mean?
Like how do you block out the sound of your friend?

1200
01:13:04.581 --> 01:13:06.530
Like right next to you.
I mean,

1201
01:13:06.531 --> 01:13:10.910
do you look at each other at any point and like how do you not start fucking

1202
01:13:10.911 --> 01:13:15.530
laughing?
I don't,
I've never understood that.
Um,

1203
01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:18.350
yeah,
you probably should have gone into the bathroom.

1204
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:22.140
You probably shouldn't have been looking at them.

1205
01:13:22.710 --> 01:13:27.710
I mean do what you have here is a fucking hilarious story and I,

1206
01:13:28.531 --> 01:13:33.080
you know,
in the spirit of the table,
all right,

1207
01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:37.250
when your friends are giving you shit,
I would just laugh.

1208
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:40.610
You just have to learn to laugh at yourself and just be like,

1209
01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.150
I swear to God I was trying to get back in the fucking game.

1210
01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:49.180
Just tell the story the way you just told it to me and think that it's fucking

1211
01:13:49.251 --> 01:13:53.270
hilarious that this dude thinks she would jerking off to him.

1212
01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:57.710
I would just laugh it off.
Which is how you get out of most shit.

1213
01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.570
You know,
it's how Donald Trump became president.

1214
01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.910
He just lets probably a bad guy to bring up who's out there grabbing pussies.

1215
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:10.970
It'd be like you said all this shit about women.
No,

1216
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:13.540
didn't I said it about Rosie O'donnell.
Ah,

1217
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.840
well you said it about other women too and he's like,
yeah,
you're probably right.

1218
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.860
It ends it.
It's when you keep fighting it.
I would just fucking laugh it off.

1219
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.520
I know it's tough at your age,
but listen dude,

1220
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:27.670
if you have it in you to fucking fuck a woman right next to your friend,

1221
01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:33.040
if you have the focus to do that,
I think he can get through this.
Um,

1222
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:38.380
but two,
you got it.
One hell of a goddamn story.
That's a great story.
Um,

1223
01:14:39.610 --> 01:14:41.680
so anyways,
all right,
that's it.
I have to,

1224
01:14:41.681 --> 01:14:45.470
I've got to get on with my day here and thanks to everybody,
uh,

1225
01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.020
who's listened to the podcast.
Thanks to the Fox Foundation,

1226
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:51.870

1227
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:55.660
Please go out to the comedy club and thanks to everybody on front runner,

1228
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:58.750

I had such a great time.
Oh,

1229
01:14:58.751 --> 01:15:03.010
and by the way,
guess what's out daddy's home part too.
I was in part one.

1230
01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:06.360
You got part two,
I heard is even better.
Joe Barton.

1231
01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:09.610
Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend told me he went to go see.
They said,
dude,

1232
01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:14.200
I fucking laughed out loud like 25 times.
Comedians don't laugh out loud ever.

1233
01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:19.060
It's one of the,
one of the fucking,
I don't know.

1234
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:22.350
It's one of the prices you pay as a comedian.
You stop laughing.

1235
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:25.630
You just start going,
oh,
that was funny.
But you never laugh.

1236
01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.790
You never laugh again.
So definitely go check that out.
And uh,
who knows?

1237
01:15:30.791 --> 01:15:34.780
Who knows?
Maybe you'll see a familiar face in there.
All right,

1238
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.270
go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
