I would like to talk briefly about

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240
I would like to talk briefly about
 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.610
I would like to talk briefly about
depolarization on the left and the right

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620
depolarization on the left and the right
 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.049
depolarization on the left and the right
because I think there's a technical

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059
because I think there's a technical
 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.640
because I think there's a technical
problem that needs to be addressed so

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650
problem that needs to be addressed so
 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.600
problem that needs to be addressed so
here's what I've been thinking about

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610
here's what I've been thinking about
 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.300
here's what I've been thinking about
it's been obvious to me for some time

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310
it's been obvious to me for some time
 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.019
it's been obvious to me for some time
that for some reason the fundamental

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029
that for some reason the fundamental
 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.570
that for some reason the fundamental
claim of post-modernism is something

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580
claim of post-modernism is something
 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.589
claim of post-modernism is something
like an infinite number of

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599
like an infinite number of
 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.509
like an infinite number of
interpretations and no canonical

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519
interpretations and no canonical
 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.580
interpretations and no canonical
overarching narrative okay but the

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:30.590
overarching narrative okay but the
 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.350
overarching narrative okay but the
problem with that is okay now what no

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360
problem with that is okay now what no
 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.600
problem with that is okay now what no
narrative no value structure that's

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610
narrative no value structure that's
 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.250
narrative no value structure that's
canonical or overarching so what the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260
canonical or overarching so what the
 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.780
canonical or overarching so what the
hell are you gonna do with yourself how

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790
hell are you gonna do with yourself how
 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.190
hell are you gonna do with yourself how
are you gonna orient yourself in the

are you gonna orient yourself in the

are you gonna orient yourself in the
world well the post modernist have no

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420
world well the post modernist have no

world well the post modernist have no
answer to that so what happens is they

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700
answer to that so what happens is they
 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.930
answer to that so what happens is they

French intellectuals in particular just
 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.890
French intellectuals in particular just
pulled off a sleight of hand and

and like we've seen the consequence of
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.990
and like we've seen the consequence of
that it's not good it's a devolution

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
that it's not good it's a devolution
 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.420
that it's not good it's a devolution
into a kind of tribalism that's well

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430
into a kind of tribalism that's well
 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.119
into a kind of tribalism that's well
that's gonna that will that will tear us

that's gonna that will that will tear us
 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.070
that's gonna that will that will tear us
apart on the right and on the left and

on the right a guy in my in my house I
have a very large collection of

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670
have a very large collection of
 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.580
have a very large collection of
Socialist Realist paintings from the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590

former Soviet Union propaganda pieces
 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.850
former Soviet Union propaganda pieces
but also kind of harsh

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860
but also kind of harsh
 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.680
but also kind of harsh

impressionist pieces of working-class
 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.870
impressionist pieces of working-class
people and so forth and I collected them

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880
people and so forth and I collected them
 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.100
people and so forth and I collected them
for a variety of reasons

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110
for a variety of reasons
 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.880
for a variety of reasons
now you could debate about the propriety

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890
now you could debate about the propriety
 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.460
now you could debate about the propriety
of that given the murderous nough subs

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470
of that given the murderous nough subs
 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.530
of that given the murderous nough subs
and fair enough

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540
and fair enough
 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.710
and fair enough
I have my reasons but I don't have

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720
I have my reasons but I don't have
 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.780
I have my reasons but I don't have
paintings from the Nazi area era in my

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
paintings from the Nazi area era in my
 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.839
paintings from the Nazi area era in my
house and I wouldn't and that's been a

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849
house and I wouldn't and that's been a
 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.690
house and I wouldn't and that's been a
puzzlement to me because I regard the

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700
puzzlement to me because I regard the
 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.210
puzzlement to me because I regard the
Communists the totalitarian communist

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220
Communists the totalitarian communist
 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.150
Communists the totalitarian communist
regimes as just as murderous as the Nazi

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160
regimes as just as murderous as the Nazi
 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.520
regimes as just as murderous as the Nazi
regimes but there's an evil associated

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
regimes but there's an evil associated
 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.140
regimes but there's an evil associated
with the Nazi regime that seems more

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150
with the Nazi regime that seems more
 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.750
with the Nazi regime that seems more
palpable in some sense so I've been

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760
palpable in some sense so I've been
 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.670
palpable in some sense so I've been
thinking about that for a long time and

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680
thinking about that for a long time and
 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.940
thinking about that for a long time and
then I've been thinking about a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950
then I've been thinking about a
 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.150
then I've been thinking about a
corollary to that which is part of the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160
corollary to that which is part of the
 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.229
corollary to that which is part of the
problem with our current political

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239
problem with our current political
 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.930
problem with our current political
debate so on the right I think we've

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940
debate so on the right I think we've
 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.569
debate so on the right I think we've
identified markers for people who've

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579
identified markers for people who've
 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.479
identified markers for people who've
gone too far in their ideological

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489
gone too far in their ideological
 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.979
gone too far in their ideological
presuppositions and it looks to be like

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989
presuppositions and it looks to be like
 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.080
presuppositions and it looks to be like
the marker we've identified is racial

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090
the marker we've identified is racial
 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.990
the marker we've identified is racial
superiority and I think we've known that

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000
superiority and I think we've known that
 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.940

what the markers are for going too far

what the markers are for going too far
on the left and I would say that it's

inequality produces and fair enough
 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.420
inequality produces and fair enough
because inequality is a massive social

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430
because inequality is a massive social
 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.180

concerned about that politically is
 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.640
concerned about that politically is
reasonable but we do know that that

reasonable but we do know that that
 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.240
reasonable but we do know that that
concern can go too far okay so I've

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250
concern can go too far okay so I've
 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.090
concern can go too far okay so I've

that's wrong maybe it's not equity

that's wrong maybe it's not equity

that's my candidate for it but it is

that's my candidate for it but it is

that's my candidate for it but it is
definitely the case that you can go too

that's the intersectional problem right

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.150
that's the intersectional problem right

it's like well we've got race and gender
let's say well okay what about the

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:04.430
let's say well okay what about the
 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.709
let's say well okay what about the
intersection between race and gender

00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:05.719

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:07.639
that's a multiplicative intersection
 

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:09.730
that's a multiplicative intersection
right so you might start with three

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:09.740
right so you might start with three
 

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.320
right so you might start with three
racial categories and two gender

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:11.330
racial categories and two gender
 

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.999
racial categories and two gender
categories but you end up with six

00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:13.009
categories but you end up with six
 

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:15.279
categories but you end up with six
intersectional categories and then

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:15.289
intersectional categories and then
 

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:16.779
intersectional categories and then
you're just getting started how many
