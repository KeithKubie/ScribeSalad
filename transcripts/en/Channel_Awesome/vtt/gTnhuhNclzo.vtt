00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.040
to motherly agree with you while you desperately search for more attention.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.620
Motherly figure: "Mhm. Yeah. You don't say. You are so smart."

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.700
"God, you're better than me. Please, tell me more!"

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.440
"Every syllable enlightens me to how wrong I am about everything!"

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.560
*sigh* "Well, I'd love to stay and listen to more, but I've got a life to live."

"However, if you replay this video, you can tell me how much smarter you are all over again."

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.320

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.300
"So you just keep replaying this video over again. Don't stop!"

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.240
Don't stop

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.120
*short laugh* You're great!
