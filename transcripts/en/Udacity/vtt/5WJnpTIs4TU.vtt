Our next question was about external APIâ€™s

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and relying on them and the dangers and pit falls of that.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For example, for Hipmunk, you parse Amtrak's website

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and what if they redesign that, how screwed are you?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Sure. Well, itâ€™s true.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If Amtrak changes their website, our parsing of Amtrak also

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
breaks and thatâ€™s basically how it goes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Itâ€™s not really a big deal, thatâ€™s just kind the way it goes.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The harder decision you have to make there is how you want to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
actually parse the website for websites that don't have an API

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
or websites whose API is so bad, youâ€™d rather just script the HTML.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can do it by hand. I showed you some regular expression examples in the lecture.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Those work if the website isn't changing very often.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Basically whatever works--parsing HTML is really tough because HTML is often invalid

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and malformed and all those sort of issues, so basically play whatever works and--

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Yeah. &gt;&gt;And-- &gt;&gt;Just do what you can.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Yeah. Things break and then you fix on them and thatâ€™s how it goes. &gt;&gt;Okay. Great.
