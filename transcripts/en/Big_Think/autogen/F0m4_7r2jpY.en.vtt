00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.099
Radha: Often people will write me an email,
like a young person will write me an email

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.330
like, “Hey, can we get together for coffee?”

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.820
And then I won’t respond just to see if
they’ll write me again.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.880
Because there’s something in that!

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.490
Like I would write my mentors probably 20
times until I got a response.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.270
Miki Agrawal: I showed up, like a stalker.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.890
Radha Agrawal: Yeah.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.480
We find out like— this one guy I wanted
to get in touch with, I called his landline

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.580
like 20 times, he wouldn’t pick up, and
then I found out where he was speaking in

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.180
New York City and then I went there, and I
was just, like afterwards I was like, “Hey

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.180
what’s up?”

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.079
And he became the head researcher of one of
my big projects!

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:50.850
And so I think the resilience and never giving
up, persistence is something that sports has

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.129
taught us, and I think that we can all be
so sort of timid at times to continue reaching

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.129
out again.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.900
Like my best friend Max, when I first started
hanging out with him he was 22 at the time

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.350
and I was 32 – he’s our best friend.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.350
Okay.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.350
Sorry.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.860
Our best friend Max, he was 22 and we were
32, and we met him on a vacation and when

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.290
he came back to New York he would just text
me all the time he would say “Hey want to

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.290
hang out?”

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.580
And I was like, “No I don’t want to hang
out with a 22 year old kid, no thanks.”

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.560
But then he just kept texting me over and
over again and be like, “Hey I’m in the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560
neighborhood!”

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.710
Miki Agrawal: And just kept showing up—
first person at the party, last person to

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.710
leave.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.710
Radha Agrawal: Yeah.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.710
And he would show up all the time.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.650
And then finally he came to one of our parties
and we realized how smart and thoughtful and

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.620
interesting he was, and he’s now our best
friend.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.950
So I think that perseverance is something
that we aren’t often taught and it just—keep

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.950
going up.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.070
And especially as women we’re so empathetic
that in some ways our empathy becomes our

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.130
fuel for fear.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.939
Empathy becomes fuel for fear because when
we care so much about what someone else thinks

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.560
it stops us from actually wanting to step
on anyone’s toes.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.200
“I don’t want to bother them again.”

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.502
And if you just take on that attitude you’re
never going to get to where you want to go.

00:02:05.502 --> 00:02:07.579
Miki Agrawal: And the worst that happens is
rejection.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:08.769
Radha Agrawal: Yeah.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:09.769
Exactly.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.740
And so I think because, again, we had each
other, this is why I wrote a book called Belong.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.010
It’s all about finding your tribe and create
community.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.989
When you have a tribe that supports you and
that really makes you feel safe and gives

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.239
you wings, you don’t feel weird reaching
out to people because you already have friends!

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.510
You’re like, “Yeah I called this guy and
he didn’t respond, what are you going to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.510
do?”

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.739
And then Miki would be like “Call him again!”
or “Call her again!”

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.949
And so you have friends and community members
who are there to build you up when you’re

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.019
sort of down.

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.920
So I think step one in anything that you do
in life, like no matter what it is whether

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.750
it’s a business, whether it’s just anything
sort of related to something that’s difficult,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.030
is to start first with finding your tribe,
finding your community, building your people.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.030
Because when you feel a sense of belonging,
when you feel that sense of “oh my God I’m

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.030
safe I’m here,” that’s how Daybreaker
became a thing, that’s how it grew into

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.030
a half-a-million-person movement around the
world that it is today in 23 cities.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.709
Because first I spent five years building
my tribe really developing and deepening my

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.250
tribe, my community, who then when I launched
our very first Daybreaker that December 10th

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.060
first snowfall in New York City in 2013, everybody
could have slept in, they could’ve been

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.910
like “No I’m not going to that thing,”
but everyone showed up.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.570
We had 200 people who showed up to our very
first event because they were my friends and

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.470
they cared about me, and I had nurtured those
relationships.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.580
And so that’s the first baseline layer to
anything that we do in life, is first put

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.200
down your computer and go meet your friend
for that drink, go meet your friend for that

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.050
dinner, because you just can’t even imagine
how in the moments that you meet them how

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.000
much they’ll be there for you.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.690
And particularly, representing a business,
it is so deeply critical too to the have those

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.570
friends they can be like “Oh I went to this
investor and they said no to me.”

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.040
Instead of taking you into a downward spiral
your friends lift you back up again, so I

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.280
can’t even say that enough, it’s the most
important thing that we can do, is to find

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.769
your tribe and feel a sense of belonging.

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.239
Miki Agrawal: At the time and nobody wanted
to talk about periods, not a single press

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.410
wanted to talk about it.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.979
“America is not ready to talk about this
Miki,” that was what I got every single

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:10.780
day in 2013/’14, et cetera, and it was really,
really, really hard.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.359
And so in 2015 we scaled the business enough
digitally that we wanted to launch our first

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.580
out of home campaign, our first subway advertisements.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.910
And we were so excited: my team spent two
weeks sleeping under their desks designing

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.990
these incredible campaigns, and we ran up
against an issue, which was the New York City

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.320
public transit system officials basically
said that they could not publish our ads in

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.790
the subway because of the word “period.”

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.870
And they said people in the subway will be
offended by it, “it’s offensive to riders.”

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.750
And we were like, “Interesting… you said
that.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.230
And Oh No You Didn’t!”

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.730
And it was a powerful moment, that in the
rest of the world periods are so taboo, in

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.410
Nepal women are still sleeping outside because
if they sleep inside their homes on their

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.800
periods then “snakes will come eat their
dads,” literally, or the husbands.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.000
That’s literally still happening.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.280
And so the fact that in the most progressive
city in the world, New York City, we could

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.980
not put the word “period” in the subways,
was really like “wow,” it really brought

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:22.980
this sort of…

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.080
Radha Agrawal: Why like grapefruits could
be put on your breasts, like there’s so

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.830
many other sort of breast augmentation ads,
so many other sort of very sexual ads that

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.620
could be on subways, but not periods.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.620
Miki Agrawal: Yeah.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.800
It was really crazy.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.530
So there was such a double standard even used
grapefruits to represent augmented breasts

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.960
but you couldn’t use it to represent a woman’s
“part” that every single human is here

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.150
because of, that important time of the month—not
man, not one man, not one woman could be here

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.150
without that important nutrients to feed the
baby as we’re in utero.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.790
So the fact that it’s considered taboo is
crazy, and so we decided instead of just slinking

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:06.370
away and put away this idea of doing New York
City subway campaign, we were like “Fuck

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.520
it we’re going to go fight it.”

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.770
And we put out - we basically sent an email
out to all press, which when we threatened

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.870
the New York City public transit system we
were like “we’re going to go to press,”

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.790
and they were like, “Go ahead.”

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.760
And we were like “You called my bluff; I
don’t know any press.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.760
Shit.”

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.020
And so I like found two contacts in press
that knew…

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.410
Radha Agrawal: I’ll never forget this, Miki
and I were DJing that night, do you remember

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.410
that?

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.630
We were DJing a party that night some non-profit
party, whatever, and Miki was like, “Oh

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.470
my god they wrote me back!”

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.150
I’m like, “What do you mean?”

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.570
She’s was like, “I put subject line: SCANDAL.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:55.150
NEW YORK CITY SCANDAL! and sent it to all
this press and media,” and one of them wrote

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.150
her back.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.330
And I remember she was like on her phone we’re
like in the middle of a DJ set and she’s

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.440
like, “Oh holy shit someone wrote us back.”

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.370
Miki Agrawal: And it was so funny because
Forbes and Mic.com both wanted the exclusive.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.700
At the time I was like, “You both can have
the exclusive!”

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.900
And they were like, “That’s not how it
works.”

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.430
And I was like, what do you mean?!

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.060
Like, no one is paying me money, so what are
you talking, “exclusive”?

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.300
I didn’t even know, like I thought exclusive
meant they were paying money.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:26.120
So I got actually in trouble because I gave
them both the exclusive and eventually Forbes

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.110
backed down and Mic.com took the story, and
it went viral—internationally.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:35.670
And I will never ever forget the moment where
it, like the way I think about it is when

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.790
you’re in the subways like you see those
people like singing music and playing the

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:45.580
guitar and like people are throwing like change
at them, I felt like we were singing our hearts

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.520
out trying to build, you know, create this
product and I’ll never forget when I was

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:56.750
like walking down Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg
after this story went viral, and I was walking

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:00.800
down the street and I ran into this Indian
guy named Sham and his two like super trendy,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.270
cool, like, Indian nieces from India like
they’re both like—just fabulous.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.290
And Sham was like, “Oh Miki, tell my nieces
what you’re working on.”

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.800
And I was like, “It’s this period proof
underwear company called Thinx.”

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.400
And both of these women were like, “Wait
a minute.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.950
Wait a minute.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:17.510
Wait a minute.”

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.510
And I was like, “What?

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.510
What?”

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:26.080
They both pulled out of their phones and literally
they were both on separate WhatsApp text threads

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.760
with all of their girlfriends and they were
all talking about Thinx.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:36.580
And I remember that moment I was just like
I just remember like imprinting that moment,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.400
and just like—I like teared up and they’re
like “What’s going—?” and I was just

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.029
like “Wow that’s great.

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:43.029
Of course you know

00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:44.029
Thinx."

00:08:44.029 --> 00:08:48.850
No I didn’t say that I would just, like,
“Wow you know it?”

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.410
Like in my head I was trying to be cool but
actually what came out was not.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:56.500
Anyway, I was just so incredulous, and I like
will never forget that moment.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:02.220
It was like I felt like someone heard my song
and they were singing it and like they were

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:07.040
singing along, and you’re just like – And
then from that moment we just took off.
