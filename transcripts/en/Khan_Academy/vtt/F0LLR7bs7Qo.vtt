00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.310
A squirrel is running across
the road at 12 feet per second.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.920
It needs to run 9 feet
to get across the road.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.230
How long will it take the
squirrel to run 9 feet?

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.120
Round to the nearest
hundredth of a second.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.040
Fair enough.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.150
A car is 50 feet away
from the squirrel-- OK,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.480
this is a high-stakes word
problem-- driving toward it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.730
at a speed of 100
feet per second.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.880
How long will it take
the car to drive 50 feet?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.370
Round to the nearest
hundredth of a second.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.600
Will the squirrel make
it 9 feet across the road

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660
before the car gets there?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.480
So this definitely is
high stakes, at least

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.012
for the squirrel.

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:43.470
So let's answer
the first question.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.140
Let's figure out
how long will it

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.730
take the squirrel to run 9 feet.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.750
So let's think about it.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.082
So the squirrel's
got to go 9 feet,

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:02.040
and we want to figure
out how many seconds it's

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.030
going to take.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.950
So would we divide or
multiply this by 12?

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.780
Well, to think about that, you
could think about the units

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.060
where we want to get an
answer in terms of seconds.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.800
We want to figure
out time, so it'd

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.810
be great if we could multiply
this times seconds per foot.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.080
Then the feet will cancel out,
and I'll be left with seconds.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.740
Now, right over here, we're
told that the squirrel can

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.490
run at 12 feet per second,
but we want seconds per foot.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.290
So the squirrel, every second,
so they go 12 feet per second,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.426
then we could also say 1
second per every 12 feet.

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:42.550
So let's write it that way.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.299
So it's essentially
the reciprocal of this

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.600
because the units are
the reciprocal of this.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.170
So, it's 1 second
for every 12 feet.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.030
Notice, all I did is I took this
information right over here, 12

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.110
feet per second, and I wrote
it as second per foot--

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.550
12 feet for every 1 second,
1 second for every 12 feet.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.010
What's useful about this is
this will now give me the time

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.230
it takes for the
squirrel in seconds.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.400
So the feet cancel
out with the feet,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.250
and I am left with 9 times
1/12, which is 9/12 seconds.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.320
And 9/12 seconds
is the same thing

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.130
as 3/4 seconds, which is
the same thing as 0.75

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.490
seconds for the squirrel
to cross the street.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.810
Now let's think about the car.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.670
So now let's think
about the car.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.060
And it's the exact same logic.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.110
They tell us that the
car is 50 feet away.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.650
So the squirrel is trying
to cross the road like that,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.810
and the car is 50 feet
away coming in like that,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.450
and we want to figure out if
the squirrel will survive.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.090
So the car is 50 feet away.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.990
So it's 50 feet away.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.830
We want to figure out the
time it'll take to travel that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.010
50 feet.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.770
Once again, we would
want it in seconds.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.240
So we would want
seconds per feet.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.750
So we would want to multiply
by seconds per foot.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.750
They give us the speed
in feet per second, 100

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.414
feet per second.

00:03:13.414 --> 00:03:15.080
And so we just have
to realize that this

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.440
is 100 feet for every 1 second,
or 1/100 seconds per feet.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.215
This is once again
just this information,

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:27.590
but we took the
reciprocal of it,

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.173
because we don't
want feet per second,

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:30.890
we want seconds per feet.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.680
And if we do that,
that cancels with that,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.910
and we're left with
50/100 seconds.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.030
So this is 50/100
is 0.50 seconds.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.710
And so now let's answer the
question, this life and death

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.825
situation for the squirrel.

00:03:47.825 --> 00:03:51.360
Will the squirrel make
it 9 feet across the road

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.440
before the car gets there?

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.320
Well, it's going to take the
squirrel 0.75 seconds to cross,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.480
and it's going to take the
car only half a second.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.490
So the car is going to get to
where the squirrel is crossing

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.320
before the squirrel
has a chance to get

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.240
all the way across the road.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.500
So unfortunately for the
squirrel, the answer is no.
