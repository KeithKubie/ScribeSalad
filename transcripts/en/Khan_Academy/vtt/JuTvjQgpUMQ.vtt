00:00:00.177 --> 00:00:01.273
- [Voiceover] What I
wanna do in this video is

00:00:01.273 --> 00:00:04.667
give ourselves some practice,
and hopefully some intuition,

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:08.202
on multiplying a scalar times a vector.

00:00:08.202 --> 00:00:09.403
Now, what am I talking about when I say,

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:12.104
multiplying a scalar times a vector?

00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:14.539
Well, let me set up a little
two-dimensional vector here.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.228
Let's say I have the vector w,

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:20.388
and let me give it an x component.

00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:23.996
Let's say its x component is one

00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:28.295
and its y component
is, let's say it's two.

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:29.594
And I could draw it if I like.

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:30.569
Actually, that's a good idea.

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.662
It's always nice to be able
to visualize these things.

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:36.419
Let me get some coordinate axis here.

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:40.379
So, that's my x-axis,

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.295
that is my y-axis.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.241
And so, if I were to draw this vector

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:47.539
in standard form, I would
put its initial point

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:48.634
at the origin.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.094
And then its terminal point would be

00:00:50.094 --> 00:00:52.384
at the point one comma two.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.761
So its x coordinate is one,

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:57.829
its y coordinate is going to be two.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.861
So, one, two.

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:03.118
This vector is going to look like,

00:01:03.714 --> 00:01:06.131
its initial point is right here,

00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:08.894
its terminal point is going
to be right over there,

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:11.989
the vector, in standard,

00:01:12.632 --> 00:01:14.278
graphing it in standard form

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:16.007
or visualizing it in standard
form, would look like that.

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.010
Now, of course, I could
have the same vector

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.837
and I could shift it
around as long as I have

00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:21.402
the same length of the arrow

00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:23.231
and it's pointing in the same direction.

00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:26.094
But if no one tells you
otherwise, it's nice

00:01:26.094 --> 00:01:29.426
to just put its initial
point at the origin.

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.844
Now, let's multiply it by a scalar.

00:01:31.844 --> 00:01:33.339
What do we mean by a scalar?

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:34.692
Well, a vector is something that has

00:01:34.692 --> 00:01:36.773
a magnitude and a direction.

00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:38.775
A scalar is just something
that has a magnitude.

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:41.274
You could think of just the numbers

00:01:41.274 --> 00:01:43.145
that you started learning
when you were four years old,

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:45.074
those are scalars.

00:01:45.074 --> 00:01:46.943
So, for example, we could think about,

00:01:46.943 --> 00:01:50.205
what is three

00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:52.177
times w

00:01:52.177 --> 00:01:53.598
going to be?

00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:55.711
Three times w.

00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:57.337
Three is a scalar,

00:01:57.337 --> 00:01:59.572
w is a vector.

00:01:59.572 --> 00:02:02.076
Now, the convention we use
for multiplying a scalar

00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:04.983
times a vector is, you just
multiply each of the components

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:07.035
times that scalar.

00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:09.207
So this is going to be equal to,

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:13.043
we have a one and a two,
and we're gonna multiply

00:02:13.043 --> 00:02:15.684
each of those times the three.

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:17.046
Three times one,

00:02:17.046 --> 00:02:18.773
and then three times two,

00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:21.683
and so this is going to be equal to,

00:02:21.683 --> 00:02:23.551
this is going to be equal to,

00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:25.165
three times one is three,

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.765
three times two is six.

00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:30.407
And so we see the resulting vector,

00:02:31.207 --> 00:02:33.318
we could call this vector three w,

00:02:33.318 --> 00:02:35.233
it's gonna have an x component of three

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:36.879
and a y component of six.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.143
So if I were to draw it
in standard form here,

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:43.739
x component one, two, three,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.821
and then y component

00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:49.523
two, three, four,

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:52.420
five and six.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.487
And so, it's going to look like this.

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:58.303
Let me see if I can draw it reasonably.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:02.014
It's going to look like this.

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.455
And obviously, I'm hand-drawing it,

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:05.913
so it's not going to be exactly right.

00:03:05.913 --> 00:03:07.762
But it's going to look like that.

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:12.333
So this is the vector three times w.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:13.572
Now, notice what happened

00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:15.665
when I multiplied it by the scalar.

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:18.936
The direction didn't change,
but the magnitude did.

00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:20.907
And you see what the magnitude changed by.

00:03:20.907 --> 00:03:24.381
It increased by a factor of three.

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:27.307
The length of my blue arrow now

00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:31.437
is three times the length
of my magenta arrow.

00:03:31.437 --> 00:03:32.536
Let's do another example.

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:35.257
I'll use the same vector w,
since we already have it set up.

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.817
Let's multiply it times a negative scalar.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.865
Let's say, let's see what
happens if I multiply

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:41.531
negative two

00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.246
times w.

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:45.691
And I (mumbles) a positive.

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:46.871
You don't think about what this would be.

00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.301
And even, if you have
the time, graph it out.

00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:51.753
Well, we would multiply
each of our components

00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:53.499
by negative two.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.831
So it would be equal to negative two

00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:58.070
times one,

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.187
would be the x component,

00:03:59.187 --> 00:04:00.366
and then the y component would be

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:02.966
negative two times two.

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:06.136
And so, this is going to
be equal to the vector

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:09.906
negative two comma negative four.

00:04:09.906 --> 00:04:11.348
Well, let's plot that.

00:04:11.348 --> 00:04:12.914
The x component is negative two.

00:04:12.914 --> 00:04:15.414
So it's negative one, negative two.

00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:16.604
And the y component,

00:04:16.604 --> 00:04:19.529
negative one, two,

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.312
three, I'm going a little
bit off of my axes,

00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:24.528
four, so that would be
negative four there,

00:04:24.528 --> 00:04:25.929
that's negative two.

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:28.584
So it's going to look something like this.

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:32.958
It's going to look something like,

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.470
something like that.

00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:37.166
So that right over there is the vector

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:39.501
negative two w.

00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:41.370
Now let's think about what just happened.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.377
Well, because we had the negative here,

00:04:44.377 --> 00:04:47.458
it essentially flipped in
the direction by 180 degrees.

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.701
It's going in the opposite direction.

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:51.005
But one way to think about it,

00:04:51.005 --> 00:04:53.748
they kind of would still
sit on the same line.

00:04:53.748 --> 00:04:55.881
So the negative just
flipped its direction.

00:04:55.881 --> 00:04:59.355
If you consider whatever
direction this was,

00:04:59.355 --> 00:05:01.121
the magenta vector, w, was going,

00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:03.275
it's now going to go in
the opposite direction.

00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:06.202
And then it also scaled it up by two.

00:05:06.202 --> 00:05:08.415
This is twice as long,
has twice the magnitude

00:05:08.415 --> 00:05:09.614
of our original vector,

00:05:09.614 --> 00:05:11.301
and it's going in the opposite direction

00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:13.088
because of the negative sign.

00:05:13.088 --> 00:05:14.694
So hopefully this gives you
a little bit on intuition

00:05:14.694 --> 00:05:17.334
of what it means to scale a vector.

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:20.145
And literally, the word scalar,

00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:22.401
let me write it down.

00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:24.961
Scalar.

00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:26.465
That's a scalar, that's a scalar.

00:05:26.465 --> 00:05:27.968
It has the word scale in it.

00:05:27.968 --> 00:05:30.447
It's literally just scaling the vector.

00:05:30.447 --> 00:05:32.621
It is changing its magnitude.

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:34.957
It might flip it around
because of a negative sign,

00:05:34.957 --> 00:05:37.070
but it's essentially
changing its magnitude,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.205
scaling it up or down
or flipping it around

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:41.078
with a negative sign.
