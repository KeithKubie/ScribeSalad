00:00:01.595 --> 00:00:02.891
TED-Ed team here.

00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:03.999
As you know, we usually post

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:05.693
animated educator lessons,

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:07.788
but today we wanted to try something a little different,

00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:10.315
and we need your help to figure out next steps.

00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:12.059
We've recently learned that a large number

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.286
of students that use TED-Ed

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:15.480
want to know more about career options,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.311
and that they and the teachers and guidance counselors

00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:18.652
that work with them need better tools

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:20.042
to make that happen.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.279
We've been busy trying to design

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.691
an interactive series to meet those needs,

00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:25.085
and today we want to share three videos

00:00:25.085 --> 00:00:27.707
that demo how the series could work.

00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:29.473
Each video features four people

00:00:29.473 --> 00:00:30.730
with four different careers

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.501
reading questions submitted by students.

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:34.828
The answers to those questions

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:36.943
and follow-up questions can be explored

00:00:36.943 --> 00:00:40.336
choose-your-own-adventure style through annotations.

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:41.707
For the purposes of the demo,

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.646
we sourced a few questions from students

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:45.039
and recruited a few TED speakers

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.240
and other professionals to answer the questions,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.125
but those two things were done independently

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:50.050
of one another.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.311
The idea for the actual series

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:52.783
is that the next set of videos

00:00:52.783 --> 00:00:54.979
would only feature questions and people

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:57.645
suggested and voted up by you, the viewers.

00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:58.927
So, if you tell us that the next video

00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:01.145
should undoubtedly feature an arachnologist,

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:02.478
an album art creator,

00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:03.657
a particle physicist,

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:04.480
and an engineer,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.059
all giving away their trade secrets for your benefit,

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:09.525
we'll try our best to make that happen.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:11.332
We think this could be a pretty fun series,

00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:13.505
and we look forward to your feedback.

00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:14.864
Enjoy the demo!

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:19.479
Now for the story of you,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.694
the TED-Ed community,

00:01:20.694 --> 00:01:22.554
your questions about potential careers,

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:24.838
and the TED speakers and working professionals

00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:27.553
that you nominate to answer those questions.

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.398
It's an interactive show.

00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:32.327
Welcome to "Click Your Fortune".

00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:37.649
"I'm Sandra Aamodt.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.550
I'm a science writer and a neuroscientist.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.717
I've written two books about the brain

00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:44.597
for popular audiences,

00:01:44.597 --> 00:01:47.089
and I edited a scientific journal."

00:01:47.089 --> 00:01:48.661
"My name is Alessandro Centrone.

00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.472
I work for Steelcase, the leading company

00:01:51.472 --> 00:01:53.486
in office furniture manufacturing.

00:01:53.486 --> 00:01:55.992
I have a responsibility for sales and distribution."

00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:57.622
"My name is Adital Ela.

00:01:57.622 --> 00:02:00.266
I call myself a sustainability designer,

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:03.037
and I try to explore how product design

00:02:03.037 --> 00:02:05.937
can support social and environmental progress."

00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:06.983
"John Werner.

00:02:06.983 --> 00:02:09.587
Eighteen years ago, I started a network of schools

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:10.818
called Citizen Schools.

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:14.006
I lead TEDxBeaconStreet in Boston.

00:02:14.006 --> 00:02:17.301
I'm also a research scientist at the MIT Media Lab."

00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:19.895
Each professional will now draw one of your questions

00:02:19.895 --> 00:02:22.060
from the fortune cookie jar.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.355
You can choose your own path from there.

00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:34.664
to be featured in future videos.

00:02:34.664 --> 00:02:35.959
Let's see what fortunes await

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.946
this batch of volunteers.

00:02:38.484 --> 00:02:42.362
"What was a moment in time that I felt most inspired?"

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.915
"If you were to give a TED Talk,

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:46.754
or if you already have,

00:02:46.754 --> 00:02:48.820
what ideas would you present?"

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.362
"What do you look for in an applicant's CV?"

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:56.578
"Okay, what ideas are you passionate about?"

00:02:57.823 --> 00:02:59.544
You may now click any fortune

00:02:59.544 --> 00:03:00.594

00:03:00.594 --> 00:03:02.242
and a handful of follow-up questions
