I still don't like
the resolution on these images.

00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:07.008
&gt;&gt; Darn it.

00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:09.721
Yeah, a lot of people have been
commenting about how the sheep just

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.794
don't look real enough.

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:13.452
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; And didn't your investors say

00:00:13.452 --> 00:00:17.271
something about wanting you to
identify a larger target audience?

00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:19.176
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, maybe.

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:22.869
I'm starting to wonder if Bale Buddy
is going to be the destructive and

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.573
transformative app that
I originally dreamed of.

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:27.895
&gt;&gt; There might not be enough
shepherds in the Bay Area.

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:29.972
It's too small a market.

00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:34.256
Baa, hey,
don't bleat yourself up about it.

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:37.496
&gt;&gt; Ha-ha, real funny.

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:40.816
All right, well,
back to the drawing board.

00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:42.350
Let's see.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.879
I'm thinking some sort of
app maybe about like, crap.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.013
Walter, did you forget
the whiteboard markers again?

00:00:49.013 --> 00:00:52.195
&gt;&gt; I just went to the store,
you should've told me this earlier.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:56.154
Kagure had the same problem yesterday
when we needed toilet paper and WD40.

00:00:56.154 --> 00:00:58.312
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it goes both ways.

00:00:58.312 --> 00:01:02.221
I was at the store picking up these
cheesy flakes, they were on sale.

00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:04.925
And then, Walter did the same thing.

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:07.108
But you know what,
I have dinner for next week.

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:08.911
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Can't be good for your credit score.

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:10.463
&gt;&gt; Crap, I'm running out of gas money.

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:12.564
This is super inconvenient.

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:16.430
[SOUND] If only there was some
way that we could communicate,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.380
something collaborative, that would
be right there in the store with you,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.944
something like an app.

00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:24.400
Great Scott, I've got an idea.
