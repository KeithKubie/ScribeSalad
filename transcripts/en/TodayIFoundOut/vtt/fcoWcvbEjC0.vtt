00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:18.290
Ben &amp; Jerry’s was originally going to be
a bagel company.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.210
Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield ended up changing
their minds when they found out how much it

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.360
would cost to get all the needed equipment
for making bagels.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.140
Instead, in 1978, they both took a $5 correspondence
course from Pennsylvania State University

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.480
on ice cream making.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.440
They then used $12,000, $4000 of which was
borrowed, and converted an old gas station

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.429
in Burlington, Vermont into an ice cream parlor
called Ben &amp; Jerry’s Homemade.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.680
Before opening the ice cream shop, Jerry Greenfield
was a lab technician, in New York, who tried

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.010
three times to get into medical school, failing
each time.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.039
Ben Cohen attended various colleges and eventually
dropped out and settled on working as a crafts

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.579
teacher for emotionally disturbed children
in New York.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.980
In New York, Ben and his old friend from Jr.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.510
High and High school, Jerry Greenfield, shared
an apartment in Manhattan before once again

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.620
parting ways.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.299
Eventually, the two reunited and deciding
to start some sort of a food company, first

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.570
going with bagels but then settling on ice
cream.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.479
When they sought out a suitable location for
their ice cream shop, they set the criteria

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.210
that it should be some place with a very warm
climate; should be a college town; and should

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.830
be a town where there were no other ice cream
shops.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.600
In the end, they found that every college
town in a warm climate already had one or

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.109
more ice cream shops, so they threw out the
warm-requirement and settled on Burlington,

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.240
Vermont, which didn’t have an ice-cream
shop.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.049
By 1983, just five years after they first
opened their doors, Ben &amp; Jerry’s products,

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.850
at their own retail stores and sold through
various other outlets, had gross sales of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.969
around $2 million.

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.689
Just one year later, they achieved a gross
of over $4 million.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.780
One year after that, they were grossing $9
million.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.130
One year after that, in 1986, they grossed
over $20 million.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.090
In 1987, they finally broke their amazing
“doubling” streak and only grossed $32

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.090
million.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.190
The following year, their rapid growth caused
President Ronald Reagan to award the two the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.190
“U.S.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.960
Small Business Persons of the Year”.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.001
In April of 2000, a mere 22 years after Ben
&amp; Jerry’s Homemade Inc. was founded, the

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:25.350
two sold the now publicly traded company for
$326 million to the British-Dutch food company

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.350
Unilever.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.490
At the time, annual sales were just shy of
$200 million and today sits at around $240

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.850
million.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.130
Bonus Facts:
• Since their inception, Ben &amp; Jerry’s

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.280
ice cream was touted as “all natural”.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.080
However, in 2010, the company was forced to
stop labeling their ice cream and frozen yogurt

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.530
such when it was discovered by the Center
for the Science in Public Interest that corn

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.720
syrup and many other artificial ingredients
were used to make their ice cream.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.270
• Contrary to rumor, Ben and Jerry do not
appear to have ever been a couple.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.910
In fact, Jerry was dating his eventual wife
when Ben &amp; Jerry were roommates.

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.900
He also left the company for a few years to
help his future wife, Elizabeth, pursue her

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.970
Ph.D. in psychology.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.870
The rumor that Ben and Jerry are gay received
a huge boost when Ben &amp; Jerry’s came out

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.260
with the “Hubby Hubby” flavor for one
month, which featured two men getting married

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:33.990
on the cover and was in support of gay marriage
rights.
