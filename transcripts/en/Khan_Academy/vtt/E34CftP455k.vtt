00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.070
Let's do a little compare and
contrast between the dot

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.710
product and the cross product.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.670
Let me just make two vectors--
just visually draw them.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.620
And maybe if we have time,
we'll, actually figure out

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.970
some dot and cross products
with real vectors.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:47.070
Let's call the first one--
That's the angle between them.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.550
OK.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.550
So let's just go over the
definitions and then we'll

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.980
work on the intuition.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.360
And hopefully, you have a little
bit of both already.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.240
So what is a dot b?

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.000
Well first of all, that's the
exact same thing as b dot a.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.590
Order does not matter when you
take the dot product because

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.230
you end up with just a number.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.440
And that is equal to the
magnitude of a times the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:21.145
magnitude of b times cosine
of the angle between them.

00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:24.450
Let's look at the definition
of the cross product.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.810
What is a cross b?

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.615
Well first of all, that does
not equal b cross a.

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.650
It actually equals the opposite
direction, or you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.900
could view it as the negative
of b cross a.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980
Because the vector that you end
up with ends up flipped,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.510
whichever order you do it in.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.600
But a cross b, that is equal to
the magnitude of vector a

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.580
times the magnitude of vector
b-- so far, it looks a lot

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.420
like the dot product, but this
is where the diverge is--

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.690
times the sine of the
angle between them.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.030
The sine of the angle
between them.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.070
And this is where it
really diverges.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.610
When we took the dot
product, we just

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.420
ended up with a number.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.520
This is just a number.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.729
There's no direction here.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.340
This is just a scalar
quantity.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.700
But the cross product, we take
the magnitude of a times the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.250
magnitude of b, times the sine
of the angle between them, and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.600
that provides a magnitude, but
it also has a direction.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.840
And that direction is provided
by this normal vector.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.550
It's a unit vector.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.820
A unit vector gets that
little hat on it.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.470
It's a unit vector, and
what direction is it?

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.320
Well, that's defined by
the right hand rule.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.200
This is a vector.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:45.870
It's perpendicular
to both a and b.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.740
And then you might say, a and
b, the way I drew them,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.810
they're both sitting in the
plane of this video screen, or

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.200
your video screen.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.670
So in order for something to
be perpendicular to both of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.550
these, it either has to pop out
of the screen or pop into

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:00.240
the screen, right?

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.110
And when you learned about the
cross product, I said there's

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.110
two ways of showing a vector
popping out of the screen.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.430
It looks like that because
that's the tip of an arrow.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.110
And to show a vector going into
the screen, it's like

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.040
that because that is the
back of an arrow.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.980
The rear end of an arrow.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.020
So how do you know which
of these two it is?

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.350
Because both of these vectors
are perpendicular to a and b.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.480
That's where you take your right
hand and you use the

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.470
right hand rule.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.120
So you take your index finger
in the direction of a, your

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.730
middle finger in the direction
of b, and then your thumb

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.210
points in the direction of n.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:33.460
So let's do that.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.695
I'm looking at my hand.

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:40.300
It's not an easy thing to do
with your right hand, but your

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.820
right hand is going to look
something like this.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:55.820
Your index finger will go
in the direction of a.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.200
Your middle finger goes
in the direction of b.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.040
So that's my middle finger.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.610
And then my other two fingers
just do what they need to do.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.160
I like to just bend them
out of the way.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.940
So they just curl
around my hand.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.280
And then what direction
is my thumb in?

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.820
My thumb-- well, actually I drew
it at the wrong angle.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.300
My thumb is actually going
in this direction, right?

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.730
Into the page.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.830
This is the top of my hand.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.550
These are like my veins.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.450
Or, if I actually drew it
correctly, where you would see

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.690
your hand from side-- so it
would look like this.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.390
You would see your pinky.

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.760
Your palm and your pinky
would be like that.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.630
And your other finger
like this.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.460
Your middle finger would go
in the direction of b.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.900
Your index finger goes in the
direction of a, and you

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.430
wouldn't even see your thumb,
because your thumb is pointing

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.960
straight down.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.520
But I think you get the point.
a cross b, this n vector is

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.780
pointing straight down.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.630
It's a unit vector.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.750
And this provides
the magnitude.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.240
Unit vector just means it
has a magnitude of one.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.560
So the magnitudes of the cross
and the dot products seem

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.360
pretty close.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.440
They both have the magnitude
of both vectors there.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.720
Dot product, cosine theta.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.980
Cross product sine of theta.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.710
But then, the huge difference
is that sine

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.730
of theta has a direction.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.410
It is a different
vector that is

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.360
perpendicular to both of these.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.340
Now, let's get the intuition.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.830
And if you've watched the videos
on the dot and the

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.420
cross product, hopefully you
have a little intuition.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.740
But I review it because I think
it all fits together

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.230
when you see them
with each other.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.290
First, let's study a,
b cosine of theta.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.470
If you watched the dot product
video, cosine of theta, if you

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.860
took, let's say, b
cosine of theta.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.750
What is b cosine of theta?

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.930
b cosine of theta-- and you
could work it out on your own

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.690
time-- if you say cosine is
adjacent over hypotenuse, the

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.140
magnitude of b cosine theta is
actually going to be the

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.520
magnitude of, if you dropped a
perpendicular-- I'll use a

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.940
different color here-- if you
dropped a perpendicular here,

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.250
this length right here--
that's b cosine theta.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.680
Let me draw it separately.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.140
I don't want to mess up
this picture too much.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.390
So if that's b.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:40.320
If that's a-- And that's b.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.610
That's a.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:42.540
This is theta.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.236
b cosine theta, if you drop a
line perpendicular to a, this

00:06:47.236 --> 00:06:48.590
is a right angle.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.350
b cosine theta, adjacent
over hypotenuse is

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.910
equal to cosine theta.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.210
So it would be the projection
of b going in the same

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.230
direction as a.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.810
So it would be this magnitude.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.120
That is b cosine theta.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.180
So the magnitude of that vector
right there is the

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.720
magnitude of b cosine
of theta.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.910
So when you're taking the dot
product, at least the example

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.970
I just did, if you view it as
the magnitude of a times the

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.570
magnitude of b cosine theta,
you're saying what part of b

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.680
goes in the same
direction as a?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.870
And whatever that magnitude is,
let me just multiply that

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.980
times the magnitude of a.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.360
And I have the dot product.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.960
Let's take the pieces that
go the same direction and

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.590
multiply them.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.040
So how much do they
move together?

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.310
Or do they point together?

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.510
Or you could view it
the other way.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.050
You could view the dot product
as-- and I did this in the dot

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:50.510
product video-- you could view
it as a cosine of theta, b.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:51.480
Because it doesn't matter.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.990
These are all scalar quantities,
so it doesn't

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.560
matter what order you take
the multiplication in.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.270
And a cosine theta is
the same thing.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.350
It's the magnitude of the a
vector that's going in the

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:01.060
same direction of b.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.270
Or the projection of a onto b.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.620
So this vector right here is a
cosine theta; the magnitude of

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.940
a cosine theta.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.010
And they're actually
the same number.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.320
If you take how much of b goes
in the direction of a, and

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.400
multiply that with the magnitude
of a, that gives you

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.550
the same number as how much of
a goes in the direction of b,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.270
and then multiply the
two magnitudes.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.100
Now, what is a, b sine theta?

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.710
a, b, sine theta.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.299
Well if this vector right here
is a cosine theta-- and you

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.700
learned this when you learned
how to take the

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.600
components of vectors.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:43.460
This vector right here is the
magnitude of a sine theta.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:49.330
You could rewrite this as the
magnitude of a sine theta

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.750
times the magnitude of b in that
normal vector direction.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.830
So if you take a sine theta
times b, you're saying what

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.460
part of a doesn't go the
same direction as b.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.290
What part of a is completely
perpendicular to b-- has

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.390
nothing to do is b.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.100
They share nothing in common.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.930
It goes in a completely
different direction.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.340
That's a sine theta.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:12.560
And so you take the product of
this with b and then you get a

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.690
third vector.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.930
And it almost says,
how different

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.950
are these two vectors?

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.390
And it points in a different
direction.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.810
It gives you this-- sometimes
it's called a pseudo vector,

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.330
because it applies
to some concepts

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.060
that are pseudo vectors.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.750
But the most important of these
concepts is torque, when

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.970
we talk about the magnetic
field; the force of a magnetic

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.320
field on electric charge.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.600
These are all forces, or these
are all physical phenomena,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.170
where what matters isn't the
direction of the force with

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.110
another vector, it's the
direction of the force

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.630
perpendicular to
another vector.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.080
And so that's where the cross
product comes in useful.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.140
Anyway, hopefully, that gave
you a little intuition.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.280
And you could have done
it the other way.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.310
You could have written
this as b sine theta.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.800
And then you would have said
that's the component of b that

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.900
is perpendicular to a.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.665
So b sine theta actually would
have been this vector.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.330
Or let me draw it here.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:04.070
That would make more sense.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:08.210
This would be b sine theta.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.030
So you could switch orders.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.160
You could visualize
it either way.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.500
You could say this is the
magnitude of b that is

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.550
completely perpendicular to a,
multiply the two, and use the

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.000
right hand rule to get
that normal vector.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.350
And we just decided that we're
going to use the right hand

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:23.630
rule to have a common
convention.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.470
But people could have used the
left hand rule, or they might

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.730
have used it a different way.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.810
It's just a way that we have a
consistent framework, so that

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.770
when we take the cross product
we all know what direction

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.900
that normal vector
is pointing in.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.400
Anyway.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.300
In the next video I'll show you
how to actually compute

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.430
dot and cross products when
you're given them in their

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.100
component notation.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.920
See you in the next video.
