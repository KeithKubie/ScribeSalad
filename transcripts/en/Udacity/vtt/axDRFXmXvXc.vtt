00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.830
So let's do an in order versus out of order quiz. So

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.520
let's say that these are the stages of our processor. We have fetch,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.810
decode, issue instructions, then we dispatch them to execution.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.590
We have two stages of execution, so everything takes two cycles to execute,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.590
followed by a broadcast of the result. Then we have a commit stage. And

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.470
then we have a separate stage after commit in which we release the ROB entry.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.680
The question for you is to mark which of these stages are happening in program

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.090
order and which one of these are out of order in a out of order processor?
