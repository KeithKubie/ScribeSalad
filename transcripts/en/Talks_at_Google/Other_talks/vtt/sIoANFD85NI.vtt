&gt;&gt;Presenter: Welcome everyone and thanks for
coming.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.300
We’re very pleased to have Doctor Galina
Mindlin here today.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.860
Doctor Mindlin is an assistant clinical professor
of psychology at Columbia University and a

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.490
supervising attending physician in the St.
Luke’s Roosevelt Psychiatry department.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.539
She also has a PhD in neurophysiology and
neuropsychology and studied at the Moscow

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.330
Medical Academy with the developer of brain
music therapy clinical treatment.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.930
She’s the founder and exclusive provider
of this treatment in the U.S. and she recently

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.939
co authored the book, Your Playlist Can Change
Your Life which describes this therapy and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.609
other ways music can enhance your life.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.220
She’ll discuss this book here today and
be sure to pick up a copy of it in the back.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.910
Please welcome Doctor Galina Mindlin.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.910
[Applause]

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.430
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: Good afternoon.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.950
Let’s see how it’s working.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.660
I’m working right?

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.280
Yeah, so that’s cool.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.810
Thank you guys so much for having me.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.120
How are you doing today?

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.890
[Audience murmurs]
Good?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.890
Cool.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.250
So let’s see.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:12.600
Oh cool, so this is, okay so Your Playlist
Can Change Your Life, this is an attempt how

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.950
we can view something we already love and
we use every day; music.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.210
Through the lines and frontier of neuroscience
which helped us to understand how we can use

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.920
playlists more effectively.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.670
Everybody knows how it feels to put the right
music when you wake up, right?

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.470
This is very cool that if you have your playlist
ready so you can retune yourself to the day

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.460
but if you don’t you just like hear those
annoying sounds.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.979
So in the book we’re going through several
places, like we’re advising you what would

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.820
be the best wake up playlist.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.030
Of course everybody has different styles and
preferences.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.380
But what we are playing for you in this book
is a variety of different playlists and why

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.350
do we do this?

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.270
The playlists can relieve your anxiety, really
enhance your focus, can make you happy, can

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:15.530
actually get you into better shape, create
your calm and put you in the optimum mindset.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.770
So what is music?

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.790
Even we think music is a mystery by Darwin
but it still has very organized oscillation,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.340
of rhythms, harmony, resonance.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.850
This is something we should apply to the brainwaves.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.850
Music is a stimuli, you can really think about
the music as if it’s a logical stimuli which

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.310
can trigger the different states in your mindset.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:49.459
And, again, this is what I mentioned that,
interestingly enough, that music and brainwaves,

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.510
they have a lot in common.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.830
And sometimes described in technical terms,
as I mentioned amplitude, resonance, applied

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.581
to the brainwaves and the music.

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:05.610
Music expresses differently by different datas
but really can influence and enhance your

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.280
ability and language and other skills.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.670
Music can send a signal to our brain for us
like when we were born and genetic competence

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.840
was really important, really plays a big role
for us in many stages of our lives.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.720
And the calmness, which is interesting, requires
the most power, much more power than your

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.190
activated mind.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.060
So the calmness require more energy for you
to stay active.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.319
Music like a scent and usually bypass many
pathways in your brainwaves.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.660
Not all but just after the smell is the second
one and that’s not rare talent.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.800
You can practice your musical ability and
you can even expand some the areas in your

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800
brain.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.930
And, again, your brainwaves can be translated
into the music so everyone in this room has

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.090
its own music so your brain plays music and
I can tell you little bit later how you can

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.910
do it.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:14.260
So music, we perceive the music as condition
stimuli; it can influence many states and

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.680
this is just without taking medication so
you can do the same with the certain frequencies

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.419
of music as you do with the medications, stimulants
but you just don’t need to use the stimulants

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.199
or some rare type of brain stimulator.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:37.159
So we talk about, in the book, in details
how you can bring the change in your life

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.270
and put yourself in the optimal set, mindset.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.749
How you can make your mind flow cause it’s
very important that you make your mind flow

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:47.009
through the day.

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:53.110
How you can create calmness in different states
and basically how you can bring your brain

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.759
in an automatic creation of calmness when
you need it; if you talk to your boss or,

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.850
for example, you have a conflict with somebody.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.409
You can increase your alertness and intensify
the release of feel good hormones without

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.330
taking substances.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.740
And I can stimulate into the best organizational
mode.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.840
This is probably lot of us would need this
through the day.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.969
Remembering, memory, you can use the music
of certain frequencies to improve your memory.

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.860
And what is interesting that you can use the
music to enhance your creative ability to

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.749
build the bridges and to build in you your
own pathways.

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:45.279
And, again, you can tap into your own soundtracks,
if you wish, because every brain plays different

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.789
music which belongs to you and your brain
as a signature.

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.270
So this is probably one the last times we
were stress free, would you agree?

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.400
When we were in our mom’s womb and just,
you know kind of floating around.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.460
And this is the first sound, the first music,
which is engraved in our brain; those vibrations

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.009
of the placenta.

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.619
And the first beat.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.619
[Snapping]

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:11.619
It’s a heartbeat.

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:14.720
So everything starts with frequencies.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.259
This is why the musical frequencies is very
important.

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:24.819
They deeply ingrain while the brain is developing
the frequencies are changing and with the

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:33.270
first spark of life you really inhale in those
frequencies.

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.020
So while, then, you know, we’re going through
the different stage of development and even

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.490
when, you know, when you ask people, for example,
when I do the EG recording and ask people

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.969
what is the most relaxing state, just how
you can put yourself in relax mind, like what

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:55.869
you can envision; 90 percent of people would
say ocean waves.

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:03.369
So, let’s see.

00:07:03.369 --> 00:07:08.369
[Ocean waves]

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:14.589
Those are the sound, the wonderful sound of
Niagara Falls waterfall.

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:18.660
Let’s talk about a concrete example, for
example, let’s call her "Jane," this is

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.259
one of my patients, so she’s about to enter
her boss office and she’s extremely stressed

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:27.460
out and she’s always stressed out and she
comes to her boss office but she instantly

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.429
goes to her iPod and she hears waterfall.

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:35.800
And she really discovered that when she traveled
to Niagara Falls to see her Grandma several

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.800
years ago.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.610
She wasn’t actually able to understand why
it’s so hard for her here.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.459
So her Grandma, even she came to the U.S.
when she was two years old, her Grandma was

00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:50.990
sitting, hours listening to this sound of
waterfalls, the same as her mom did when she

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.939
was pregnant with her.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:59.879
So now she can really use the sound, the cues
of waterfalls, those frequencies, as her prescription

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.529
for staying calm.

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:07.340
Cause there’s this, I wanna actually share
with you the sound of my calm.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:15.009
It’s a beautiful sound of white snow in
Russia; I was born in North Pole where my

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:18.499
father is polar aviator pilot.

00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:23.649
And every time I’d go to Kindergarten, you
know, every time the sled would put with deer,

00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:31.050
so dogs, I would go to, just to this like,
kind of like white bright snow and this is

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:37.270
the sound this white bright snow it’s deeply
engrained in me so I every time I want to

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:42.740
just pursue some task, I have to take all
the sounds off even for the minute and it

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.000
works for me very well.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:53.140
Actually this is not my pair but I had a pair
in fox, station in fox.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:09:05.030
Then this is like I wanted to do some exercise
with you guys, that’s interesting, the exercise

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:11.490
I wanted to do with you also was a movie,
which was supposed to work.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:17.610
And this is something you guys try to imagine,
okay, try to use your imagination, close your

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.610
eyes.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:21.630
I know it’s hard cause we don’t have a
sound.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.630
[Laughs]

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.630
And we don’t have an image in it.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:29.280
But we have so much brain power in our head
so we can easily put ourself in this relaxed

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.500
state.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.830
And really try to envision the ocean waves
and try to envision those nice frequencies.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:41.750
They actually would match your alpha wave
which is from 8 to 12 hertz.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.720
This is why we’re so drawn to the ocean.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.550
Most of the oceans meets those frequencies
and just stay there.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.070
Imagine the blue sky and the breeze around
you; beautiful.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.210
You open your eyes.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:04.720
Thank you guys, you know, working with me
on that cause you know there’s no image.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.930
So those the brainwaves, right?

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:11.520
I mean the brainwaves you probably know and
I’ll just, you know, really quickly.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:19.090
Beta state is you state, like there different
beta waves but the subset beta in beat you’ll

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:25.080
really appreciate, those the beta from the
like 12 to 15 up to 18 hertz.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:30.310
This is when your brain really is maximal
effective, like an optimal state.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.910
The alpha state you just demonstrate yourself,
everybody can do this.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:39.320
It’s from 8 to 12 hertz when you sitting
with your closed eyes and try to relax and

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.160
try to take all your worries away.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.880
When you wanna drive little bit deeper to
the theta state which is 4 to 7 hertz, you’re

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.260
going to the dream state.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:55.020
To sometimes the people that have problem
with attention, adult or children, they very

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.760
often stay in the state for awhile.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:05.570
See though they’re very [inaudible] the
kid with ADD, pick up your garbage, call your

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:10.660
friend, do your homework and the child is
looking at this like, “Huh?”

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.880
So that is a theta deep state which is very
hard to come out of.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.260
This is like listening to the kids or someone
is blasting the techno music or electronic

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.570
music like, “What is he doing?”

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:28.300
What he’s actually doing, it’s very therapeutic,
really trying to get himself or herself from

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.630
the theta state and bring to the marks of
beta state as best they can.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.310
So when you see kids or yourself, when you
stuck in the theta state it’s very actually

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.200
important to bring yourself into higher frequence
mode.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.700
And delta, this is something trance state,
you can reach out by doing the meditation.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.760
Some of the people are very good in that.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.810
But that would be very much physical with
training.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.240
Music changes brain wiring.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.311
Remember like when we get older we’re losing
some neuro connections and that’s something

00:12:01.311 --> 00:12:04.730
you can restore with music, with certain frequencies.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:11.870
Actually, you can expand your neuro circuit
which is, it’s like learning to surf, if

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:20.420
you arc your playlist you will be able to
keep that memory flow, that neuro circuitry,

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.880
much longer.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.880
How does it work?

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.270
I mean, it may seem like very simple.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:33.610
We know we found something we like, right,
like our favorite song sounds very good.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.220
And then about the music, the great thing
about music it effect all areas of the brain.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.840
I will just show you the areas of Brodmann
and you see that music really kind of tap

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.680
in to affect all areas.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.930
It may help you through the day.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:51.810
In the book really guiding you through how
to create the task oriented playlist, it’s

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:57.100
very important; driving to work, talking to
your boss, unwinding after the job, going

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:04.060
to the date, going to gym.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.600
And then again, I mean, technically speaking
music really affect the way you think, the

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.750
way you feel, the way you behave.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:17.900
So those areas of the Brodmann, right, so
if you see I was trying to put for you the

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:25.380
how we can respond, how our brain respond
in terms of the music tape.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:31.070
The music comprehension, area Brodmann 22
and 42, they’re responsible for harmony,

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.640
melody and rhythm and those little bit of
details.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.390
But the main thing that you can actually hear
the sound.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.390
[Coughing]

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:46.660
You can see the sound with area 19 and musicians
have little bit bigger area of 19 and they

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:53.210
recover from stroke much easier than non-musicians
because the area is bigger.

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:59.010
But the good news for you guys you don’t
have to be musician, you have to practice,

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.130
not necessarily playing but listening.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.170
Listening is a great practice as well.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:12.130
So, for example, just before we were setting
up the sound I think one gentleman came and

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.960
said, “Can you make temperature little bit
higher?”

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:23.230
So because it’s hard to take information
in when there’s something uncomfortable,

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.620
the same for the brain, you have to adjust
those frequencies.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:32.180
So the brain is in a maximum state for you,
everybody’s different, when it’s balanced

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.130
between the relaxed and activated.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:37.640
What we call the best mindset.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:44.100
It’s like cup of coffee, unless like you’re
like not in a French bistro and you have to

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:49.490
make cup of coffee, you put coffee in microwave,
it just get a little bit hot, you pour the

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:55.330
milk, it get a little bit colder and you put
the sugar, so basically you’re trying to

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:57.010
make the adjustments.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:02.810
The same for the brain, you have to make the
adjustments to make it work.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:07.670
You have to power the sound with imagery,
it’s very important cause I was showing

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:13.980
you data of the brain, the temporal area is
emotionally and especially bright and brilliant,

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:16.290
very sensitive to the imagery.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:21.840
So if you can power the sound with imagery
just try to think of something nice like when

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:26.890
you’re on vacation, when you had a good
time, not a time when you had a conflict with

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:27.890
somebody.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:33.029
Just kind of when you went away for several
days and your mind were completely relaxed

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:39.780
and try to use those frequencies as something
you might use to listen to your vacation,

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:40.800
something nice frequencies.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:48.960
Try to power up with this and really will
replay a time for you when you get anxious.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.040
Emotional memory is very powerful.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.290
You know, some of you probably remember when
they were on top of the game.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:03.320
So that I think you will do much better if
you practice this playlist and the competition,

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:11.190
you know like many of us have the very significant
moments in our life.

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:19.370
When we power that visual image, we saw a
memory; wedding song, birth of a child, your

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:26.200
favorite date, falling in love, winning the
competition; tons of those moments powering

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.310
specific sound frequencies.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.819
So this is the example of how music can really
triumph over tragedy.

00:16:33.819 --> 00:16:41.580
This is Russian figure skater Ekaterina Gordeeva
who was skating with her husband who basically

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.320
they were winning all the competitions before
Sergei died on the ice.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:54.800
He died just after they won two gold medals,
making history while training for the competition

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.150
that on ice.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.210
He just dropped dead on the ice from heart
condition.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:04.970
Ekaterina in two years she came onto the ice
and she was dancing.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:10.779
Like two years she was rehearsing the certain
movements, under the certain frequencies of

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:14.110
the Mahler 5 symphony.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:21.779
And that, actually, would make you stronger
and your objective, your objective actually

00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:26.360
feedback from that fullness, was that she
felt double strong because she really felt

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:31.730
that Sergei was with her and she was embraced
and those music frequencies they were dancing

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.380
together actually helped her to survive the
tragedy.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:44.990
And for some us who watched their performance
really felt like healing power in the heart.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.769
So dealing with stress.

00:17:46.769 --> 00:17:47.769
[Laughs]

00:17:47.769 --> 00:17:56.399
I mean you know, sometimes lose the file or
something happened like sounds is not working

00:17:56.399 --> 00:17:57.999
[Laughs]

00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:01.710
This is how the people would react.

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:07.950
And she probably would not be excited to hear
anything at that moment but if she would listen

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:15.230
to her playlist before, if she would try probably
she would react little less tense.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.909
And this is also the one way, like how many
people resort to something destructive?

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:28.090
And in our minds sometimes there are destructive
paths because there is a hopelessness and,

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:32.929
as you know, like you gain three quarters
more brain power to go to some creative way

00:18:32.929 --> 00:18:39.169
but also you can really help yourself to use
the training of the certain stimuli not to

00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:41.980
get to that stage.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.649
This is on the one side of the town.

00:18:46.649 --> 00:18:58.480
In the other side of the town there’s this
lady, I don’t wanna say patient, the young

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:07.669
lady who has a passion for [inaudible] and
fire dancing and she was diagnosed with terminal

00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:11.720
form of Leukemia while she was preparing for
competition.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:19.119
And she got the green light from her doctor,
from her oncologist to stay in competition

00:19:19.119 --> 00:19:21.710
and it was supposed to be for in 6 months.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:28.799
All she doing, almost 24/7, she was dancing
and she was embracing herself with those frequencies

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:32.779
that she loved, something she was listening
from her childhood.

00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:37.940
And if it’s something you loved hearing
actually turned in the competition and put

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:44.000
in the power imagery when she was little she
would love to go to the ocean and watch the

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.470
eagle coming through the sky free.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:52.899
This is how she was imagining herself, like
moving very slowly under those frequencies

00:19:52.899 --> 00:20:00.960
and she really embracing herself and connecting
herself with this eagle who flying free.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:07.730
When you watch this woman you would never
think that any disease or any terminal illness

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:15.100
can steal that power she has in her through
her movement and those frequencies she has

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.100
engrained.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.860
So she’s becoming an eagle.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:24.239
Let’s look at the concrete things because
that’s something that help you in creating

00:20:24.239 --> 00:20:31.360
your playlist and this is something we are
sharing with you in the book extensively,

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:38.419
this is just a snapshot, low frequencies something
like very familiar.

00:20:38.419 --> 00:20:43.009
And, again, everybody has different styles,
different preferences and this is something

00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:46.830
that you guys will prescribe or it will be
prescribed of your playlist.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.320
We just advising you the ropes, you know how
to get there.

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:57.600
So very low frequency, New York, New York,
right, 40 up to 50 beats per minute.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.059
If you’re going to something everybody knows,
Strawberry Field that would be about 90 beats

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:04.059
per minute.

00:21:04.059 --> 00:21:11.700
Then we go higher like something we could
do, I don’t know, like some disco pop songs

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.909
like Adele, “Set Fire,” 125.

00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:19.460
High alert you probably go like high techno.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:27.470
There was a Pandora station playing like when
I came there was about, I think, 140, something

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.690
like 140, 150.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:34.539
And then you can actually match your playlist
with a specific task.

00:21:34.539 --> 00:21:39.279
We also advising you how you can actually
get yourself in better shape if you would

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:43.679
put the certain playlist while you exercising.

00:21:43.679 --> 00:21:49.999
It’s very important what exactly, what frequencies
you put while you’re exercising.

00:21:49.999 --> 00:21:54.669
When you’re jogging, when you’re light
walking, when you do the cardio, the weight

00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:59.570
lifting, that is something you can also create
yourself cause I don’t know your preferences;

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.369
you love what you love.

00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:07.220
But the frequencies is very important for
you to get into the shape and just remind

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.679
yourself that mind and body is very connected.

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:17.379
So assembling your playlist; you first pick
out the song you like, that’s easy.

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:22.059
And then you pay attention when the song works
and when it doesn’t.

00:22:22.059 --> 00:22:27.230
It also depends on your mood, depends how
you feel through the day.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.070
Do you guys hear the sound?

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.590
[Music plays]

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:35.649
It’s kind of going to space.

00:22:35.649 --> 00:22:40.149
Okay, then you ingrain some in your memory,
it’s very important.

00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:42.340
It should be filed, right?

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:47.669
You know how to file the certain things you
do, like in projects on the computer there’s

00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:52.639
a file keeping it in your brain, don’t forget
to file it.

00:22:52.639 --> 00:22:58.619
After you file it, make it task oriented,
it should be task oriented to drive into work,

00:22:58.619 --> 00:23:02.809
again, some important meeting, you have a
speech, you have the deadline.

00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:05.470
You show many playlists as you wish.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:09.619
We’re telling this in the book how effectively
to do this.

00:23:09.619 --> 00:23:11.460
You have to train.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.799
You have to train your brain the same way
as you train the muscle because sometimes

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:21.450
we forget we have to train our circuitry,
right, we’re going to gym, we’re trying

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:26.580
to build a beautiful shape but the mind is
the same; you have to train it and you can

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.169
use something fun to do this.

00:23:28.169 --> 00:23:33.659
Look for new songs, old songs, you have to
arc your playlist.

00:23:33.659 --> 00:23:37.559
Guided imagery, BPM is important.

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:39.259
Emotional connection is very important.

00:23:39.259 --> 00:23:47.909
So, again, how you can influence the amount
of exciting neurotransmitters in your brain,

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:50.019
how you can do this guys?

00:23:50.019 --> 00:23:52.840
How do you do that?

00:23:52.840 --> 00:24:00.539
How someone can enhance their faucet of neurotransmitter
performance, many ways, right?

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:06.169
Many ways, many pleasurable activities but
some pleasurable activities are very exciting

00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:07.169
for us.

00:24:07.169 --> 00:24:11.950
We waiting for them, we’re anticipating
them it’s even going higher when anticipating

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:16.750
the pleasurable activities but some of the
pleasurable activities are not that great

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:18.149
for the brain.

00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:22.859
Maybe they feel good but they’re not that
cool in the long run.

00:24:22.859 --> 00:24:27.119
Like substances, in a big amount, or things
like that.

00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:33.220
So you can really use the same frequencies
because what you’re doing for the brain

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:38.129
waves and basic time and you put them like
in a very high beta like, almost gamma state,

00:24:38.129 --> 00:24:42.369
like when you using lots of substances, let’s
say.

00:24:42.369 --> 00:24:47.850
Or when your dopamine is like really going
up to the roof so you have to get it balanced.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:53.970
But in order to get yourself there you can
certainly use the certain frequencies.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:56.480
And we actually tell you in the book how to
do this.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:07.610
You can certainly use that song which brings
you to this happy moment in a healthy way.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:08.659
And then you can train it.

00:25:08.659 --> 00:25:13.191
You remember that happy moment when you have
when you use that song and you would do this

00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:20.549
every time you wanna dive into this moment
and stay there as much as you want.

00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:31.440
Memory, that I think is also, cause you would
appreciate, working in Google, how music can

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.019
enhance your memory.

00:25:33.019 --> 00:25:36.759
This is a very interesting story about Paul
McCartney’s first album.

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:44.169
He actually wanted to record in some exotic
place; he went to Lagos, Nigeria and that

00:25:44.169 --> 00:25:49.299
was actually the beginning of a very cool
journey but it took a couple of unfortunate

00:25:49.299 --> 00:25:55.100
turns; his band left besides his wife Linda
and Blue Moon guitarist, John Wayne.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:01.970
And what happened was he was stripped of his
valuables at the gun point and he had to give

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:08.960
his musical score, he didn’t have it anymore,
so he had to rewrite, some of you guys probably

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.470
know that story, he had to rewrite everything
from the memory.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:21.490
And, still, at the album of 75 who got the
Grammy award by Rolling Stones magazine is

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:22.690
announced one of the best.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:35.150
So it’s really possible to write such a
complex musical score by memory.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.399
I think I have another one.

00:26:37.399 --> 00:26:44.740
This is German composer, Mendelssohn, he wasn’t
robbed but he managed to leave his music score

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:51.529
in the taxi when he was riding in the taxi,
so he had to rewrite all of the music composition,

00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:56.190
all the harmony and frequencies he wrote before
from memory and he did.

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.279
Just exactly as it was original.

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:04.110
So there was research, evidence based research.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:13.270
One of the Mozart sonata, I would love to
play it for you guys and I’ll try it.

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.620
[Music plays]

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:31.610
Mozart Sonata actually was shown, D major
K448, improve your memory, increase your IQ.

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:38.409
And we’re showing you in the book how you
can enhance your playlist with the Mozart

00:27:38.409 --> 00:27:40.379
Sonata, how you can do this.

00:27:40.379 --> 00:27:45.769
Because it really open up the pre-frontal
area and then there's a certain graphic area

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:51.479
in the brain can increase your cognitive ability.

00:27:51.479 --> 00:27:57.090
Healing effect of music, it’s very hard
to underestimate that the god of music and

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.549
medicine is the same in Greece.

00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:09.059
And over the centuries, everywhere you go,
right, you go to different ceremonies you

00:28:09.059 --> 00:28:12.070
go to weddings, funerals, music is everywhere.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:19.249
Armies use certain frequencies of activation
that’s how the brain of the soldier stay

00:28:19.249 --> 00:28:23.820
aroused and this is how they can go without
sleep 24 hours.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:29.950
By marching those frequencies, which they
really ingrain and practice in their brain,

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.129
this is how they go on.

00:28:31.129 --> 00:28:38.249
I gave the presentation recently to NASA pilots,
like after we finished the study in Washington,

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:40.519
on those responders.

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:46.450
So those something for those guys to use while
they switching the time zones, it’s very

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.450
important.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:53.090
But this is more involved than music you can
really create from your own brain.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:58.799
And music is really sort of a human obsession.

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:04.809
Music therapy, some of you probably know that
it’s very effective form of therapy and

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:10.369
it’s proven, actually, how it helps with
stress, helping to improve communication skills,

00:29:10.369 --> 00:29:14.499
reduction of distraction symptoms, reduction
of destructive behaviors.

00:29:14.499 --> 00:29:20.179
There’s huge studies right now in Cochrane
Review like 2,000 people using just relaxing

00:29:20.179 --> 00:29:29.479
music for the patients with cancer, for the
pain, post op, post procedures, post operation.

00:29:29.479 --> 00:29:36.470
Now we’ll be talking about your music, the
music which comes from your brain which we

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.039
call brain music treatment.

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:46.309
So brain music treatment, brain music waves
which are created from your own brain wave

00:29:46.309 --> 00:29:49.029
frequencies and, again, everyone has different
frequencies.

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:56.960
As we say genetic competent is important and
the signature of the brain is very important.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:04.520
So I would love to play for you, there is
two files; activating and relaxing.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:10.130
Activating and relaxing, activating files
created mostly from your fast waves as we

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:13.200
will have, you know, high beta and beta.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.570
And relaxing is created from your own slow
waves which is alpha theta

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:19.739
[Piano music]

00:30:19.739 --> 00:30:27.850
Okay, it’s activating, I can’t play it
very long because I get very activated.

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:33.879
It’s my activating file; what was I thinking?

00:30:33.879 --> 00:30:35.379
[Music plays]

00:30:35.379 --> 00:30:38.999
Great, and this is my relaxing.

00:30:38.999 --> 00:30:43.639
[Music plays]

00:30:43.639 --> 00:30:55.889
Sorry guys I cannot do this that long cause
I would fall asleep.

00:30:55.889 --> 00:30:57.259
I’m just kidding.

00:30:57.259 --> 00:30:58.259
[Laughter]

00:30:58.259 --> 00:31:04.289
But actually what we showed and across the
board, and I’ll show you the studies, it’s

00:31:04.289 --> 00:31:11.899
effective in 85 percent of the people suffering
from insomnia and about the same effectiveness

00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:15.460
for people suffering from anxiety or social
anxiety.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:24.119
So 
how does it work, right?

00:31:24.119 --> 00:31:25.679
&gt;&gt;audience member: So where exactly did the
songs come from?

00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:26.679
You said it’s your song, so it’s your
brainwaves?

00:31:26.679 --> 00:31:27.679
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: Yes, yes.

00:31:27.679 --> 00:31:28.679
So I’ll just tell you in a moment.

00:31:28.679 --> 00:31:34.120
The brainwaves are recorded on EEG and then
they are converted to the musical sound and

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:44.019
they are placed on two files for you that
you can put them on Mp3 or CD.

00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:47.070
And they actually based on what you need for
the day.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:54.179
You can use activating file when you tired
through the day, when you feel like very relaxed,

00:31:54.179 --> 00:31:59.509
you want a little bit perk up and relaxing
file you use when you feel like very high

00:31:59.509 --> 00:32:04.519
strung, very anxious and you use at night
when your brain just can’t shut down.

00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:07.989
Like for some of us we go to bed and what
do we do?

00:32:07.989 --> 00:32:12.580
Just lay there and think, think with our brain
like a shadowbox this is how you can unwind

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.989
your brain by using your own relaxing file.

00:32:14.989 --> 00:32:20.700
It’s a pretty complex algorithm and I don’t
want to bore you guys but basically it’s

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:28.440
a translation through harmonic free analysis
of alteration of the brainwaves we have.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:34.059
With this algorithm we translate allegoration,
for those that play a little bit of piano,

00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:40.519
like 36 notes, 3 piano octaves and 8 volume
gradation and duration segments.

00:32:40.519 --> 00:32:51.899
In the first study we did we used about 120
algorithms just to show that this treatment

00:32:51.899 --> 00:32:54.309
is effective.

00:32:54.309 --> 00:32:55.360
So this is what happened.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:04.710
This is the first graph of someone who suffers
insomnia.

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:11.409
So you see there is a stage, you guys know
a little bit stage 1, 2, 3, 4, this is a deep

00:33:11.409 --> 00:33:16.669
sleep so this person with insomnia doesn’t
have a deep sleep, they just go and they hear

00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:22.099
enough sounds, enough to bring music treatment,
the treatment really would allow you to dive

00:33:22.099 --> 00:33:28.519
to the delta sleep and the amount of sleep
cycles would increase after the brain music

00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:35.440
treatment; from 2 to 6 or maybe none to 4
and 6 so this is impressive.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.649
You see that your total sleep time was increased.

00:33:37.649 --> 00:33:43.080
SOL, that’s sleep onset latency, this is
the amount that you just lay in bed and, you

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:49.729
know, counting the sheeps or elephants, really
decreased from an hour to 9 minutes, right?

00:33:49.729 --> 00:33:53.659
So you’re not awake during the night and
your delta sleep increased.

00:33:53.659 --> 00:33:59.720
It’s very interesting we also did the comparison
with Ambien, and you know that Ambien sometimes

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:06.470
could be actually quite harmful for you, right,
decreasing your short term memory.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.659
So those is the study we did in Canada.

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:15.400
As I mentioned to you the anxiety goes down
when using your authentic brain music, an

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:24.220
insomnia skill and the sleep is better when
using your own authentic brain waves music

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.310
compared to I would use some of yours.

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.780
This is what were the double blinded studies
we used.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:36.440
We have a group that use their own authentic
brain waves and who use somebody else.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:42.250
So this is the study, just finished the study,
so this is the base line with the sleep quality

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:48.891
and trait anxiety and you see even on the
week 3, on the third week when people are

00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:56.620
listening to their own brain music, right,
their anxiety goes down and they actually,

00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:04.870
they sleep, the amount of time laying in bed
counting the sheep is significantly decreased

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:06.310
so your insomnia improved.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:12.270
On the week 6 your insomnia continue to improve
and the anxiety goes down.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:20.390
Those are some complex slides and those something
we did in Washington with operational chief

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:24.650
command, first responders and the control
group.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:31.800
Those pretty complex graphs for those of you
who interested I can tell you more, with insomnia,

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:35.870
again, and with a peak performance.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:39.280
Yes, we can.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:47.720
Actually that is something we can use to practice
and repeating certain sounds.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:54.110
It’s something a lot of politician would
use, right, to engrave some message into your

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.540
right temporal area and the frontal area,
the repetition.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.150
Yes we can.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:09.890
You guys really can find out a lot of things
and your playlist can change your life.

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:15.980
You can change the way you respond to life
challenges, which is true, just by the push

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.150
of the button you can do it.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:25.320
And you can walk a path of charged happiness
and wellness, it’s true because you really

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.660
can bring a positive change and enhance your
life.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:34.800
Many people did and you can do this.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.600
May the concepts and techniques we described
within our book, Your Playlist Can Change

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:45.400
Your Life, serve you well as they have for
me and each of my other co authors.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.950
Yes, we can.

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:51.060
[Laughs]
Thank you guys.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.640
Questions please.

00:36:53.640 --> 00:37:04.800
[Applause]
Do you guys have any questions I may answer

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.300
for you?

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.050
Yes?

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:17.320
&gt;&gt;male #1:How much are you samples of just,
standard population, how much actual musicians

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.320
or separate cultures that have like more melodic
based languages, like how much of that was

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.320
taken into consideration?

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.120
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: You know, the gathering
data in terms of the playlist there were a

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.270
lot of us and no musicians, just college students.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:31.670
You know, we’ll have the medical students,
the people who run the corporation in terms

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:32.670
of the playlist.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:37.290
In terms of the brain music, all the groups
we had, I mean there were people who were

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.240
suffering from insomnia and people suffering
from anxiety.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:47.260
So there were two target group and in terms
of operational chain of command and so those

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:54.120
were our first responders, firefighters, so
those are the people who have to be their

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.400
optimal best.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:01.700
So there were no musicians, I think there
was one musician, actually, in Canada.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.090
Yes?

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:16.370
&gt;&gt;male #2: The civil music you were playing
have almost as much effect as the individualized

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.370
one is that because the [inaudible] just someone
else’s brainwave music?

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:21.260
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: You know what happened with
the placebo which is somebody else brain music,

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:25.730
right, could be effective at some way, you
know?

00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:32.550
Not as effective as your own but the effect
would fade away like on about 7 to 10 days

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.390
it would fade away.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:40.070
This is the first study we did we did with
medical school about 25 years ago, something

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:46.560
like that, so this is when we took the group
of medical students and just gave them their

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:52.540
own authentic and somebody else and it was
effective, somewhat, not that effective from

00:38:52.540 --> 00:39:03.070
the parameters [unintelligible] then the effect
would fade away like next week.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:16.890
Some more questions for you guys?

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:17.890
Yes?

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.100
&gt;&gt;male #3: Have you ever tried recreating
the custom sound after you use it for a couple

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.100
weeks and see if there were any changes?

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.100
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: After you use your own?

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:27.690
Yeah, we recommend actually that you would
come to retune your first sample.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:32.510
The same that I would adjust the medications
and we don’t study the follow up, that’s

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:37.220
what you’re saying, I mean, like follow
some sonography after you use it.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:44.680
But we list the changes on baseline, you know,
EEG and in this study like I said, we did

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:48.780
post sonography but not like in a huge sample.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:55.620
Of course, I mean, there were like a soft
picture of, for example, your fast brain waves

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:58.900
they come in common so this is what we showed.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.440
This is how you can dive into delta sleep.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:07.470
But how you can make it more proficient, that
is something we are about to study.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:09.070
Like, for example, in a year.

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:15.400
For example, in Italy we have some people
that would use their CD for years and you

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.060
call them and they’re like, “I don’t
want to come in cause I like my CD.”

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.880
[Laughs]
Nicely put, why would they come?

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:28.530
But we actually recommend that you would come
to make it just more perfect.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:33.660
In the book, I’m giving you a lot of examples,
you know, how to use your playlist, how to

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:39.950
combine it in a different variation, how to
create task oriented playlists.

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:40.950
Yes?

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:53.350
&gt;&gt;male #4: If I listen to my favorite song
too much will it lose its effect?

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.400
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: Yeah.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.400
Yeah.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:03.056
&gt;&gt;male #4: [inaudible] wondering if you knew
if for EMT is there a limit to how much you

00:41:03.056 --> 00:41:04.056
listen [inaudible]

00:41:04.056 --> 00:41:06.600
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: Yeah, that is a great question
actually because, I mean, certainly when you

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.510
use, when you do something pleasurable too
much, I mean, too much is too much.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:18.870
So you really go to desensitization to your
brain waves, I mean, you can decrease this

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:19.870
effect.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:24.140
What we actually noticed with activating file
you really have a limit.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:27.800
You cannot listen to your activating file
more than two times.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.070
Some people do three.

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:35.030
I mean it just like with people who have very
heavy ADD but we do not recommend more than

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:39.330
two times because we actually noticed that
people get too activated and this is something

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.270
that you don’t want to do.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:46.570
And just with your playlist sample you really
have to arc your playlist, you know, it’s

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.430
like you have to do some novelty.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:53.180
You have like given a new style range, something
you love like rock and roll, techno, rap,

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.250
doesn’t matter but you have to upgrade it
within your style.

00:41:56.250 --> 00:41:57.250
Within your preferences.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:58.250
Just stop with the desensitization.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.250
Yes?

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:04.650
&gt;&gt;female #4: What’s your take on Pandora
and the shuffle feature to create your playlist.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:16.160
Does that have any value at all to like the
spontaneity [inaudible]

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.280
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: I think there is definitely
value in a certain way if you’re asking

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:27.680
me about like neurophysiologic response I
think there is some, you know, anticipation

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.350
kind of desire, your transmitters don’t
know what is next.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.380
I think it’s cool but what do you do with
this therapeutically.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:43.151
I mean if you like something like be a young
age or something I think it’s cool just

00:42:43.151 --> 00:42:44.800
for fun.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.270
Guys, more questions?

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:48.910
More songs?

00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:49.910
Yes?

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:54.670
&gt;&gt;male #5: In the movie [inaudible]

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:57.130
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: Yes.

00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:02.890
&gt;&gt;male #5: [inaudible] have something horrible
happen

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.360
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: Yes

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.820
&gt;&gt;male #5: [inaudible]

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:15.770
&gt;&gt;Galina Mindlin: Let me incorporate right,
yeah I remember that movie, wow there were

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.100
some horrible things there like when there
was that music.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:23.820
Are you saying like when something happened
when he’s sort of appearing, something horrible

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.820
happened right?

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.050
And the music is pleasant.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:30.320
I mean we have different personalities, styles.

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:37.180
I do supervise the unit with personality disorders;
I mean there is this variation, so there’s

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.890
personality traits.

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:45.180
And the best, I mean, again, we’re talking
about the creativity the best when you appear

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:52.290
to something positive to something positive
cause if you have something, negative like

00:43:52.290 --> 00:44:00.500
event in your life, you can’t reverse it
with a positive but not when you’re in kind

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:03.790
of perpetrator mode or
[Laughs]

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:14.090
&gt;&gt;That is what I mean; you can through the
tragedy, that you can do the training.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.610
Some more questions, guys?

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.290
[Ocean waves]

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:26.680
You guys can do it, actually, every day for
yourself.

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.040
Just for five minutes.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:38.800
It’s very restorative for your brain to
use the natural sounds to bring yourself from

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.960
that state you were coming from, it’s very
restorative.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.760
I would recommend.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.560
I do it.

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:51.990
So, something else, guys, you would like to
hear some sounds we may miss?

00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:57.630
Something you want me to play for you from
what I have?

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:02.730
On the tape we were playing?

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:10.190
[Laughs]
So do you guys want little bit activating

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.660
file just to stay active?

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.950
But it’s mine, I don’t know if you want
to do this.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.880
I know it’s little bit too activating.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:28.130
Let’s do maybe some of the Mozart for you
so you guys will feel, you know, active.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:33.730
You guys are not forgetting the book, right,
cause I mean; I don’t want to tell you everything.

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:34.880
[Laughs]
