00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:00.520
Hey guys welcome back i'm Nate with the King of Random and today

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.620
We're going to build a laminar flow nozzle

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.620
Laminar flow refers to when water is traveling all in exactly one direction with no turbulence which means that when the exits a nozzle

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.369
It has a perfectly smooth stream so the purpose of the video today is to learn how to build our own laminar flow nozzle

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.840
without breaking the bank

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.500
Here's the supplies

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.569
We're gonna need for this build we have the four inch diameter plastic tubing you can use PVC or ABS

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.040
We have two of these test caps we have a nozzle that attaches to a standard garden hose some epoxy putty coffee stirrer straws

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.229
Some screen door mesh some scouring pads and a can of soda. Let's start building

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.099
This piece of PVC I have is a little too long we're only going to need a piece about a foot long so first

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.169
I'm just going to cut this in half, so it's a little more manageable

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.029
Now I'm going to cut off three rings from the PVC tube each one about 1/4 inch wide

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.368
And now we measure for the main section of to which should be between 11 and 12 inches long

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.580
Now that we've cut our pipe to length the next step is to drill holes in each of our test caps

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.960
We want to use a drill bit

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.520
That's the same size as the narrow end of the threads that way it will have a nice tight fit in the end cap

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.639
For the pipe fitting I have I'm using a three-quarter inch drill bit

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.040
Later when we drill the actual nozzle

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.480
We're going to be using this 5/8 inch drill bit using one of the quarter inch PVC rings

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.869
You've cut trace out the inside of the circle, on the 3 of the scouring pads

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.730
Cut along the line and you'll have three circles made from the scouring pads

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.949
Cut through one of your quarter inch PVC rings

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.460
With the PVC rings we want to figure out how much we need to cut off in order to fit the entire ring

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.680
inside our PVC tube

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.760
Use your first cut ring as a guide to mark on the other two where to cut

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.899
Cut out three pieces of screen large enough that you have a little bit of a border around each of your PVC rings

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.989
Empty a can of soda and rinse it out well

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.839
Using a knife or a pair of scissors cut the top and bottom off of your soda can

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.179
Be careful because the jagged edges of the can might be sharp

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.849
You'll want an unbent piece of the can wall about 3 inches square

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:58.539
Sandwich a piece of aluminum between two smooth boards and screw it together tight making sure your screws go through your sheet of metal

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.579
This piece of aluminum is going to be your nozzle where the water comes out

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.858
Here's where we're going to use that 5/8 inch drill bit drill through the top board and the layer of metal beneath it

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.939
By screwing into the metal sheet you should prevent any movement you get a nice clean cut

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.189
Once you finish drilling undo the screws and remove your sheet of aluminum

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.969
Trim the excess so you have about a 1 inch border around the hole you drilled

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.158
Drilling has probably left a little bit of a burr on the aluminum so we want to try and sand that off using a very

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.619
High grit sandpaper first I'm going to sand it with 400 grit sandpaper, and then with some trip a lot steel wool

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.590
Alright guys quick update we have now cut prepped and prepared all of our parts

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.709
And it's time to start assembling our laminar flow nozzle first

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.829
We want to take our three sponges and press them inside the tube

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.069
Leaving about an inch and a half at the bottom next we want to attach one of our screens to the ring and press that

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.749
Into the tube place the screen over the tube and then squeeze the ring together so that the gap is closed

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.189
Using a knife or scissors remove the excess screen, but leave a small border around it

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.559
Being careful to apply pressure to the whole ring at once

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.589
Lower it and the screen down until it is pressed up against the sponges now what we're going to do is fill the whole tube

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.590
with the coffee stirrer straws

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.510
You'll want to make sure all of your straws are pointing the same direction

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.369
So the water will flow smoothly if any of your straws go in sideways make sure you straighten it out

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.220
We also want to make sure that the entire opening is full of straws so keep putting them in until there's no gaps left

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.540
Some people have tried building these with regular drinking straws and that might work pretty well, too

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.700
But I think it works better using these coffee straws

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.009
So with the sponges and the straws in place we have a device that will mostly get the water traveling in one smooth direction

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.659
But we have a little bit of space after the straws and we want to make sure that the water doesn't start picking up any

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.770
Turbulence we're gonna put in two more layers of the screens held in via the PVC rings

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.309
Which should help prevent the water from building up any turbulence before it leaves the nozzle

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.230
This first ring you want to push almost all the way down to the straw is leaving a gap of only about a quarter of

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.179
An inch the second ring you only want to have about one inch below the top of the tube now

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.580
We're going to attach our flow nozzle to our end cap we'll attach a piece of electrical tape to the flow nozzle

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.539
But before we secure it on flip it over and line it up to make sure that the flow nozzle

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.670
Hole is right in the center of the hole

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.330
That's drilled into your end cap press the tape onto the end cap to secure it in place

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.020
Tape securely all the way around the flow nozzle, so there are no exposed edges

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.989
Now that our flow nozzle is attached to our cap we're going to fit that over our pipe

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.329
It's probably a pretty tight fit but with a little work

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.710
You should be able to fit the test cap into the end of the pipe the last step before we test

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.220
This is to attach our hose nozzle to the other end cap and attach that to the pipe as well

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.199
If you're having a hard time fitting the hose nozzle into the hole you've drilled into the cap you can expand it a little bit

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.200
by using some sandpaper

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.139
Once your nozzle is attached to the end cap press the end cap down into the pipe

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.680
There you have it our laminar flow nozzle is now ready for a test fire before we make all of the connections permanent, okay

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.630
So we're gonna hook our laminar flow device up

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.650
And I've removed the cap because we want to see the water as it's rising up

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.669
You can see just look how smooth this water is you can see through it almost perfectly because there's no disturbance to it

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:35.229
You can see some air bubbles are getting trapped underneath the screen and even down on top of the straws

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.120
So I'm just gonna tip it try and get those air bubbles together and come out

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:47.019
That is not laminar flow all right

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.440
I'm gonna turn the water off put the cap back on and then see how this is flowing out

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.399
Okay, you can already see this is working pretty well look at this little stream

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.229
It's a it's just this nice clear jet you can easily see right through it

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.169
I'm gonna try turning up the pressure just a little bit

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:13.509
Alright once again, that's a higher pressure. It's still going pretty well

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:18.729
There is a little bit of waviness right as it's coming out of the nozzle so one thing

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.470
I'm just gonna try I'm gonna turn off the water

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.869
And I'm gonna sand down the nozzle just a little bit with some high grit sandpaper to smooth it out

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:30.190
Just a tiny bit more feeling all the way around that that's feeling pretty smooth by now

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:38.019
There we go that is a nice clean stream, you can see right through it it looks really good

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.430
Let's seal this thing up and make all of the connections permanent alright as an update

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:48.009
We've now tested this and after a little bit of additional sanding on the nozzle to make it extra smooth. It's working pretty

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:52.538
Well you probably saw that a little bit of water was seeping out the edges in the hose connector spot

00:07:52.539 --> 00:07:57.729
So now what we want to do is seal up all the connections so that it doesn't leak at all this two-part epoxy putty is

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:03.309
Strong waterproof and holds up under pressure just mix the two parts together until you have a uniform color

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.339
And then you'll have a minute or two to apply it to whatever it needs to be glued

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:08.409
Alright now that our putty is mixed

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:13.149
We're going to take half of it and use it on the outside and half of it on the inside of our hose nozzle

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:19.278
Well the putty is carrying on the hose nozzle

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:22.939
We're gonna use a little bit more of it on the top of the cap to hold that onto the device

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.378
Boozing out all over as I squeeze this cap down onto the pipe

00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:41.628
And you use a little bit of extra putty to make sure that the gaps are really well filled that's one side attached now

00:08:41.629 --> 00:08:43.629
Let's glue on the other one

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:55.759
The putty holding all of our nozzle pieces connected is now dry and we're going to sand it just a little bit to clean up

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:57.759
the edges

00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:05.149
This is all sealed up and ready to go, but before we hook it up to the hose again

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.579
You know here at the king of random we like to decorate

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.689
All right, we've got this bad boy all decorated. Let's go hook it up to the hose again

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.410
Here we go are working laminar flow nozzle

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.329
You can see look how clean this whole line of arc is it almost looks like a piece of glass

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.809
but of course if you touch it it splatters everywhere a

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:50.919
Couple of tips if you're trying to troubleshoot your laminar flow device because you're not getting a nice smooth flow out of it you'll want

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.599
To be sure that you have at least two or three of those sponges down at the bottom because they really help slow the water

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.050
Down so that the straws can do their job of straightening all the water out

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.640
You'll want to make sure that the straws are all packed in tightly touching the sides of the tube

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.540
And if there are no gaps

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.230
And they aren't moving around in there the pieces of screen will really help

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:13.780
Prevent any turbulence from building up in the space between the straws and the end of the nozzle and lastly

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.660
Probably the most important thing is that your nozzle has to be

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.260
extremely smooth

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.580
it's hard to spend too much time on this if you can feel even the

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.179
slightest divot or burr or scratch in the aluminum nozzle

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.599
Then that's going to affect the water flow all right one of the main

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:34.569
Indicators that you have a good laminar flow is that your water stays together as a cohesive stream all the way to the end

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.700
Look at how the water coming out of this nozzle is still in a tight stream even when it's hitting the ground

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:45.160
When the water is truly moving with a laminar flow it's amazing how clear it gets check this out

00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:58.569
There you have it the laminar flow nozzle as you saw it works

00:10:58.569 --> 00:11:03.099
Pretty well at low pressure at higher pressure the stream does start to get a little bit wonky

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:08.860
And I know one of the reasons for that is higher pressure especially out of a garden hose is a little less consistent

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.519
I have plans for the future to look into what I can do to make it so that we have more

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.750
Consistent pressure so that at higher pressures our stream of water will travel farther

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.219
Let's do a quick recap of the build we took a piece of PVC and added a hose

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:25.629
Intake valve the water is slowed down by running through some sponges

00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:29.319
And it's then straightened out by running through some coffee stirring straws

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:36.279
There are a couple layers of screen mesh at the end to prevent any turbulence from building up in the dead space after the straws

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:40.059
In the tube it then exits through a perfectly round super smooth

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.869
Hole all of which gives us a perfectly smooth stream of water with no turbulence

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.349
So it almost looks like a stream of glass coming out of the nozzle

00:11:48.199 --> 00:11:52.899
There you have it you now know how to build your very own laminar flow nozzle without breaking the bank

00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:57.459
we are hoping that we can revisit this in the future to figure out how to add a little more pressure and

00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:00.878
Maybe some fancy things like putting lights into the stream of water

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.529
Thanks for joining us for this project today, and we'll see you in the next one taki then

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:09.009
There's a giant fly

00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:16.509
Now it's a dead fly hello the clouds did part and the Sun did smile down upon them

00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:21.849
Really confusing they're shot. It's just like a drinking fountain with a lot of water coming out

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.600
Hey guys

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:27.699
