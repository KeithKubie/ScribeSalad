so there's no warmth when he looks at
his mother or no fear when he looks at

but if you come up with an anatomical

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799

Sherlock Holmes like deduction here and
then you analyze what's going on and

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220
then you analyze what's going on and
 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.770
then you analyze what's going on and
it's mystery solved and you can test it

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780
it's mystery solved and you can test it
 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.539
it's mystery solved and you can test it
