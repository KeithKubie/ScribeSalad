00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.590
OK, so we're here at the
Nottingham Forest Football

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.220
Stadium, and we wanted
to find some

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.185
excuse to use the stadium.

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:12.860
So I thought, why not talk about
the football itself?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.360
Now, it's a very special shape,
but I tell you what.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.295
For the purpose of this video,
I'm going to use this little

00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:20.400
toy version.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.910
This is a bit clearer to see.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.570
Now, this is actually a special
mathematical shape.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.689
It's called a truncated
icosahedron.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.160
But what is an icosahedron?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.450
Let's start with that.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.310
So this prop, slightly less
glamorous, I'm afraid.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.470
It's a home-made prop.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.120
I made it out of cardboard
myself.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.940
But this is the icosahedron.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.660
It has 20 triangular faces,
and it looks like this.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.750
So now, if I cut off the
corners of this shape--

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.080
we have 12 corners.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.500
If I cut them off, I will now
make my football shape, the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.950
truncated icosahedron.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:08.060
So the truncated icosahedron
has 12 pentagon faces.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.900
Here they are in black.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.030
And 20 hexagon faces.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.110
There they are in white,
and they fit together.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.120
And this is your traditional
football.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.970
This was used in professional
games since the 1970s, and has

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.220
been more recently replaced
with a modern ball, which

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.640
actually uses fewer panels.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.810
Now, there is an advantage,
though, to using the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.730
old-fashioned ball.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.290
Because although it's slightly
counter-intuitive, the

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.190
stitching around the ball makes
it a bit more rough.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.120
It makes the surface a bit more
rough, and it actually

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.340
makes it more aerodynamic.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.760
What they find within modern
balls, because they're

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.650
smoother and are less rough,
they are actually less

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.900
aerodynamic.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.260
So they have to artificially
add dimples, and artificial

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.590
grooves, and stitching, so that
it will have the same

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.950
sort of flight as the
old-fashioned balls did.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.125
Yeah, so this shape was also
used by an American architect

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:12.120
called Bookie Fuller.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.310
He used to build domes
in this shape.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.250
And it's him that they named
the Bookie Ball after.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.100
The Bookie Ball is this shape.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.540
Yeah, you may have heard
of the Bookie Ball.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.908
It's also used in chemistry
because it's a molecule of 60

00:02:25.908 --> 00:02:31.830
carbon atoms, again, forming
this shape, the truncated

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.750
icosahedron.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.190
So in a Bookie Ball, we have
these 60 atoms, which are the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.870
corners of this truncated
icosahedron shape, making the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.260
same shape as this
football makes.
