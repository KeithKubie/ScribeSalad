00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.080
All actors have a special gift with the ability
to hide behind a character.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.480
Voice actors are able to go one step further
by masking their physical appearance to become

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.300
someone completely different.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.020
Disney has created countless beloved characters
for generations but viewers may not realize

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.360
that many characters were played by the same
actor.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.910
Here are 10 Actors You Didn’t Know Voiced
More than one Major Disney Movie Character

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.840
Sterling Holloway Cheshire Cat and Winnie
the Pooh

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.640
Cheshire Cat and Winnie the Pooh were voiced
by Sterling Holloway.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.620
The actor was one of the original voice actors
hired by Walt Disney.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.390
His credits expand far beyond the two characters
but Cheshire Cat and Winnie the Pooh may be

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.079
his most beloved work in his sixty year career.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.449
1951’s Alice in Wonderland based on Lewis
Carroll's novel, showcased Holloway as the

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.100
devious feline who insists on confusing Alice
in the mysterious land.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.590
Holloway also played the similarly mischievous
Kaa from Disney’s The Jungle Book.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.989
He was then given the role of Winnie Pooh
in the 1960s.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.390
He continued the role in The Many Adventures
of Winnie the Pooh until 1977.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.350
Pooh’s rumbly-tumbly and bumbly persona
may seem like a completely different character

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.140
for Holloway but he defined the role as others
only impersonate the sound he created.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.909
Kathryn, Beaumont, Alice and Wendy

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.189
Kathryn Beaumont was only twelve years-old
when she was discovered by Walt Disney and

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.530
given the role of Alice in Alice in Wonderland.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:31.579
Her youthful voice lent an innocence that
could not be easily feigned by an older actress.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:35.250
When Walt was casting the role of a similarly
positive young girl who ends up in a magical

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.619
land, he looked no further than Beaumont,
for the role of Wendy Darling in 1953's Peter

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:40.619
Pan.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.920
The two characters don’t just sound similar,
they also have a nearly identical face as

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.869
the animators based the characters on the
small featured actress.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.710
Kathryn Beaumont was pleased to be a Disney
legend and showed that appreciation by voicing

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.939
the two characters until 2005 for television
specials and video games.

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.799
After that she retired and a younger actress
stepped into the petite shoes of Alice and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.749
Wendy.

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.719
Verna Felton Fairy, Godmother and Queen of
Hearts

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.619
It may be hard to believe that the person
who played Cinderella’s kind and generous

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.180
Godmother also played the villainous Queen
of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland, but actress

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.040
Verna Felton voiced the greatly contrasting
women.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.940
Felton was an actress born in 1890 so by the
time she was playing two of Disney’s most

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.300
recognizable characters, she was already a
seasoned actress in radio, film, and television.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.320
Just like most of the actors who work for
Disney, she was given many roles throughout

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.280
her time working for the famous mouse.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.170
Her ability to play the gentle Fairy Godmother
with genuine believability did not exactly

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.370
type-cast her as she was given the role of
the nasty Queen of Hearts one year later.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.530
Providing memorable voices was a family affair
as Felton’s husband actor Lee Millar was

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.240
the voice of Pluto.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.550
Bill Thompson, Smee and White Rabbit

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.630
Smee is Captain Hook’s first mate and practically
his personal assistant so it may not come

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.600
as a surprise that the actor who played him
also voiced The White Rabbit.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.000
Just as Smee supports Hook even at his most
demanding, The White Rabbit’s first instinct

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.840
is to ensure the Queen of Heart’s comfort
at every turn even when she requires outlandish

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.840
things.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.980
Bill Thompson was a vaudevillian and radio
actor when he began working with Disney.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.950
He started performing in shorts voicing Droopy
dog.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.060
Just like many of the characters who are voiced
by the same actor, there is a resemblance

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.690
to White Rabbit and Smee even though one is
a neurotic rodent who has issues with being

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.690
tardy.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.720
They both are short, stout, and eager to please

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.410
Eleanor Audley, Lady Tremaine and Maleficent
Two of the most wicked antagonists to Disney

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.500
princesses are Cinderella's evil stepmother,
Lady Tremaine, and Aurora’s insanely bitter

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.720
Godmother Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.760
Their similar devilish demeanor and chilling
voices are from actress Eleanor Audley.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.020
Audley worked in television, film and radio
for years before obtaining the roles.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.040
She initially turned down the role for Maleficent
due to her battling tuberculosis at the time,

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.610
but she was made for the role.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.310
The animators based both characters on the
actress as it was common to dress the model

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.720
in the character's attire to get a realistic
design.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.230
The malevolent evil-doers were not the only
voice Audley did for Disney, she can be heard

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.540
to this day as Madame Leona, the psychic spirit
in The Haunted Mansion attraction at Disneyland

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.650
and Disney World.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.750
Bobby Driscoll, Goofy Jr. and Peter Pan
Bobby Driscoll was one of the first child

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.760
actors to receive a contract with Disney in
the 1940’s.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.490
He started out in the live action film Song
of the South.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.730
In 1952, the fifteen year-old Driscoll was
given the voice role of Goofy Jr. in the classic

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.900
Disney short, Father’s Lion, in which Goofy
and his son go on a hunting trip.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.890
Younger viewers may be more aware of Goofy’s
son Max from A Goofy Movie, but it was Father’s

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.730
Lion that introduced the silly dynamic of
Goofy and his son.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.020
Driscoll scored his most memorable role a
year later as the maturity stunted boy, Peter

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.020
Pan.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.190
Bobby was also the model for Peter.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.090
Unfortunately, Driscoll’s fame came at too
early of an age and he was unable to maintain

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.090
success.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.540
He died from an overdose at the age of thirty-one
as he was a truly lost boy.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.360
Jodi Benson, Ariel and Barbie
Ariel is a teenage mermaid who just wants

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.150
to be part of our world which requires feet
but apparently not much talking.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.070
Barbie is a Mattel creation that became part
of Andy’s toy crew.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.950
The two characters share a bubbly disposition
and struggle unnaturally on the legs they

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.950
are given.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.730
They were also both played by Broadway actress
Jodi Benson.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.080
The Tony Award winning actress began her career
in the early 1980s.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.040
She cross paths with someone involved with
1989’s The Little Mermaid so she decided

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.600
to send in a demo of herself.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.780
After getting the part she has continued to
voice Ariel in films, television, video games,

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.780
and specials.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.520
For the role of Barbie in Toy Story 2, Disney
did not have to look far as Benson was the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.430
ideal sound for the leggy blonde.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.060
Phil Harris, Thomas O’Malley and Baloo
What do the sly and confident Thomas O'Malley

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.940
from The Aristocats, the carefree and lovable
Baloo from Jungle Book, and Robin Hood’s

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.090
right-hand bear Little John have in common?

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.620
They were all voiced by comedian, actor and
jazz musician Phil Harris.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.060
A jazz musician playing the three too cool-for-school
characters was a perfect fit.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.770
His voice became known for generations after
not only playing the speaking voice but also

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.580
singing songs like “The Bare Necessities”
and “Everybody wants to be a Cat”.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.140
After more than a decade without Disney, Harris
recorded Baloo once again for the 1990 series,

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.140
Talespin.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:01.389
Unfortunately, the producers decided his aged
voice was not a good fit and replaced him

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.169
with a sound-alike.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.070
Jimmy McDonald, Mickey Mouse, Chip, Dormouse,
and Jacque

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.070
While most of the actors who work for Disney
stick to their job as a performer, Jimmy McDonald

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.740
was a man of many skills.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.120
He started out as the head of Disney’s sound
department.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.550
He was responsible for not only creating the
sound effects but also composed the music

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.260
for some early Disney shorts.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.740
He began doing supplemental voice work for
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but his big

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.610
break into acting was becoming the new voice
of Mickey Mouse in 1947.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.330
He remained the legendary mouse for thirty
years.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.460
In addition he was Chip of Chip and Dale,
Jacque the helpful mouse in Cinderella and

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.669
the sleepy Dormouse from Alice in Wonderland.

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:35.950
His aptitude for voicing likable critters
has cemented his position as one of the most

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.210
versatile Disney employees in history.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.490
Barbara Luddy, Lady and Roo
Barbara Luddy played two dogs and two maternal

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.490
guides.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.540
Lady is known to be the delicate and composed
cocker spaniel who falls in love and has a

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.580
memorable spaghetti dinner with a boisterous
mutt in Lady and the Tramp.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.730
Then there is Roo’s adoring mother Kanga
who has a kind voice and sensible disposition.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.040
Actress Barbara Luddy played the two enduring
characters and spent most of her career working

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.040
with Disney.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.360
Along with Lady, she also voiced Rover from
101 Dalmatians.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.919
Using the same protective cadence she used
for Kanga, she also provided the voice of

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.050
one of Aurora’s Godmother, Merriweather
in Sleeping Beauty.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.740
Luddy started out as a Vaudevillian actor
and worked occasionally on television, but

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.810
her Disney work remained her legacy.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.139
There’s our list.

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:16.139
What did you think?

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.020
