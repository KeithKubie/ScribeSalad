00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.370
Did you play the game Mousetrap?

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.160
Or see a Rube Goldberg
machine at the science fair?

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.540
If our app were a Rube Goldberg machine,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.330
then an instance of a class would
be one of its moving parts.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.615
A class is a unit that we use to package
together related data and functionality.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:18.235
A class is made up of properties and

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:21.665
methods, as you can see here
in this simple Movie class.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:24.585
The properties are title,
director and release year.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.195
And it only has one method,
an init method.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:30.000
We'll talk about the specifics
of initialization shortly.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.900
For now, just know that every class
needs an initialization method.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.300
Notice that the properties are generally
defined at the top of the class,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.910
followed by the methods.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.680
Here's another class you've seen before,
the Moviearchive class.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.610
This one has a property that's
an array of movie objects.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.390
And in addition to its init method, it
has a familiar method, filter by year.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.170
You can see that, apart from
the placement of the code between these

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.420
curly braces, defining properties in a
class is no different from defining any

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.360
other variable or constant.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.270
And defining methods in a class is
no different from defining global

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.900
functions.
