00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:09.632
Every chicken was once an egg,

00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:11.575
every oak tree an acorn,

00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:13.573
every frog a tadpole.

00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:15.283
The patch of mold on that old piece of bread

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:16.735
in the back of your fridge,

00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:19.781
not so long ago that was one, solitary cell.

00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:21.569
Even you were once but a gleam

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:23.742
in your parents' eyes.

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:26.346
All these organisms share

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:27.974
the same basic goal:

00:00:27.974 --> 00:00:30.633
to perpetuate their own existence.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:33.969
All lifeforms that we've discovered so far

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.178
stay alive by using

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:38.725
basically the same rules, materials, and machinery.

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:41.940
Imagine a factory full of robots.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.028
These robots have two missions:

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:44.572
one, keep the factory running,

00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:45.927
and two, when the time is right,

00:00:45.927 --> 00:00:48.484
set up an entirely new factory.

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:49.783
To do those things,

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:51.755
they need assembly instructions,

00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:52.862
raw materials,

00:00:52.862 --> 00:00:54.029
plenty of energy,

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:56.003
a few rules about when to work normally,

00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:57.011
when to work quickly,

00:00:57.011 --> 00:00:58.037
or when to stop,

00:00:58.037 --> 00:00:59.627
and some exchange currencies

00:00:59.627 --> 00:01:02.587
because even robots need to get paid.

00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:05.292
Each factory has a high security office with blueprints

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:08.260
for all the possible factory configurations

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.641
and complete sets of instructions

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:11.510
to make all the different types of robots

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.793
a factory could ever need.

00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:15.971
Special robots photocopy these instructions

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:16.843
and send them off

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:19.469
to help make the building blocks of more robots.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:21.093
Their colleagues assemble those parts

00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:23.428
into still more robots,

00:01:23.428 --> 00:01:24.256
which are transported

00:01:24.256 --> 00:01:25.839
to the right location in the factory

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:28.894
and given the tools they need to start working.

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:30.261
Every robot draws energy

00:01:30.261 --> 00:01:32.148
from the central power plant,

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:34.691
a giant furnace that can burn regular fuel

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:36.057
but also scrap materials

00:01:36.057 --> 00:01:38.911
if not enough regular fuel is available.

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:41.212
Certain zones in the factory

00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:42.794
have harsher working conditions,

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:44.623
so these areas are walled off.

00:01:44.623 --> 00:01:46.875
But the robots inside can at least communicate

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.045
with the rest of the factory

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:49.454
through specialized portals

00:01:49.454 --> 00:01:51.464
embedded directly into the walls.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:53.723
And as you've probably figured out,

00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:55.141
what we're describing here

00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:56.429
is a cell.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.035
The high security office is the nucleus.

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:00.392
It stores the blueprints and instructions

00:02:00.392 --> 00:02:03.515
as deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA.

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:06.226
The photocopied instructions are RNA.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.437
The robots themselves are mostly proteins

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:09.852
built from amino acids,

00:02:09.852 --> 00:02:11.409
but they'll often use special tools

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.227
that are, or are derived from,

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:15.045
vitamins and minerals.

00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:16.863
The walls between factory zones

00:02:16.863 --> 00:02:18.333
and around the factory itself

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.040
are mostly made up of lipids,

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.084
a.k.a. fats.

00:02:22.084 --> 00:02:23.374
In most organisms,

00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:25.455
the primary fuel source are sugars,

00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:26.285
but in a pinch,

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:27.954
fats and proteins can be broken down

00:02:27.954 --> 00:02:30.266
and burned in the furnace as well.

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.349
The portals are membrane proteins

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.847
which allow very specific materials and information

00:02:34.847 --> 00:02:37.789
to pass through the walls at the right times.

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:39.555
Many interactions between robot proteins

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:41.677
require some kind of push,

00:02:41.677 --> 00:02:43.923
think robot minimum wage.

00:02:43.923 --> 00:02:46.193
A few small but crucial forms of money

00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:47.983
are transferred between proteins

00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:49.811
to provide this push.

00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:52.939
Electrons, protons, oxygen, and phosphate groups

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.486
are the main chemical currencies,

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:56.612
and they're kept in small molecular wallets

00:02:56.612 --> 00:02:59.518
or larger tote bags to keep them safe.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:01.783
This is biochemistry,

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:03.740
the study of how every part of the factory

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.242
interacts to keep your life running smoothly

00:03:06.242 --> 00:03:08.822
in the face of extreme challenges.

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:10.330
Maybe there's too much fuel;

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.510
your body will store the excess as glycogen or fat.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.615
Maybe there's not enough;

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:17.122
your body will use up those energy reserves.

00:03:17.122 --> 00:03:19.590
Maybe a virus or bacteria tries to invade;

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.138
your body will mobilize the immune system.

00:03:22.138 --> 00:03:24.122
Maybe you touched something hot or sharp;

00:03:24.122 --> 00:03:26.967
your nerves will let you know so you can stop.

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:29.687
Maybe it's time to create a new cell

00:03:29.687 --> 00:03:31.242
or a new person.

00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:34.569
Amazingly, oak trees, chickens, frogs,

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.102
and, yes, even you

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:37.646
share so many of the same

00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:39.894
basic robot and factory designs

00:03:39.894 --> 00:03:41.641
that biochemists can learn a lot

00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:42.911
about all of them

00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.202
all at the same time.
