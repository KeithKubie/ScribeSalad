MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
to Talks at Google

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.550
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.239
Today, it's my enormous pleasure
to welcome Eileen Pollack,

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.140
author of the recently
published book

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.260
"The Only Woman in the Room: Why
Science is Still a Boys' Club."

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.720
Miss Pollack is professor
of creative writing

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.395
at the University of Michigan.

00:00:30.395 --> 00:00:34.380
She is a published author
of novels, nonfiction,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.020
and textbooks, but she was
not always as we see her now.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.270
At one time, she overcame
many obstacles, most of them

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.830
external, a few, if I
read the book correctly,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.010
internal, probably, to become
one of the first two women

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.420
at Yale University to earn
a Bachelor of Science degree

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.590
in physics.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.480
She graduated summa
cum laude with honors,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.610
and yet chose, at that time, not
to pursue a career in physics,

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.130
which she had dreamed
of her entire life,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.580
but rather to pursue
a career in writing.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.720
Part of this book
is a memoir that

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.930
explains how she
got to that point

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.590
and what she did after that.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.760
It picks up again
as a research study

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.550
sparked by Larry Summers'
infamous comment,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.870
or famous comment, in 2005,
gee, why aren't there more women

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.670
teaching in hard sciences?

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.550
Could this be
because, et cetera.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.950
So she took it on
herself to interview

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.280
former fellow students
and teachers and women who

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.170
had since made careers
in STEM subjects

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.100
to find out the answer.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.740
I won't spoil it here.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.980
There may not be a
happy ending yet,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.640
but perhaps it's something
we can work toward.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.120
Please, join me in
welcoming Eileen Pollock.

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:08.070
EILEEN POLLACK:
Thanks so much, John.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.320
Hi, everybody.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.910
Can you all hear me,
back rows and everything?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.840
Thanks for coming out.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.920
I can only imagine how busy
you all are, and it's really

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.390
an honor and it's exciting for
me to be in a Google space.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.150
We all-- the outsiders hear how
mystical it is for you guys,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.400
and it turns out it's true.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.490
I've just never worked
in such a place.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.200
But I have a lot of
attachments to Kendall Square.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.370
So back in the
'80s, my ex-husband

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.590
was doing his M.D. PH.D.
at Harvard and MIT,

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.535
and his lab was right on the
other side of Ames street.

00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:50.410
But of course, none of
this looked like this.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.530
It was just this huge
wasteland, because they

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.910
were supposed to build the
Kennedy Space Center here.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.910
So they destroyed
all the buildings.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.140
And then Kennedy
was assassinated,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.480
so it became the Johnson
Space Center in Houston.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.830
And for all those many years
it was just this big, vast,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.630
nothing here.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.440
The only place to eat was--
there was the old B&amp;B deli.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.990
It's not still here.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.510
Anyway, so it's interesting
for me to be back.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.760
My first job was at MIT.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.420
I worked for the head of the
civil engineering department.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.060
He would get
assigned from the UN

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.880
to write books about
how to build low cost

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.760
housing in developing countries,
and I researched and wrote them

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.350
for him.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.210
And considering I never
even built a bird house,

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.150
and had never been to
a developing country,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.300
I have always hoped
that, really, nobody ever

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.240
used those books at
the UN for anything.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.870
So what I thought I would do
was, talk a little bit more

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.980
about the book.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.480
Because my publisher
would want me to do that.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.790
And I do hope you'll get a copy.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.012
And I would love to sign
them for you afterward.

00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:00.220
And then what I'm actually
going to read to you from,

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.600
though, is a more
recent article that's

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.700
more directly focused
on tech and how

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.970
some of the issues effect
a place like, maybe Google.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.110
So the book is divided
into a bunch of parts.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:21.070
And it starts with sort of
an investigative memoir.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.980
When Larry Summers made his
remarks, you know, I got upset,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.240
but I had actually
known Larry for years.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.570
We went way back.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.270
I was a debater and high school.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.180
I was just nerdy in every
way you could be nerdy.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.930
And Larry was older,
so he judged our team,

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.040
and then I kept track of
him later and knew him.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.430
So I got all upset that
he would have thought

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.680
that there was even a
possibility that one

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.860
reason there weren't more women
physics professors at Harvard

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.470
was because of any kind of
innate aptitude problems,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.670
or that women didn't want to
work hard-- as hard as men.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.080
The other reasons he gave
seemed to be more on target,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.600
that they were cultural reasons,
and bias, and things like that.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.230
So I actually sat down
to write him an email

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.450
to explain why I had really
not gone on in physics,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.120
even though I so
passionately wanted to.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.140
And the email just
went on and on,

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.590
and I ended up with this
like, 20 page email.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.440
And instead of sending
it to him then,

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.350
I decided to write a book, and
then I sent the book to him

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.590
after it was done.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.230
And he was good enough to--
there's a blurb on the back,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.230
and he said, oh,
now I see the light

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.950
and I understand what I
didn't understand before.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.810
So that made me feel good.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.420
But I realized that I
really didn't understand

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.530
why I hadn't gone on.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.020
It was so painful for me to
have worked so incredibly

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.700
hard to get that physics
degree and to do this research

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.690
and stuff, that when
I walked away from it,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.250
I really didn't want to ever
think about the part of my life

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.750
that had wanted
to be a physicist.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.320
And so then I had to go back
and really revisit everything.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.960
And you know, part of it
was, as Jonathan said,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.330
sort of these external factors.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.150
So I went to a not very
good, rural high school.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.200
And I actually wasn't-- we
didn't have any AP courses,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.610
but there was a sort of
accelerated track that a couple

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.010
of boys got to take
in science and math.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.380
And I wasn't allowed to do it
because, as the principal said,

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.830
girls don't go on in
science and math anyways,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.410
so you would just
be wasting a seat.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.884
And besides, it would
ruin your social life.

00:06:21.884 --> 00:06:23.800
I didn't have a social
life, because if you're

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.190
a girl at that age,
and you're really

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.630
good at science and math,
that doesn't help, anyway.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.340
So I got very bored, and
angry, and I stayed at home

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.770
and taught myself what I
thought were-- I was really

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:38.012
reading about physics, but
I thought I was actually

00:06:38.012 --> 00:06:38.720
studying physics.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.370
And I taught myself calculus.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.020
But when I got to Yale, I was
just blown out of the water.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.880
Because first of all, there
were 118 guys and two women.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.850
And almost all of them had
gone to really good schools,

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.240
and had two years of high
school physics, two years

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.670
of advanced calculus,
and I had taught

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.380
myself this stuff from books.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.996
So I flunked my first mid-term.

00:07:01.996 --> 00:07:03.370
And I was going
to drop, which is

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.630
what happens to many young
women and minorities.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.270
You get there and
realize that you

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.740
have had a terrible background,
you flunk your first test,

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.980
and of course those
courses are even

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.980
called weed out courses, right?

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.920
So there's this ethos
that if you get there

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.000
and you're not already
like, top of the pack,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.470
you couldn't possibly
be good or worth saving,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.540
and so let's weed out.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.900
Luckily, I had--
you know, the book

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.940
is not a story about villains.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.030
I know that the '70s sound
like a really long time

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.570
ago, you're mostly really young.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.480
But it was actually-- didn't
feel much different from now

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.570
in terms of sort of
feminism and sexism.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:47.050
We felt, even then, that all
the battles had been fought,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.680
and that women
could do anything.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.510
And I didn't feel
like a pioneer.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.690
And I had really, really
nice-- I had all professors.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.770
There were no women professors.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.880
But I had really,
really nice guys

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.530
teaching me math and physics.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.840
And so when I was going to drop,
actually, it was very unusual

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.990
but my freshman year
physics professor

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.920
wouldn't let me drop the course.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.060
And he gave me a very good
advice, and I stuck it out,

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.390
and I worked incredibly hard.

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.170
And as often happens,
if you come from behind,

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.830
you overshoot the mark, right?

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.240
And by the time I was a
senior, I was top of my class,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.390
and I had done
all this research.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.950
And so the fact
that I didn't go--

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.580
and I had almost
perfect grades, but I

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.919
didn't think that I was good
enough, because no one said,

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.720
you're good at this.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.159
No one said, are you
going to grad school?

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:42.860
And I thought, if I were good,
someone would have said, go on.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.490
Which is a big difference
between most young women

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.540
the most guys, that
guys are raised more

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.550
to make their own value.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.530
Like, not look to other people
to pat you on the head and say,

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.250
yes, you're pretty, you're
cute, you can do it, whatever.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.920
And so women more need
this encouragement

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.450
from the outside to go on.

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.300
I didn't have confidence,
because I had come from behind,

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.910
and I still thought
of myself as behind.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.580
If you're the only woman in
the room, the only black person

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.150
in the room, the only
whatever in the room,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.170
there's this-- it's
called a stereotype

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.687
effect-- but this self
consciousness where everything

00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:21.145
you do you feel like you're
representing your whole gender,

00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:23.530
or your whole race.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.580
You feel self conscious.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.690
Every time I would
cross my legs in class,

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.600
even though I was
wearing jeans like,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.930
the professor
would stop talking.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.500
It was so distracting.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.990
So there were just
so many distractions,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.300
and I was so isolated, really.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.400
All the guys did their
problem sets together,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.050
and I was off just
working all by myself.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.580
Nobody ever even talked
to me in classes.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.930
And so those were the
factors that I started

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.630
to realize had really
been debilitating,

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:55.320
and the main reasons
that I didn't go on.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.810
The second part
of the book was, I

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.840
wanted to see whether my
experience had been unique,

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.960
whether anybody had ever
felt anything similar.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.300
And I was really interested in
how it compared to young women

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:12.670
today.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.940
I assumed that things
really must have changed.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.140
And so I was shocked when I--
so went back to Yale to talk

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.130
to the young women there.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.580
I followed up with people
I had been in school with.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.661
But I was really
interested in young women

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:30.660
today, and young women
at University of Michigan

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.920
where I teach, so I could
compare a public school

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.430
to an Ivy.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:37.540
And I was really shocked.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.000
There were a few more
young women in the classes.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.240
But most of them seemed to
be saying that inside, it

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.950
felt the same as I had felt,
that they weren't getting

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.350
encouragement, they didn't
have the confidence,

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:53.620
they felt isolated.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.750
But also-- I think, this it was
very hard for me to admit it,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.640
and then I think for them
to admit it to me, too--

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.530
these beautiful, smart,
charming young women

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.830
at Yale all saying to me,
nobody wants to date us,

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.710
because when we say we're a
physics major, that's the end.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:14.490
Is anybody going to marry me?

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.720
And I was like, can I really be
hearing this at Yale in 2012?

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.830
It just couldn't be.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.710
And then they started
telling me stories

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.010
of the teasing they
had been getting like,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.867
in junior high and high school.

00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:30.700
You know, I'm going to
grade you on the girl

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.240
curve in your physics
class, and the boys

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.750
will be graded on the boy curve.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.610
I mean, this is
from my childhood.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.040
This is like, from
people your age.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.050
Or one friend's daughter
was told by her teacher,

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.540
you're too pretty
to be good math.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.430
And very recently I
heard-- so I heard

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:55.200
from one young woman who
walked into-- she wanted

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.002
to be in the robotics club.

00:11:57.002 --> 00:11:58.460
She walked in, it
was all guys, she

00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.668
turned around and walked out.

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:02.790
But three young women who
were in the robotics club

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.820
in high school, and they were
preparing for a competition.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:07.680
The club was going to
host a competition.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.710
And the adviser for
the robotics club

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.370
said to the three
young women, you

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.110
can be in charge
of refreshments.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.730
So they just dropped the club.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.230
They never told him like,
you shouldn't say that.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.700
So this stuff was still going
on, and that really shocked me.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.560
So I think what's different
is, there are few more women,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.020
they last a bit longer, there
are few more organizations for

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.950
or are support
groups and things,

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:41.990
but I was really surprised
how little had changed.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.400
For the third part
of the book, I

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.490
did look at the studies
that had been done

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.990
on gender bias in the science.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.090
And more and more
of those studies

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.940
are being done now, partly
because of Larry Summers'

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.510
remarks.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.090
So again, I think
he inadvertently

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.570
did us a real service, because a
lot of people got mad and said,

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.090
all right, he wants us to give
them the reasons for this.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.800
Let's figure it out.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.790
And some of the
studies we very recent,

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.830
and are really very powerful.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.170
So the one I quoted
in the excerpt that

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.270
appeared in the Times
Magazine two years ago--

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.420
it's in the book-- by
Jo Handelsman at Yale,

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:20.810
which really shocked me.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.440
So it's about implicit bias.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.050
She ran the study at mostly
research institutions,

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.130
but one of the categories
was engineering.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.250
So there was engineering,
physics, chemistry,

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.840
I think math was the other one.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.070
And what they did was just
mock up job applications

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.715
for an entry level position.

00:13:39.715 --> 00:13:41.090
So it's sort of
for someone who's

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:44.020
between undergrad and
thinking of one day going on

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.720
for a PH.D., and
in the meantime,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.520
wants like, a lab manager job.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.060
And so they're exactly
the same job application--

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.760
the same cover letter,
references, you know,

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.610
grades, everything's the same.

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:01.540
But one says John on
and one says Jennifer.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.270
That's the only difference.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:08.120
And if you see the bar graph
for the statistical difference,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.730
it's so significant-- it's
not like, some little sliver,

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:17.320
it's huge-- that John was judged
more hireable, more competent,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.790
and more worthy
of being mentored

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.610
than Jennifer by a huge margin.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:25.340
And if Jennifer was
going to be hired,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.460
her salary was a good $4,000
to $5,000 lower than John's.

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.370
And we're talking
really small salary.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.671
So John would get
like $32,000 and she

00:14:34.671 --> 00:14:36.920
was going to get $28,000,
or it's $26,000 and $30,000.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.160
Something like that.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.660
So that's huge, right?

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.740
And what really shocked me
was that the degree of bias

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.380
did not vary
according to gender.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.120
So women who were going
to hire a lab manager

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.179
preferred John just
as much as guys

00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:55.720
who were going to
hire a lab manager.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.344
And it didn't vary by age.

00:14:58.344 --> 00:15:00.760
So if you were an assistant
professor or a full professor,

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.250
you were 30 or you were
65, you were just as

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.800
biased against Jennifer, except
that Jennifer was much more

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.850
likely to be judged likable.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.270
Like, who did you
think was more likable?

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.210
Jennifer.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:13.740
All right?

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.990
So you can see how insidious
some of these things are.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.864
Because if you were
Jennifer, and you went in

00:15:17.864 --> 00:15:20.010
for the job interview,
you'd come out thinking,

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:20.930
they really liked me.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.730
I got the job.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.450
And you would even get
why you didn't get it,

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:26.730
because the people
hiring you wouldn't

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:30.310
get why you didn't get it.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.350
So that I thought was shocking.

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.110
One study that's not
in the book that I'll

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.190
share with you that also
shocked me-- so this one

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.844
just came out,
literally, last week.

00:15:37.844 --> 00:15:39.760
And it was done by,
actually, a friend of mine

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.910
from the old days,
Bob Sege, who's

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.000
in Boston, that came out in
the Journal of American Medical

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.690
Association.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.300
So you tend to think, too,
that these problems aren't

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.010
as bad, say, in biology,
because those are now

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.410
women fields, and people
fields, or whatever.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.680
So this was in
biomedical science.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.400
And the study measured start
up grants for first time hires.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.242
So if you-- in academia
you get your first lab,

00:16:05.242 --> 00:16:07.450
you need money to set it
up, because you haven't been

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.170
able to get grants yet, right?

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.220
So the money comes from the
institution that hires you.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.250
So the average
for women starting

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.070
their lab-- their support
money was $350,000.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.429
Sounds like a lot, right?

00:16:19.429 --> 00:16:21.720
So you could imagine a young
woman getting hired going,

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.810
wow, they hired me and
they gave me $350,000.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.260
Yes, thank you so much.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:27.910
When do I start?

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:31.190
What was the average for guys?

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.000
$890,000.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.820
That's a half a million
dollars difference

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.180
to start up your first lab.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.600
Now, imagine how
that accumulates

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.210
in terms of your whole-- right?

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.382
And nobody knows, right?

00:16:43.382 --> 00:16:45.590
The guys don't know that
the women are being screwed,

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.850
the women don't know the
guys are getting $890,000.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:51.124
It clearly has to do with--
they don't know the reasons,

00:16:51.124 --> 00:16:52.290
because this is a new study.

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:55.400
But you can imagine
it might be the people

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.300
offering the money don't even
realize they're offering more

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.000
to the guy because he's a guy.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.935
But then the guy knows to
bargain, to negotiate, right?

00:17:02.935 --> 00:17:04.310
Well, I want even
more than that,

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.143
whereas the woman's
getting lower and going,

00:17:06.143 --> 00:17:08.710
thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.722
So there's still
much work to be done.

00:17:11.722 --> 00:17:13.180
The fourth part of
the book is sort

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:17.510
of an epilogue, in that
after the piece came out

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.030
in The Times, I got
thousands of emails,

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.900
and heard from all
sorts of people,

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.310
mostly people who agreed
about the encouragement,

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.630
the confidence factor.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.110
And I heard more-- so I focused
the book more on, say, physics.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.375
But I heard a lot from
people in tech and finance.

00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:37.080
And the issue seemed
to be very similar.

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.450
I heard from women who
would say, I'd be in a room,

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.870
and I'd get an idea, or I
know how to solve the problem,

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.287
but I didn't have the confidence
to just say it right out,

00:17:46.287 --> 00:17:47.619
and somebody else says it first.

00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:48.640
And then I kick myself.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.140
So that kind of thing--
the implicit bias.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.350
And then, of course, the
issues for child care,

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.120
and how much of the
house work you're doing,

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.480
and all the benefits
for policies for taking

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.950
time off if you're having a
kid, or other family problems.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.700
So that's the final
part of the book.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.450
So again, rather than
read from the book,

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.860
because I'm hoping that
maybe you'll take a copy.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.450
I thought I'd read you a
piece that I just wrote.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.600
"The Times" wanted me to
write op-ed piece that

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.310
sort of is a new angle on this.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:29.100
And so this piece
is focused more

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.530
on computer science, and
somebody else's research that

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.850
just came out.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.310
And I don't know that I'm right.

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.930
So afterward, I would love
to hear your responses,

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.980
and if it doesn't drive
with your experience,

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.120
or it doesn't sound
right, let me know.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.750
The largest high tech
companies, such as Google,

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.430
have finally begun to
devote serious resources

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.620
to attracting and promoting
women and minorities.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.190
Unfortunately, if young
women and students of color

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.140
continue to shy away from
classes in computer science

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.110
and engineering,
these firms will

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.610
compete for the same
limited pool of employees

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.970
who are white or male.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.240
Figuring out why people who
choose not to do something

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.720
choose not to do
it is like trying

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.590
to interview the elves who
live inside your refrigerator,

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.470
but only come out
when the light is off.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.540
Women already
working at a company

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.070
might tell you what
makes them unhappy,

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.020
but these complaints
won't necessarily

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.390
pinpoint the factors
that frighten girls away

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.710
from studying computer
science in the first place.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.810
As one of the few women
who's lived in both worlds--

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.230
I earned a Bachelor of Science
and physics from Yale in 1978

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.240
but have lived the past
35 years as a writer

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.460
and English
professor-- I've long

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.000
been interested in why women
like me who love science

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.040
and math switch to other fields,
and so many other women flee

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.390
in horror at the sight
of the simplest equation.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.500
That young women who love
science and math grow

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.820
tired of being teased
about their interest

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.850
seems easy to understand.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.620
Rather than receive
encouragement,

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.560
they face discouragement.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.700
They may dislike working in a
competitive, aggressive culture

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.440
the demands they give up any
outside interests that might

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.460
keep them healthy and sane.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.630
They face very real
difficulties trying

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.130
to raise young children
while carrying out research

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.690
that might earn them tenure.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.110
What might strike people
as a less plausible,

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.010
is that many young women avoid
studying computer science

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:25.820
or engineering
simply because they

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:28.365
fear they won't fit in
with the students who

00:20:28.365 --> 00:20:30.466
do take such classes.

00:20:30.466 --> 00:20:34.180
For the past six
years, Sapna Cheryan,

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.660
who's a psychology professor at
the University of Washington,

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:39.700
has been studying why
girls in high school

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.440
are significantly less
likely than boys to sign up

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.490
for a class in computer
science, take the AP

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.390
exam in that subject, or express
interest in computer science

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:52.750
as a career, and why
female college students are

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:56.000
four times less likely than men
to major in computer science

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.450
or engineering even though they
test extremely well in math.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.770
What Cheryan's research
reveals is that many girls just

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:07.300
don't think they would feel
comfortable in such a class.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.850
This shouldn't be
too surprising.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.170
When most of us are deciding
whether to move to a new town,

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.570
join a club, or
take up a hobby, we

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.710
are as perceptive as Sherlock
Holmes in picking up clues

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.220
as to whether we might belong.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.450
Over and over, Cheryan
and her colleagues

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.150
have found that female
students are significantly more

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.730
interested enrolling
in a computer class

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.520
if they are shown a classroom,
whether virtual or real-- so

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.760
if it's for an online
class, right, the classroom,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.920
you can make it look like
anything-- is decorated not

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.250
with Star Wars posters,
science fiction books, computer

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.810
parts, tech magazines, and boxes
for video games and software,

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:50.190
but rather with art and nature
posters, water bottles, coffee

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.480
makers, lamps, plants, pens,
and general interest magazines.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.880
So one is sort of
this stereotype

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.740
of what a computer science
room is going to look like.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.090
And the other isn't meant
to be feminine or masculine.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.920
It's more neutral.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.590
Interestingly, the willingness
of most male students

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.420
tends not to change
significantly,

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.200
whether they're shown
a room decorated

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.470
in a stereotypical
manner or a room

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:16.100
with a more neutral decor, while
about a quarter of the women

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.667
reported being drawn to the
more stereotypical setting.

00:22:19.667 --> 00:22:21.500
So there are some women
who are like, great.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.400
I like Star Wars.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.000
Here I am.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.860
The importance of what
Cheryan calls an ambient sense

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.830
of belonging proves equally
strong with female college

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.800
students considering a job
in an office that does not

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.440
conform to their image of
what a computer company might

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.070
look like.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.910
Cheryan and her
colleagues also found

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.620
that cultural stereotypes
about computer scientists

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.770
strongly influence
young women's desire

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.880
to take classes in the field.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.120
At a young age, girls
already hold stereotypes

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.780
of computer
scientists-- and we know

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:55.410
this doesn't apply to
anybody we actually

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.650
know-- as pale, awkward
young men who are socially

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.710
isolated, obsessively devoted
to playing video games,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.220
and intensely
focused on machinery,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.580
and whose genius is inborn
rather than the result of study

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:09.240
and hard work.

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.780
Given that such stereotypes run
counter to the indoctrination

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.500
most girls still receive
that they should be feminine,

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.530
whatever that means, interested
in working with other people,

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:21.160
and modest about
their abilities,

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.840
as well as many girls' beliefs
that they are not innately

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.450
gifted at science or math, it's
no surprise that they cannot

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:32.170
see themselves as happy,
successful computer scientists.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.760
In another experiment,
Cheryan and her colleagues

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.580
arranged for female
undergraduates

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:41.390
to talk to an actor pretending
to be a computer science major.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:44.530
If the actor wore a tee
shirt that said, "I code,

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:48.370
therefore I am" and claimed
to enjoy video games,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.710
the female students
expressed less interest

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.260
in studying computer
science and less confidence

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.200
in succeeding in such a
class than if the actor wore

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.430
a solid tee shirt and claimed to
enjoy hanging out with friends,

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.670
even if the actor
was another woman.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:09.000
Such stereotypes might
seem laughably outdated,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.980
and yet studies show
that the basic stereotype

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:13.880
of a scientist that
most people have

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.070
hasn't changed since they
first started testing

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.430
for it in the 1950s.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:22.260
And these stereotypes do still
have some basis in reality.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.950
In some ways, young women today
might have an even harder time

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.610
imagining themselves as
physicists, engineers,

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:31.650
or computer scientists than
when I was a physics student

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:33.180
in the mid-'70s.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.180
Back then, women
were still rebelling

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.840
against the norms of the 1950s.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.720
Most of us wouldn't
have been caught dead

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.610
pretending to be princesses,
even when we were little girls,

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:47.570
or wearing high heels and
fancy dresses as adults.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:51.520
We eschewed manicures,
makeup, and hair salons.

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.330
Fancy weddings that required a
year of planning were anathema.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.630
And we weren't about
to devote every minute

00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:59.440
to hovering over
our children the way

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.560
our stay-at-home
mothers hovered over us.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:04.720
I'm not making a value
judgment about what women

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.117
should wear or shouldn't
wear, or how much time they

00:25:07.117 --> 00:25:08.950
should or shouldn't
devote to their weddings

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.330
or their families.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:13.280
But young women today
clearly face more pressure

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.290
to dress in a
feminine, sexy manner

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.560
than they did when
I was young, which

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.130
means that the gap
between the way women

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.650
see themselves-- this is
most women-- and the way

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.150
they see scientists
has only grown wider

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.370
in the past few decades, not
to mention that the messages

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.090
young women continue to receive
from their teachers, parents,

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:34.960
and classmates convince
them this gap is real.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.460
For instance, one girl
I know was recently

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.820
told by her high school
teacher that she was

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.010
too pretty to be good at math.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.090
And research demonstrates that
female undergraduates who've

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.970
watched commercials in which
women focus excessively

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:51.290
on their appearance demonstrate
less interest in careers

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.450
in high tech than
students who haven't

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.920
viewed such commercials.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.150
Cheryan postulates
a similar theory

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.260
to explain why the percentage of
women studying computer science

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.090
has fallen since the mid-1980s.

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:07.240
Citing evidence that high
school students get their ideas

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.530
about scientists from popular
culture and the media,

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.250
she wonders if there might be a
causal link between the decline

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.530
in women's interest
in computer science

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.740
and the rise of
movies and TV shows

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.980
such as "Revenge of the
Nerds" and "The Big Bang

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:24.090
Theory," which portray
scientists and engineers

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.870
as white or Asian male geeks.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.800
The media's intense focus
on the startup culture

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.670
and geniuses such as
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.110
might also have inspired
more young men than women

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:38.970
to enter the field-- that's
her theory-- even though very

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.470
few jobs are located
in startup companies,

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:45.330
and very few computer scientists
are Steve Jobs or Bill Gates.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:47.990
Again, present company excluded.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.260
Some people scoff that
if young women are

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.370
going to let such nebulous
factors deter them from careers

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.300
in physics or computer
science, well,

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.550
the women are simply exercising
their own free choice.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.870
And if girls were tough enough,
such exaggerated stereotypes

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:05.360
and feelings of discomfort
wouldn't discourage them.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.300
Yet the stereotypes
are still pervasive.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.990
Just yesterday-- well,
yesterday from when

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.260
I wrote this-- I was standing
in line at my corner pharmacy

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.110
in New York when I realized that
the covers of the magazines I'd

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:19.430
been staring at for
10 minutes showed

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.210
a godlike portrait
of Steve Jobs, who's

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.010
the subject of a recent
movie, at the top.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:30.030
Beneath him, a big-busted model
in her underwear, then a heroic

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.540
clear-eyed portrait
of Mark Zuckerberg.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:35.550
And then at the very bottom,
another scantily clad

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:37.450
female model.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.030
All of us are bombarded
by such images.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.630
How can we not absorb the lesson
that computer geniuses are men,

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.420
while the chief goal
of a woman's life

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.470
should be to look
fabulous in her underwear?

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.460
I wonder how many
young men would

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.210
choose to major in
computer science

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.320
if they suspected they
might need to carry out

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.050
their coding while sitting
in a pink cubicle decorated

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.000
with posters of
"Sex and the City"

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.350
and "Thelma and Louise" and
copies of "Vogue" and "Cosmo"

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:04.740
scattered around the lunchroom.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.460
In fact, Cheryan's
research shows

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.180
that young men tend not to major
in English for the same reasons

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.960
most women don't major
in computer science.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.490
They compare their
notions of who

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.040
they are to their
stereotypes of English majors

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.440
and decide they won't fit in.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.140
All this meshes with
my own experience.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.060
Even though I felt more
comfortable in a tee

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.970
shirt and jeans than a
dress or a stylish suit,

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.780
after four years of
majoring in physics at Yale,

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:35.130
I experienced so much pressure
to dress and act like a man

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:38.460
that I began to feel extremely
uncomfortable about my identity

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.820
as a woman.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.070
Working as an intern
at Oak Ridge National

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:45.120
Laboratory in Tennessee,
or attending a conference

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.860
on theoretical physics
in Austin, Texas,

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:51.180
I felt out of place among
my mostly male colleagues

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:54.010
because I hated drinking
beer or eating barbecue

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:58.060
and didn't like getting
teased about reading novels.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.030
I've heard similar stories
from countless women.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:04.360
Even the female students at Olin
College of Engineering right

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.050
here in Massachusetts complained
to me about feeling out

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.210
of place among male classmates
who were always, quote,

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:14.420
"engaging in pissing contests"
or "burping the periodic

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.440
table"-- those
were their words--

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.960
or male coworkers at summer
jobs will continually cursed

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.600
and made vulgar jokes.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.510
The good news is that womens'
stereotypes of scientists

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:28.070
can be surprisingly malleable.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.610
In one experiment, young
women who read a fake article

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.700
claiming that many computer
scientists no longer fit

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.020
the geeky stereotype
demonstrated

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.390
a significantly greater
interest in computer science

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:43.200
than their counterparts
who read a fake article

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.960
saying that the
stereotype remains true.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.440
To make computer science
more attractive to women,

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.150
we might try to change how
women think about themselves.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:56.290
But we might also diversify
the images of scientists

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.190
that women see in the
media, along with the decor

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:03.680
of classrooms in which they
might want to study or work.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.410
This would be
especially easy to do

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.710
in the case of virtual
classrooms for online courses

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.020
and the offices in which
they might apply to work.

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.360
In this way, we could
retain the men and women

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.390
who are drawn to the current
images and environments

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.560
while attracting women and
men who might previously

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.920
have shied away because they
felt they wouldn't fit in.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:27.420
After all, a high tech
company isn't like the Army,

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.590
where the stereotype
of a warrior

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:33.800
is inextricably linked to the
actual requirements of the job.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.430
A stylishly dressed
woman in a cheerful room

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:38.510
with a beautiful
painting on the wall

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.960
is just as likely to write
a brilliant line of code

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.300
as a man in an "I code,
therefore I am" tee

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:47.060
shirt sitting in a dingy cubicle
decorated with a Star Wars

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.820
poster and littered with
soda cans and pizza boxes.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.590
Even small changes might
make a big difference.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.920
A thoughtful male
computer professor

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.530
once wrote me to suggest that
changing the name of the major

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.300
from Computer Engineering to
Computer Arts, or Computer Arts

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.290
and Sciences, would double
the number of female students

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.550
overnight.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.950
Of course, luring young
women into a field

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:15.160
by showing them images of
offices that don't exist

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.490
and letting them read fake
articles that claim computer

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:22.310
scientists are more
suave and socially adept

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.930
than they really
are might be unfair.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.480
But as Cheryan points
out, the stereotypes

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.500
are, at best, only
partially true,

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.860
and women who actually take
classes in computer science

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:34.600
don't hold the
same negative views

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.680
as women who get their ideas
from movies and TV shows.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.420
Besides, if companies
do succeed in attracting

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.940
more women and minorities,
the stereotypes

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.067
will change, as will,
presumably, the grubby decor.

00:31:47.067 --> 00:31:48.650
Of course, as I'm
reading this to you,

00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:51.800
I realize that this is the least
grubby decor that I have ever

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:52.920
seen in my life.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.510
So that part clearly
doesn't apply to you guys.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.490
This is why Mayor Bill
DeBlasio's recent announcement

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.720
that within 10 years, all of
New York City's public schools

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.840
must offer at least some
training in computer science

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.510
to all students is so important.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:12.250
As Cheryan herself suggests,
requiring all students to take

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.630
computer science not only
would change the stereotype

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.290
as to who does or doesn't
take such classes,

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.530
it would provide girls
and students of color

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.500
with the opportunity to
experience the material

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.730
and decide for themselves
if they like the work.

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.340
At the college level,
some fairly simple changes

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.910
could allay the anxieties of
female and minority students.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.160
At Harvey Mudd
College, strategies

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.590
such as renaming courses--
so they took Introduction

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.820
to Programming in
Java and renamed

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.310
it Creative
Approaches to Problem

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:48.490
Solving in Science and
Engineering using Python.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:50.947
I don't know that
that's a direct--

00:32:50.947 --> 00:32:53.030
but you can see the
difference in the kind of name

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:56.040
it is-- creating separate
introductory classes

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.770
for students with zero
programing experience

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:01.630
and students who already
know how to code,

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:05.940
discouraging show off
behavior, exposing students

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.490
to non-geeky
computer scientists,

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.700
and allowing them to
work on projects that

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.050
fit their preferences led to
an increase in the percentage

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:18.770
of computer science majors who
were female from 10% to 40%

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:20.540
in only four years.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:25.230
So just making these
ridiculous sounding changes,

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:29.070
they went from 10% to 40%
female computer science majors

00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.870
in four years.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:33.170
As an added benefit,
Cheryan's research

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.000
on the effects of
stereotypes and what

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.520
she calls an ambient sense of
belonging on career choices

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.500
might have important
lessons to teach us

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:44.000
about how we might persuade
more young men to enter fields

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.010
they traditionally avoid,
such as nursing, education,

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:51.360
early child care, and yes, even
English and creative writing.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.490
So that's the piece
I'm working on now.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.430
And I would just be happy
to take questions or hearing

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:02.110
your disagreements,
your viewpoints.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.610
You are the ones
working in the field.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:08.310
So I would just love to
take questions or hear

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:09.050
what you think.

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.466
And if you have a
question, if you

00:34:10.466 --> 00:34:12.530
could go to one of the
mics, that would be great.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.929
AUDIENCE: So one thing I heard
as a refrain throughout that

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:24.964
is that if we hide
away geekiness,

00:34:24.964 --> 00:34:27.980
then we'll attract a
more diverse culture.

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.420
And the problem with
that is that geeks exist.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:38.170
And many geeks and nerdy
people and weird people

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:42.900
throughout high school
experience extreme--

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.650
are ostracized,
and kind of retreat

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:51.710
into hyper-intelligent
kind of approaches.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:54.076
I don't think this
is an accident.

00:34:54.076 --> 00:34:56.159
I don't think this is just
an arbitrary thing that

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:59.340
happens for no reason at all.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.710
Those people feel very, very
invested in tech culture,

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:08.140
and they feel that they're being
attacked by the bullies that

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.690
bully them in high school.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.550
Now we're all
supposed to grow up

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:13.170
and become adults
and realize it's

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.430
more complicated than that.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.490
I'm not justifying
their position.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.467
But this is a very real
conflict right now.

00:35:18.467 --> 00:35:20.550
EILEEN POLLACK: I totally
hear what you're saying.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:22.883
AUDIENCE: I think it needs
to be addressed respectfully,

00:35:22.883 --> 00:35:24.030
and with an understanding.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:27.630
So my question to you is
to answer those concerns.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:31.010
EILEEN POLLACK: I think
what was in the piece

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:36.240
that I read was that we
need be open to more.

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.920
So we're not changing or
denigrating what is there,

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.790
we're opening to
more possibilities.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.770
So what I was
saying is that there

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:51.280
are people who are nerdy, geeky,
whether by choice or that's

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.480
just who they are, or
they want to do it.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.890
And we want to keep those
people and respect them.

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:01.750
So it said 25% of the women
who were surveyed actually

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:07.500
were drawn to the classroom
that had the Star Wars posters.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.070
And so I was very
careful to say,

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.970
and Cheryan is very careful
to say, we want to keep that,

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:14.780
and respect those people.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.540
So it's not taking
the people who

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:20.830
are bullying the geeky
kids, or the women who

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:25.336
feel that they can't show
their inner math and science

00:36:25.336 --> 00:36:27.210
self because then they
get bullied or teased,

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.540
or nobody will ask them out.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.480
It's trying to have
both groups now

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:34.680
want to be free to take
whatever kind of-- not

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.540
to be ruled by
stereotypes and bullying.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:40.090
So there's this
anti-intellectual culture

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:44.830
that affects young men and
women who let their inner geek

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:48.310
and nerd out, and
they get disrespected.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:52.260
But then there are these girls,
and probably some young men,

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.370
who would like to be
doing that, but they're

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:59.030
scared off because they've
been socialized by these images

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.250
to say, that's not me, or to
fear that if they're like that,

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.840
no one will like them or date
them, or be nice to them.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.840
We want both of those groups.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.590
And that was what I
kept trying to say,

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.510
is that we want to make the
images more diverse to show

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:20.330
more possibilities, so
we'll keep what we have now

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:24.130
and respect them, and draw in
people who are being scared off

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.460
by the bullying, and
by saying, but I'm

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.650
different from the kids
who, at least, have

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:35.340
each other in the robotics club
or the computer science lab,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:37.260
but I'm not like them.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.570
And they think that's
the only way to be.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.560
So even though, if
you're in that room,

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.190
you feel like you're being
bullied or disrespected,

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.314
there's this other group
that's looking and saying,

00:37:46.314 --> 00:37:48.000
at least you have an
identity and you're

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.350
doing this thing, whereas
I don't fit in with you,

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.560
and I don't fit in with them.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.790
So it's first of
all, how do you get

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:58.390
rid of the awful
stereotypes from the movies

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:02.140
and the TV shows that are really
not doing anybody any good?

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.010
And how do you say
that there's room

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.180
for many different
kinds of people

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.960
that aren't currently in tech?

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.872
So DeBlasio saying everybody
has to take computer m at least

00:38:15.872 --> 00:38:17.330
you then get
everybody in the room,

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.310
and there's no more sense of,
oh, only those kids do it,

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:22.030
or you'll be stigmatized
if you do it.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:25.570
And if you do it, it's because
you have to take the class,

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:28.630
and then you
discover you love it.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:32.520
So one way to literally
get everybody doing

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:36.580
and lessen the stigma is to
require everybody to do it.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.830
The other way is for all
of us to be much more

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:44.610
alive to the
stereotypes, the images,

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.540
the decor, and who is
being attracted by it,

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:50.480
and who is being turned
off by it, and why.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.510
And to realize that even though
it sounds like small stuff,

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:55.060
it's very powerful stuff.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.720
So yeah, I totally
agree with you.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.890
But there definitely
were lines in here

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.267
that were saying that
we want to keep--

00:39:01.267 --> 00:39:03.600
that there are women and men
that are attracted to this.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.058
They're great, we want to keep
them, they should be happy--

00:39:06.058 --> 00:39:08.640
but that there are other
people that are actually

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.100
being kept away by thinking
that's the only way you have

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:11.690
to be.

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:12.190
Yeah.

00:39:14.162 --> 00:39:15.870
AUDIENCE: Law and
medicine are two fields

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:19.280
I can think of where
there's been an increasing

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.530
number of women-- certainly not
equal yet, but much better--

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:26.040
and they both seem to be fairly
geeky fields in the same manner

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.910
that computer science is.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.480
Do you have an
opinion on whether we

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.490
can learn any lessons
from those fields

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:35.720
and transfer them across
to sciences in general?

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.866
EILEEN POLLACK: So which
fields are you talking about?

00:39:39.866 --> 00:39:40.990
AUDIENCE: Law and medicine.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.230
EILEEN POLLACK: OK.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.410
Yeah.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:42.160
Great.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.420
So yeah, I do.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.080
So especially medicine.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.280
What happened in medicine
is really interesting.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.140
The big stumbling
block there used

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:53.400
to be medical school training.

00:39:56.249 --> 00:39:57.790
Well, first of all,
there were rules,

00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:59.090
and women couldn't be doctors.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:00.590
They would let them
into med school.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:02.260
But once they got
past that, there

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:03.880
were women who
wanted to be doctors,

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.570
but the training system was
a grueling hazing system

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.294
where you had to be on call
for, like, four days straight,

00:40:10.294 --> 00:40:11.210
and you could go home.

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:15.850
And it was incompatible
with human life.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.950
And especially if there
were children at home,

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:20.920
you couldn't just
disappear for four days,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.080
so only men who had a
wife at home who could

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.990
stay with the kids could do it.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.850
But it wasn't even
good for the men.

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:29.010
And it wasn't good
for the patients,

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.860
because a doctor who's been
up for four days straight

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.470
often screws something up.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.230
So along about the
time my ex-husband

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:40.730
was in medical school, we made
it through medical school.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.030
We made it through PhD.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:45.150
We didn't make it
much past that,

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.740
because these
issues are so hard.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:50.100
So he was never home.

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.040
So there was a
movement to change,

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:55.880
and it was partly because
women were entering the field,

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.860
and it was keeping
them out, and partly

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.330
because the men were finally
admitting that it was

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:02.180
destroying their lives, too.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.420
So there was a move to humanize
medical school training so

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.360
that you didn't have to give
up your marriage, your kids,

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.120
your whole life to do it.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.830
And that was a reason that more
women could go into the field.

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:17.960
They picked certain areas that
seemed more "girl friendly"

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.410
like being a pediatrician.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.420
But you know, it's
spreading now even

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.630
to some of the more
hardcore specialties.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.880
The reason that's
relevant is because I

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:31.344
think PhD training is
still a hazing like that.

00:41:31.344 --> 00:41:33.010
It's still much more
like medical school

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:34.450
from the old days,
where the idea

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:37.610
is, if you're not
serious-- if you're not

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.250
willing to be in the
lab 24/7 and give up

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:44.520
every other interest, and
forget about your spouse

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.590
and any responsibilities
to any other human being,

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:49.970
you're not serious, you
won't be taken seriously,

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.460
and you don't belong.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.030
And so we still
lose a lot of women.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:57.130
So it's just a-- grad school's
miserable for guys, too,

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:00.250
but they tend to be more
socialized to tough it out.

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:01.710
They have to have a career.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:06.650
People don't let them just
drop out as quickly and easily.

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:17.080
So that hazing period in a
profession tends to be a block.

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.890
And if you can get rid of that.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:23.760
So I think in terms of
fields where you need a PhD,

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:26.080
if you can do for the
PhD program, which

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:30.280
is humanize it the way medical
school training was humanized,

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.840
and convince people it's not
going to lower standards--

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.202
that if you're trying to run
a program or a [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:36.202 --> 00:42:37.660
after you've been
up for four days,

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.035
you're going to screw it up
the way you would have killed

00:42:40.035 --> 00:42:41.140
your patient.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.810
Now for tech, I think it's
more like what Anne Marie

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.200
Slaughter was saying
in her article, which

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.760
is just that if being
in a profession,

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:51.160
like that article
about, was it Amazon?

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.640
Where you just have to--
you're treated like crap

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:58.270
and have to work 900
hours a week-- you know,

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:03.230
that idea of what is needed to
be good at your field, I think,

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:06.790
is still something-- if
that applied to all fields,

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:09.490
if you can have
things more humane

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.340
and that's not the standard.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.930
The other part of it
is the stereotypes.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:17.080
So there's still this
very American idea

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.070
that somehow girl
femininity does not

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:24.420
equate with math,
computer, tech--

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:28.460
these stereotypes that girls
have picked up by second grade.

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:31.267
And one thing I was really
interested to discover

00:43:31.267 --> 00:43:32.850
in researching this
book is that's not

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.726
true in every other culture.

00:43:34.726 --> 00:43:36.600
There are a lot of
cultures where women don't

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.150
have certain other rights.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:41.000
But it's inconceivable to
the men in those cultures

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.160
that women wouldn't be as good
at science, math, computer

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.704
programming, whatever, coding.

00:43:46.704 --> 00:43:48.370
Which, if you're
American, you go, wait,

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:52.430
no that's such a basic
stereotype for us.

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.610
And yet in other
cultures, maybe the woman

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.154
needs her husband's permission
to go to a tech conference

00:43:57.154 --> 00:43:59.070
because there are going
to be other men there.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.110
But he doesn't think,
but no one thinks--

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.360
there are cultures that think
women are better at math

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.240
because women are more
creative than men.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.390
And that whole business
about how, you know, women

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.720
used to be the software
people, because it was seen

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.490
as just the secretarial work,
until the guys decided that

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.531
was the cool part, and
then they kicked them out.

00:44:16.531 --> 00:44:20.340
So just these-- being
alive to the hazing aspect,

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:24.220
the part that makes it
inhuman, but also the way

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.890
these stereotypes
are just-- I think

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:28.480
they're more pervasive
today than they

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.830
were when I was young.

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.670
There's even more
emphasis on women

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.920
being really
traditionally girly,

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.219
feminine, spending
all their time

00:44:37.219 --> 00:44:38.510
on planning weddings and stuff.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.390
And that's just
not-- and then they

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:44.540
get a stereotyped idea
of what tech is like,

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:45.930
and the two just don't mesh.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:48.190
So it's being
really, really alive

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.390
to the stereotypes
that are so different.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.890
Yeah.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:53.680
You were next.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:55.530
AUDIENCE: So I
don't know if you've

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.880
seen-- there's a woman online
who's known as The Geekess.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.246
She was doing Linux
kernel programming,

00:45:01.246 --> 00:45:02.620
and she's just
decided that she's

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:05.320
going to step out because
she's done with the hazing.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.230
She's done with the
combative attitude

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:10.100
of having to take a lot of
crap, which, of course, speaks

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.570
to what you were just saying.

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.160
But what you're addressing
is what, I think,

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.450
we at Google tend to refer to
as the pipeline issue, where

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:19.280
women aren't coming in.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.810
But there's also a substantial
issue where a lot of women,

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:24.360
once they're in and have
been here for awhile,

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:25.940
will then drop out.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:28.550
I know that's something that
we've seen with the numbers

00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:29.709
inside of Google.

00:45:29.709 --> 00:45:31.500
I don't know if I'm
allowed to actually say

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.540
what those numbers are.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:36.120
But certainly the higher
up the levels you go,

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.960
the fewer women there are.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:43.160
Do you have any ideas on how
to address the lack of role

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.550
models, given that there are
few women to act as role models

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.410
for women who are
joining the field,

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:52.086
it's much harder to
then stick around

00:45:52.086 --> 00:45:53.710
because you don't
have a model on which

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:54.870
to base what you're doing.

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:56.250
EILEEN POLLACK: For sure.

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:59.240
Well, first of all, I
focused in the book much more

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.420
on sort of the pipeline issues,
because my whole question

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.080
was, why didn't I go on?

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.670
And if I had gone on, and
I spent 10 years working

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:11.120
for a tech company, I
would have felt more secure

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.000
focusing on that.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.160
I should say that
I did do-- I taught

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.420
myself Fortran when
I was an undergrad

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.190
and did a program for a
professor, a scattering

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.690
program.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.240
We didn't have-- there were
no PCs, there were no screens,

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.450
so you had to do-- everything
came out printed on paper,

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.330
and you had to flip--
it was like a flipbook

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.050
to make the simulation work.

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.940
And then I worked at Oak Ridge
programming a simulation there.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.540
And so I have some
sense of this.

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:38.619
The sexism there was
just unbelievable.

00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:40.660
I think that was the worst
I've ever experienced.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:42.610
There was stuff called
job control language,

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:46.270
so you needed certain codes to
even get time on the computers.

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:49.820
And it was run by guys
in mirrored sunglasses

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.480
who literally would
make the women say or do

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:56.360
something sexy and suggestive
so they could find out

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.044
that they used JCL language.

00:46:58.044 --> 00:46:59.460
So I mean, I have
some idea of it,

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.550
but I feel like you
guys are the experts.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.190
That said, I've talked
to a lot of women.

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:09.120
And I think what's really
insidious is that it's

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:14.150
so many relatively
small obstacles,

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:18.580
insults, just hardships,
no one of which

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:21.400
is enough to make
you just go, that's

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.750
it, that's the last straw.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:25.300
But they accumulate.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:28.910
And in some ways-- so
a lot of what happens

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:31.562
is somebody finally
can't take it, and says,

00:47:31.562 --> 00:47:33.520
I'm just going to stay
home and raise the kids,

00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.144
or I'm going to do
something different.

00:47:35.144 --> 00:47:39.510
And then people use that to
justify that women are no good,

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:41.626
or that they actually
prefer something else.

00:47:41.626 --> 00:47:43.500
So the fact that I
eventually became a writer

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.280
caused people to write
to me and say, well, see?

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.420
You preferred a people field.

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.250
I'm like, no.

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.180
It was made so miserable for me.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.340
But it's gradual.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:56.990
So the analogy I sometimes
use is if you were at the gym,

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:00.240
and you're on a treadmaster, and
there's a guy on the next one.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.520
And you both think that the
incline, the resistance,

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.150
is the same.

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:08.060
But what you don't know is
yours is set higher, right?

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.190
And so you're both going,
and then you speed it up.

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:13.840
And you're sweating and
huffing and puffing,

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.210
and he's not so much, and you
think, what's wrong with me

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:19.250
that it's harder for me?

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:21.540
And he's looking over and
going, why is she sweating

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:22.540
and huffing and puffing?

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:24.570
We're both on the
same treadmill.

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.730
And then you give each
person one of those balls

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:29.750
at the gym that look the
same, but one's much heavier.

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.210
And you don't know yours is
heavier, because I don't know,

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:35.620
this data that you're not
sharing-- if everybody doesn't

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.620
know the data.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:40.670
That's child care, that's parent
care, that's house care, right?

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:44.030
And at some point you're just
like, not only am I exhausted,

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:45.530
but he's not.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.200
So I must not be
as good at this.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.370
This isn't worth it.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.180
I'll just go take a yoga class.

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.970
See, women just like
yoga classes, right?

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:57.280
So talking, registering
what's going on,

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.740
so the more that you
couldn't be aware of what's

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:02.380
going into the
fact that it seems

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:05.580
harder, to articulate
that, to bring it out,

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:08.580
to make as much public as
you can, to be aware of it

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.210
and to know what you're at
least experiencing and fighting,

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:16.270
that he got $890,000 to
set up his lab, and I got--

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:19.270
So the women at MIT in
the late '90s to whom this

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.260
first occurred, like, why
are we so much more tired

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.530
than the guys?

00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:25.470
Nobody wanted to share the data.

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:26.650
They forced the issue.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:28.100
Let's see salaries.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:33.250
They were on their hands and
knees measuring lab space.

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:37.170
So whatever it is that
you can articulate,

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:39.080
I think that that's
actually even more

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.620
important than literally
having a role model.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:45.170
There are a lot of guys who
are very sympathetic-- I'm

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:48.320
sure many of them are
in this room-- having

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:52.100
a sympathetic male
supervisor or role

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.330
model can be just as powerful.

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:57.010
And unfortunately, sometimes
it's so hard for a woman

00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:00.680
to get to a certain point that
by the time she gets there,

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:02.630
she's sort of like, I did it.

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:04.020
I did it my way.

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:08.300
And it can be harder to have
her as a role model than a guy,

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:12.520
because she's got
so much to defend.

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.330
So I sometimes hear from women
who disagree with everything

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:17.830
in my book and say,
none of this is true,

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.500
because it did apply to them.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.050
And I'm saying, right.

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:24.080
That's why you're the only woman
where you are, and it's great.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.720
I love what you did.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:27.680
But they're denying
that their reality--

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.270
they're saying their reality
is the same for everybody.

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:33.690
So it's also not
taking your role model

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:37.320
as, maybe, the obvious choice.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.980
My greatest role
model as a writer

00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.610
was an African American male
writer who was just brilliant,

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:46.370
and said everything
I needed to hear.

00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:48.780
And he was my role model.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.630
Whereas there were
some women writers,

00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:52.820
older women writers,
who were-- I

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.150
don't know whether they were
trying to toughen me up,

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:59.940
or they forgot that at my age,
they weren't so tough either,

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:01.396
or that they needed
encouragement

00:51:01.396 --> 00:51:02.270
when they were young.

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:07.080
So sometimes you just have to
pick different role models,

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:11.150
or say, oh, I can do it on my
own because-- not on my own,

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:13.730
but with other women at the
same level, and some men,

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:16.300
bring in male allies.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:20.220
Just trying to articulate
some those hidden stressors

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:23.760
and differences, and see
if you can work on those,

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.300
rather than just let it all
accumulate the way I did,

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:29.050
and walk away from
it, and then be my age

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:31.890
and regret that you let
people-- not that it's

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.980
your weakness or your fault,
but-- if I had known what

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:39.730
I was coping with, I don't know
that I would have walked away.

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:41.060
There was another question.

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.340
We have time for-- yeah.

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.350
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:46.530
So here I am.

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:47.030
I made it.

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:49.450
I did finish my PhD.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:52.370
And I am just really fortunate.

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:54.960
I went to an all-girl high
school, which set me up

00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.527
in college to not even-- I
really did not notice that I

00:51:58.527 --> 00:51:59.610
was in a room full of men.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:02.280
I have a very funny story
that I will spare you.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:06.670
And then I was fortunate to
find a female professor who

00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:09.060
thought highly of me
and went out of her way

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.260
to mentor not just me, but
other female scientists.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:12.940
She was my PhD adviser.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:16.310
And my research group
at my university,

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:18.830
we had parity, because
the two professors

00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:20.790
in charge of our group
went out of their way.

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:23.690
But I also have friends who
are software engineers, women

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.020
who are software engineers
at other companies.

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.169
And they really do
not have a good time

00:52:30.169 --> 00:52:31.210
in these other companies.

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:33.490
So I was kind of scared,
and I said, oh, thank god

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:34.990
I'm going to Google,
where they have

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:36.823
these things like
unconscious bias training,

00:52:36.823 --> 00:52:38.740
and they care about this.

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.500
So I guess the question is,
if we are here and we made it,

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.727
what do we do to help?

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:46.060
I mean, I'm not going to go
and be teaching high school,

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.476
because that's not
my temperament.

00:52:47.476 --> 00:52:50.559
But what can I realistically
do to help the women behind me?

00:52:50.559 --> 00:52:52.350
EILEEN POLLACK: First
of all, that's great.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:56.660
And I have to say that although
I don't think studies have been

00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:00.210
done to back this up,
after just six months doing

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.590
the research on
that book, I felt

00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:03.610
like I could tell
if a woman had gone

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:08.260
to an all-girl high school, or
if an African American student

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:12.010
had gone to a historically black
college, because was something

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.970
about that experience
of-- especially in junior

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:19.870
high and high school, say, in
a single-sex institution-- it's

00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:23.650
almost like you get inoculated
against the stuff that really

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:26.150
was so hard for me,
needing the encouragement,

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:27.880
lacking the confidence.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.300
I don't know how it weighs
out against whether there

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.640
are disadvantages of it.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.060
But even later, when
women say then they're

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.920
in the room with
men, they just don't

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:40.840
seem to experience the same
psychological hindrances.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:42.340
And I think that's
really important.

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:45.030
So with that Harvey Mudd
College, what they're

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:49.980
doing now, that first course,
separating people out,

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:53.170
so that there's
room for-- it tends

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:55.280
to be mostly women,
but some guys, too,

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.150
who have had no experience,
so they are not kind of

00:53:58.150 --> 00:54:01.170
intimidated away by
the mostly guys who

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:03.410
feel really good
about their skills,

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.640
and are all too ready to show.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.730
So that keeping things
separate at least long enough

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:12.150
that people get their legs under
them, I think, is important.

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:15.140
So if you're working at the
college level, that's one way.

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.080
So you're not really
separating by gender,

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:21.720
except it ends up being gender
influenced with the experience.

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:27.860
I think, really,
the work to do is

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:30.560
trying to-- if there are
things that work here,

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:33.660
trying to get other
industries to adopt, like,

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.070
what are the best practices?

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:36.060
Can you publish?

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.710
Can you write Op Ed pieces?

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.970
I'm the one they're asking
to write the Op Ed pieces.

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:43.110
If you were writing it, you'd
know even more what to say.

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:46.190
And then people read it and
it spreads to other companies.

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:47.830
And to work on these images.

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:51.990
Like if you're watching a
show or movie, and the imagery

00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:56.250
of who is or isn't a
computer scientist,

00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:59.000
or what it's like to
work in the field.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.330
You can get people
to exert pressure,

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.330
on Facebook or wherever,
on whoever made the movie

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:06.490
or is selling the product.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:10.400
So yeah, I think there
are things to do.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:13.110
Get support groups going.

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:17.950
Go in to other companies to
be a role model or a mentor.

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:22.177
But yeah, I think
especially what

00:55:22.177 --> 00:55:24.510
you were talking about with
the single-sex institutions,

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:28.880
it's very powerful.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.195
Any other questions?

00:55:30.195 --> 00:55:30.694
Yeah.

00:55:34.086 --> 00:55:35.710
AUDIENCE: So you
talked a lot about how

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:39.770
the images of who computer
scientists and programmers are

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:43.110
influences people's perceptions.

00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:47.920
But has there been
any study about what

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.870
computer science is used for?

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:52.050
So sort of the
popular conception

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:57.600
of Silicon Valley disrupting
industries, and sort of it

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.900
tends to be very
aggressive language.

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:05.000
Does that turn off people who
just don't see what programming

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.820
could be used for that's sort
of constructive or creative

00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:08.320
or artistic?

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.778
EILEEN POLLACK:
Yeah, very much so.

00:56:09.778 --> 00:56:12.320
And Cheryan works on that, and
some other people have, too.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.940
So there are two levels of that.

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.580
So the students who
are just, maybe,

00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:20.260
thinking of going into the
field and taking a first class,

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:23.040
or thinking about, maybe,
do I want to major in that?

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.540
And then that-- it's extremely
important, like, well,

00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:28.150
what would I use this for?

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:31.580
And basically, people
have no idea what

00:56:31.580 --> 00:56:33.740
you do with coding,
which seems--

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:37.090
I know if you actually do
it, you know it's everything.

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:40.000
But you don't get that if
you don't know what it is.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.590
And so one of the things
Harvey Mudd lets students do

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:46.490
is pick their own projects.

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:48.072
So that would make
it easy for you.

00:56:48.072 --> 00:56:49.530
I mean, you're
given some guidance,

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.840
but you can pick the thing
that seems important for you

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.230
to work on.

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:56.020
There's some notion
that young women

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.660
want to work on people
fields or things that

00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.940
will benefit humanity.

00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:03.910
I've never really
seen a study that

00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:05.650
proves that to my satisfaction.

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:08.130
And I always wonder where
that notion comes from.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:10.906
I think it gets
drummed into your head,

00:57:10.906 --> 00:57:12.280
if you're a girl,
that you should

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:17.270
want to work on some people
field that's good for humanity,

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:19.760
because I remember
people saying it to me.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.630
Like I'd say I want
to be a physicist,

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:24.490
and I remember my social
studies teacher saying, no,

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:26.480
you should want to
work on a people field.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.910
So where does it
really come from?

00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:30.390
But that's a lot
of the work that's

00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:35.010
being done with girls'
coding clubs, robotics clubs.

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:37.660
A lot of work is
actually being done.

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:39.560
It's never enough,
but they're trying

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:42.660
to work with like seventh and
eighth grade girls in clubs,

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.110
like, what would
you use coding for,

00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:47.860
and is this something
that's enjoyable to you?

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.170
And it's not to blow
people's heads up

00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:53.340
on a video game or something.

00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:56.380
And then there's
the level at which,

00:57:56.380 --> 00:58:00.480
once you start to be in
the culture, the aggression

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:04.150
and the competitiveness--
that's more the hazing stuff

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:06.610
that I was talking about
before, the culture.

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:10.950
And again, a big part of what
I'm trying to do, especially

00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:13.900
in physics, but it's the
exact same thing here,

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.580
is change that culture,
because I just don't think it's

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:18.240
healthy for anybody.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.790
And I think there are a lot of
guys who don't like it, and get

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:25.850
caught up in it because it's the
way they think they have to be.

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:31.950
So I was one of two women
who were the first graduates

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:32.870
with a physics degree.

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:36.770
The other woman became
just a whiz programmer.

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:39.410
I mean, she's just brilliant.

00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:42.240
She started at Bell Labs, worked
at all these other places.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.370
And she's been
kind of edged out.

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:47.210
She's currently unemployed.

00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:49.360
And she's utterly brilliant.

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:57.770
But the competitive, sexist,
ageist stuff just-- she got

00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:58.500
edged out.

00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.690
So it's working on that culture
when you see it, calling it,

00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:05.460
like, why did you have to
talk to the person that way?

00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:07.180
Or if somebody
presents something,

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:08.900
do you have to
jump on them first?

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:12.020
Could you maybe say what
was good about what they did

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:14.400
before you make suggestions?

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.840
That's the difference.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.380
One last thing is, one
thing that struck me.

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:26.340
So Dropbox was trying to
recruit more minority employees.

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:29.595
And they had one African
American engineer

00:59:29.595 --> 00:59:31.250
who was pretty high up.

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:33.990
And he went-- I don't know
if it was his alma mater.

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:38.610
He just decided to go to, I
think it was Howard University.

00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:44.220
And he said, how many
of you use Dropbox?

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:47.570
And a lot of them raised their
hands, because a lot of us

00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:48.690
use Dropbox.

00:59:48.690 --> 00:59:50.890
He said, well, wouldn't
you like to come work

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:54.270
for the company that
makes this happen?

00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:56.277
And they're like,
yeah, we really would.

00:59:56.277 --> 00:59:57.360
Would you like us to come?

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.740
Because nobody's ever
recruited anybody here,

00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:01.990
and we'd love to do this.

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:06.760
Part of it was they didn't know,
oh, yeah, I use this thing.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.680
It would be fun to
create stuff like this.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:13.340
So that's part of it,
knowing what you do with it.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.640
But also thinking you're
wanted, because you

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.680
look at the room, or the
movie, or the whatever,

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.120
and there's nobody who
looks like you there,

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.480
and nobody's coming to
your school to recruit.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.750
So yeah, all of the above.

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:27.208
What are you going
to do with this?

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:29.870
And I think what happens is,
once you're in the field,

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:33.110
it's so obvious to
you that to get back

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:36.020
down to the level of an eighth
grade girl or an eighth grade

01:00:36.020 --> 01:00:40.890
boy, or an African American
kid-- you know, why is it

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:42.950
not obvious to them?

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:44.950
Where was it that you
picked up the ideas,

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:51.080
and how are these people either
being welcomed or scared away?

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.940
That's sort of where it is.

01:00:55.630 --> 01:01:00.040
I think that I'm being signaled
that we have our time up.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.110
So I will stick around
as long as you'd like me,

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:04.470
if anybody wants the book.

01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:06.110
But thanks so much
for inviting me.

01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.520
I really am glad I
got to meet you guys.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:12.170
[APPLAUSE]
