1
00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.370
One of my jars of coins.
Got To

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.680
that wasn't very far.
They've even been on one row.
All right,

3
00:00:08.681 --> 00:00:12.250
well wisdom along that William along this row,
foster cat is just shaken pass.

4
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:17.251
Now I everybody who is everybody who has had a hose at access to those jars.

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.250
Can you please write down on your notebook,
just write down,

6
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.770
but don't judge your neighbor right down for each of those two jobs,

7
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.890
how many coins you think are in the small jar and how many coins you think are

8
00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:34.054
in the large job,

9
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.370
how many Koreans in kind of the small char and how many coins you think are in

10
00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:42.010
the lodge.
All right,
keep passing it along.

11
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.070
All right,

12
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.780
so today I want to talk about auctions and just to put this in the context of

13
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:53.530
the whole class,

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.800
way back on the very first day of the class we talked about different types of

15
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:04.120
people playing games.
We talked about evil gets versus indignant angels.

16
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.390
And then for most of the course,
really until this week,

17
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.380
we've been assuming that you knew who it was you were playing,

18
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:12.550
you knew your own payoffs,

19
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.020
but you also knew who it was you were playing against or with.
All right?

20
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.940
But the feature that new feature of this week has been that we're looking at

21
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:26.380
settings where you don't necessarily know what are the payoffs of the other

22
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:28.720
people involved in the game or strategic situation.

23
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.540
So in the sibling model we looked at last time,

24
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.610
the different types of worker had different types of payoffs from going to,

25
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.060
from going to uh,
uh,
uh,

26
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.490
does it get an Mba from going to business school and they yielded different

27
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:45.280
payoff to you if you hired them.
All right,
let's wait.

28
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.220
And we have to model the game where you didn't quite know the payoff to the

29
00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:49.390
people you were playing against.

30
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.580
And similarly an auction is we're going to study today is such a static.

31
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.940
Typically in an auction you are competing or playing with or against the other

32
00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:04.744
bidders,

33
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.710
but typically you don't know something crucial about those other bidders.

34
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.720
You don't know how much they value the good in question,
right?

35
00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:13.931
Somebody,

36
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:18.070
there's a good out for sale and you don't know how much they value that.
Good.

37
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.770
So I want to start off by thinking about a little bit of this,

38
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:24.250
of informational structure of auctions and then we'll get into more detail as we

39
00:02:24.251 --> 00:02:28.690
go along.
And the first thing I wanted to distinguish our two extremes.

40
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.270
One extreme,
I want to talk about common values.

41
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.040
I know the other extreme I want to talk about private values.

42
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.780
So the idea of a common value auction is that the good that is for sale

43
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.950
ultimately has the same value for whoever buys it

44
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.400
all right?

45
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.300
Now that doesn't mean they're all going to be provided to bid the same amount

46
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.130
because they may not know what that value is,
right?
That for example,

47
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.380
imagine there's an oil well,
right answer.
There's an oil one out that there's,

48
00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:10.491
there's,

49
00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:14.620
it doesn't oil reserve out that and different companies are trying to estimate

50
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.120
how much they want to bid for the right to draw oil out of this oil field.

51
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.650
Each of them is going to make it a little practice well and get some estimate of

52
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:26.950
how much oil there isn't the well,
so they're gonna be different amounts.

53
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.690
But at the end of the day,
what comes out of that?
Well,

54
00:03:29.691 --> 00:03:30.870
it's the same for everybody.
It's the,

55
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.540
that is just one amount of oil in that well and that oil is just worth one

56
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:37.360
amount,
uh,
at the market price.
All right,

57
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.290
so that's a classic example of a common value auction.

58
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.410
<v 2>The value,
oh,
the good for sale,</v>

59
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.380
the true value for like,
it's the same for all

60
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.460
and willing to use an invitation v Okay

61
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.770
<v 0>to do note this common value that this object has.</v>

62
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.600
Now the other extreme is private value and it's really such an extreme.

63
00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:07.190
It's hard to think of good examples,

64
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.430
but the idea is that the value of the good at hand is not only is it different

65
00:04:12.861 --> 00:04:13.694
for everybody,

66
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.880
but my evaluation of this good has no bearing whatsoever on your value for the

67
00:04:19.401 --> 00:04:24.401
good and your value for the good has no bearing whatsoever on my value for them.

68
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.140
<v 2>All right?
All right,
so here's a case where the value of the good,</v>

69
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.640
the ultimate value of the good in question

70
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.280
no one is it different for all.
Okay,

71
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.880
<v 0>how many is it different for all?
But moreover it's completely,
it isn't cratic</v>

72
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.500
<v 2>and my value</v>

73
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.740
is irrelevant

74
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.410
to you.
All right?

75
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.150
<v 0>So if you,
if you buy,</v>

76
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.320
if you happen to buy this good and you learn that in fact I valued a lot that

77
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:11.950
makes no difference to how well how happy you feel that having bought the good

78
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.630
right now these are extremes and most of reality lies between or actually give

79
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.270
you a notation.
Let's Use v sub I,

80
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.920
let's Use v Saabye to be the private values.
Were I the notes,

81
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.840
the player in question there.

82
00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:31.050
These are extremes and most things lie in between.

83
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.880
So we already mentioned that on this extreme close to this extreme,

84
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.090
you could think about the oil wells.
All right.

85
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.330
Oil Wells are pretty much common value.
Good.

86
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.020
There's a certain amount of oil there and that's all there is to it.
However,

87
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.110
even there you could imagine that the different firms have different costs on

88
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:56.220
extracting that oil or these different firms have their machinery occupied to

89
00:05:56.221 --> 00:06:00.200
different extents in other wells that they're digging.
So even in that pure case,

90
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.330
seemingly perfect example of a common value,

91
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.630
it probably isn't literally a common value.
All right?

92
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.500
Or these different firms have different distances between the wells on their

93
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.940
refineries.
All right,

94
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.330
so the oil one is a good example of something that's close to common value,

95
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.510
but it isn't really literally common value probably in reality,

96
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.230
once tempted to say that homes are private value after all my evaluation,

97
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:29.390
my happiness from living in my house is not really affected by how happy you

98
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:31.390
would feel living in my house.
Right?

99
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.200
I didn't really care if you would like to live in my house,

100
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.420
so if you wouldn't like to live in my house because I'm the person living in it.

101
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.610
Is that right?
Is that right?
Bots?
There's a catch here.
What's the catch?

102
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.460
Which makes homes not literally private valley.

103
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.003
What's the catch?

104
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.910
The catch is that at some point in time,
I may want to resell my hope,

105
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.520
right?
The home is a durable good.
It's,
it's,
it's a consumption.
Good.

106
00:06:56.521 --> 00:07:01.170
My living in it.
That's a private value.
All right,
but it's also an investment.

107
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:01.680
Good.

108
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.920
I'm going to want to resell that home at some point when I'm kicked out of Yale

109
00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:08.190
or whatever.
All right,
and then at that point,
which I eat salads,

110
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.160
I'm going to care a lot about how much you value is right?

111
00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:13.710
Because that's going to affect the price that I'm going to get at the end of the

112
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.780
day.
So in a,
in the case of a home,

113
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.800
it's somewhere between a private value and a colon.
A value.

114
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.650
<v 1>Okay?</v>

115
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.040
<v 0>It's true that the consumption part might be private value,</v>

116
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.750
but the investment component introduced is common values.
All right.

117
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.560
So really for private values,
for pure private values,

118
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.360
we need to think about pure consumption goods.
Goods that I consume,

119
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.690
they have no investment value.
They have no resale value.

120
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.520
So think about some good being sold on Ebay.
It's a cake.
It's a cake.

121
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.390
So if I buy it once,
I've eaten it,
I can't resell it,
I can't have my cake.

122
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:55.310
And we started.
All right.
So think about pure consumption of goods over here.

123
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.310
And even in these pure consumption goods,

124
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.040
I mustn't get any psychological value out of thinking.

125
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.410
I managed to get that cake and you didn't.
All right.

126
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:11.810
So the private value case is really an extreme thing,

127
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.560
but it turns out to be a useful abstraction when we come to consider things

128
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:19.820
further.
All right?
Now where's my jars?
Got To?
Am I jealous?
Oh,
plenty.
I said,
okay,

129
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:23.840
so I can suddenly,
I've got 72 rows I can,
I can play with here.

130
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.120
Let's talk about this auction for the jar.

131
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:29.540
So what we're gonna do is we're going to have people bid for the,

132
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.960
for the value in the jar.
They're going to get,
they,

133
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.180
they going to put forward a bid.
The highest bidder is gonna win.

134
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.060
And what they're going to win is the amount of money in the jar because they're

135
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.290
going to pay.
Is that bitch?
All right.
So what is that?

136
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.800
Is that a common value or a private value?

137
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.060
That's a common value,
right?
There is a certain amount of money in that jar.

138
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.560
You don't know what it is,

139
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.120
but there is a certain amount of money in that jar and that's the common value.

140
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.820
All right,
so pretty much our jaws of Koreans.

141
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.003
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

142
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.850
<v 0>light over here.
That probably even a pure example down the oil.
Well,</v>

143
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.290
all right,
now let me get the first.
Let me get the first two rows of the,

144
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:16.290
of the class.
So,
uh,
this row here and this row here,

145
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.620
all of you have,
all of you have now had a chance to have a look at the jars.

146
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.670
Let me just get you to write down on without looking at each other at each
other.

147
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.860
Write down on your notepads and you've already written down how many jars do
you,

148
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:32.490
how many coins you can,
the jar for the,
for the,
uh,
for the large jar.

149
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.530
We'll do the large door first.
Write down your bed.
You can't cheek later on.

150
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.510
Write down your bed.
All right,
well we're playing this for real cash,
right?

151
00:09:41.511 --> 00:09:44.430
So if you win,
you're going to have to pay me.
All right?

152
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:47.590
So write down what you're going to be.
Well,
I might not hold it to you if you,

153
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.810
if it's too crazy,
but we'll,
we'll,
we'll see what will,

154
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.770
at least in principle plank for real cash.
All right?
So write down your bit.

155
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.500
Show without changing a bed.
Show your neighbor your bed.

156
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.863
<v 2>All right.</v>

157
00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.680
<v 0>Alright,
now what I'm going to do is if I can just borrow,
borrow out a second.
Uh,</v>

158
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.840
here's some shock.
Let me,
um,

159
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.530
let me go along the row and find out what those beds were.

160
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.100
[inaudible] want to record the beds.
All right?

161
00:10:13.101 --> 00:10:15.040
So we're gonna record everybody's beatable.

162
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.210
Come back and talk about it afterwards.
Alright,
what are those jars,
by the way?

163
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.700
Let's have a look at the west.
The jog on it.
Who's,

164
00:10:21.701 --> 00:10:24.800
who's got the large jar that hold up the light?
Yeah,
the woman in the corner.

165
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.700
Hold up that large jars.
Everyone can see it.
All right.
That's,
that's the bit,

166
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:33.500
it's a,
it's a,
it's a coins in a Sainsbury's Pesto Jar.

167
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.950
Since risk pastor turned out to be quite good.
All right.
Okay.

168
00:10:36.951 --> 00:10:40.880
So I wouldn't bother with names today.
I'm just gonna get your beds.
All right.

169
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.000
Evidence.
Everyone's written down a bait.
No one's gonna cheese.
All right,

170
00:10:44.001 --> 00:10:48.410
so what is your bed?
$4 and 50 cents.
$4 and 50 cents.

171
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.240
$3 she shouted.

172
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:55.100
US ever going to hear $3 $4 99 cents.

173
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.230
All right,
I'm going to pass this along.
So

174
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:01.580
<v 2>80 cents,
three 80.</v>

175
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.610
<v 0>That's a shout loud on that.
What was that?</v>

176
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.870
[inaudible] 83 $84 $4 again.

177
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:12.010
Do dollars and 9 cents.
$2 and 9 cents.
$3

178
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:16.070
<v 2>[inaudible] $62 and 1 cent.</v>

179
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:24.360
<v 0>Sorry.
The last,
uh,
the last one was what?
What?
We're going to two a water here.</v>

180
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.800
That was after I won 60 though.
That was off throw one 16

181
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.630
all right.
Sorry.
Yep.
89 cents 89 cents just for the big jar.

182
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.770
The big job.
One 41 40 all right.
Are we going a second rows worth of people?

183
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.850
40114150150 $3 $3 $2 $2 four 54 $55 $5 we're getting some high ones now.

184
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.240
1 cent.
1 cent.
Okay.

185
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.790
What's wrong with my job?
Okay.
All right.
Pass that along.

186
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.550
Second,
crazy.
88 that was an AC.

187
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.580
150150150 $9 a dollar dollar $20 20 and three more.

188
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.020
And dollar 50 a dollar.
$52.
All right,

189
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:24.520
so you have lots of bids.
And the winner is,
uh,
the last one was $2.

190
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.850
I've actually forgotten how many coins were in here.
Let me just remind myself.

191
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:36.400
This was the large jar,
right?
Okay.
No,
no,
no.
I know again,
okay.
All right.

192
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:37.960
So who is all winner that,
uh,

193
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.260
I've got a four 50 a five.
There's a fine.
Okay,
so here's,

194
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.820
here's our winner.
Who's our winner.
Okay,

195
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:53.680
so let's,
that's how have a to stand up a second.
All right,

196
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.640
so now a round of applause for our window,
right?
Yeah.

197
00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.970
<v 3>All right.</v>

198
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.190
<v 0>No,
let's talk about how people Baden,
why they paid that amount,
that amount.
Okay.</v>

199
00:13:05.191 --> 00:13:08.520
So let's start with all winner.
Alright,
let's start with our winner.

200
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.350
All right.
So why don't you bid $5?

201
00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:19.170
It looked like there could be about $5.
So I've gotten your name.

202
00:13:19.171 --> 00:13:20.010
My name is Ashley.

203
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.630
So Ashley is saying she bayed roughly $5 cause it looked like there was about $5

204
00:13:24.631 --> 00:13:27.840
in there.
Plus she gets the jar.
Plus you get the jaw.
I,
yeah,
I'm not sure.

205
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:30.570
I'm throwing it in the jar.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
So let's,

206
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.800
let's solve a few other people and see what they say.
What did you say again?

207
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.260
I said a buck 60 because,
um,

208
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.690
I didn't want to over a estimated because then I'd have to pay you more than I'd

209
00:13:42.691 --> 00:13:45.300
get.
All right,
so,
so what was your,
what was your estimate?

210
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.890
My estimate was about one 80 to 200.
All right.

211
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.120
So your estimate was one 80 to 200 and you bet around one 60 a person next to

212
00:13:54.121 --> 00:13:57.700
you?
Um,
well I guess three and same reasoning.
I,

213
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.850
I thought they would probably be about $4 and then I asked,
I valued at like $1.

214
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.270
All right,
so,
so you,
you thought there's about $4 worth of coin,

215
00:14:06.271 --> 00:14:08.940
then you actually bid three.
Three.
All right,

216
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.810
so all of you actually wrote down initially how many coins you thought were in

217
00:14:12.811 --> 00:14:16.770
there,
right?
Is that right?
Let's just get some idea of the distribution of those.

218
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.180
So how many people thought there was less than a dollar in there?

219
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.790
What brings out the no shame here?
Just raise your hands.

220
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.750
How many people thought that was between a dollar and a dollar?
50.

221
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.370
How many of you thought it was a dollar between a dollar 50 and $2?

222
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.940
Some might be on the back of your hand.
Okay.

223
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.660
How many people thought it was between $2 and $2 50 [inaudible] older between

224
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:44.070
two to $2 50 and $3 right?
How about,

225
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.930
how about more than three 50
alright,

226
00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.040
I'll clear the people who bit hired hit.
Okay,

227
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.660
so we have a whole of estimates there and wide range of estimates,

228
00:14:54.661 --> 00:14:58.880
a wide range of beds and people are saying things like,
wow,

229
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:01.580
I thought my baby was,
I thought it was this many coins in there.

230
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.330
Maybe I shaded down a little bit from the number of coins I thought was in there

231
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:08.270
because I want to make some profit on this.
Is that right?
That's kind of the,

232
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.800
that's kind of the explanations I'm hearing from people.
All right.
And Oh,

233
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.750
what I want you to suggest is that not a very good way to bid in this auction.

234
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:20.190
Right?
All right.

235
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.180
Just repeat what I think people date and people can contradict me if this is

236
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:26.990
wrong.
I think most people,
they look to the,
there,
they shook this thing,

237
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:28.730
they waited a bit,

238
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.990
they figured out there was let's say three 50 worth of pennies in that.

239
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.290
And then they said,
okay,
three 50 so I'll bid,
I don't know,

240
00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:39.910
three to 43 30 isn't like that.
All right,

241
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.320
so what's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?

242
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.980
All right,
well,
first of all to reveal it,
so something wrong with it.

243
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:53.190
Let me tell you how many Koreans were in there now in the larger jar there where

244
00:15:53.321 --> 00:15:55.570
it was $2 and 7 cents.

245
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.510
$2 and 7 cents.

246
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:03.220
How many of you paid more than $2 and 7 cents [inaudible] raise your hands.

247
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.750
All right.
All right.
Quite a few of you.
All right.
All right,

248
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.930
so what we see here is a number of people including our winner bid a lot more

249
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.800
than that.
Then the number of coins and the job.
All right.

250
00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:22.090
What we find is by a lot is that the winning bid

251
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.130
was much,
much greater than the true value,

252
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.830
and this is a common phenomenon in common value auctions.
It's such a common,

253
00:16:37.831 --> 00:16:40.530
but it's such a common phenomenon that it has a name.

254
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.590
The name is the winner's curse.

255
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.560
It's the winner's curse

256
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:55.810
and the main lesson of the first half of the day is going to be,

257
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.620
let's figure out why there is exist to winner's curse.

258
00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.830
Let's try and avoid falling into a winner's curse.

259
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.160
And maybe that's even forgot how to do better.
All right,

260
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:11.700
so let's try and think through why it is we fall into a winner's curse.

261
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.643
All right?

262
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:24.690
So one way to think about this is to think about naive bidding in this context.

263
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:29.560
So I suppose what people suppose people's strategy,

264
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:34.150
suppose people's strategy was actually to bid their estimate.

265
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.370
I know that isn't what people did.
Most people shade to the rest of it,

266
00:17:36.371 --> 00:17:40.420
a little base,
but most people get pretty close to their estimate.
All right?

267
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.100
What's going to happen in that instance is what people are going to bid

268
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.470
essentially what they,
what they think it's worth.
And we just saw that fully,
uh,

269
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.660
fully were half of you.
I think half of the people like we,

270
00:17:52.661 --> 00:17:57.060
we sampled overestimated the number of coins in there.
That right?

271
00:17:57.061 --> 00:18:00.330
We just have that show of hands.
How many people raise your hands again,

272
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:01.061
just be honest.
If you,

273
00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:05.730
if you thought it was more than two oh seven in that as maybe maybe roughly a

274
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:06.090
half,
roughly,

275
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.810
maybe a little bit less than a half of you overestimated the number of coins in

276
00:18:09.811 --> 00:18:11.940
there.
Now?
What's that?
What's that going to mean?

277
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:16.350
It's going to mean all of those people who have this overestimates are going to

278
00:18:16.351 --> 00:18:18.750
overbid.
All right?

279
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.020
But we can be a little bit more general and a little bit more rigorous about

280
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:25.860
this.
So let's try and be a little bit more general.
All right,
so first of all,

281
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.100
let's just make sure we understand what the payoffs are.
This auction,

282
00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.400
<v 1>the payoff in this auction</v>

283
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.953
is what

284
00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.080
<v 0>you get the true value.
You get the number of of of Koans,</v>

285
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.350
a number of pennies in the jar,
minus your bed

286
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.970
<v 1>if you are the highest</v>

287
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.260
<v 0>and you get zero.
Otherwise,</v>

288
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.140
hi around.
Just I think it's straight forward.

289
00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:05.410
We all understand that's what the value is and what do people do?

290
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.500
People try to estimate this is,
this is not a mistake.

291
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.360
People tried to estimate how many coins were in the jaw.
Now,
in fact,

292
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.320
the true number of coins on the jaw was V,
which turned out to be two,

293
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.750
207 all right?

294
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.460
But when people estimate is they don't get it exactly right.

295
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:27.640
Neither here where you're shaking the jar,
nor in the case of these oil samples.

296
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.780
All right,

297
00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:33.580
so what they actually estimates each person forms an estimate,

298
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:35.560
which we could.
Cool.

299
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:40.590
Why I and this why we could think of as being the truth plus noise.

300
00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.750
So it's quite Absalon I that's even been a tiller of art.
Make it clear.

301
00:19:46.751 --> 00:19:49.390
It's kind of a random cell.
All right,

302
00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.820
so for some people epsilon I is a,
it's going to be a positive amounts,

303
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.950
which means they're gonna own our estimates.

304
00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.350
The value or the number of coins in the jar,

305
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.950
and for some people apps on is going to be a negative amount,

306
00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.160
which means they're gonna underestimate the number of codons in the job.

307
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.210
All right?
Everyone agree with that?
That doesn't,

308
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.440
that's not a controversial statement,
right?
Does that ever okay with that?

309
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:17.020
All right,
so let's think about the distribution of these wise.

310
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.640
Let's draw a picture

311
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:25.620
that has on the horizontal access all the different estimates that people could

312
00:20:27.131 --> 00:20:29.710
form of the number of coins on the jar.

313
00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.770
And let's anchor this by v.

314
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:38.050
So here's V and here is going to be the,
if you like,

315
00:20:38.051 --> 00:20:40.870
the probability of getting that estimate.
All right,
so the number,

316
00:20:40.871 --> 00:20:44.590
the frequency or probability of estimating,

317
00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:49.660
why I given that fee I,
is that all right,

318
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.950
so I don't know what the shape of this distribution is,

319
00:20:51.951 --> 00:20:55.780
but my guess is it's kind of bell shaped,
is that right?
So it's probably,

320
00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:01.030
it probably looks something like this.
Right?
Let me that.

321
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:04.890
That's implausible.
All right.
And we can actually test this and we had time,

322
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.340
we could actually go round all of you and get you to report what their estimates

323
00:21:08.341 --> 00:21:11.760
were and we could plot that distribution and Steve,
it is bell shape,
but I,

324
00:21:11.761 --> 00:21:14.740
my guess is it's reasonable to assume it's spelled shapes,
right?

325
00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.210
There's some central tendency to estimate.
There's something close to the truth.

326
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.330
If I draw on this correctly,
I'd have its highest point at v.

327
00:21:21.331 --> 00:21:24.180
I haven't quite done it correctly.
All right.
I'd say it's probably,

328
00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.700
it's probably roughly symmetric.
Okay.

329
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:32.270
So now suppose that people's bidding strategy is pretty much what they reported.

330
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.950
People are going to bid roughly the estimates of the number of coins and the

331
00:21:37.951 --> 00:21:40.890
jar.
It's suppose people bid.

332
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.333
<v 1>Okay?</v>

333
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:50.020
<v 2>People bid bi roughly equal</v>

334
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.950
<v 0>to why I,
so I know people are going to shade a little bit,</v>

335
00:21:52.951 --> 00:21:56.840
but let's ignore that for now.
All want to be able to fit in roughly equal to y.

336
00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:58.803
<v 1>All right,</v>

337
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:04.070
<v 0>so what's going to happen here?
All right.
Who's gonna?
Who's gonna win?</v>

338
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.670
Who's gonna?
Wait,
if people bet,

339
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:11.060
if this is the way in which the yr is emerge naturally in life,
right?

340
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.210
There's a v as a true vi and then people make some estimate of it,

341
00:22:14.211 --> 00:22:18.110
which is essentially via v plus noise.
Who's going to end up being the winner?

342
00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:20.480
The winner of the,
of the auction.

343
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.280
It's going to be the person who has the highest estimates,
right answers.

344
00:22:25.281 --> 00:22:26.450
It's really a lot of people.

345
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:30.710
The winner isn't going to be the person who estimated correctly at v.

346
00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.200
The winner's going to be way out here somewhere,
right?

347
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.200
The wind is going to be

348
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:43.230
way up in the right hand tail.
Why?
Because the winner,

349
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.163
<v 1>the winner,</v>

350
00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:50.850
<v 2>we'll will then be</v>

351
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:56.970
the eye.

352
00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.350
Who's why I,

353
00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:04.990
<v 0>it's the biggest is the maximum.</v>

354
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.370
And the problem with this is the person who is white is the biggest,

355
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.590
has what they have the biggest era,
right?

356
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.790
The person who's why I as the Max,

357
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.510
hi e epsilon,
I

358
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:25.920
is the Max.
And that's exactly what happened when we did estimates just now.

359
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.390
The person who won was the person who who,
uh,
I Ashley,

360
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:35.630
who had estimated to be roughly maybe a little bit more than $5 worth of coins

361
00:23:36.391 --> 00:23:38.760
in there.
So I'm guessing yes,
that's right.

362
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:43.200
That no one else estimated more than $5 and these two roads,
is that correct?

363
00:23:43.201 --> 00:23:44.250
No one estimated more than $5.

364
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.930
So the person who the highest estimate bid the most,

365
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:52.130
which is pretty close to her estimates and that caused her to lose money.
Right.

366
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:55.850
He ends up owing me a whatever it is,
one 91 93,

367
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.870
which I will collect it afterwards.
All right.
All right.

368
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.150
So the winner's curse is caused by this.

369
00:24:02.151 --> 00:24:07.151
It's caused by if people bid taking into account that own estimate and only that

370
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:13.460
own estimates of the number of coins and the jar or the amount of oil in the
oil,

371
00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:17.840
well then the winner ended up being the person with the highest estimates,

372
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:21.530
which means the person with the highest era.
All right?

373
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.100
So No cess what this leads to it on average,

374
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.040
<v 2>on average,
the bid,</v>

375
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.320
the bid,
the winning bid,

376
00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.950
the winning bid,
and he's going to be much,
much bigger than the truth

377
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.793
is that right?

378
00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:47.970
<v 0>Biggest era.
It's typically going to be way out in this right tail,</v>

379
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.490
and that's going to be,
people are going to lose money.
All right?

380
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.420
So this phenomenon is very general because common value auctions are very

381
00:24:56.421 --> 00:24:57.140
general.

382
00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:02.000
I already mentioned the oil fields in the early period after World War II when

383
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:06.350
the u s government's,
I did auctioning out the rights to drill oil in the Gulf.

384
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.310
All right?
So,
uh,
and the,
and the Gulf of Mexico,
uh,

385
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.290
early on it was observed that these companies are the winning companies or

386
00:25:13.291 --> 00:25:16.220
companies who won the bid each time was losing money.

387
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:18.850
It was great for the governments.
But these companies,
companies,

388
00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.340
we're consistently losing money.
They're consistently overbidding be careful.

389
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.370
It wasn't that the companies as a whole over bidding,

390
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.720
it was that the winning bid was overbidding.
It was the witness curse.

391
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:31.243
Over time.

392
00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.730
Companies figured this out and they figured out that they shouldn't bet as much

393
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:35.780
and this effect went away.

394
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:40.970
But you also see this affects in other places where naive bidders are involved.

395
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:42.470
So for example,

396
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.550
if those people who have been following the baseball free Asian markets,

397
00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.790
I think you could argue,
but if someone can do empirical test of this,

398
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.880
you can argue that the winning bids on free agents in the baseball for Asian

399
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:59.120
market end up being horrible over beads.
But at the same reason,
right?

400
00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:04.010
The team who has the highest idiosyncratic estimates of the person's value ends

401
00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:05.180
up hiring that player.

402
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:10.310
But the highest it is in credit value tends to be too high.
Right?

403
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.320
And similarly,
perhaps more importantly,
if you look at IPO,

404
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:17.610
initial public offerings of companies,
they tend to sell to high.

405
00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.360
There's very calm,
this one,
baseball,
why don't I haven't got the data?

406
00:26:21.361 --> 00:26:24.330
But the IPA is,
we know that IPO and uh,

407
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.530
there's a tendency for IPOs initial about product offerings of companies to have

408
00:26:28.531 --> 00:26:32.710
too high a share price.
And then for those shares to fall back after a while,

409
00:26:32.711 --> 00:26:36.030
let me be a little bit of initial enthusiasm,
but then they fall back and why?

410
00:26:36.031 --> 00:26:36.630
Again,

411
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:40.830
the people with the highest estimates of the value of the company end up winning

412
00:26:40.831 --> 00:26:42.960
the company.
And if they're not sophisticated about the,

413
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.800
they bid about the way they bid,
then they overbid.

414
00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:48.883
<v 2>All right.</v>

415
00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.500
<v 0>All right.
So this is a serious problem out there and it raises the problem.</v>

416
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:57.820
Everybody's,
if the issue,
well,
how should I correct this?
I might it in life,

417
00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.540
be involved in an ocean as a bitter for something that has a common value

418
00:27:01.541 --> 00:27:04.810
elements.
How should I think about how I should be?

419
00:27:04.811 --> 00:27:05.900
We've learned that we shouldn't be,

420
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:08.620
we shouldn't just bait my estimate minus a little.

421
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.600
<v 2>Alright,
so how should we think about it?
Okay.</v>

422
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.350
<v 0>Not a Walker's towards that.</v>

423
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:19.590
Let me try and think about a little bit more about the information that's out

424
00:27:19.811 --> 00:27:23.500
there.
Let's go back to our oil.
Well example,

425
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:28.950
each of these oil companies drill as a test well in the oil fields and from this

426
00:27:30.011 --> 00:27:30.371
test.

427
00:27:30.371 --> 00:27:35.080
Well each of them get some estimates of why I do.

428
00:27:35.081 --> 00:27:39.310
You can imagine someone doing a test,
a test drill into my jar of coins.

429
00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.250
And when they do this test drawn at this jar,
this jar of coins,

430
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:43.610
they form an estimate.
Why?

431
00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.340
I suppose that your estimates of the number of coins in the,

432
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.870
in the jar,
either not of oil in the,
in the oil.
Well suppose that this,

433
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.690
your particular one is equal to 150

434
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:58.463
<v 2>all right.</v>

435
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:02.310
<v 0>Does it,
and if I,
if I then asked you the question not to not to bid,</v>

436
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:06.270
but I asked you the question,
how many coins do you think are the jaw?

437
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:10.410
Your answer would be 150 all right,
there'll be over at your best estimate.

438
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.880
But suppose I then told you that your neighbor,

439
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.230
let's go back to Ashley again.
So Ashley's estimate was was,

440
00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.690
let's say it was 150 it wasn't,
but it has 150 and suppose I went to her,

441
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.470
to her neighbor and her and asked her neighbor and her neighbor said,

442
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.620
actually I think there's only 130 in that.

443
00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.580
So I suppose Ashley now knows that she did a little test.

444
00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:37.740
She thinks there's 150 but she now knows that her neighbor has done a similar

445
00:28:37.741 --> 00:28:40.980
test and he thinks there's only 130

446
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.593
<v 2>yeah.</v>

447
00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:46.161
<v 0>Now what should it be?</v>

448
00:28:46.161 --> 00:28:50.870
Ashley's estimates of the number of coins and the job or somewhere in between,

449
00:28:50.871 --> 00:28:51.081
right?

450
00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:55.940
So probably probably somewhere between 150 and 130 maybe about 140 but certainly

451
00:28:55.941 --> 00:28:58.970
lower than 150 is that right?
That right.

452
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:04.210
So if I told you that someone else had an estimate that was 20 lower than yours,

453
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:09.860
that would cause you to lower your belief about how many coins was in the jar.

454
00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.613
<v 2>All right,</v>

455
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.970
<v 0>now let's push this a little harder.
Suppose I told you,</v>

456
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.180
not that your neighbor had a hundred had an estimate of 130 but just that your

457
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:26.151
neighbor hadn't estimates that was lower than 150 I'm not going to tell you that

458
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:31.050
you're what?
I'm not going to tell you exactly what your neighbor estimates.

459
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:36.100
I'm just going to tell you that his estimate is lower than yours.
All right,

460
00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.260
so your initial belief was there was 150 coins in this jar,

461
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:45.470
but now I know that my neighbor thinks there's fewer than 150 do you think you

462
00:29:45.851 --> 00:29:48.940
estimate is your belief is still 150 or is it lower?

463
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:53.720
Who?
Who?
Who?
Who thinks it's gone up hasn't got out?
Right?

464
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:56.870
Who thinks it's gone down?
It's gone down,
right?
It's going down.

465
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.870
I didn't know exactly by how much to pull it down.
All right,

466
00:29:59.871 --> 00:30:04.871
but the fact that I knew that my neighbor has a lower estimate than me suggest I

467
00:30:05.251 --> 00:30:09.490
should put that suggest that I should have a lower estimate than one 50 now.

468
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:12.890
So it was actually something more dramatic.
Suppose I go to Ashley and say,

469
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.760
your initial estimates was actually it wasn't 150 it was $5 wasn't it?

470
00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:17.883
That's right.

471
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:23.750
So your initial estimate was 500 pairs,
right?

472
00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:26.360
And I'm not going to tell you what your neighbor's estimate was.

473
00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.940
I'm not going to tell you what your neighbor's neighbor's estimate was,

474
00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:34.180
but I'm going to tell you that every single person in the row in the two rows,

475
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.800
rather than you had an estimate lower than $5 I sorry,

476
00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.701
Ashley's,
that's what it was.

477
00:30:40.701 --> 00:30:45.701
$5 but I'm not going to tell her that every single person in the room had a

478
00:30:46.701 --> 00:30:51.350
lower estimate than she,
than hers.
All right?
Try not to tell her it is.

479
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.453
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

480
00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:58.540
<v 0>but why you,
Jay is less than why I</v>

481
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.310
fuck Ooh for all Jay,
for all the other people.

482
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:07.900
All right.

483
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:12.900
Can I claim that if you tell me that everybody else to a party with 30 other

484
00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:15.750
people there has an estimate lower than mine.

485
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.320
Everyone else watch it.
What should I now estimate?
What?

486
00:31:20.321 --> 00:31:23.880
What should happen to my estimate?
It's going to come down a lot,
right?

487
00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.550
It's gonna come down a lot.
Is that right?
I have,

488
00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:30.000
my estimate was $5 but I know everybody else will just one person,

489
00:31:30.001 --> 00:31:33.480
but everybody else had lower estimates.
There might,
my guess,

490
00:31:33.481 --> 00:31:36.270
or the number of coins on the jaw has come down a whole lot

491
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.720
about what,
but that's exactly what Ashley knows.

492
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:47.440
As soon as she founds out that she's won the auction,
why?

493
00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:51.750
If people are bidding their values,
if people are bidding as,
sorry,

494
00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.090
don't about us.
If people are bidding the estimates,

495
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:59.460
then as soon as Ashley discover she's,
she's one,
she's going to say,
oh,

496
00:31:59.461 --> 00:32:01.320
Boba,
right?

497
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:06.120
I now know that my estimate was too high to make something more extravagant than

498
00:32:06.121 --> 00:32:08.310
boulder.
Right?
But at the very least might say,
oh,
bother.

499
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.490
I now know that everyone else had a lower estimate than me,

500
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:16.500
or therefore my estimate of $5 is too high.
All right.
All right.

501
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.810
So what's going to happen is if people start bidding,

502
00:32:18.811 --> 00:32:23.040
their estimates are close to their estimates.
Then once they've won,

503
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.050
they're going to learn exactly this.

504
00:32:25.051 --> 00:32:29.220
They're going to learn that everyone else's estimate was lower than theirs and

505
00:32:29.221 --> 00:32:31.710
they're going to regret their choices.

506
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:33.130
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

507
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.900
<v 0>it can't be a good idea.
I called an equilibrium for people to make choices,</v>

508
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:43.370
which they're going to regret if they win or that's crazy.
All right,

509
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:47.240
so we need to think about how to correct for that.
All right,

510
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.230
so how do we correct for it not?
Let's talk about this a little bit harder.

511
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.140
Each of you,
when you're bidding for this jar of coins,
you,

512
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:01.300
I claim you only really care about how many coins were in the jar in one

513
00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:04.370
circumstance.

514
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.990
What's the only circumstance in which you care at all?

515
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:14.210
How many coins are in the job
if you win,

516
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.310
right?
It's I claim,

517
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.530
<v 1>yeah,</v>

518
00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:21.810
<v 0>only care.</v>

519
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:29.210
How many clients
in the jaw?

520
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:31.520
Well,
how much oil is in the,
well,

521
00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:36.590
if you win,

522
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.960
if your bid is the winning bid and if your bid is the winning bid,

523
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:45.230
what do you know?
You knew,

524
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:50.690
you know that your estimates was the highest estimate in the room.
At least.

525
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.370
At least if the secret of master property that beds are increasing and estimates

526
00:33:53.371 --> 00:33:56.570
per say,
which is not much trickled specs.
So you know

527
00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.450
in this case

528
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.083
<v 1>you</v>

529
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:10.520
<v 0>would have an estimate why I that was at least as big as why Jay for all,</v>

530
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.430
for all the other people in the room.

531
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.530
<v 1>All right,</v>

532
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:26.130
<v 0>so where are we?
You only care how many coins are in the jar.</v>

533
00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:29.490
If you win and if you win,
you know your estimate was the highest.

534
00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.010
So what's the relevant estimates,

535
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.030
the relevant estimate of the number of claims in the jar for you when you're

536
00:34:36.031 --> 00:34:36.864
bidding.

537
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:41.460
The relevant estimate is not how many coins do I think in this is in this job.

538
00:34:41.461 --> 00:34:42.390
That's the naive thing.

539
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:48.080
The relevant estimate is how many coins do I think is in this jar given my

540
00:34:48.601 --> 00:34:53.601
shaking events and given the facts that I have won the auction,

541
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.960
we'll give him this opposition that I might win the auction.
All right,

542
00:34:57.961 --> 00:35:00.240
so the relevant estimates in bidding.

543
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

544
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:05.930
<v 0>The relevant estimates</v>

545
00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.233
<v 1>when bidding</v>

546
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.033
is

547
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:20.690
<v 0>how many coins</v>

548
00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.370
do I think of that

549
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.843
<v 1>given</v>

550
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:36.180
<v 0>my initial guests?
Why Ai and</v>

551
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:39.510
given,

552
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.020
but why I is bigger than Yj?

553
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.343
<v 1>Okay.</v>

554
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:50.680
<v 0>I know this is the kind of a weird thing.
It's a counter factually.</v>

555
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:52.930
I don't know what the timing of which I'm bidding.

556
00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.920
I don't know that I'm going to win,
right?
But nevertheless,

557
00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:01.270
I should bid as if I knew I was going to win because I don't need care.

558
00:36:01.271 --> 00:36:03.400
And the second time,
which I went,
right.

559
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.610
So the way in which I should estimate the number of the number of coins in the

560
00:36:06.611 --> 00:36:06.821
jaw,

561
00:36:06.821 --> 00:36:11.470
and indeed the way in which I should bid is I should bid the number of coins.

562
00:36:11.471 --> 00:36:15.370
I would think we're in the jar if I want.

563
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.793
<v 1>Say it again.</v>

564
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:20.510
<v 0>I should bid the number of coins.</v>

565
00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:24.880
I would think we're in the jaw if my bit ended up being the winning bed.

566
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.730
Alright,
so the lesson here is

567
00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.870
<v 1>bid as if</v>

568
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.080
<v 0>you know</v>

569
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.960
<v 1>you win.
All right?</v>

570
00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:48.400
<v 0>Betas.
If you know you win.
And why is that a good idea?</v>

571
00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.960
Let's go back to this case of now you discover you've one provided you bid as if

572
00:36:52.961 --> 00:36:55.360
you know you won.
When you win,

573
00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.610
you're not gonna be disappointed because you already took that information into

574
00:36:57.611 --> 00:37:02.110
account.
Right?
But if you bid not as if you won,

575
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:05.410
you failed to take a minute to take into account the possibility of winning,

576
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.480
then winnings going to come as a shock to you and cause regret.
I have to,

577
00:37:10.481 --> 00:37:15.481
the only way to prevent this ex post regret wait a bit optimally is to bid as if

578
00:37:15.581 --> 00:37:19.180
you know you're going to win.
Estimate the number of coins,

579
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:24.100
not on your own sample,
but on the belief that your sample is the biggest song.

580
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:26.203
<v 1>Yeah,
there's a question.</v>

581
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:33.930
<v 4>I don't really understand what the differences between fitting,
sorry,
I don't,</v>

582
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.220
I don't understand what the differences between bidding as if you know,

583
00:37:38.221 --> 00:37:42.720
you win and what if you want,
right?
Because if you bid,
like whenever you bid,

584
00:37:42.721 --> 00:37:45.150
you're bidding the number that you think,

585
00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.630
oh well I think there are this many coins in the jar.
So if I,
when I'm,

586
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:53.410
I don't want to bid too many so that I don't lose.
Right.
So good.

587
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.380
How is that different from bidding is if you know you win.

588
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.570
<v 0>This is good.
Okay.
Okay,
good,
good,
good.
So how,
good question.</v>

589
00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:03.000
So how is it different to say bidding as if I know I win.
So it's,
it's bidding.

590
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:05.560
Okay,
so,
so let me try that again.
So what do,

591
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:08.260
what are you going to do is you're going to think of the following thought

592
00:38:08.261 --> 00:38:12.970
experiment.
Suppose you told me I won.
Suppose you told me I want it.

593
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:17.830
Now how many coins do I think are in the jar?
Right?
Let me bid that amount.

594
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.770
All right.
So before we even do the Beta,

595
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.950
through the following thought experiment,

596
00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.430
you'll find out how many coins do you think of that?
Now I say,

597
00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.820
suppose it turns out that your estimates,
the highest estimates.

598
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:32.650
Now how many claims do you think of that?
That's what you should bet,
right?

599
00:38:32.651 --> 00:38:36.280
And I'm arguing that that being,
that your estimates,

600
00:38:36.281 --> 00:38:39.820
the highest he's going to drag down.
That dragged down the estimate a long way.

601
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:44.170
All right.
But the key idea here is if you bid is if you know you win,

602
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:47.770
then you won't regret winning,
right?
And that's what you want to avoid.

603
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:51.610
You want to avoid the winner's curse.
All right,

604
00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.010
now let's see how that goes on us.

605
00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.940
Let me swap places with Allie again and let's see if we can actually very

606
00:38:57.941 --> 00:39:01.660
quickly just do one row on the second job.
All right.

607
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:07.270
Uh,
so this is the yellow mic.
Alright,
so same,

608
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:09.800
same group of people,
same group of people are,

609
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:14.020
let me get to shout these out fairly quick.
Here's what we get.
We move onto this,

610
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:18.960
these two rows right down in your bed on the smaller jar.
Now on the smaller job,

611
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:24.580
all right,
this is your bid,
not your estimated,
right?
And you're right on your,

612
00:39:24.581 --> 00:39:28.780
your,
your essence,
your bid on the smaller jar.
All right,
fast as we can go.

613
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:34.120
All right,
just shout out a number.
40 cents,
40 cents.
$1,
$1,

614
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:39.990
$1 2151 58 cents 98 cents $1 90 cents 90 cents 75 cents.

615
00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:49.890
616151514140.

616
00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.800
Uh,
okay.
I got to pass this end,
so I'll go get the other side.

617
00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:59.300
Keeps shouting them out.
95 cents.
Haley,

618
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.620
50 50 70 51251205150 bucks.

619
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.681
30 bucks.

620
00:40:07.681 --> 00:40:12.681
31 2120 (509) 100-9115 one 15 and 80.

621
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:18.700
I think they get everybody.
All right.
80 was the last one.

622
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:19.840
All right,

623
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.080
so I'll get the bids came down partly because the Jarvis smaller of course,

624
00:40:23.081 --> 00:40:27.040
which is cheesing fast.
Let me just tell you.
Let's find out who the winner was.

625
00:40:27.041 --> 00:40:29.410
First of all.
So one 60 is the winner.

626
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:32.320
Uh,

627
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.820
one six is the winner and it turns out that the number of clients in this jar

628
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:41.770
was
one 48.
All right,

629
00:40:41.771 --> 00:40:43.960
so what happened here?
I think people took into account,

630
00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:47.440
people did lower that bids below the estrogen.
Is that,
let's just check actually.

631
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:52.520
So who is,
who is my one 60 person?
Alright.
Sustenance.
Stand on my one 60 person.

632
00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:57.680
All right.
So how many coins did you think were in that one?

633
00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.560
61 60 okay,
I see.
So,
so your name is Robert.

634
00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:06.970
So Robert thought that was what you paid one 60?
Yes.
All right.

635
00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:10.600
How many coins do you think was in there?
One 61 60.
I'm not doing well here.
Am I?

636
00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.390
Okay.
All right.
All right.
What?
Okay.
Okay,
fine.
Okay.

637
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.890
So what am I trying to convince you to do here?
I try to convince you to do.

638
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.880
All right,
so let,
let me,
let me find some other bidders.
So,
so,
uh,
yes.

639
00:41:23.881 --> 00:41:27.580
So what did you paid?
$1.
How many coins do you think were in there?

640
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.290
One 25.
Okay.
So how many of you be honest now,

641
00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.320
how many of you bid significantly below or significantly below your,

642
00:41:37.551 --> 00:41:42.200
your,
uh,
your estimates?
All right,
so the idea,
okay,

643
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:44.170
raise your hands.
Have you been,
have you ever been bit brother?
You estimate?

644
00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:45.770
All right,
good.
So we're learning something.

645
00:41:45.771 --> 00:41:48.230
I feel like this is the 24th lecture I'm about to teach you something,
right?

646
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:52.310
Right,
right.
Okay.
So the idea here is in a common value auction,

647
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.540
you need to shade your bed considerably,
right?
In fact,

648
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:01.300
most of these beds,
even though you are shading your paid considerably,
uh,

649
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:04.400
most of you didn't shade it enough.

650
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:06.980
I say even even taking this into account,

651
00:42:06.981 --> 00:42:11.120
even taking into account the lesson of the day,
even with that endo count,

652
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:15.320
a number of you are still overbidding.
Alright,
so what's the takeaway lesson?

653
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.640
If you're in a common value auction,
a common value auction,

654
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.940
you need to bid as if you had been told that your estimates is the highest

655
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:30.590
estimates.
That means you need to shave.
Your estimate are locks.

656
00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:35.750
If you don't do this,
you'll win a lot of auctions and you'll be very unhappy.

657
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.050
All right?
All right.
Now we're not done here yet.

658
00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.490
Let me move forward by moving away.
Now,
just from common value auctions.

659
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.560
So Steve,

660
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.020
all we focused on common value auctions and we focused on particular structure

661
00:42:55.021 --> 00:42:55.854
of auction.

662
00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:01.100
But I also want to talk about different types of ocean themselves because one

663
00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.030
phenomenon you're seeing out there a lot these days is

664
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.460
the people rum,

665
00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.880
different structures of auctions and auctions are getting more and more

666
00:43:11.881 --> 00:43:13.140
important than theU s economy.

667
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.830
It used to be the auctions where something you thought of as a pretty rare event

668
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:20.250
and you'd go or you see them when people are selling capital and you see them

669
00:43:20.251 --> 00:43:23.730
when people was selling art.
But that was pretty much it.

670
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:27.090
But now you see auctions everywhere.
We see auctioned on Ebay,

671
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.260
we see auctions for the spectrum.
Pretty much everything is auction these days.

672
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.540
So all kinds of becoming important.
In fact,

673
00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:37.890
at Yale this year we had a cost solely devoted to auctions.

674
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.260
We're having one day of this past for 12 months,

675
00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:44.760
but they had a whole 24 lectures on oceans.
All right?
It's not important.

676
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:46.090
All right.

677
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.980
And one thing we should realize is that there are lots of different types of

678
00:43:49.981 --> 00:43:54.630
auctions.
So let's talk about four different types of auction.

679
00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:57.570
Let's call them a,
B,
c,
and d.
All right?

680
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:02.900
So the first type of auction is a first price sealed bid auction.

681
00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.670
And that's what we just did.
Everybody wrote down their bed on a piece of paper,

682
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.980
all right?
And the winner,

683
00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.790
the winner was the person with the highest bid and they paid their bed.

684
00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:22.970
All right,
Ashley,
in the first case,
Jonathan [inaudible],
Jonathan,
and the in the,

685
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.620
in the second Robert on the second one.
All right,

686
00:44:25.621 --> 00:44:28.440
so first price sealed bid auction is what we just did.

687
00:44:28.441 --> 00:44:32.370
And that's a typical auction you to see.
For example,
in house sales,

688
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:38.720
here's another type of auction though,
so this sounds crazy,

689
00:44:38.721 --> 00:44:39.710
but me write it up anyway.

690
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:46.910
You could imagine a second price sealed paid ocean.

691
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:52.500
So what happens in a second?
Price seal,
but ocean,
everybody writes down that bed.

692
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.450
Each per player writes down their bed,

693
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.800
the highest bidder get the good.

694
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.480
It's much the same as before,

695
00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:05.610
but now instead of paying the bed that they wrote down,

696
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:10.410
they bayed the SA,
they pay the second highest paid,

697
00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.610
all right?
It's the idea is the winner.

698
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:19.140
The winner pays

699
00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.560
the second bid.
The winner is the person with the highest bid.

700
00:45:25.561 --> 00:45:30.360
But they pay the second bed.
So that seems crazy,
doesn't it?
Seems a bit crazy.

701
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:33.120
These are sometimes called Vickery auctions.

702
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:34.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

703
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.980
<v 0>And Vickery won the Nobel prize so they can't be that crazy.</v>

704
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.580
I will come back and talk about it.
Alright,

705
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:47.790
here's two other kinds of auction we can think about an ascending open ocean.

706
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:52.553
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

707
00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.930
<v 0>So this is what you all think of when we say auction.</v>

708
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.750
This is what happens with a catalog option or an auto auction.

709
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:59.730
And when people are shouting out beds,

710
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.330
one way to think about this is that we will be,
if we weren't bidding something,

711
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.700
if we were auctioning off something in the class today,

712
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.880
is that everybody who is still in the auction would raise their hands and as the

713
00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:15.240
bid got higher and higher,
some of you would start dropping out.
Is that right?

714
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.940
And eventually when there's only one hand left,

715
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.040
that person would be when the auction is that right?

716
00:46:21.041 --> 00:46:25.230
If that's another version of an ascending open or everybody raises their hand

717
00:46:25.231 --> 00:46:27.600
when the price is zero,
there's the price goes up.

718
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:29.790
Hands go down until there's only one hand left.

719
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.740
But we can also imagine another crazy origin,

720
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.740
which is a descending open ocean.

721
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.210
So how does the descending,
okay,
open auction,

722
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:46.590
if I should just say this is the kind of this open extending one is what you

723
00:46:46.591 --> 00:46:50.160
typically see on Ebay.
All right.
What did extending open auction,

724
00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.920
I just sending open auction is the same idea almost,

725
00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:56.130
except instead of starting the prices at zero and going up,

726
00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:00.540
I'll start the price at infinity and go down.
All right,

727
00:47:00.541 --> 00:47:03.990
so now if I start at the price in Finnessey,
none of you have your hands up,

728
00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:06.690
I hope.
All right.
And then as the price goes down,

729
00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:10.650
eventually one of you is going to raise that hands and then you,

730
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:13.470
you get that good and pay that amount.
All right?

731
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:15.960
So there's auction happens in the real world.

732
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:20.040
It used to happen in a place called filings basement.

733
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:25.020
When I was in graduate students,
uh,
struggling to have enough money,

734
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.360
there was a place in Boston called fighting's basement,

735
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:29.620
which would sell clothing in this way.

736
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.890
So you'd go and pick out the suits you needed for your horrible job interview

737
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.280
and you just [inaudible] the price would come down each week and you'd hope that

738
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:37.480
no one bought it before you did.

739
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:39.223
<v 1>All right.</v>

740
00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:42.300
<v 0>All right.
Sometimes it's called a Dutch auction,</v>

741
00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:51.100
right?
So here's four kinds of auctions.
Two of them seem pretty familiar,
right?

742
00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:56.140
If a and c sound like familiar kind of auctions that you're used to seeing and

743
00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:59.790
BMD seem a little weird.

744
00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.590
So the first thing I want to convince you of is that B and d and knowledge,

745
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:08.070
weird as they seem.
All right,
so let's look at these crazy auctions.

746
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:13.080
The first thing I want to claim is,
is that auction d

747
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:19.450
is really the same
as auction a,

748
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:25.540
just remind us of what let's do.
Auctions are auction a is every,

749
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:27.010
it's exactly what can we just do it for the coins?

750
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:28.810
Everybody writes down their bid,

751
00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:33.190
we open all the envelopes and the winter is the hype person with the highest,

752
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.500
highest bid written down or they pay that,
right?
The descending open auction.

753
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.660
Nobody beads,
nobody bids,
nobody reads,

754
00:48:40.661 --> 00:48:43.930
nobody been suddenly suddenly bit some somebody bids and then they pay that

755
00:48:43.931 --> 00:48:47.050
amount.
Why are those two auctions at the same?

756
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:49.270
Wow.

757
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:53.950
Think about that descending bid that the offending open auction during that

758
00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:58.300
descending open auction,
each of you may have written down in your head,

759
00:48:58.570 --> 00:48:59.620
it's useful.
Think of it this way,

760
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:03.640
you've written down in your head the number at which you're going to raise your

761
00:49:03.641 --> 00:49:05.140
hand.
Is that right?

762
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.980
So there are now as a graduate student waiting for my suit to come down in price

763
00:49:08.981 --> 00:49:11.530
so I can afford it and I know what that number is.

764
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.830
And then from your point of view,
the other potential wearers of the suits,

765
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:19.690
all right,
from your point of view,
that's a seal bid for me,

766
00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:25.090
right?
At the end of the day,
whoever has that highest intended bid,

767
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:29.270
that highest seal bid will end up winning the suit and they'll pay that bit,

768
00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.740
right?
So from a strategic point of view,

769
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.370
the descending open auction and the sea,

770
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:41.140
the descending open auction and the seals first price auction are the same
thing.

771
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.110
The person who has the highest bid,

772
00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:47.890
the highest strategy wins and they pay their bed and you don't get it.

773
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:50.320
You don't get to see animals and strategy until it's too late.

774
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.373
<v 1>All right,</v>

775
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.860
<v 0>so d is equal to to a what about B and d?</v>

776
00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.593
<v 1>Okay,</v>

777
00:49:58.770 --> 00:50:02.400
<v 0>so I claim that B and d are not the same,</v>

778
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.490
but they're very closely related.

779
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.370
Sorry,
B and c.
C,

780
00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:16.270
so c is what see is our Ebay auctions are classic auction.

781
00:50:16.271 --> 00:50:19.120
You're all used to playing on Ebay and B,

782
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:23.980
B is this slightly crazy thing where we all write down beds and the winner is

783
00:50:23.981 --> 00:50:28.730
the person who has the highest bid but they only pay the second amount.
How?

784
00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:33.710
Why?
Why am I saying that's the same as our Ebay auction in some ways?
Well,

785
00:50:33.711 --> 00:50:37.380
let's think about the Ebay auction.
He you all playing the Ebay auction,

786
00:50:37.381 --> 00:50:39.080
so all of you have your hands up,

787
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.930
meaning you're still in and the price is going up,

788
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.750
prices are going up over time and all of you that have your hands up,

789
00:50:44.751 --> 00:50:49.010
you're still in it,
right?
Each of you has some strategy in mind,

790
00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:53.330
which is what the strategy is.
When am I going to lower my hand?

791
00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.220
Right?
What's the highest price I'm willing to pay,
high price price,

792
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:59.840
I'm going to pay for this object.

793
00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:05.030
So your strategy in the classic Ebay auction is the price at which I love on my

794
00:51:05.211 --> 00:51:07.220
hand.
All right.

795
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:10.220
Who Wins in that open ascending auction?

796
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:14.450
The person who has the highest intended bid,

797
00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:19.370
the person whose hand is up at the end is the person who's who's intended bid is

798
00:51:19.371 --> 00:51:22.340
the highest,
but what amount do they pay?

799
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:26.450
When does the ocean stop under the ocean stuff?

800
00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:31.830
It stops when the second to last hand goes down,
right?
So if my,

801
00:51:31.831 --> 00:51:35.090
if,
if I'm the winning bid in an o and an openness sending ocean,

802
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:38.360
my hand is still up.
You don't know what I was willing to pay.

803
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.700
What I'm actually going to pay is the price of the last person whose hand went

804
00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:47.300
down.
I ain't going to pay the bid of the person who's,
who's,

805
00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.630
who's amount they're going to pay is the second highest amount.

806
00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:56.270
That makes sense.
So in an ascending open ocean,
the winner,

807
00:51:56.540 --> 00:52:01.220
the person who has the highest intended bid,
actually pays the amount,

808
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:06.070
the intended,
highest intended bid off the second highest player.

809
00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:09.260
All right,
so an ascending oak and ocean.

810
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.980
It's structurally very similar to the seal,
but oceans,

811
00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.590
which is really why the sealed bid auctions are interesting.

812
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:18.860
The second price deal,
but it was awkward.
Interesting.
Now,
having said that,

813
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.990
they're not like they're not exactly the same,

814
00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.980
and the reason they are not exactly the same is that if in fact the good for

815
00:52:24.981 --> 00:52:29.981
sale has common value than we might learn something by the fact that the hands

816
00:52:30.201 --> 00:52:31.820
are up.
All right?

817
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.700
So the fact that people's hands are still up in the open auction,

818
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.640
whereas you can't see what people are doing in the sealed auction makes these

819
00:52:37.641 --> 00:52:41.450
not identical,
but there's clearly a close similarity between them.

820
00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.670
All right?
Now let's us,

821
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:47.870
I guess the question people even up you've been wondering about,

822
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:51.950
which is how should I bid at Ebay?

823
00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.340
We figured out that for colon value auction,

824
00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:59.330
if you're going to reset coming color,
the auction on Ebay,
for example,

825
00:52:59.331 --> 00:53:02.180
if the good you're buying is a good year,
you're later on.

826
00:53:02.181 --> 00:53:05.810
I'm going to want to resell.
In that case,

827
00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:07.910
we already know that you should,

828
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:11.810
should should shade shade your estimate of the value considerably.

829
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:17.540
So let's go to the other extreme.
Let's consider a private valley

830
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.870
a private value.
Well,

831
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.210
there's no common value here at all.

832
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:30.300
And let's assume that this auction,

833
00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.860
he's either second price sealed bid.

834
00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:39.003
<v 1>Oh,</v>

835
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.870
<v 0>open or sanding.</v>

836
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:49.120
There's summarize.
It's either what we call B or what we call sync.

837
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:52.190
All right,
so you're,
there you are.

838
00:53:52.191 --> 00:53:55.190
You're bidding on Ebay and it's a private value.
Good.

839
00:53:55.191 --> 00:53:58.580
There's nothing interesting about how much anyone else values this thing.

840
00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:03.800
All right,
so what's your value?
Your value is VI,

841
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:09.140
right?
You might bid bi tool.
This is your value.

842
00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:14.810
Your bid is bi,
and what's your payoff

843
00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:20.160
<v 1>you'll pay off is</v>

844
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.280
<v 0>vi minor is no minus bi.
What's it minus?</v>

845
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:31.650
It's going to be minus,
let's call it be jade bod.
I'll say what is the minutes?

846
00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:36.840
So you'll value your payoff is the value of the goods to you.
Minus this thing.

847
00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:40.470
I'm going to call Bj Bar,
which say what?
It isn't the minutes if you went.

848
00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:44.880
So if ba is is,
is highest

849
00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.780
and it's zero,
otherwise is that right?

850
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:55.370
So what Bj Bar Bj Bar is

851
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:59.960
the highest.

852
00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:02.423
<v 1>I'll bet,</v>

853
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:07.940
<v 0>right?
So if my bid is the highest,</v>

854
00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:13.180
my final payoff is the value of the good to me minus the highest other bit.

855
00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:16.010
The second highest paid in other words,

856
00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.093
<v 1>all right,</v>

857
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.570
<v 0>so question,
how should I be on?</v>

858
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:24.580
How should I be either on Ebay here or for that matter in a,

859
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:26.120
in a second price deal,
bid auction?

860
00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:28.910
What's the right way to bid in these auctions?

861
00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:35.090
Should I bid my value?
Should I be under my value?

862
00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:38.970
As of a poll?
Who thinks you should?

863
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.430
Who thinks should have been over your [inaudible]?

864
00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.060
Are you going to pay the second price?

865
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.980
So who thinks she's should pay over your value?

866
00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:49.080
Who needs you a bit over your value?
Who thinks she's a bit of your value?

867
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.160
He think should have been under your value.
All right.
Everyone knows this.

868
00:55:53.161 --> 00:55:55.350
That's good.
That's good.
Okay,
good,
good,
good,
good.
That's that's correct.

869
00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:58.260
So the optimal thing to do is bid

870
00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.220
<v 1>your</v>

871
00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:06.030
<v 0>valley video value.
I actually,
we can do better than that.</v>

872
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:08.280
We can show,
we haven't got time now,

873
00:56:08.281 --> 00:56:13.281
but we can show that bidding your value in a second price option is a weekly

874
00:56:14.221 --> 00:56:17.940
dominant strategy,
right?
So setting

875
00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.830
be,
hi,

876
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:26.440
equal to VI is weekly

877
00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:34.150
dominant.
It's a weekly dominant strategy.
It's really a very good idea.

878
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:38.050
Alright,
so there's nothing subtle about bidding on Ebay.

879
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:39.790
If truly a private value auction,

880
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.030
you're going to spin until it hits your value and then you got to drop out.

881
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:48.160
Right?
Okay,
Holly proving that as an exercise.

882
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:50.350
What about if we,

883
00:56:50.351 --> 00:56:55.351
if we switch from the second price auction or Ebay to a first price auction?

884
00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:57.403
<v 1>Okay,</v>

885
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:08.040
<v 0>so now your payoff is v I minus your own bed.</v>

886
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:13.600
If you win and zero all the lies.

887
00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.700
Why should a first price auction,

888
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:22.290
you're going to get your value minus your own bed if you win and zero otherwise,

889
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.480
now,
how should you be?
This is a private value auctions.

890
00:57:25.481 --> 00:57:29.820
You don't have to worry anymore about the winner's curse,
but nevertheless,

891
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:32.430
how should you be?
Should you paid more than your value?

892
00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:36.570
Should you bid the same as your value or should you bid less than your valley

893
00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.990
who they should have been more than your value to the poll?

894
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:42.780
Who thinks you should build your value?

895
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:48.210
Who thinks he's a bit less than your value?
Yeah,
the alters you here,

896
00:57:48.211 --> 00:57:50.430
you should bid less than your value.
That.
See,
why

897
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:56.610
bid less than vi?
Why?
Because if you bid vie,

898
00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:00.930
even if you win the auction,
what's going to be your payoff?

899
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:05.310
Zero.
If you lose the oxygen getting through,
if you win the auction,
you get zero.

900
00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:09.030
If you bid less than via,
if you shaved your database,

901
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.740
then if you win,
which will happen with some pro bowlesy,
you'll make some,

902
00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:18.150
you'll make some surplus.
All right,
so here it's flipped around here.

903
00:58:18.151 --> 00:58:19.020
It turns out

904
00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:23.670
that building your value

905
00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:30.810
and the first price auction is weekly dominated.

906
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:35.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

907
00:58:35.940 --> 00:58:37.500
<v 0>All right.
Where all,
we haven't got much time.</v>

908
00:58:37.501 --> 00:58:40.320
I want to get one more thing out of the class.
So where are we here?

909
00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:45.540
What we've argued is in a first,
in a second price auction,

910
00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.610
you're going to beat your value,
but yet,

911
00:58:47.611 --> 00:58:52.560
but the wind is only going to pay the second price in a first price auction,

912
00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.560
you're going to shade your bed under your value,

913
00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:57.840
you're going to trade off two things.

914
00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:01.740
The two things you're going to trade off are the,
as you raise your bed,

915
00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:04.350
you'll increase your chance of winning the auction,

916
00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.880
but you'll get less surplus if you win.
All right,

917
00:59:07.881 --> 00:59:11.100
so the first price auction is a classic trade off marginal benefit and marginal

918
00:59:11.101 --> 00:59:11.700
cost.

919
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.220
The marginal benefit of raising your bait as you increase the probability of

920
00:59:14.221 --> 00:59:15.054
winning,

921
00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:19.550
the marginal cost is you'll get less surplus if you went all right,

922
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:23.780
but in summary,
in the second price auction,
I bid my,

923
00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:26.210
I'd bid quote truthfully my value,

924
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:31.010
but if I went only I only pay the second price in the first price auction,

925
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.570
I bid less than my value,
but I pay what I paid.
If I win,

926
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:38.300
I'm at leads us to the natural question.

927
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:44.590
Which of these two auctions at least an expectation is going to raise more

928
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.090
money?
Let me make some assumptions.

929
00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:55.420
Let's assume that it's a purely private value environment and let's assume that

930
00:59:56.871 --> 01:00:01.280
these,
let's also assume that these values are completely independent,

931
01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:05.480
but my value is this statistically completely independent in your value.

932
01:00:05.481 --> 01:00:06.890
They're just completely idiosyncratic.

933
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:10.610
And let's assume that we're all kind of basically similar except for that.

934
01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:15.110
All right,
so I'm going to steam independence,
cemetery,
private values.

935
01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:19.590
Most importantly you can imagine.
Let's ask the question again.
I'm,

936
01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.960
I am selling the good.

937
01:00:20.961 --> 01:00:25.961
Now would I rather sell this as a second price auction in which at least he'll

938
01:00:26.211 --> 01:00:27.200
be your values,

939
01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:30.610
but the winner will only pay the second battery or would I rather?

940
01:00:30.611 --> 01:00:34.460
But as I started as a first price auction in which you're all going to shade

941
01:00:34.461 --> 01:00:38.900
your values because of this,
uh,
this,
this,
this,
this effect of,
of,
uh,

942
01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:40.670
of trying to get some surplus,

943
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:43.640
but at least the winner will actually pay you what they bet,

944
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.790
which is going to generate more revenue for me.
Let's have a poll.

945
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:49.540
Who thinks I should set it?

946
01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.400
Who thinks I'll get more revenue from a second price auction?

947
01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:58.140
Who thinks I'll get more revenue from a first price auction.
Oh,

948
01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:01.490
that's what this is the last poll of the class.
We can surely get no extensions.

949
01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:05.000
Yeah,
let's try it again.
All right.
No extensions.
Last part of the class,
right?

950
01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:08.030
Last fall,
the whole course.
Who thinks you get more?

951
01:01:08.031 --> 01:01:12.410
I'm gonna expect more revenue from a second price auction in which people will

952
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:13.340
build,
bid their values,

953
01:01:13.341 --> 01:01:17.000
but I only get the second price and who thinks I get more revenue from a first

954
01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:21.480
price auction in which in which people pay?
They paid,
but they all stayed there.

955
01:01:21.481 --> 01:01:26.360
Beds.
There's a slight majority of a second price.
Sorry.
Here's a fat.

956
01:01:26.361 --> 01:01:31.361
A great therapy provided where in that setting I said pure private value.

957
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.330
Absolutely independent and my values completely just to be independent of your

958
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:38.100
value.
We're all basically similar,
independent,
private VAT,
symmetric,

959
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.983
private value,

960
01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:42.980
both of those type of auctions we mentioned the first price auction and the

961
01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:47.981
second price auction and indeed any other kind of auction which has the property

962
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:52.400
that in equilibrium,
the person with the highest value ends up winning the good.

963
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.240
Any stock auction in expectation yields exactly the same revenue and

964
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:03.230
expectation.
The first price auction,

965
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:06.950
the second price auction or any other silly old auction you come up with,

966
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.950
at least it has the property the next than in equilibrium.

967
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.360
The highest value wins.

968
01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.860
All of them generate the same revenue in expectation.

969
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:21.080
But to find out why you're going to have to take another course in game three

970
01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.270
cause we're done.
And I will see you at the review session

971
01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.710
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
