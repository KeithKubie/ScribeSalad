00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.609
Despite how it sounds, “Tulipmania” does
not refer to just a general love of tulips;

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.960
it was actually one the world’s first recorded
major financial bubbles.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.510
Long before the dot com frenzy or the real
estate bubbles of recent decades, there was

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.860
Tulipmania in the Netherlands beginning around
1624 and reaching its peak from 1636 to 1637.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.460
While the extent of the mania, in terms of
how widespread it was, is still largely debated,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.460
as is what all the elements involved were
that caused it- nevertheless, for a brief

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.710
time, Tulip prices in the Netherlands rose
to ridiculous levels, with one flower costing

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.381
more than the annual income of a skilled tradesman,
and for certain types of tulips, over ten

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:30.310
times more!

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.420
Why the frenzy over tulips?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.159
It seems like such a simple, almost run-of-the-mill
flower to us; just about every neighborhood

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.540
in Middle America has some blooming in their
yard.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.670
But to Dutch horticulturists of the 17th century,
the tulip was lauded as exquisitely unique

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.130
and put on a high pedestal.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.479
The colors were far richer, lush, and concentrated
than those of just about any other flower

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.479
in Europe before the Tulip was introduced
via importation from Turkey (initially in

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.479
the mid-16th century and from then slowly
spreading throughout Europe).

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.329
The Dutch people quickly became enamored with
the tulip and having tulips in your garden

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.140
soon was something of a status symbol.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.060
Once this psychological component was in place,
the ground was made fertile for a buying craze

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.200
and a bubble.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.360
The life cycle of the tulip itself was another
factor in the buying squeeze and frenzy.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.090
The mother bulb of a tulip only lasts a few
years and can only produce two to three clones

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.090
per year.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.480
It takes a full seven years to grow a tulip
from a seed.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.500
While the demand of tulip buyers spiked during
Tulipmania, the supply of actual tulip bulbs

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.510
did not.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.390
Tulip bulb prices rose at a steady pace through
the 1630s as more and more speculators entered

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.390
the market.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.140
Who all these speculators were is up for debate,
but it appears they comprised mostly of wealthy

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.630
merchants and tradesman, rather than members
of the nobility and somewhat more traditional

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.630
investors.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.200
For this reason, tulip trading tended to take
place more in taverns than at the stock exchange.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:04.110
By 1636, ANY tulip bulb — even low quality
bulbs — could be sold for a small fortune,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.310
with an average price of about 160 guilders,
and at its peak near 200 guilders.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.050
Unfortunately, there’s no real accurate
way to translate that to modern day currency,

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.480
but for reference, a typical skilled tradesman
at this time generally only made about 150

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480
guilders.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.030
So if you want to translate it that way, a
typical skilled worker today in the United

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.030
States (someone with some sort of post-high
school education, but not post-secondary education)

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.819
averages about $48K per year; so using that
extremely loose correlation, an average tulip

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.890
bulb would cost around $64K at the mania’s
peak.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.420
At this peak in late 1636, some tulip bulbs
were changing buyers up to ten times per day,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.530
with people no longer typically even taking
possession of the bulbs, simply purchasing

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.239
them in the futures market and then trying
to sell up for profit.

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.939
In fact, with many of these exchanges, not
only did the bulbs not change hands, but money

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.569
usually didn’t either at this time, with
the exchange to happen when the bulb(s) were

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.400
physically taken possession of, which was
no longer happening in most cases.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.269
The height of the frenzy came in a famous
incident when seven orphaned children auctioned

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.370
off their inheritance from their deceased
father: 70 tulip bulbs.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.810
One was an extremely rare Violetten Admirael
van Enkhuizen bulb, which ended up selling

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.709
for 5,200 guilders — an all-time record.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.220
The total yield of the auction was 53,000
guilders… for 70 bulbs.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.620
In another auction, in 1635, 40 bulbs were
sold for 100,000 guilders.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.490
Again, a typical skilled tradesman at this
time only made about 150 guilders per year.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.310
According to British journalist Charles Mackay,
in his book Extraordinary Popular Delusions

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.099
and the Madness of the Crowds, published in
1841 (which some economists speculate exaggerated

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:46.800
the extent of Tulipmania, so take his word
on the extent of the craze with a grain of

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.800
salt),

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800
Many individuals grew suddenly rich.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.680
A golden bait hung temptingly out before the
people, and, one after the other, they rushed

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.180
to the tulip marts, like flies around a honey-pot.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.830
Every one imagined that the passion for tulips
would last for ever, and that the wealthy

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.750
from every part of the world would send to
Holland, and pay whatever prices were asked

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.750
for them.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.560
The riches of Europe would be concentrated
on the shores of the Zuyder Zee, and poverty

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.810
banished from the favoured clime of Holland.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.409
Nobles, citizens, farmers, mechanics, seamen,
footmen, maidservants, even chimney sweeps

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.450
and old clotheswomen, dabbled in tulips.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.450
Mackay went on to say that there was one very
rare tulip that was traded for not money,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.450
but for four fat oxen, eight fat swine, twelve
fat sheep, two hogsheads of wine, four turns

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.450
of beer, one thousand pounds of cheese, two
tons of butter, a bed, a silver cup, a set

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.450
of fine clothes, two lasts of wheat, and four
lasts of rhye.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.450
This was all valued at around 1500-2000 guilders.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.840
In another instance, he stated a Semper Augustus
bulb was traded for 12 acres of farm land.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.380
But not long after this, the tulip market
crashed in spectacular fashion.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.680
There was nothing gradual about it.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.250
It began in the city of Haarlem at a routine
bulb auction, when an investor did not show

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.219
up and pay for his tulip bulb purchase.

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:41.180
This started people worrying over the fact
that there seemed to no longer be anyone who

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.779
actually was buying the bulbs to acquire the
physical tulips; rather, they were simply

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.740
buying them to turn around and sell again.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.860
Without any apparent buyers, only sellers,
within days widespread panic ensued among

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.000
the tulip traders.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.192
Some of the more savvy investors tried to
prop up the market, but the demand for tulips

00:05:57.192 --> 00:06:00.630
very quickly dried up, and the market soon
evaporated.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:08.169
Tulips that had fetched a few thousand guilders
just weeks before were now valued at only

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:15.340
1% of that.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.560
Surprisingly, the fallout from this doesn’t
appear to have been very drastic.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.360
While some lost their fortunes, most simply
paid small penalties on not honoring their

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:35.890
tulip contracts and moved on with their lives.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:46.149
(Tulip futures speculators were not obligated
to pay the full amount of their contract,

00:06:46.149 --> 00:07:03.849
simply a small percentage if they chose not
to pay for their purchase, which also seems

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:38.479
to have contributed to 
the growth of the bubble.)

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:49.539
This, combined with the fact that most of
the trading took place on “Main Street”,

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:54.669
rather than at the stock exchange and among
nobility, and that in general no money or

00:07:54.669 --> 00:08:02.880
tulips changed hands during the height of
the bubble, resulted in the overall economy

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:24.959
not being affected much at all, contrary to

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:42.979
what you may often read.
