thinks it's a bad idea I'm not sure they
are ready to do it or they want to be

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000
are ready to do it or they want to be
 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.550
are ready to do it or they want to be

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829
developing the new best practices I
 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:38.410
developing the new best practices I
think closely related to that is the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420
think closely related to that is the
 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.849
think closely related to that is the
large pension funds which we were

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859
large pension funds which we were
 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.529

do so even putting pressure on companies

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:44.179

to do so the NGO community the
 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:48.489
to do so the NGO community the
stakeholder community when I did the

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499
stakeholder community when I did the
 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.169
stakeholder community when I did the
research from my book I wasn't sure if

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190
they would support integrated reporting
 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.649
they would support integrated reporting
or they wanted to continue to have

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659
or they wanted to continue to have
 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.139
or they wanted to continue to have
separate sustainability reports they're

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149
separate sustainability reports they're
 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.000
separate sustainability reports they're
very supportive of this and so I think

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010
very supportive of this and so I think
 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.219
very supportive of this and so I think
you'll see the NGOs that have been

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229
you'll see the NGOs that have been
 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.500
you'll see the NGOs that have been
putting pressure on companies for

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510
