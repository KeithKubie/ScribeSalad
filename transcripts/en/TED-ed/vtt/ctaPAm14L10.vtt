00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:16.179
Emily Dickinson said over a century ago

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:19.623
that "There is no frigate
like a book to take us lands away ..."

00:00:19.647 --> 00:00:20.906
And it's true.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.453
When we pick up a book,
turn on the TV, or watch a movie,

00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:28.711
we're carried away down the currents
of story into a world of imagination.

00:00:28.735 --> 00:00:32.336
And when we land, on a shore
that is both new and familiar,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.822
something strange happens.

00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:36.379
Stepping onto the shore, we're changed.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.623
We don't retrace
the footsteps of the authors

00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:40.533
or characters we followed here.

00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:43.392
No; instead, we walk a mile
in their shoes.

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:47.595
Researchers in psychology, neuroscience,
child development and biology

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:51.033
are finally starting to gain
quantifiable scientific evidence,

00:00:51.057 --> 00:00:53.659
showing what writers and readers
have always known:

00:00:53.683 --> 00:00:57.467
that stories have a unique ability
to change a person's point of view.

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:00.628
Scholars are discovering evidence
that stories shape culture,

00:01:00.652 --> 00:01:03.721
and that much of what we believe
about life comes not from fact,

00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:05.123
but from fiction -

00:01:05.147 --> 00:01:09.510
that our ideas of class, marriage
and even gender are relatively new,

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:12.315
and that many ideologies
which held fast for centuries

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.245
were revised within the 18th century,

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:16.624
and redrafted in the pages
of the early novel.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.730
Imagine a world where class,
and not hard work,

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:21.333
decides a person's worth;

00:01:21.357 --> 00:01:25.042
a world where women
are simply men's more untamed copy;

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.848
a world where marriage for love
is a novel notion.

00:01:28.326 --> 00:01:31.255
Well, that was the world
in which Samuel Richardson's "Pamela"

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:32.430
first appeared.

00:01:32.454 --> 00:01:35.819
Richardson's love story
starred a poor, serving-class heroine,

00:01:35.843 --> 00:01:39.510
who is both more superior and smarter
than her upper-class suitor.

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.432
The book, challenging
a slew of traditions,

00:01:42.456 --> 00:01:44.001
caused quite a ruckus.

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:46.976
There was more press for "Pamela"
than for Parliament.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.868
It spawned intense debate
and several counter-novels.

00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:52.241
Still, for all those
who couldn't accept "Pamela,"

00:01:52.265 --> 00:01:54.932
others were eager
for this new fictional world.

00:01:54.956 --> 00:01:57.659
This best seller
and all its literary heirs -

00:01:57.683 --> 00:02:00.817
"Pride and Prejudice,"
"Jane Eyre," and yes, even "Twilight" -

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:04.434
have continuously shared the same tale
and taught similar lessons,

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.991
which are now conventional
and commonplace.

00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:10.440
Similarly, novels have helped
shape the minds of thought leaders

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:11.889
across history.

00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:14.318
Some scholars say
that Darwin's theory of evolution

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:16.824
is highly indebted to the plots
he read and loved.

00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:21.507
His theory privileges intelligence,
swiftness, and adaptability to change -

00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:23.529
all core characteristics in a hero.

00:02:23.553 --> 00:02:26.473
Whether you're reading
"Harry Potter" or "Great Expectations,"

00:02:26.497 --> 00:02:28.992
you're reading the kind of plot
that inspired Darwin.

00:02:29.016 --> 00:02:32.533
Yet, recent studies show that his theory
might not be the whole story.

00:02:32.557 --> 00:02:35.427
Our sense of being a hero -
one man or one woman

00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:38.646
or even one species
taking on the challenges of the world -

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.904
might be wrong.

00:02:39.928 --> 00:02:42.365
Instead of being hardwired for competition

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.976
for being the solitary heroes
in our own story,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.056
we might instead be members
of a shared quest.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.640
More Hobbit than Harry.

00:02:50.283 --> 00:02:52.800
Sometimes, of course,
the shoes we've been walking in

00:02:52.824 --> 00:02:53.975
can get plain worn out.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.044
After all, we haven't walked just one mile

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:58.036
in Jane Austen's or Mark Twain's shoes -

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.600
we've walked about
100 trillion miles in them.

00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:03.899
This isn't to say that we can't
read and enjoy the classics;

00:03:03.923 --> 00:03:05.710
we should travel with Dickens,

00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:08.359
let Pip teach us
what to expect from ourselves,

00:03:08.383 --> 00:03:12.333
have a talk with Austen and Elizabeth
about our prides and prejudices.

00:03:12.357 --> 00:03:14.843
We should float with Twain
down the Mississippi,

00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:17.648
and have Jim show us
what it means to be good.

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:19.894
But on our journey,
we should also keep in mind

00:03:19.918 --> 00:03:21.616
that the terrain has changed.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.525
We'll start shopping around for boots

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.755
that were made for walking into a new era.

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.109
Take, for instance, Katniss Everdeen
and her battle with the Capitol.

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:32.900
Can "Hunger Games" lead us into thinking
about capitalism in a new way?

00:03:32.924 --> 00:03:34.075
Can it teach us a lesson

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.573
about why the individual should not
put herself before the group?

00:03:37.597 --> 00:03:40.451
Will "Uglies" reflect the dangers
of pursuing a perfect body

00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:42.702
and letting the media
define what is beautiful?

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:45.514
Will "Seekers" trod a path
beyond global warming?

00:03:45.538 --> 00:03:49.439
Will the life-and-death struggles
of Toklo, Kallik, Lusa and the other bears

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:52.986
chart a course for understanding animals
and our place in their world?

00:03:53.646 --> 00:03:57.198
Only the future will tell which stories
will engage our imagination,

00:03:57.222 --> 00:03:59.731
which tales of make-believe
we'll make tomorrow.

00:04:00.248 --> 00:04:01.924
But the good news is this:

00:04:01.948 --> 00:04:04.976
there are new stories
to venture in every day,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.429
new tales that promise to influence,
to create and to spark change -

00:04:09.453 --> 00:04:12.111
stories that you might
even write yourself.

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:14.667
So I guess the final question is this:

00:04:15.253 --> 00:04:17.362
What story will you try on next?
