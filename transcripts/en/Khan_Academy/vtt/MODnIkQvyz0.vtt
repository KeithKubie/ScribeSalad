00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:01.827
- [Voiceover] We've already spent a lot of time talking

00:00:01.827 --> 00:00:05.927
about proteins, and how they do a huge variety of things

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:07.122
in biological systems,

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:10.454
anything from acting as hormones to antibodies

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:13.218
to providing structures in cells, signaling mechanism,

00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:15.690
a whole series of things and their ability to do

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.989
all of those things in living systems

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:21.133
comes out, it's a by-product of their structure,

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.283
so what we want to talk about in this video

00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:25.540
is protein,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.286
protein structure, and to just get a high-level appreciation

00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:32.722
for protein structure, this is a hemoglobin molecule

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:33.918
right over here,

00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:35.625
and this hemoglobin molecule,

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:39.027
it's made out of four polypeptide chains.

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.592
Two of them have 141 amino acids,

00:00:41.592 --> 00:00:44.623
two of them have 146 amino acids,

00:00:44.623 --> 00:00:49.049
for a total of 574,

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.899
574 amino acids.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.154
But you see, they don't just go into some random

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.670
configuration, they come into a configuration that is really

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.883
good for doing what hemoglobin does,

00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:02.119
and that is being a transporter for oxygen,

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.356
being a transporter for oxygen within red blood cells.

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:08.481
So how do proteins like hemoglobin,

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:10.118
there's many, many other types of proteins

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:11.918
that do many, many other types of things.

00:01:11.918 --> 00:01:13.787
How do they get their structure?

00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:15.226
Well, one way to think about it is,

00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:18.547
there's different layers of the structure,

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:20.718
or there's different degrees of structure.

00:01:20.718 --> 00:01:22.912
The first degree of the structure we can call

00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:24.851
the primary structure.

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:28.090
Primary structure, and this is really just the sequence

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.692
of the amino acids.

00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:31.747
When we talk about the translation step,

00:01:31.747 --> 00:01:35.254
when we go from mRNA and we go to a ribosome

00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:37.854
and the tRNA brings the amino acids and puts them,

00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:39.189
and starts linking them together,

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.954
it's setting up the primary,

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:43.253
it's setting up the primary structure.

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:45.726
The DNA, the information in DNA,

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:46.887
that's essentially what it's coding.

00:01:46.887 --> 00:01:50.393
It's coding for what order do we put the different amino

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:52.088
acids in, so this is just the order,

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:53.760
the order,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.641
order of,

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:58.218
of the amino,

00:01:58.218 --> 00:02:00.262
of the amino acids.

00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:01.457
Now the next level of structure,

00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:04.615
this is just the order, this is how we form our polypeptide,

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:07.286
but how does a polypeptide start getting bent into

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:09.457
these shapes to be able to do the different things

00:02:09.457 --> 00:02:10.860
that it needs to do?

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.848
Well the second,

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:14.890
the second order of our structure,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.746
or I could say the secondary structure,

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:18.988
secondary structure,

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:22.820
this is due to interactions of the peptide backbone.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.127
Due to interactions,

00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:30.618
interactions of the backbone

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:33.420
of the peptide,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.194
of the peptide backbone,

00:02:36.194 --> 00:02:38.888
and I have some examples of that.

00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:42.127
I have some examples of that right over here.

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:44.391
You see, right over here, we have a bunch of,

00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:46.609
we have a polypeptide chain.

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.756
We have a bunch of amino acids that are bonded

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:50.591
with the peptide bonds.

00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:51.984
This is a,

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:54.724
this is a peptide bond over here.

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:56.315
This is a,

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:58.927
this is between the carbonyl carbon and the nitrogen,

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:01.121
another peptide bond between the carbonyl carbon

00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.828
and the nitrogen, another peptide bond.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:04.650
And this chain,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.483
this polypeptide chain, you can imagine maybe it goes

00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:08.528
down here,

00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:12.030
maybe it goes around, maybe it comes back, who knows?

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.043
But we see that when it comes back,

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:16.086
we still are going from nitrogen

00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:19.581
to carbonyl carbon, polypeptide linkage,

00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:22.286
nitrogen, carbonyl carbon,

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:23.923
peptide linkage,

00:03:23.923 --> 00:03:25.351
but what you see happening is,

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:27.987
from these two chains, the backbones are interacting.

00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:30.425
I actually didn't even explicitly even draw the side chains.

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:33.989
I just put an "R" here for the different side chains,

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.009
but you see how they're interacting.

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.086
Right over here, we have nitrogen.

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:40.885
Nitrogen is electronegative.

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:43.788
It would hog the electrons from the hydrogen,

00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:47.155
so the hydrogen's going to have a partially positive charge.

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:49.024
Oxygen is electronegative.

00:03:49.024 --> 00:03:51.485
It's going to hog the electrons from the carbon,

00:03:51.485 --> 00:03:54.121
so it's going to have a partially negative charge,

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:55.688
and so this hydrogen, this oxygen,

00:03:55.688 --> 00:03:57.255
they're going to be attracted to each other.

00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:58.416
This is a hydrogen bond,

00:03:58.416 --> 00:04:00.251
our good, old friend the hydrogen bond.

00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:02.422
Same thing is going to happen over here,

00:04:02.422 --> 00:04:04.488
same thing is going to happen over here.

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:06.822
And so these two chains,

00:04:06.822 --> 00:04:08.784
these can form kind of this sheet,

00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:10.084
in fact it's called,

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:13.289
this is called a beta-pleated sheet.

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.817
Beta-pleated,

00:04:16.817 --> 00:04:19.349
beta-pleated sheet.

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.950
Now, over here, I have also constructred a beta-pleated

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.318
sheet but you might notice the difference.

00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:28.424
This one went from the nitrogen to the alpha carbon,

00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:30.158
this is the alpha carbon over here,

00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:32.886
to the carbonyl carbon, nitrogen, alpha carbon,

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:35.591
carbonyl carbon, and this one was also going in the same

00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:37.728
direction, nitrogen,

00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:40.526
alpha carbon, carbonyl carbon, nitrogen,

00:04:40.526 --> 00:04:42.685
alpha carbon, carbonyl carbon,

00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:45.890
so this is a parallel beta-pleated sheet.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.814
These, both of these side chains that are interacting,

00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:52.519
sorry, both of these backbones that are interacting

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.922
are going in the same direction,

00:04:54.922 --> 00:04:56.722
so we would just call this one,

00:04:56.722 --> 00:05:00.785
we would just call this one a parallel beta-pleated sheet.

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:04.299
Now this one, they're parallel, but what we see going on,

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:07.322
we go nitrogen, alpha carbon, carbonyl carbon,

00:05:07.322 --> 00:05:10.154
nitrogen, alpha carbon, carbonyl carbon,

00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:11.443
that's on the left side,

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:14.218
but on the right side, we're going carbonyl carbon,

00:05:14.218 --> 00:05:16.087
alpha carbon, nitrogen.

00:05:16.087 --> 00:05:19.024
Carbonyl carbon, alpha carbon, nitrogen.

00:05:19.024 --> 00:05:20.255
We're going in the opposite direction.

00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:21.323
In fact, even to construct this,

00:05:21.323 --> 00:05:23.459
I copy and pasted this but I rotated it around.

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.524
You can see that I've actually drawn it upside down,

00:05:26.524 --> 00:05:28.219
and so here, we have these two things,

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.855
you still have the hydrogen bonds between these,

00:05:30.855 --> 00:05:34.593
between these partially positive ends of these,

00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:37.391
of this bond, this nitrogen-hydrogen bond,

00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.692
at the hydrogen end,

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:40.956
and this partially negative charge of the oxygen.

00:05:40.956 --> 00:05:42.024
You still see,

00:05:42.024 --> 00:05:44.090
you still have these hydrogen bonds,

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.121
but, and these backbones are parallel,

00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:49.222
but they are going in different directions.

00:05:49.222 --> 00:05:51.879
They are, so we would say these are anti,

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.690
these are anti-parallel beta-pleated sheets.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.722
So, anti,

00:05:56.722 --> 00:05:59.415
anti-parallel beta-pleated sheets.

00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:02.353
So this is another form of a secondary structure.

00:06:02.353 --> 00:06:04.187
Now this over here, we see,

00:06:04.187 --> 00:06:07.728
we see that the backbone is going in this,

00:06:07.728 --> 00:06:10.584
it's going in this, in this helical structure,

00:06:10.584 --> 00:06:13.707
and we have, essentially, hydrogen bonds between

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:16.691
the different layers of the helices,

00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:20.975
or between the different layers of the helix, I should say.

00:06:20.975 --> 00:06:24.354
So, over here, this oxygen is partially negative,

00:06:24.354 --> 00:06:25.422
partially negative charge.

00:06:25.422 --> 00:06:27.221
This hydrogen, partially positive charge,

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:28.684
so I have a hydrogen bond.

00:06:28.684 --> 00:06:30.925
I could have a hydrogen bond over here,

00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:33.293
and so that's what gives this a helical,

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.687
a helical structure,

00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:36.916
and we would call this an alpha,

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:39.412
an alpha helix,

00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:42.593
so these interactions between the backbone,

00:06:42.593 --> 00:06:46.338
between the backbone, the peptide backbone,

00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:48.421
that's the secondary structure.

00:06:48.421 --> 00:06:50.557
That's the secondary structure of a protein.

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:52.775
Now, we're not done yet because you could imagine

00:06:52.775 --> 00:06:54.992
these side chains have something to say.

00:06:54.992 --> 00:06:57.558
Some of these side chains are hydrophobic,

00:06:57.558 --> 00:07:00.693
so they would want to kind of pull that part into, kind of,

00:07:00.693 --> 00:07:04.073
away from, if it's in water, away from the outside.

00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:06.928
Some of these side chains might form hydrogen bonds

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:08.518
with other side chains, so they,

00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:10.283
those would interact in certain ways.

00:07:10.283 --> 00:07:12.454
You could have side chains that form, actually,

00:07:12.454 --> 00:07:13.754
disulfide bonds,

00:07:13.754 --> 00:07:17.318
actually covalent bonds with other side chains,

00:07:17.318 --> 00:07:19.337
and we're gonna go into a lot more detail of that

00:07:19.337 --> 00:07:21.161
in a future video but the,

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.855
the third, I guess, the third form of structure,

00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:26.421
and we'll call that the tertiary structure,

00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:27.953
the tertiary structure,

00:07:27.953 --> 00:07:31.680
this is due to interactions of side chains,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.322
so, due to side chain,

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:40.620
due to side chain interactions.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.058
Due to side chain interactions.

00:07:43.058 --> 00:07:45.589
And so you can imagine, you know, if, let's say I have

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:48.990
this, you know, this thing over here, maybe,

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.788
maybe I have a bunch of hydrophobic,

00:07:51.788 --> 00:07:54.459
hydrophobic side chains right over here.

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:55.457
I'm just drawing them as "R"

00:07:55.457 --> 00:07:57.025
but let's just assume they're hydrophobic

00:07:57.025 --> 00:08:00.055
and let's say that the H2O is out here,

00:08:00.055 --> 00:08:02.156
they might, and we'd have to think in three dimensions,

00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:05.256
but they might want to get away from the H2O,

00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:08.251
and likewise, you can maybe have hydrophilic side chains,

00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:10.957
maybe polar side chains might be on,

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.454
might be on the outside.

00:08:12.454 --> 00:08:15.194
You might have a situation where,

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.725
where one side chain,

00:08:17.725 --> 00:08:20.384
let's call it R1 and another side chain R2,

00:08:20.384 --> 00:08:22.857
maybe they form hydrogen bonds with each other.

00:08:22.857 --> 00:08:25.794
Maybe they have an ionic bond with each other,

00:08:25.794 --> 00:08:27.745
so there's a bunch of different types of side chain

00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:30.113
interactions that we could actually think about,

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:32.493
and we'll go into more depth in that in a future video.

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:36.522
Now, any protein that's made up of a single polypeptide

00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:38.820
is only going to have primary structure, secondary structure

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.190
and tertiary structure,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.025
but if we're dealing with something like hemoglobin,

00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:44.788
that's made up of more than one polypeptide,

00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:48.747
then we're going to talk about quaternary structure.

00:08:48.747 --> 00:08:52.126
So, quaternary,

00:08:52.126 --> 00:08:57.443
quaternary, quaternary structure,

00:08:57.443 --> 00:08:59.858
quaternary structure,

00:08:59.858 --> 00:09:02.842
and this is all about how the different polypeptide chains

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.523
come together to form the larger,

00:09:05.523 --> 00:09:07.892
to form the larger complex,

00:09:07.892 --> 00:09:09.889
so, multiple,

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:12.989
multiple, I guess you could say, interactions or arrangement

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:16.089
of multiple chains together.

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:18.120
So, arrangement,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.451
arrangement of multiple,

00:09:22.451 --> 00:09:25.260
multiple, in the case of hemoglobin we had four,

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.450
multiple peptide, peptide chains.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.820
So hopefully that gives you an appreciation,

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.027
and this is a fascinating thing.

00:09:33.027 --> 00:09:35.918
Protein structure is a fascinating area,

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:37.788
in fact, there are so many permutations,

00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:40.493
so how you can, how you can actually construct proteins,

00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:43.647
that if we understand that better, we'll be able to,

00:09:43.647 --> 00:09:45.659
much better be able to go from DNA,

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:47.691
to be able to translate to primary structure,

00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:49.723
and then to really figure out how proteins work,

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:51.615
what they do, how they can be fixed,

00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:53.891
how they can maybe provide other functions,

00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:56.637
so it's a fascinating, fascinating field of study.
