00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.201
For the rest of the day,
every decision I have to make,

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:03.369
every question
life throws at me,

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:05.638
I will run it
by the Magic 8 Ball

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.607
and do what it
tells me.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.741
And in order
to keep the rest of the world

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:11.644
in the dark about this
rather odd practice,

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:13.479
I'm gonna keep the 8 Ball
here in this fanny pack.

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:16.616
I don't want anyone
to think I'm weird.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:17.483
So...

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:18.851
Shall I head out into the world?

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:23.523
[fabric rustling]

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.024
"Most likely."

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.225
Very well then.

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:29.028
Should I
use the men's room?

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:32.231
(Forrest voice-over)
As I set out
on this journey of chance,

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:33.232
the idea of giving up
all of the day's

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:35.735
decision-making
responsibilities

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:38.371
to this children's toy
struck me as a relief...

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:39.872
Should I help
pick this stuff up?

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:41.841 align:start size:63% position:38%
That would be great.

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:44.811
(Forrest voice-over)
Though one with certain risks.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.513 align:end size:22% position:22%
"No."
Sorry.

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:51.517 size:84% position:58%
[Ed muttering indistinctly]

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.853
Can I say hello
to these two people?

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.322
(Forrest voice-over)
Since 1950,
the iconic Magic 8 Ball,

00:00:56.355 --> 00:00:59.625
with its mysterious triangle
afloat

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:02.195
in an inky blue
nontoxic realm,

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.330
has provided advice
and premonition

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:06.499
to those adrift
in the inky blue,

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:08.034
often toxic, waters of life.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:11.737
Can I cross the street?

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.574
These "ask again later"s
are a real problem.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:17.076
The more I embraced
the randomness of life...

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.713
Shall I share my food
with this hungry creature?

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:24.117
(Forrest voice-over)
The more meaningful even the
smallest decision seemed to be.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.319
[clicks tongue]

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.489
Should I
chase after this squirrel?

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.158
(Forrest voice-over)
And I had a lot of fun.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.794
[Forrest chuckling]

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:35.828
Where did--Okay.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.998
Should I follow him
up into the tree?

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:41.033
[grunting]

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.602
[laughing]
This is great!

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.704
(Forrest voice-over)
But, of course, I wasn't happy

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.105
with all of the 8 Ball's
decisions.

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:47.140 align:start size:72% position:28%
Shall I have a hot dog?

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.875
[fabric rustling]

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:50.843
(Forrest voice-over)
And it soon became clear

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:53.079
that this plastic ball
also had the capacity

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.780
to complicate my family life.

00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:55.815
[phone rings]
It's Suzanne.

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:58.417
Okay, uh, can I answer this,
please?

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.219
(Forrest voice-over)
Despite many attempts
to contact her,

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:02.755
I had not spoken
with my ex-wife Suzanne

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.191
since I gave a toast
at her rehearsal dinner,

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:06.792
that caused her
to call off her wedding.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:08.227 align:start position:0%
He is constantly sleeping with
baseball groupie whores!

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.862 align:end position:100%
What?
What is going on?

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:11.864
Yes.
Yes!

00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.232
Yes.
Hello. Hi. Hi.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.601 align:end position:100%
(Suzanne)
Hi, Forrest, I saw you called
many times.

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:17.904
Yeah, hi.
Hey, what's up?

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.840 align:end position:100%
(Suzanne)
Were you calling to apologize
for ruining my life again?

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:24.010
Uh...

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.012 align:start size:28% position:72%
(Suzanne)
Forrest?

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.181
Yeah, no, I--just a second.

00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.216
Uh,
"Better not tell you now."

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:31.617
Okay?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.085 align:end position:100%
(Suzanne)
"Better not tell me now"?

00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:34.353
Yeah.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:35.821 align:end position:100%
(Suzanne)
What does that even mean?

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:36.789
Uh...

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:37.723 align:end position:100%
(Suzanne)
Are you sorry or not?

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:39.659
[fabric rustling]
- Forrest.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.827
Just a second.
Just a second.

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:44.931
"Don't count on it."

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.332 align:end position:100%
(Suzanne)
Really?

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:47.934 align:end position:100%
All right,
go [bleep] yourself.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.669
- Stop calling me.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:51.971
Ask me another question.
Ask me a different question.

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.372
(Forrest voice-over)
While I was ready
to talk through

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.975
the issues Suzanne and I
were experiencing,

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:57.843
it was clear
that the Magic 8 Ball was not.

00:02:57.876 --> 00:02:59.712
What?
