the miracle with the last 20 years that
 

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.720
the miracle with the last 20 years that
is three and a half GDP growth three and

is three and a half GDP growth three and
 

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:12.700

something we can do not only by the
 

00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:56.320
something we can do not only by the
effort these talk about but also the

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:56.330
effort these talk about but also the
 

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.549

of all my of the total smart grid so if

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:11.630
of all my of the total smart grid so if
 

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:14.500
of all my of the total smart grid so if
we solve this the last one mile of the

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:14.510
we solve this the last one mile of the
 

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.630
we solve this the last one mile of the

that would be a totally different world

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200
that would be a totally different world

that would be a totally different world
that good it just imagine if there is a

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:24.740
that good it just imagine if there is a
 

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.120
that good it just imagine if there is a
carbon tax or some right pricing these

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:28.130
carbon tax or some right pricing these
 

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.600
carbon tax or some right pricing these
things would take off people clamor for

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:31.610
things would take off people clamor for
 

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:37.090
things would take off people clamor for
absolutely surfing whatever yeah so I

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:37.100
absolutely surfing whatever yeah so I
 

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:39.250
absolutely surfing whatever yeah so I
think of this I'm not these guys know a

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:39.260
think of this I'm not these guys know a
 

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.720
think of this I'm not these guys know a
lot more about energy and alternative

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:40.730
lot more about energy and alternative
 

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:42.760
lot more about energy and alternative
energies than I do so I think of these

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:42.770
energies than I do so I think of these
 

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:44.130
energies than I do so I think of these
things as an akan

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:44.140
things as an akan
 

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:49.960
things as an akan
and the carbon tax is is good for many

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:49.970
and the carbon tax is is good for many
 

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:53.710
and the carbon tax is is good for many
reasons but I think perhaps one of the

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:53.720
reasons but I think perhaps one of the
 

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.870
reasons but I think perhaps one of the
most important ones is that I personally

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880
most important ones is that I personally
 

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.210
most important ones is that I personally
don't trust the the the politicians to

00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:58.220
don't trust the the the politicians to
 

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.480
don't trust the the the politicians to
be able to figure out what the right

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:00.490
be able to figure out what the right
 

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:06.270
be able to figure out what the right
alternative is so having government

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:06.280
alternative is so having government
 

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.680
alternative is so having government
invest in alternatives and make

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:08.690
invest in alternatives and make
 

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.120
invest in alternatives and make
decisions they're not very good at

they're pretty the track record is not

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:13.610
they're pretty the track record is not
 

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:15.790
they're pretty the track record is not
good on that and if you've been reading

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:15.800
good on that and if you've been reading
 

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.100
good on that and if you've been reading
anything about the u.s. you probably

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:18.110
anything about the u.s. you probably
 

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.730
anything about the u.s. you probably
have read about some of the investments

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:21.740
have read about some of the investments
 

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.120
have read about some of the investments
that the government is made in some

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:24.130
that the government is made in some
 

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:28.120
that the government is made in some
alternative energy companies that didn't

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:28.130
alternative energy companies that didn't
 

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:31.090
alternative energy companies that didn't
quite make it so to speak so the

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:31.100
quite make it so to speak so the
 

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.010
quite make it so to speak so the
advantage of a carbon tax is clearly

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:33.020
advantage of a carbon tax is clearly
 

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.620
advantage of a carbon tax is clearly
then you put the onus on the private

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:35.630
then you put the onus on the private
 

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.690
then you put the onus on the private
sector to figure out what the best

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:37.700
sector to figure out what the best
 

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.820
