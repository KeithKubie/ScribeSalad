00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000
alright so so you are gonna do something
 

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.130
alright so so you are gonna do something
a little different but then they just

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140
a little different but then they just
 

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.120
a little different but then they just
kind of they do the stuff that every

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:41.130
kind of they do the stuff that every
 

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.639
kind of they do the stuff that every
other horror film right now is doing you

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:43.649
other horror film right now is doing you
 

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:44.870
other horror film right now is doing you
know so it's not something where it's

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880
know so it's not something where it's
 

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.079
know so it's not something where it's
like this is super tired and super just

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:48.089
like this is super tired and super just
 

00:12:48.089 --> 00:12:50.840
like this is super tired and super just
you know decades of this going on I mean

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:50.850
you know decades of this going on I mean
 

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.139
you know decades of this going on I mean
this is like the past maybe six seven

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:54.149
this is like the past maybe six seven
 

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:56.180
this is like the past maybe six seven
years of this like high to becoming

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:56.190
years of this like high to becoming
 

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.180
years of this like high to becoming
standard this is stuff where I me a

00:12:59.180 --> 00:12:59.190
standard this is stuff where I me a
 

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:00.860
standard this is stuff where I me a
couple decades ago we said we wish

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:00.870
couple decades ago we said we wish
 

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.690
couple decades ago we said we wish
horror films would do this now they're

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700
horror films would do this now they're
 

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.810
horror films would do this now they're
all doing this so which is tricky

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.820
all doing this so which is tricky
 

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.860
all doing this so which is tricky
because then you have to come up with

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:06.870
because then you have to come up with
 

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.810
because then you have to come up with
different things and different ways to

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:08.820
different things and different ways to
 

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:12.110
different things and different ways to
get scares so so I get it stuff but

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120
get scares so so I get it stuff but
 

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.220
get scares so so I get it stuff but
that's probably the biggest problem with

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:13.230
that's probably the biggest problem with
 

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.410
that's probably the biggest problem with
this film everything else in terms of

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:15.420
this film everything else in terms of
 

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.620
this film everything else in terms of
like a compelling story and the

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:18.630
like a compelling story and the
 

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.990
like a compelling story and the
like that I mean it's you know you're

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000
like that I mean it's you know you're
 

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.340
like that I mean it's you know you're
not gonna get that I mean these

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:22.350
not gonna get that I mean these
 

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.570
not gonna get that I mean these
conjuring movies are stupid but if they

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:26.580
conjuring movies are stupid but if they
 

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.300
conjuring movies are stupid but if they
can be done you know just to get a few

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:29.310
can be done you know just to get a few
 

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.610
can be done you know just to get a few
scares and you like the characters and

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620
scares and you like the characters and
 

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.170
scares and you like the characters and
and you're with them as you're getting

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:33.180
and you're with them as you're getting
 

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.760
and you're with them as you're getting
through this stuff I think it's what

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:34.770
through this stuff I think it's what
 

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.990
through this stuff I think it's what
people are looking for I think it's why

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000
people are looking for I think it's why
 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.470
people are looking for I think it's why

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.970
scares and I usually don't like jump
scares but like I said we've gotten a

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980
scares but like I said we've gotten a
 

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.360
scares but like I said we've gotten a
little better at them in a sense it's

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:38.370
little better at them in a sense it's
 

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.220
little better at them in a sense it's
like they're still cheap but we've got a

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:40.230
like they're still cheap but we've got a
 

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:41.900
like they're still cheap but we've got a
little bit more creative with them you

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:41.910

know uh it the film version of it had a

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540
know uh it the film version of it had a
 

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.090
know uh it the film version of it had a
lot of jump scares but but they were

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:47.100
lot of jump scares but but they were
 

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.190
lot of jump scares but but they were
creative that there was a creativity to

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:49.200
creative that there was a creativity to
 

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.510
creative that there was a creativity to
a man like that they're doing that uh

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:50.520
a man like that they're doing that uh
 

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.030
a man like that they're doing that uh
but this feels like that creativity is
