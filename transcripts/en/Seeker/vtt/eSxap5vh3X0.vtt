00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.440
Saturn's moon Titan has fascinated astronomers
for quite some time.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:13.530
Now this little world has thrown us a curveball
-- it might be older than Saturn itself!

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.350
Hello everyone, I'm Ian O'Neill, space producer
for Discovery News and I want to talk about

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.330
one of the weirdest moons ever studied.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.390
According to most prediction models, moons
are formed from the same material as the planets

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.390
they orbit.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.880
In other words, the planet comes first, then
the moon.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.119
But a new finding about Saturn's moon Titan
seems to contradict that model.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.269
NASA's Cassini spacecraft recently beamed
back some bizarre isotopic data about Titan's

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:35.269
atmosphere.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.600
All elements have a certain number of isotopes,
which means the same element can have a different

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.859
number of neutrons but the same number of
protons in the nucleus.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.819
Titan's atmosphere is rich in Nitrogen, so
researchers can get a good idea of its origins

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.609
by measuring the quantities of Nitrogen-14
and Nitrogen-15.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.600
Any changes in the ratio between these two
isotopes can help scientists decipher how

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.199
old the atmosphere is and its possible origin.

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.350
And this is the strange thing: the isotopic
ratio shows Titan's atmosphere has similar

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.780
characteristics to the ancient comets that
formed in the outer solar system, over 4 billion

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.780
years ago.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.750
This study provides a hint that Titan's building
blocks didn't form from the hot gases that

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.159
created Saturn, it's actually composed of
ancient ices, pre-dating Saturn!

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.140
There is also an implication for Earth.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.170
It has always been assumed that the majority
of Nitrogen in OUR atmosphere was deposited

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.290
by asteroid and comet impacts.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.439
Our planet's atmosphere is also Nitrogen rich,
and maybe some of it comes from the same ancient

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.909
material as Titan's.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.719
Of course, this isn't the only thing that
makes Titan a bit strange.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.770
It's also the only moon in the entire solar
system to have a thick and dynamic coat of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.909
gas with a surface pressure about 60 percent
higher than Earth's.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.280
There are large 'seas' of liquid methane and
ethane and these organic compounds have their

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.750
own cycles through Titan's atmosphere, much
like Earth's water cycle.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.310
Methane RAIN has also been spotted, which
is pretty alien to us Earthlings.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.560
Titan is also rich in organic compounds on
its surface -- hydrocarbons cover the moon,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.380
leading many astrobiologists to believe it
is similar to Earth when it was very young.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.070
The building blocks of life are in abundance,
motivating scientists to push for another

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.179
surface mission.

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.780
The European Space Agency did one in 2005,
called Huygens.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.890
The robotic lander was attached to the Cassini
spacecraft that orbits the ringed gas giant

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.890
to this day.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.590
Huygens beamed back photographs revealing
a pebbly world covered with river channels,

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.920
dunes and valleys.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.220
So the finding that the building blocks of
Titan may be older than Saturn itself only

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.319
adds to the fascinating science surrounding
it -- fascination that can only be satisfied

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.560
when we land another mission onto the moon's
surface, or -- my PERSONAL favorite -- send

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.450
a probe to sail in one of Titan's seas.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.159
What about you- are you eager to find out
more about Titan?

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:38.190
Let us know in the comments below and keep
coming back for new DNews videos every day

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.370
