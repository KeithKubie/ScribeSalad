You are listening to radio lab radio lab

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.680
from W N Y S C e n n p r

3
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.320
<v 1>looking to gate in Canadian with electric gate electric gates.</v>

4
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.550
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab,

5
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.250
the podcast and today, nice out here.

6
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.110
We're on a road trip in Escondido, California, which is close to San Diego.

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.440
Regular suburban neighborhoods, sprinklers, lawns, ice houses.

8
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.440
Pretty ordinary except this might be him.

9
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.570
He gets him for David Hallway now. It going good. How are you?

10
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.850
<v 0>David is an ecologist and an evolutionary biologist from UC San Diego. Oh yeah,</v>

11
00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:48.670
you can just park. And when we saw him, he was standing in the street.

12
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:49.780
<v 1>Oh, he's got the things.</v>

13
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:54.610
He's got the things holding what look like some kind of Nice hookup pipe.

14
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.400
When we got out of the car,

15
00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:01.180
he walked us over to the side of the road near a driveway and pointed down in

16
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.150
CRG and financing the, the uh, uh, along the curb here.

17
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.930
And there's a little guy here. Yeah, that's, that's a arch in right there.

18
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.210
<v 0>DRG Antonio.</v>

19
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.620
So I'm just going to click some margin hung out from the side of this, uh,

20
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.990
side of the sidewalk and you are scraping the surface of the dirt with your

21
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:18.360
fingers. There's a little nastier.

22
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.260
As soon as he scrapes about a hundred ants just appear and start running in

23
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:23.094
every direction.

24
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.580
That's what we're seeing in just small numbers of workers that were probably in

25
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:29.140
the leaf. Litter at the surface doesn't seem so small though.

26
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.840
It looks like they're everywhere. This is tiny. This is tiny.

27
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.780
And there's a lot of them. First hundreds,

28
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.310
then thousands of are wrecking up their day looking at you're lucky.

29
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.830
The reason the three of us grown adults are now squatting on this little patch

30
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.460
of dirt in somebody's front lawn is because around 10 years ago,

31
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:49.461
David and colleagues discovered that this very spot at this particular driveway,

32
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.040
and we're at two to one, one eucalyptus in front of this house.

33
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.800
<v 1>What's the edge of a vast empire</v>

34
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.380
right about at this driveway. And then empire ends right at that one driveway

35
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.490
<v 0>to do one eucalyptus to demonstrate this.</v>

36
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.190
David takes this hookah thing of these caring's.

37
00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:08.900
So there's a tube that you suck on that connects to a vial.

38
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.050
He sticks the tube into the scrum, sucks up a few ants,

39
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.130
drops him into the vial. Okay, you just put one at one.

40
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.063
It's that one right there. Okay.

41
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.240
And then he walked just to the other side of the driveway,

42
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:23.800
like 17 steps sucked up some aunts on that side. A new

43
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.300
<v 1>here is a new guy, plopped him into the same cup.</v>

44
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.120
So that one right there and waited [inaudible] nobody seems to.

45
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.800
So you've got these answering from different sides of the driveway and the same

46
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:36.650
cup at first. They don't seem to notice each other. Okay,

47
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:39.440
so we're watching and I'm watching one guy, one

48
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.630
mm, and then

49
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.440
right away, wow. Two aunts just lunge at each other.

50
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.700
Oh God. They lock in Tena and soon they're in a ball.

51
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.770
This isn't good. That is heavy duty fighting. They're like

52
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.030
<v 2>rolling around one Scott looks like it's got ahold of the leg and the other</v>

53
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.260
one's got [inaudible]. It's got a Chit Tanner.

54
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.170
It's also listing a couple of legs because it got yanked out your tire.

55
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.020
And one side. Look at that. See, one side of his legs are missing.

56
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.810
He's going around in circles cause he has nowhere else to go.

57
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.880
<v 0>It's no holds barred.</v>

58
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.440
Now here's the thing.

59
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.370
What we saw in that cut between those two aunts was a tiny version of what is

60
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:31.210
happening all over the planet. This one family of aunts,

61
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.760
the one on the left of the driveway, not the right, has fought its way,

62
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.830
not only across huge hunks of America,

63
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.940
they now control enormous swaths of the globe and how they pulled this off.

64
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.490
Well, that's maybe more frightening than the fact that they've done it. Yeah.

65
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.900
Now we're going to get to all that,

66
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:51.580
but first we have to go back to the mid 18 hundreds to a little place in the

67
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.130
north eastern corner of Argentina. That's right.

68
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.430
Have you ever been to this place? Oh yeah. Yeah. We've been there several times,

69
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.890
but yeah, actually on the first, that's Neil Tsutsui.

70
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.070
He's an evolutionary biologist and says, if you're an ant,

71
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.900
this place is kind of special.

72
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.290
Meaning hellish because it's a place where two rivers come together. Yeah.

73
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.580
It's this region in the floodplain between the Rio partner and the Rio,

74
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.730
or why a lot of different kinds of ants live there in this little spot.

75
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.680
And he says, when it rains

76
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.420
<v 3>[inaudible],</v>

77
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.440
<v 0>which it does there all the time, the floodwaters rise</v>

78
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.110
<v 3>[inaudible],</v>

79
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.230
<v 4>everybody's home gets flooded and you have to flee.</v>

80
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.410
The aunts are forced up into the trees or any high ground. That's ecologist,

81
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.250
Mark Moffitt. And then as the waterfalls,

82
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.390
all these different subgroups meet again and they have to start battling from

83
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:45.220
scratch. That's Milan, Milan, Milan.

84
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.800
They battle relentlessly because this place is always flooding.

85
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.040
And over time, eons of this,

86
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.240
they simply simply do not know how to stop killing each other.

87
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.910
<v 0>So you've got this breeding ground for incredibly nasty ants there in northern</v>

88
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:06.150
Argentina. All of these different groups all fighting and fighting,

89
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.060
more or less keeping each other in line. But

90
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.253
<v 3>one day</v>

91
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.980
<v 0>in the 18 hundreds as steamship rolls up to say Bueno Saturdays,</v>

92
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:20.960
which is a big part of the mouth of these two rivers,

93
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.520
<v 4>a boat pulls up, a ramp comes down. And, uh,</v>

94
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.140
somehow a couple of aunts from one of those Argentine and families are up the

95
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.410
gangplank probably, you know, within the first hour, you know,

96
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:34.560
cause they're always fleeing floods. So they're, they're programmed to move.

97
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.780
That's what they do. They're moving into coffee bags.

98
00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:39.000
You can imagine they're moving into all kinds of things.

99
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.190
And then the boat pulls out

100
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.720
<v 2>and this family of aunts leaves their war torn hill hold of the homeland behind</v>

101
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.120
<v 4>until eventually, oh, sooner or later it was bound to happen. 1890,</v>

102
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.850
as the first time they were seeing there,

103
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.430
<v 1>they show up in New Orleans</v>

104
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.890
<v 4>and then, uh, 1907, and they leapfrogged all the way to [inaudible]</v>

105
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.950
<v 1>cornea cut off on y'all.</v>

106
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.590
<v 4>They were simultaneously found in San Francisco on Los Angeles, I believe.</v>

107
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.670
How did they get to California? Well, the Panama Canal wasn't open yet,

108
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.490
so it seems likely that they took the train.

109
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.373
<v 3>Wow.</v>

110
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.620
<v 1>Now here's the thing about these hands that make them different from all the</v>

111
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:34.550
other aunts because they grew up in this crazy blood soaked floodplain of death.

112
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.510
Their survival strategy was pretty simple. Kill everything.

113
00:06:38.511 --> 00:06:42.720
If it's not one of us, kill it. No matter what.

114
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.720
Other ants will have occasional sex with other age groups,

115
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.770
capture them and make them into slaves. Adopt their children. These ants,

116
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.190
these ants don't fool around. They don't have sex outside the group.

117
00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:55.680
They never take slaves. And if they catch your babies,

118
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.183
<v 5>they eat them.</v>

119
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.700
<v 1>And it turns out there's a side benefit to being a cruel segregationist,</v>

120
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.350
violent bastard. Cause being that way allows these ants to stay

121
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:09.513
<v 3>pure</v>

122
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.100
<v 1>genes stay the same genetically pure, yeah, genetically pure.</v>

123
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.580
But when they stay genetically pure, they can stay unified as a group.

124
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:20.870
And when they do that, they can spread in ways the other ants just can't

125
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.000
<v 5>see</v>

126
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.670
<v 1>ants. You smell like. That's how they know who's in and who's out.</v>

127
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.270
First thing they do when they meet another aunt is they sniff them using their

128
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:32.360
antenna. Something sort of like a tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, sniff, sniff, sniff,

129
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:33.180
sniff, sniff.

130
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.340
<v 4>They they register odor. It's a parallel to nationality in humans.</v>

131
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.880
As long as they sense that identity throughout the individual, say meet,

132
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.850
they're happy.

133
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.840
<v 1>Hey now with most ants, as they spread over vast distances,</v>

134
00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:49.290
they start to commingle with other as queens come and go,

135
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.330
and inevitably that smell, nationality dilutes. It begins to change.

136
00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.920
But with these Argentine ants,

137
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.490
the smell doesn't change from queen the Queen or from nest to nest.

138
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.080
Even if they go way off, conquer totally new territory, build distant nests,

139
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.100
<v 4>all these different nests function as sort of a fluid network.</v>

140
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.450
They can fuse and vision through time. For example,

141
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:14.300
you might be nesting on the edge of a sidewalk and the sprinklers come on,

142
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.890
everybody evacuated and all the queens and workers in babies get moved to higher

143
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:23.690
ground and may fuse with a nest that's already existing at the higher ground.

144
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.230
<v 1>So all these Argentine ants living across the south in the u s they,</v>

145
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.710
they get along and if you don't have to worry about each other and you've killed

146
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:31.550
off everything else,

147
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.610
they can focus their energy on producing more Argentine ants

148
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.000
<v 4>and all you have to do is outnumber the enemy enough and you can wipe out</v>

149
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.990
anything. Even an animal, 5,000 times their size.

150
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:47.730
Foreign Lizards are dropping and abundance out in California because the aunts

151
00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:50.340
simply run all over them and they can never sleep.

152
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.930
These lizards normally eat ants,

153
00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:56.070
but they simply can't grab these answer too fast and too small and

154
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.390
<v 0>so they're literally being killed by their own food, does sum up,</v>

155
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.610
they are very nasty, very loyal and they're extraordinarily numerous.

156
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:08.500
Put those three things together and what you get is gangas con and an ant

157
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.380
<v 1>c Ah, USA in your shadow. Bye</v>

158
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.760
<v 0>during the 1950s this tight knit brutal family of and starts to spread deeper</v>

159
00:09:19.761 --> 00:09:20.600
into California.

160
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.070
<v 1>Thanks in large part to all the new freeways because now that gets spread faster</v>

161
00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:28.700
and farther. Like say you put out a potted plant on your front porch,

162
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.940
the ants move in overnight. Next Day, pick up that plant and move it,

163
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.780
you know, a hundred miles away.

164
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.710
The next day there they are in this new place that's so far away from where they

165
00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:42.170
were yesterday and they can conquer that. And not only that,

166
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.370
<v 0>it is after all the 1950s and 1960s and you've got suburbs springing up all over</v>

167
00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:50.240
America, lots of lawns, lots of springs

168
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.530
<v 1>[inaudible] go on off, on, off, on off.</v>

169
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:58.590
Which if you're an aunt is in many ways very similar to home fresh terrain

170
00:09:59.801 --> 00:10:01.870
that's been exposed by the reseeding floodwaters.

171
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:06.280
Humans have modified the habitat in California in ways that Argentine ants

172
00:10:06.281 --> 00:10:07.114
really like.

173
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.030
<v 0>So the Argentine answer happy,</v>

174
00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.980
and most people don't even notice this is happening until we get to the 1990s in

175
00:10:14.981 --> 00:10:19.360
fact, in 1998 Neil, our entomologist friend and his colleague Andy Suarez,

176
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:24.520
they're now studying Argentine ans around San Diego and they begin to wonder how

177
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:29.110
far can a family like this have ants spread and still remain pure and still

178
00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:31.860
remain loyal to each other. So in the summer of that year,

179
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.710
Neil and Andy hop into a car and they go on a little road trip

180
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.420
<v 4>starting in San Diego and hitting more.</v>

181
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.880
They took a cup full of Argentine ants from San Diego and periodically they

182
00:10:45.881 --> 00:10:47.290
would stop, get out of the car,

183
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:50.860
kneel down with their aunt hookah pipes and suck up local aunts,

184
00:10:50.861 --> 00:10:54.850
whoever happened to be there and then pop those hands into the cup with the San

185
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.030
Diego. And now if the ants think they're part of the same colony,

186
00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.870
they won't fight. That's right. So we put an answer from Los Angeles, tap, tap,

187
00:11:01.871 --> 00:11:02.860
tap, sniff, sniff, sniff.

188
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.980
And they recognize San Diego ants as being members of the same colony.

189
00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:09.490
So they know the colony extends, or at least from San Diego to Los Angeles,

190
00:11:09.491 --> 00:11:13.660
but they keep going. If you go up to Santa Barbara, no aggression, snip, snip,

191
00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:17.500
snip, nothing, no fighting to San Louis Obispo, tap, tap, tap. That same thing,

192
00:11:17.501 --> 00:11:20.080
snip, snip, snip, snip. They think they're all members of the same colony.

193
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.160
Still no fight up to San Francisco. Tap, tap, tap. The same things. Sniff,

194
00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:26.980
sniff, sniff. And this continued all the way to a little town,

195
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.680
a hundred miles north of San Francisco,

196
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.090
and that site displayed no aggression towards the ants that we collected at the

197
00:11:34.091 --> 00:11:38.470
very beginning of our road trip from over 600 miles away in San Diego.

198
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.230
Just think about that for a second. Okay.

199
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.200
<v 1>Remember those anthills you might've had in your front lawn,</v>

200
00:11:44.201 --> 00:11:45.490
you had a little little mounds.

201
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.240
Imagine one of those 600 miles wide,

202
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.420
give or take with trillions and trillions of ants in it.

203
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.630
<v 0>Scientists call this the super colony,</v>

204
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.860
the large California super colony and scientists kept tracking this colony.

205
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:04.150
They realized these ants had hitchhiked far beyond California.

206
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:06.900
They're all over Europe. Europe's got actually,

207
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.160
you're just got the largest quality known. That's Australian and scientist,

208
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.510
Melissa Thomas. Yes. In 2002,

209
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:17.830
she worked with David Hallway to check just how far this one super colony has

210
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:22.090
expanded. Uh, Australia has some where you are. We've got some here in Perth.

211
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.500
Yes. And um, over in um, Melbourne and Sydney area,

212
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.780
up and down Spain, all around Italy,

213
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.010
<v 4>around Greece, Pan many Atlantic and Pacific islands, Hawaii, Easter island,</v>

214
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.790
places like that. They've taken over much of northern New Zealand.

215
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.860
They've taken over parts of South Africa.

216
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.180
All these places are occupied by the same family of the other, the same colony.

217
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.880
They think they're all members of the same colony. In fact,

218
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:50.260
we imported Argentenians from Japan, Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand,

219
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.890
Europe brought them to UC Berkeley and they put all of these aunts from all

220
00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:57.760
these different places in the same cup like we did on our road trip, tap, tap,

221
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:01.480
tap, tap, tap, sniff, sniff, sniff, sniff and no fighting.

222
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:03.920
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

223
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.890
<v 0>you've got say an ad from Okinawa in Japan and an aunt from Genoa in Italy.</v>

224
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.510
There's 6,000 miles distance, maybe 150 generations apart.

225
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.130
And yet they still know each other.

226
00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:16.360
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

227
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.690
<v 4>they still recognize each other as members of the same colony because the smell</v>

228
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.520
that bonds them together hasn't changed. At some point in the past,

229
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.061
you know,

230
00:13:25.061 --> 00:13:29.860
one colony in Argentina got picked up and moved around and spread and continue

231
00:13:29.861 --> 00:13:34.000
to spread and continue to spread the descendants of those aunts we have now

232
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:36.520
across all continents except Antarctica.

233
00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.890
They still think they're all members of the same family.

234
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.700
So here you've got this monoculture, right?

235
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.590
[inaudible] that's really violent on the edges. Yeah.

236
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.370
But then if you're on the inside and part of the group, very, very peaceful.

237
00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.980
And since there's only one other creature that can do this,

238
00:13:50.981 --> 00:13:54.760
I can create an allegiance across vast, vast spreads of earth.

239
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.040
I couldn't help it ask Neil, do you ever, do you ever analogized to,

240
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:03.700
to human history when you will look at these things? It's tempting to, but uh,

241
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:05.170
I try not to because it, you know,

242
00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:07.120
these sorts of situations are kind of a roar shark.

243
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:09.700
You can see whatever you want to. And then, yeah. And so, you know,

244
00:14:09.701 --> 00:14:12.100
for our Argentine, at research, we've had people say, look,

245
00:14:12.101 --> 00:14:15.310
the lesson from this is that we should all be like Argentine ants and get along

246
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:19.570
and cooperate and we'll succeed. But then on the other hand, I've had, you know,

247
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:23.020
white supremacist websites cite my research and say, you know,

248
00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:27.760
this is evidence that they're, the key to success is not mixing the races.

249
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:34.700
<v 0>The, the unsettling part is that the, at least in efficacy like there, right.</v>

250
00:14:34.701 --> 00:14:38.300
This has, this has been a very successful formula for these ants.

251
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.150
Well, if it lasts, right.

252
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:47.630
Which brings us to a chill, what's your whole big name? Jill Shanahan.

253
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:52.010
Jill Shack. In 1995 Jill was working with Andy Suarez in San helping him

254
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.490
<v 1>map the ant empire. And one day as part of her job,</v>

255
00:14:55.491 --> 00:15:00.491
she found herself in park and housing complex just outside San Diego looking for

256
00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:04.450
Argentine ants. So do you find them? Yeah, I believe that they had,

257
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.820
there was a colony at the base of a tree. No. Before she left,

258
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:11.020
she grabbed some Argentine ants from the lab and these tree aunts,

259
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.870
they looked exactly the same as her lab and they're pretty easy to identify and

260
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:18.230
she figured they would just meet the new ants and go sniff, sniff, get along,

261
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.460
or ignore each other.

262
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:24.610
But when she plopped one of these trees into the cup with one of her lab bands,

263
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.910
these guys were fighting,

264
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.380
one was more aggressive than the other and start biting the other one and then

265
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:33.470
they rappel each other and get to get into a tight little ball and just,

266
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.880
and you're watching this and no one has ever seen Argentenians fake before.

267
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.920
You're seeing something nobody's seen before.

268
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:43.370
Did you have any sense that that was happening? No. I guess not.

269
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.010
Which may explain why Jill is now in the interior design field,

270
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:53.630
but this is a big deal because what it means is that another family of Argentine

271
00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:55.610
ants had made it over from the old country

272
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:57.663
<v 3>in Brazil,</v>

273
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.150
<v 1>that old fight to America I was going to spent a lot of time at.</v>

274
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.050
So scientists like Melissa began to wonder how big is this new empire?

275
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.630
Interesting. And where do the two meet exactly.

276
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.860
I'll go is to find where that territory met in nature.

277
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.230
So Melissa heads out with her standard ant gear.

278
00:16:15.231 --> 00:16:18.770
The hookah pipe thing does suck up the ants, the fight cup to plop them into,

279
00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:22.790
right. She'd do the Fight Cup test in all these different places in the area,

280
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:27.950
trying to zero in on where that border might be slightly sort of get closer and

281
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:31.760
closer and closer and eventually she finds herself walking down a street and a

282
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:34.730
normal subdivision in Escondido. She looks down

283
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.980
<v 6>and she sees it. This thick channel of death,</v>

284
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:43.600
dead bodies, hundreds, hundreds of thousands,

285
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.930
hundreds of thousands of dead bodies and from all directions.

286
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.210
<v 1>Live ants were pouring into this area and fighting to the death</v>

287
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:56.330
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

288
00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:01.330
<v 1>masses and masses of them fighting piles and piles of them killing each other.</v>

289
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.610
It's pretty extraordinary to see. Actually,

290
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.820
there were times when we didn't even need to get out of the car to find the

291
00:17:07.821 --> 00:17:11.390
super colony boundary because you'd see the dead workers spilling over the curb,

292
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.250
spilling drinks us back to where we started that driveway and David Halloway.

293
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.220
Oh my God. They're just like almost bouncing off the bottom.

294
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.500
This then is the price of empire.

295
00:17:21.501 --> 00:17:25.120
These aunts have conquered a huge portion of the globe. Oh.

296
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.490
But every day they pay the price in bodies at the border.

297
00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.590
Like this guy has lost all that. You see, he's only,

298
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:34.280
he's only got limbs on one side now and that price might be going up.

299
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.300
The scientists have now figured out that several more families of Argentine ants

300
00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:41.740
have hitchhiked their way over. Yeah. This is that. This is what I expect.

301
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.620
They gonna die or they'll pro, yeah,

302
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.230
the ones that are really injured probably won't live too much longer. Oh my God.

303
00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:49.860
Those two, when you show in the end,

304
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:55.650
<v 0>this strategy of violence and intolerance seems to be pretty good until it meets</v>

305
00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:57.054
itself.

306
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:59.563
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

307
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:05.290
<v 0>or even worse, something bad or oh my God, this too.</v>

308
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.610
When you shut the Ho, I think Godfrey opened the other one up.

309
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.360
He just went into another fight. Oh look, they're going into a circle. Oh,

310
00:18:13.361 --> 00:18:16.900
they're in the ball of death. Well, not quite.

311
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:21.010
They've just sort of locked, locked the will become the ball. Big things too.

312
00:18:21.011 --> 00:18:25.000
Douglas Smith for production help on this piece. Douglas. I'm Jad Abumrad.

313
00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.040
I'm Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
