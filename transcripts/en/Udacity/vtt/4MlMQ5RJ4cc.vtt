00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.710
So, your Facebook page yes definitely dynamic. It's

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.240
built by Facebook servers and rendered in your browser.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.080
The udacity.com logo, not dynamic. It doesn't change

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.570
very often it's just a file sitting on a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.300
server. A blog's front page. Yes, definitely dynamic.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.694
You know, a blog's front page probably takes all

00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:22.917
of the blog's and resets somebody has written

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:25.311
and collates them together and renders a page that

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:27.420
you know, includes you know, the top ten or

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.100
whatever. And Google search results. Definitely dynamic. You run a

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.860
search, Google in the background you know, does a

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.790
search on, on all of their computers, puts together results

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.610
and then renders them for you on the fly.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.830
So, these are all examples of dynamic content. You know,

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.590
content that's basically put together by programs. And, in this

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.910
class we're actually going to be building a blog, so that's

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.840
what you're going to to learn how to build.
