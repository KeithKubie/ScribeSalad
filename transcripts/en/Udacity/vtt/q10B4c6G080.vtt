There are a variety of ways that we could start this problem. I'll start by

00:00:05.048 --> 00:00:10.225
simplifying what's under the radical sign, and distributing the 2x with the

00:00:10.237 --> 00:00:15.463
quantity x plus 1. So if you look at what's under the radical sign, the square

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:20.777
root of 2x cubed, broken out, that's the square root of 2 times x squared times

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.508
x. x squared comes out as x times the square root of 2x. And next, we're going

00:00:26.508 --> 00:00:32.270
to distribute the 2x with the quantity x plus 1. This gives us x times the

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:38.235
square root of 2x, raised to the fourth power, plus 2x squared, plus 2x. Now,

00:00:38.362 --> 00:00:46.190
let's simplify what's in the parentheses. This gives us 4x to the 6th, plus 2x

00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:48.320
squared, plus 2x.
