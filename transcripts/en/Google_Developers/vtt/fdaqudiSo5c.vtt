RUTH JOHN: I'm Ruth.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.550
I'm a coding artist.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.850
And this is how I code.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.540
The way that I code is--

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.420
yeah, the downstairs of my
house is actually my studio.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.920
So that's where I sit and
write the majority of my code.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.513
There are other exciting things
in the studio, which is why

00:00:16.513 --> 00:00:17.680
I spend a lot of time there.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.810
There's a laser cutter.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.180
I've got a sewing machine.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.960
It's where I build
all my electronics.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.270
I spend a lot of time
coding by myself,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.970
so I use Cal, who's
my rubber duck,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.549
to talk through all the
problems and all the decisions

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.740
that I have when I'm coding.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.930
So Cal helped me out
recently, because I

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.840
was building a step sequencer,
which is an instrument.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.070
And I had a problem
with the scheduling,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.020
because the notes have to go
sort of one, two, three, four.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.850
And I couldn't see why
the notes were just

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.730
going one, two, one, two.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.690
And talking it through
with him really helped.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.020
I realized that I was resetting
a variable at the wrong time.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.970
