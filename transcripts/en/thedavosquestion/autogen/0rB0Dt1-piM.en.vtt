00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:43.940 align:start position:0%
now you know if you order a transformer
 

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.970 align:start position:0%
now you know if you order a transformer
at<00:25:44.090><c> three</c><00:25:44.330><c> years</c><00:25:44.750><c> as</c><00:25:44.960><c> a</c><00:25:44.990><c> expedited</c><00:25:45.590><c> delivery</c>

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:48.980 align:start position:0%
hmm we know that we order transformers

hmm we know that we order transformers
so<00:25:49.670><c> I</c><00:25:49.700><c> think</c><00:25:50.180><c> you</c><00:25:50.990><c> know</c><00:25:51.080><c> in</c><00:25:51.200><c> that</c><00:25:51.320><c> kind</c><00:25:51.680><c> of</c>

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:51.830 align:start position:0%
so I think you know in that kind of

so<00:25:57.080><c> I'd</c><00:25:57.230><c> say</c><00:25:57.410><c> transmission</c><00:25:58.010><c> we</c><00:25:58.310><c> should</c><00:25:58.430><c> have</c>

00:25:58.570 --> 00:25:58.580 align:start position:0%
so I'd say transmission we should have
 

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.460 align:start position:0%
so I'd say transmission we should have
we<00:25:58.700><c> should</c><00:25:58.910><c> just</c><00:25:59.090><c> assume</c><00:25:59.480><c> that</c><00:26:00.230><c> we're</c><00:26:00.380><c> going</c>

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:00.470 align:start position:0%
we should just assume that we're going
 

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.620 align:start position:0%
we should just assume that we're going

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:02.630 align:start position:0%

we have better transmission and that's
