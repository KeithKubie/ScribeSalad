00:00:00.945 --> 00:00:05.884
Voiceover: What I want to go
over in this video is what Khan
Academy is in its current form

00:00:05.884 --> 00:00:10.450
and where I see it going,
what I hope it will grow into.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.872
Most of you are probably already
familiar with the video library
that's available at Khanacademy.org.

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:25.552
There already about 1,400 videos
covering everything from basic
mathematics to college level calculus,

00:00:25.552 --> 00:00:29.604
biology, chemistry,
differential equations,

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:32.252
there's even a piece on economics,

00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:35.197
but I really see it growing
well beyond the video library

00:00:35.197 --> 00:00:37.678
and I've already started
working on the software piece.

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:41.126
This right here, this
map structure you see,

00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:43.526
this is the Khan Academy knowledge map,

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:48.434
(writing) Knowledge, knowledge map.

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:58.076
and you can access it at
Khanexercises.appspot.com

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.399
You just need a Google
ID and you can log in,

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.199
it's completely free and
hopefully it always will be.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:11.011
If you click on the knowledge
map tab you'll see something
like this for yourself.

00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:16.618
This shows you, essentially, the
current curriculum of the software.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:19.897
I want to be very clear, the
videos, there's 1,400 videos,

00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:22.243
far more extensive than
the software piece.

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:25.575
The software piece right now, because
it frankly is more labor intensive,

00:01:25.575 --> 00:01:29.806
or since I've been the only labor, maybe I
should say since it's more Sal intensive,

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:34.921
than the video piece there's only
about 70 software modules right now

00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:39.794
and this covers from basic
arithmetic through about Algebra II.

00:01:39.794 --> 00:01:43.254
The idea here is to start
everyone at the most basic level,

00:01:43.254 --> 00:01:44.718
a level that anyone can start at.

00:01:44.718 --> 00:01:48.817
This module right here is 1 + 1 = 2 or

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:53.662
2 + 3 = 5 and as they get
streaks of 10 in a row right

00:01:53.662 --> 00:01:58.920
it keeps moving them up, at their own
pace, to more and more advanced topics.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.208
Over here we have level
4 linear equations,

00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:05.122
systems of equations, multiplying
expressions, so on and so forth.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:06.916
Just to get an idea of
what these look like

00:02:06.916 --> 00:02:09.718
and if you log in you can just click on
the modules and start working on them,

00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:12.966
but this is a screen shots
of one of the modules.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:16.324
This is a screen shot
of multiplying decimals.

00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:20.199
The paradigm that I think this
type of software introduces,

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.925
although it might seem very subtle,

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:25.832
I think it's quite transformational to
how we traditionally teach and learn.

00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:28.755
The traditional model
is you have a lecture,

00:02:28.755 --> 00:02:31.920
you have a lecture that normally occurs

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.197
while everyone's in a room
together at some scheduled time.

00:02:35.197 --> 00:02:39.322
Then you have practice in the form of
homework that normally goes on at home,

00:02:39.322 --> 00:02:42.832
usually on your own and if you
get stuck there's not much help

00:02:42.832 --> 00:02:44.257
and you get very little feedback.

00:02:44.257 --> 00:02:46.798
The book might have every
other problems answer,

00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:49.677
but you have no idea why
you got it right or wrong.

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:53.952
Then you have some type of
assessment, some type of quiz.

00:02:53.952 --> 00:03:00.250
You maybe get 80 or 90% right
on that quiz, you are labeled
a B student or an A student

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.803
and then you move on to the next topic.

00:03:02.803 --> 00:03:04.453
(writing) Next topic.

00:03:04.453 --> 00:03:10.774
And because of this structure, and
it's no individuals fault, it's more
mainly a bi-product of the system,

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:15.747
everyone has to learn at the
same pace, the lecture is 1
to 30 people at their pace.

00:03:15.747 --> 00:03:19.353
It doesn't matter if half the class
is lost or half the class is bored,

00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:20.932
that's what everyone's getting.

00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:24.128
No matter how good of a teacher you
are you have to cater to everyone,

00:03:24.128 --> 00:03:28.295
so some percentage will be lost
and some percentage will be bored.

00:03:28.295 --> 00:03:32.453
Then no mater whether you
get 10% wrong or 20% wrong

00:03:32.453 --> 00:03:37.337
or 30% wrong as long as you are
"passing" you move on to the next topic.

00:03:37.337 --> 00:03:42.333
Anyone familiar with math or science knows
that if you have some core weakenesses,

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:46.694
if there's 10% of exponent
problems you didn't know how to do,

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:49.937
later on when you move
to more advanced topics

00:03:49.937 --> 00:03:53.654
that's going to be a major
hole in your foundation,

00:03:53.654 --> 00:03:58.067
it's going to make it almost impossible
to master more advanced topics.

00:03:58.067 --> 00:03:59.828
So, this is the traditional model.

00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:03.487
What this software is advocating
or maybe what I am advocating,

00:04:03.487 --> 00:04:09.255
is a model where all of this
is happening simultaneously in
a very data rich environment.

00:04:09.255 --> 00:04:13.152
You start off with instructions,
that's the whole point of lectures.

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:17.248
When you do it within this
framework you're getting your
instruction from the videos.

00:04:17.248 --> 00:04:19.664
(writing) You're getting your
instruction from the videos.

00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:24.284
Let's say you're seeing the
multiplying decimals module for
the first time in your life,

00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:28.273
so you're right here, right
here on the knowledge map.

00:04:28.273 --> 00:04:31.448
You've just gotten 10 in a row
right on level 4 multiplication,

00:04:31.448 --> 00:04:34.984
so it is now suggesting that you
work on multiplying decimals,

00:04:34.984 --> 00:04:37.682
this will be orange in your knowledge map.

00:04:37.682 --> 00:04:41.490
So you're seeing this for the first
time, you have no idea how to do it,

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.154
you can click on watch video
and this window will pop up

00:04:45.154 --> 00:04:49.737
and you can watch one of, well in this
case, the multiplying decimals video

00:04:49.737 --> 00:04:53.515
from Khanacademy.org it
will be pumped directly in.

00:04:53.515 --> 00:04:57.383
Once you watch it you can start
doing some practice problems.

00:04:57.383 --> 00:05:00.276
Once again the paradigm
here is very different.

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:03.955
If you don't know how to do this
particular problem you can click hint

00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:08.287
and it will give you the exact
steps, step by step for this problem.

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:11.923
So, when the person, or the viewer first
went here they just saw the problem

00:05:11.923 --> 00:05:15.581
and all of this highlighting
and all of that, that happened
after they started clicking hint.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:21.920
I encourage you to experiment on it,
with it on Khanexercises.appspot.com.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:29.939
Once you start getting good
at it, you don't move on
after only getting 90% or 80%

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.523
and it labels you as a B+
student or as an A- student.

00:05:33.523 --> 00:05:37.861
This says I want you to keep doing
these multiplying decimal problems

00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:42.542
and I, the software, will keep generating
multiplying decimal problems for you,

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:46.799
even if it takes you a thousand
problems until you get 10 in a row.

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:49.619
(writing) 10 in a row.

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:53.784
The paradigm or the idea
that I'm trying to advocate

00:05:53.784 --> 00:05:58.248
is for you not to move on until you
have complete proficiency in a concept.

00:05:58.248 --> 00:06:00.422
Right here on this streak
as you get problems right,

00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:03.607
you can try it out, the stars
fill up until you get 10 in a row.

00:06:03.607 --> 00:06:05.067
Once you get 10 in a row it will say,

00:06:05.067 --> 00:06:10.644
"Hey you know what you're doing, we think
you should move on to the next concept."

00:06:10.644 --> 00:06:13.648
The other area where this is kind
of ... this is the user experience,

00:06:13.648 --> 00:06:18.588
but behind the scenes here we have a
super, super data rich environment.

00:06:18.588 --> 00:06:20.884
Just to give you an idea
of the potential here ...

00:06:20.884 --> 00:06:23.660
Everything you're seeing,
this is already built,

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.076
but I think this can all be
taken to even another level.

00:06:26.076 --> 00:06:29.192
This right here is data
I get from YouTube.

00:06:29.192 --> 00:06:33.248
(writing) That right there
is data I get from YouTube.

00:06:33.248 --> 00:06:36.248
This really is, on some level,
the educational holy grail.

00:06:36.248 --> 00:06:41.320
This is the actual data on
the Khan Academy balancing
chemical equations videos.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.191
This is the video here,

00:06:43.191 --> 00:06:48.516
but right here YouTube shows me the
attention span as someone watches videos.

00:06:48.516 --> 00:06:52.830
(writing) This is attention,
this is attention.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.530
They're measuring it against the
average YouTube video of this length.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.405
Let's say this is 7 minutes,
so at 7 minutes into the
video I'm doing pretty well,

00:07:03.405 --> 00:07:04.963
I'm still above the average.

00:07:04.963 --> 00:07:08.725
There's always a natural drop off rate,
but my drop off rate is doing better

00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:13.878
and actually it improves relative
to the average as we go further
and further through the video.

00:07:13.878 --> 00:07:15.323
So you can imagine the potential here.

00:07:15.323 --> 00:07:19.498
You can keep recording videos
and see which ones have the
best audience attention.

00:07:19.498 --> 00:07:25.497
I've seen some of my videos where
this graphic looks more like this.

00:07:25.497 --> 00:07:27.195
(writing) Where the graphic
looks more like this.

00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:31.357
I can go back and say gee, something must
have happened right there in the video,

00:07:31.357 --> 00:07:35.025
at maybe minute 8, that
caused people to drop off,

00:07:35.025 --> 00:07:37.535
maybe I said the word
orthogonality without defining it

00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:40.993
or I skipped a step in an equation
and I can either annotate that video

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:44.436
or I could re-record the video so that
the new version does something like ...

00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:46.410
(writing) does something like that.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.225
Just off of the viewer data, off of
YouTube, you can do tremendous things,

00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:53.688
things that were never
possible in education before.

00:07:53.688 --> 00:07:57.612
When you couple that, when you actually
couple that with the exercises,

00:07:57.612 --> 00:08:01.636
when you actually know when
they watched the video, in
the context of what exercise,

00:08:01.636 --> 00:08:05.263
how they did on the exercises before
and after watching the videos,

00:08:05.263 --> 00:08:10.737
how many times they clicked on
hint, then all of the sudden you
can do far more powerful things.

00:08:10.737 --> 00:08:14.660
This right here is actual
data collected for a teacher.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.594
This is a daily spreadsheet
that is automatically generated

00:08:18.594 --> 00:08:21.883
for a teacher using Khan
Academy at a summer camp.

00:08:21.883 --> 00:08:23.927
These are all of the students.

00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:25.732
I've blurred them out for their privacy.

00:08:25.732 --> 00:08:29.595
Each column here is one of the
exercises in the Khan Academy

00:08:29.595 --> 00:08:35.254
and green means that the student has
already gotten 10 on a row in that module.

00:08:35.254 --> 00:08:37.244
Purple means that they're
working on it right now,

00:08:37.244 --> 00:08:39.291
but it seems like everything is good.

00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.740
Red means that they're working on it,
but they've done an awful lot of problems

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.271
without having gotten 10 in a row
yet, so this might be a problem area.

00:08:46.271 --> 00:08:52.024
The model that, I'm at least advocating
is, everyone works at their own pace,

00:08:52.024 --> 00:08:56.531
at home and in the
classroom using the software

00:08:56.531 --> 00:08:59.461
and the teacher gets these daily
reports, and it tells them,

00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:03.096
look teacher everyone is doing
fine, everyone is progressing,

00:09:03.096 --> 00:09:08.998
except for these 2 kids right here
are stuck on level 2 division.

00:09:08.998 --> 00:09:15.399
Why don't you take them aside,
have a very focused 30 minute,
1 to 2 sessions with them

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:20.671
kind of a tutorial with them and
then move on to the next 2 students.

00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:24.000
There's a couple of students who are
having trouble with level 4 subtraction,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.375
so that way the student is
always being directly catered too

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:34.276
and the teachers time is always
spent directly, directly hitting
pain points for the student.

00:09:34.276 --> 00:09:40.947
Just to highlight the power, at least in
my mind, of this asynchronous learning.

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:45.896
This is the actual data of that
same cohort of students as they
work through the summer camps.

00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:49.363
Just to understand what
this chart is showing,

00:09:49.363 --> 00:09:54.666
this vertical axis right here is
the modules that they completed

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:59.065
and the horizontal axis right
here is days on the summer camp.

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:01.653
The black line is the class mean.

00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:10.476
This is saying 5 days into the camp the
average student had completed 20 modules.

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:15.115
These green lines above and below
that are standard deviations
below and above the mean.

00:10:15.115 --> 00:10:19.846
I've plotted some, what I consider
interesting students trajectories here.

00:10:19.846 --> 00:10:22.778
I could plot all of the students here,
but it would be a very messy graph.

00:10:22.778 --> 00:10:25.752
What I want to show you in
particular is one student right here.

00:10:25.752 --> 00:10:30.612
On day 5 if you were to do an assessment
using a traditional learning model,

00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:33.595
if you were to do an
assessment on day 5 right here,

00:10:33.595 --> 00:10:39.255
you would say that this
student, this student in purple,

00:10:39.255 --> 00:10:42.327
that she is more than one
standard deviation below the mean.

00:10:42.327 --> 00:10:44.853
You would say that maybe she
needs some type of remediation.

00:10:44.853 --> 00:10:49.338
She is a C student or a D student,
maybe she shouldn't be in this class,

00:10:49.338 --> 00:10:53.255
but when you do it with an asynchronous
learning model you allow that student

00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:56.077
to work at their own pace, you don't
have to slow down the rest of the class

00:10:56.077 --> 00:10:58.444
for him or her, and this was a her.

00:10:58.444 --> 00:11:03.379
It turns out that she just needed a
little bit extra time on negative numbers.

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:06.050
This was a cohort of rising 8th graders.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.770
Everyone else, it was a little
bit of a review for her,

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.836
she needed extra time on negative numbers
and we were collecting data on everything.

00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:16.418
Each of these columns
represent a problem she did.

00:11:16.418 --> 00:11:19.865
This right here, this first column
was the very first problem she did.

00:11:19.865 --> 00:11:24.652
She got it wrong, that's why it's
red and it took her 33 or 35 seconds.

00:11:24.652 --> 00:11:26.615
The next one she got right,
maybe she guessed it,

00:11:26.615 --> 00:11:28.783
or maybe it was 2 positive
numbers being added

00:11:28.783 --> 00:11:32.779
and then the next two she got
wrong, then she got one right,
maybe she guessed, who knows.

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:35.056
Then this right here,
actually, I don't plot it,

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:39.264
but this is actually where she watched
the video, that's why it took her so long.

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:43.650
Then after that she started to
get some problems right, that's
what the blue bars represent.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.484
Not only did she get some ... she
got a few wrong here or there,

00:11:46.484 --> 00:11:49.916
but at the same time, the time it took
her to do problems also went down,

00:11:49.916 --> 00:11:51.854
you see the height of
these bars are going down.

00:11:51.854 --> 00:11:54.950
This is actually a distribution
of the times it took her.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:00.093
As you can see, you can actually
get granular date of what
peoples' actual pain points are,

00:12:00.093 --> 00:12:04.052
what remediation they need
without slowing anyone else down

00:12:04.052 --> 00:12:07.551
and then directly tackle that and
you get all of the data on it.

00:12:07.551 --> 00:12:12.608
At the same time, once she was able to
get through this, this one pain point,

00:12:12.608 --> 00:12:15.253
not only was she not below the average,

00:12:15.253 --> 00:12:18.452
but she was able to rocket
forward after she got through this

00:12:18.452 --> 00:12:21.608
and she actually, at the end of ... this
was actually only a month and a half,

00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:24.598
she finished at the 2nd or
3rd best student of the class.

00:12:24.598 --> 00:12:28.335
Just to give an idea, these
judgements that we place on
students are so arbitrary,

00:12:28.335 --> 00:12:31.089
back here you might have
called her a remedial student,

00:12:31.089 --> 00:12:36.536
out here you would say wow she
just rocketed straight through
level 3 linear equations,

00:12:36.536 --> 00:12:41.447
which are equations of this
form right here, which is
really above her grade level

00:12:41.447 --> 00:12:43.785
and would say, hey she's
maybe a gifted student.

00:12:43.785 --> 00:12:46.933
When you let every student work at
their own pace, at their own time,

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:50.859
not pushing people forward before
they're ready or holding people back,

00:12:50.859 --> 00:12:56.350
you really do see amazing
results out of students.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.516
Now, everything I've talked about so
far, everything I've talked about so far,

00:13:00.516 --> 00:13:02.580
we've talked about the video library.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.458
(writing) we've talked about the video
library, we've talked about the exercises.

00:13:07.458 --> 00:13:13.281
(writing) we've talked about
the exercises and how that
could be, the combination here,

00:13:13.281 --> 00:13:17.202
could be transformational for a classroom,
everyone working at their own pace

00:13:17.202 --> 00:13:19.519
and even if the software isn't being used,

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:21.342
there have actually been a few
teachers who've already emailed me,

00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:25.677
that they've flipped the model, instead
of doing lectures in the classroom

00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:28.650
and homework at home, they're now
doing homework in the classroom

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.361
and using the Khan Academy videos
at home which makes a lot of sense

00:13:32.361 --> 00:13:35.563
because you do the videos at your
own time, you can pause, repeat,

00:13:35.563 --> 00:13:40.404
look up stuff, you can review videos
at your own pace, at your own time,

00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:45.311
as you need them and then when you're
actually doing problems in the classroom

00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:49.195
when you're surrounded by your peers
and the teacher who can help you along

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:53.330
and really kind of give you assistance
and feedback when you need it.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.859
That's already happening,
even before the software,

00:13:55.859 --> 00:13:59.323
but I think when you have the
software it becomes even more rich,

00:13:59.323 --> 00:14:02.779
especially with the data collection,
but there is a situation of,

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:05.987
what if one of these
students were getting stuck.

00:14:05.987 --> 00:14:10.904
Let's say they're not working in
the framework of a classroom that
has already adopted this paradigm,

00:14:10.904 --> 00:14:17.907
what do they do, at least my view
point of the answer, that you
have peer-to-peer instruction.

00:14:17.907 --> 00:14:26.256
(writing) peer-to-peer, peer-to-peer
instruction, peer-to-peer instruction.

00:14:26.256 --> 00:14:29.799
So you've watched the videos, we
know you've watched the video,

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:31.706
the software knows
you've watched the video,

00:14:31.706 --> 00:14:36.588
you've done the exercises, we
know that you've done so many that
you're having a pain point here.

00:14:36.588 --> 00:14:42.172
What we can automatically do is
set up a peer-to-peer instruction

00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:46.343
with some other teacher, student,
tutor, it could be in the same city,

00:14:46.343 --> 00:14:49.601
it could be on the other side of the
planet and we could do it virtually;

00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:53.263
the same way that I started off with
my cousins where you have a pen tablet,

00:14:53.263 --> 00:14:58.720
you're doing this on a computer
but you have some type of
internet telephone connection

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.716
whether it's Skype or Google
voice or whatever else and
you're using a shared whiteboard,

00:15:02.716 --> 00:15:06.956
kind of something like what I'm writing on
right now, but it's live and in real time.

00:15:06.956 --> 00:15:08.953
You could actually even record.

00:15:08.953 --> 00:15:11.869
(writing) You could
record the interaction.

00:15:11.869 --> 00:15:14.052
One, that's valuable from
a safety point of view,

00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:18.457
but it's also valuable to have this
huge library of other interactions that

00:15:18.457 --> 00:15:20.750
maybe if I can't find a tutor immediately,

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.259
I can dig through the recordings of
other people who've had the same problem

00:15:24.259 --> 00:15:26.259
and I can get my question answered.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:32.331
The power here is not only are you able
to leverage all of the student body

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:35.054
of this virtual academy
to teach each other,

00:15:35.054 --> 00:15:40.744
but you also are doing it in
a very data rich environment
because you know what happens.

00:15:40.744 --> 00:15:45.889
Each of these, in isolation, I
think, is already a huge value add,

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:49.553
but when you do them together it
becomes a super-duper value add

00:15:49.553 --> 00:15:52.430
because not only do you have
the peer-to-peer instruction,

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:58.221
you use the exercises to
figure out exactly what type of
peer-to-peer instruction you needed,

00:15:58.221 --> 00:16:03.085
you know who to pair someone with because
you know maybe Sal is having trouble

00:16:03.085 --> 00:16:07.603
with level 1 exponents, Bill, we already
know has mastered level 1 exponents.

00:16:07.603 --> 00:16:11.652
So, let's set up that interaction and
then you have data on before and after.

00:16:11.652 --> 00:16:14.518
(writing) Before and after.

00:16:14.518 --> 00:16:19.806
You will even be able to assess
how good was that interaction.

00:16:19.806 --> 00:16:24.744
You can have a qualitative rating
from both the tutor and the tutee,

00:16:24.744 --> 00:16:26.621
I guess you could say or from the student.

00:16:26.621 --> 00:16:31.261
You can also have data on what happened
before and after that interaction

00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:35.320
and is it statistically significant
compared to other similar interactions.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.504
When you couple this, I really
think you are approaching
the holy grain of education.

00:16:41.504 --> 00:16:47.518
This right here is the virtual school
that I see Khan Academy growing into.

00:16:47.518 --> 00:16:51.993
Obviously these first two pieces, this
piece has been built to a large degree.

00:16:51.993 --> 00:16:56.325
I intend to continue to build it and
continue to add, really all topics.

00:16:56.325 --> 00:17:01.050
This is already starting to be
built, but I envision, right
now it goes through Algebra II,

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.822
if you look at the knowledge map.

00:17:02.822 --> 00:17:08.201
I completely see more and more
of these, you can see physics
problems budding off of this,

00:17:08.201 --> 00:17:12.173
you can see calculus budding off
of this, you can see chemistry
budding off at certain points.

00:17:12.173 --> 00:17:15.969
You can see genetics problems budding off
of this, probability, you can imagine.

00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:21.814
Right now there are 70 modules,
I imagine a world where you
can have 500 or 5,000 modules.

00:17:21.814 --> 00:17:26.886
That piece can obviously built
up, you could have other types of
exercises that are complimentary,

00:17:26.886 --> 00:17:29.143
maybe emersive type exercises.

00:17:29.143 --> 00:17:31.993
Then the part that I think has a lot
of value that has yet to be built

00:17:31.993 --> 00:17:38.135
is really the peer-to-peer piece,
but all of the technology already
exists today, I think, to do it.

00:17:38.135 --> 00:17:42.546
Just to give, I think, a hint of
where I think the social value is here

00:17:42.546 --> 00:17:45.732
and I'm going to do a quick
back of the envelope calculation

00:17:45.732 --> 00:17:51.931
because I think there is a huge
amount of ... it seems appealing
to a large percentage of people

00:17:51.931 --> 00:17:58.045
but just to get an idea of how
scalable, how much leverage this
type of a concept could have,

00:17:58.045 --> 00:17:59.631
or how much social value it can create.

00:17:59.631 --> 00:18:02.953
Let's just talk about the videos alone,
let's not even talk about the exercises

00:18:02.953 --> 00:18:07.582
or the peer-to-peer interactions and let's
just talk about the videos only in English

00:18:07.582 --> 00:18:10.442
although they are already
being translated into Spanish

00:18:10.442 --> 00:18:13.286
and Tamil, and there's a group in Poland.

00:18:13.286 --> 00:18:16.112
They could very easily be translated
to every major language in the world.

00:18:16.112 --> 00:18:20.906
Let's just talk about English,
let's say we have about 500 million,

00:18:20.906 --> 00:18:25.645
(writing) There's about 500 million
English speakers world wide.

00:18:25.645 --> 00:18:29.186
That includes, I think there's
about 350 million native speakers

00:18:29.186 --> 00:18:33.846
and 150 million people who are
speaking English as a second language.

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:36.684
Let's just say, this is a back
of the envelope calculation.

00:18:36.684 --> 00:18:42.278
Let's just say that 10% could
potentially use these type of videos,

00:18:42.278 --> 00:18:44.581
that they are at some point in
their life where they want to learn.

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:47.401
Maybe they're teachers who want
a new way to teach something

00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:49.985
or there are people going back to college,

00:18:49.985 --> 00:18:55.986
or they are your traditional
K-12 or college student,

00:18:55.986 --> 00:18:59.583
so 10% of the population
could stand to benefit.

00:18:59.583 --> 00:19:02.239
This is, you could kind of
view this as the market,

00:19:02.239 --> 00:19:06.595
but I speak of this in kind of a social
enterprise point of view, as the market,

00:19:06.595 --> 00:19:08.769
people who could benefit from it.

00:19:08.769 --> 00:19:12.982
We're already talking about 50 million, I
actually think this number is much larger

00:19:12.982 --> 00:19:17.278
because you should include parents
and teachers and really anyone
who wants to learn anything.

00:19:17.278 --> 00:19:22.054
Let's just say 10% of the population, so
you have a 50 million addressable market,

00:19:22.054 --> 00:19:26.984
and let's say that for whatever
reason only 10% adopt the videos,

00:19:26.984 --> 00:19:30.900
I'm only talking about the videos
here, so let's just cut that down.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:36.319
We're talking about 10% of
the 10% addressable market of
the English speaking world,

00:19:36.319 --> 00:19:42.515
which is really only 10% of
the world, I think making very
conservative assumptions here.

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:50.873
Sp, 10% penetration into the market
that, for whatever reason, it's
free and it's easily available

00:19:50.873 --> 00:19:55.205
and probably the most
extensive resource available,

00:19:55.205 --> 00:19:58.048
let's say just for
assumption only 10% adopt it,

00:19:58.048 --> 00:20:03.723
we're talking about 5 million
learners on a regular basis using it.

00:20:03.723 --> 00:20:07.077
Let's say that they each
watch a video roughly a week.

00:20:07.077 --> 00:20:15.756
We're talking about times say
50 video a year per person,

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.851
they're just watching one video a week.

00:20:17.851 --> 00:20:21.716
The data I'm seeing right
now is people are on average
watching a video every 3 days.

00:20:21.716 --> 00:20:25.248
Actually, some of them are
watching 2, 3 videos a day,

00:20:25.248 --> 00:20:26.950
but if we average all of
the unique viewers out,

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:30.268
it looks like they're watching a video
once every 2 or 3 days, so once a week,

00:20:30.268 --> 00:20:32.550
I think, is a very
conservative assumption.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:34.524
Remember, we're only talking
about the videos right now,

00:20:34.524 --> 00:20:37.528
we're not talking about even the
exercises or the peer-to-peer
instruction or all of that.

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:43.423
If you multiply that out, you
have 250 million video views.

00:20:43.423 --> 00:20:47.120
(writing) views per year.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.190
Khan Academy isn't there right
now because it doesn't have quite
that, really that mind share yet.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.954
I don't think most people are
even aware that it even exists,

00:20:54.954 --> 00:20:57.482
but I'm talking about the reality
where people do know it exists.

00:20:57.482 --> 00:21:01.743
You have 250 million video views a year,
we're talking about only the videos,

00:21:01.743 --> 00:21:04.261
only in English, we're making
some conservative assumptions.

00:21:04.261 --> 00:21:08.567
Let's say that a video view, the
social value of a video view.

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:15.937
(writing) Let's say the social
value, so the social value.

00:21:15.937 --> 00:21:17.889
Let's say, I don't know, it's $1.

00:21:17.889 --> 00:21:19.531
I'm just making an assumption here.

00:21:19.531 --> 00:21:21.941
My personal opinion, I think
it's far more than that.

00:21:21.941 --> 00:21:26.466
Private tutoring in any of these topics
can cost anywhere from $10 to $50

00:21:26.466 --> 00:21:29.224
and this, I think, is frankly
better than private tutoring.

00:21:29.224 --> 00:21:32.690
My cousin's have even told me that
I'm better on YouTube than I am live

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.394
because it's a less stressful environment,
they can pause, they can repeat,

00:21:36.394 --> 00:21:40.826
but let's say that the social value is
$1 which I think is very conservative.

00:21:40.826 --> 00:21:47.094
Then the total social return,
that just the videos, just the
videos using these assumptions

00:21:47.094 --> 00:21:49.122
would produce, just in English ...

00:21:49.122 --> 00:21:56.252
(writing) The social return in
this scenario would be $1 times
250 million video views a year,

00:21:56.252 --> 00:22:03.183
which would be $250 million,
$250 million annually, annually.

00:22:03.183 --> 00:22:07.118
I'm not doing some type of
present value where I'm looking
at all of the future value

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:12.685
created over the next 25 or 50
years, this is on an annual basis.

00:22:12.685 --> 00:22:14.854
This is using these
conservative estimates.

00:22:14.854 --> 00:22:19.001
If you had translated to
the top 10 languages you can
multiply this number by 10.

00:22:19.001 --> 00:22:24.573
If you make this 10% into
20% you can multiple this by
2, it will be 500 million.

00:22:24.573 --> 00:22:28.799
If you present value even this
number you're going to get
something in the billions,

00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:31.912
depending on how you present value and
your discount rate and all of that.

00:22:31.912 --> 00:22:36.620
You're going to get a number that's in
excess of multiple billions of dollars.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:43.320
This is all, in my mind, for a
very, very, very small relative
investment to support all of this.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.123
Remember, the social return is
calculated just from the video views.

00:22:46.123 --> 00:22:48.989
If you actually think about
it replacing actual education,

00:22:48.989 --> 00:22:53.130
you compare it to what's actually spent on
a per pupil basis in the developed world,

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.395
a $10,000 per pupil then the
numbers become really ridiculous,

00:22:57.395 --> 00:23:02.294
but if you just look at the
$250 million all of this, that's
the return just on the videos,

00:23:02.294 --> 00:23:07.660
but all of this could be built,
I think, by a team of 5-10
highly motivated engineers.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:16.772
(writing) 5-10, built and
maintained, motivated, 5-10
engineers including myself.

00:23:16.772 --> 00:23:20.858
So, you're really talking about
an operating budget depending
on the scale you do it at

00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:24.192
on the order of a million dollars a year.

00:23:24.192 --> 00:23:29.234
The videos, obviously I can keep
going and I would pay myself
far less than a million dollars,

00:23:29.234 --> 00:23:32.195
so just there you're
getting a huge social value,

00:23:32.195 --> 00:23:36.134
but even here if you're
looking at an operating budget
of a million dollars a year

00:23:36.134 --> 00:23:43.965
you really are talking about something
that has the impact to transform
education on a world wide basis

00:23:43.965 --> 00:23:49.208
and have a social return well,
well in excess of what I think
of this as kind of the base case.

00:23:49.208 --> 00:23:50.708
Even if this was the best case,

00:23:50.708 --> 00:23:57.441
a million dollar a year
getting a $250 million a year
payback is pretty tremendous.

00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:59.937
The last thing I want to highlight
is that this is all evergreen,

00:23:59.937 --> 00:24:05.167
this is all evergreen, these
videos and these modules they don't
have to be changed every year.

00:24:05.167 --> 00:24:08.267
Math and Science does
not change that fast.

00:24:08.267 --> 00:24:11.983
Once some of this, once most
of this content is built out,

00:24:11.983 --> 00:24:17.191
if I, God forbid, got hit by
a bus tomorrow, this social
return will still exist.

00:24:17.191 --> 00:24:20.733
It's not like as soon as these engineers
disappear that all of this disappears.

00:24:20.733 --> 00:24:23.378
As long as this is maintained
by some skeleton crew,

00:24:23.378 --> 00:24:28.929
you will still continue to generate
this much in social return.

00:24:28.929 --> 00:24:31.444
Anyway, I want to leave you there
and hopefully that gives you a sense

00:24:31.444 --> 00:24:35.637
of what I see Khan Academy, what
it is today, what I see it becoming

00:24:35.637 --> 00:24:39.637
and, I think, a sense of the real
value that this can have for the world.
