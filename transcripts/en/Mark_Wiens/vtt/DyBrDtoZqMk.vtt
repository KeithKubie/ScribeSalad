00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.235
- They're kinda similar to shrimp,

00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.377
but a little bit, or
quite a bit different.

00:00:03.377 --> 00:00:05.852
I'm gonna need to just reach
in with my fingers here.

00:00:05.852 --> 00:00:06.980
Oh, here we go.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.147
Alright, I think that's a good
piece, I'll eat that there.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:16.634
It's everything you want in
a good Chinese restaurant.

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:20.301
(lively instrumental music)

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:23.521
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.568
with migrationology.com in Hong Kong,

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:29.913
just took the metro to Tin
Hau Station this morning,

00:00:29.913 --> 00:00:33.194
and actually, I really
wanted to go this coffee shop

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:35.095
street food stall called Bing Kee

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:38.215
which is right in this
area, and I went there

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:40.468
last time I was in Hong
Kong, it's a great place,

00:00:40.468 --> 00:00:43.740
but unfortunately, they
are closed on vacation,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.164
so we are heading over
to a different place

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:47.794
to have some roast meat.

00:00:47.794 --> 00:00:51.294
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:52.278 --> 00:00:56.807
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.724
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:02.623
Yeah, for here, for here.

00:01:02.623 --> 00:01:04.244
Char siu.

00:01:04.244 --> 00:01:05.077
And pork.

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:07.718
Roast pork.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.346
One pigeon.

00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:11.401
One pigeon.

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.607
Made it to this restaurant,
and it is called Kwan Yu,

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:18.201
and this is a definite meat paradise.

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:22.126
You are met at the entrance
with just a cabinet,

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:25.523
a glass cabinet that's
filled, fully stocked,

00:01:25.523 --> 00:01:28.340
with an assortment of different
roast and braised meats,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.962
there's chicken, there's
duck, or maybe that's goose,

00:01:31.962 --> 00:01:34.883
there's roast pork, there's char siu,

00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:39.036
all things delicious meat are
within that front cabinet.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:40.624
And they do have a dining room in the back

00:01:40.624 --> 00:01:43.039
where you can take a seat
and eat, but they also,

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.558
it seems a lot of people
come here for takeaway,

00:01:45.558 --> 00:01:48.899
get a Styrofoam box full of meat to go.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.358
I got one plate of rice
topped with both char siu,

00:01:52.358 --> 00:01:54.955
and how could I resist that roast pork,

00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:59.122
they literally have the entire
carcass, rib length of pork,

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.636
roasted, and that golden, bubbly skin,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.550
that is just irresistible, so
I had to get some char siu,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.234
which is the Chinese barbecue pork,

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:11.889
plus the roast pork over rice,

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.300
and then, also, I really
wanted to have a pigeon,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.411
so I had to get a pigeon.

00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:18.312
Let me grab a pair of chopsticks.

00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:20.533
He very expertly chose the meat

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.272
and then sliced it up expertly,

00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:23.867
the char siu is on the bottom,

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:27.122
and look at that roast
pork, that looks ridiculous,

00:02:27.122 --> 00:02:30.351
all over rice, there's a
splash of sauce on the bottom.

00:02:30.351 --> 00:02:34.434
Let me just go for a piece
of the char siu first.

00:02:38.203 --> 00:02:41.109
That was actually a very
lean piece of char siu.

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.225
Not too fatty.

00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:43.705
Mm!

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:44.913
And what's actually really good about that

00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:46.921
is it's not too sweet.

00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:50.355
Sometimes char siu can be a
little bit too sweet for me,

00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:52.243
this one is more on the salty side,

00:02:52.243 --> 00:02:56.972
with just a little bit of
balance of that sweet glaze.

00:02:56.972 --> 00:02:58.109
Mm!

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.534
Oh, it's really good.

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:02.081
Has a really nice salty smokiness.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.702
Wow, okay, on contrary to that char siu,

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:09.408
which was pretty lean,
this is like pure fat.

00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:11.029
I think that whole part is fat,

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.731
and then a piece of meat at the bottom,

00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.648
but look at that crust
of skin, and that color.

00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:22.528
Wow, that is fatty.

00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:24.268
But that just melts in your mouth,

00:03:24.268 --> 00:03:27.218
until you get to that skin,
which is just like, pure,

00:03:27.218 --> 00:03:29.055
pure, ultimate crispiness.

00:03:29.055 --> 00:03:32.722
That has to be balanced
with a bite of rice.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:37.281
And maybe I should balance
it with a piece of vegetable.

00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:39.114
I think it's choy sum.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:41.470
Mm.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.024
Has a little bit of a bitterness to it.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.041
Really good.

00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:48.395
I'm gonna make my way
over to the pigeon now,

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:51.797
and I don't think this is
roasted, I think it's braised.

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:53.380
Maybe soy sauce braised?

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.814
I think so.

00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:56.852
And I have to begin with that little wing,

00:03:56.852 --> 00:03:58.354
that little drum right there.

00:03:58.354 --> 00:04:00.450
Look at the dark color of that meat,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.304
and how succulent it is.

00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:06.137
And in fact, I'm just
gonna tear that guy off,

00:04:09.558 --> 00:04:12.891
and get the whole drum in my first bite.

00:04:21.353 --> 00:04:22.797
Oh!

00:04:22.797 --> 00:04:26.880
That is like a really,
really succulent meat, mm!

00:04:27.973 --> 00:04:28.854
The skin?

00:04:28.854 --> 00:04:30.813
Yeah, it's definitely not roasted,

00:04:30.813 --> 00:04:34.396
but it has almost like
a sweet honey glaze,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.665
is what it tastes like, and
then that meat underneath,

00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:43.559
it's like dark meat, but
it's very, very lean,

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:45.642
and very, very succulent.

00:04:51.955 --> 00:04:53.105
Oh, that's so good.

00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:57.272
Next up, this is more of the
the breast piece, I think?

00:05:02.058 --> 00:05:03.164
Oh, yeah.

00:05:03.164 --> 00:05:05.475
That actually tastes like liver!

00:05:05.475 --> 00:05:08.392
Oh, it's so lean, and just so pure,

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.018
and it has a little of a mushy texture,

00:05:12.018 --> 00:05:14.084
similar to the liver, and a little bit

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:16.167
of an iron-y taste to it.

00:05:20.852 --> 00:05:21.685
Mm.

00:05:21.685 --> 00:05:24.042
All of the meats here
are really, really good,

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:26.421
but on this plate, the char
siu is definitely my favorite,

00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:28.138
and normally, I would
prefer the roast pork,

00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:30.697
because the char siu can be kind of sweet,

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:33.134
but the char siu here is excellent,

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:35.732
and then, I think just
enough the piece we got

00:05:35.732 --> 00:05:39.876
of the roast pork is a little
bit on the extreme fatty side,

00:05:39.876 --> 00:05:41.447
it's a little too fatty for me,

00:05:41.447 --> 00:05:45.588
or the ratio is a little
on the fatty side,

00:05:45.588 --> 00:05:47.966
but the char siu in particular here

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:51.124
is just absolutely fantastic.

00:05:51.124 --> 00:05:54.390
When you come here, you
have to get some char siu.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.110
But actually, my absolute
favorite thing here is the pigeon.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.167
This pigeon is just insanely good.

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:02.951
I think this is the wing
with a little bit of

00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:04.284
the breast part.

00:06:05.517 --> 00:06:08.753
And I love pigeon, how the,
the skin is really good,

00:06:08.753 --> 00:06:12.078
but the actual meat is
really, really lean.

00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:13.887
Okay, that's not gonna
break, I'm just gonna have

00:06:13.887 --> 00:06:14.804
to bite it.

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.616
This is an amazing place to
eat your fill of roast meat

00:06:21.616 --> 00:06:23.771
when you come to Hong
Kong, and the staff here,

00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:25.429
the owners are really nice as well,

00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:28.718
so if you're looking for some
delicious meats in Hong Kong,

00:06:28.718 --> 00:06:30.145
this is a great place.

00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:32.728
Thank you very much, thank you.

00:06:33.674 --> 00:06:36.174
(Mark laughs)

00:06:37.645 --> 00:06:40.777
That was a delicious meat
experience in Hong Kong,

00:06:40.777 --> 00:06:43.104
and I just have to emphasize
that one more time,

00:06:43.104 --> 00:06:45.086
char siu is not always my favorite,

00:06:45.086 --> 00:06:48.300
but their char siu was fantastic.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.089
But I think my absolute
favorite thing was that pigeon.

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:53.163
You have to have a pigeon
when you come here.

00:06:53.163 --> 00:06:56.307
We're going back to the
subway and back to Central.

00:06:56.307 --> 00:06:59.807
(upbeat electronic music)

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:10.618
We made it to Central
Station, took exit D2,

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:14.201
and on our way to go
eat at a dai pai dong.

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:21.585
One of the great things about Hong Kong

00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:24.525
is that it's so hilly, and
so it gives you a chance to

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:28.692
get some exercise just walking
to the next restaurant.

00:07:39.296 --> 00:07:42.296
(waitress speaking foreign language)

00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:45.470
A dai pai dong is a registered, licensed

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.313
cooked food stall in Hong Kong,

00:07:47.313 --> 00:07:50.228
and oftentimes, they
are street food stalls,

00:07:50.228 --> 00:07:53.125
or even at market stalls that serve food,

00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:55.385
but, one of the things about Hong Kong

00:07:55.385 --> 00:07:57.021
is that they used to be very popular,

00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:58.671
but now, a lot of the dai pai dongs,

00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:01.976
because they run within the
family, have started to faze out

00:08:01.976 --> 00:08:04.882
as Hong Kong has become
more and more modern,

00:08:04.882 --> 00:08:08.508
but there are still some
street food gems in Hong Kong,

00:08:08.508 --> 00:08:11.569
this being one of them,
and I am excited to be here

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:12.697
for lunch.

00:08:12.697 --> 00:08:15.149
This dai pai dong is called Sing Kee,

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:17.640
and it's one of the most
legendary dai pai dongs

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.598
in Hong Kong.

00:08:18.598 --> 00:08:21.405
What I love so much about
this is the atmosphere.

00:08:21.405 --> 00:08:24.353
You're sitting like, we're
right at Central in Hong Kong

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:28.490
surrounded by malls and
fancy, modern shopping centers

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.796
and buildings, but then
right within this alley,

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:34.307
there are some street food
stalls, and you come here,

00:08:34.307 --> 00:08:37.251
people are hanging out,
people are relaxing,

00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:40.831
it's really a throwback
to traditional Hong Kong,

00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:42.855
and they have a full menu of different

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.136
mostly stir-fried dishes and some soups,

00:08:45.136 --> 00:08:47.112
and I just ordered a
couple of different dishes,

00:08:47.112 --> 00:08:49.403
I am ready to eat for lunch, this is

00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:51.570
my kind of an environment.

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:10.198
Oh, thank you!

00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:14.982
I was just standing
here watching him cook,

00:09:14.982 --> 00:09:16.549
and he was cooking our
sweet and sour pork,

00:09:16.549 --> 00:09:19.539
and he just gave me a taste
of it, right out of the wok.

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:21.789
Okay, it's so hot, I gotta.

00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:24.942
Oh, that's hot!

00:09:24.942 --> 00:09:27.257
At first, I thought you just
wanted me to take a photo.

00:09:27.257 --> 00:09:28.305
- Aw!
- But then you, like,

00:09:28.305 --> 00:09:31.810
held it out, and you're just
like, "Take it, take it!"

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.202
We ordered a couple of different dishes

00:09:33.202 --> 00:09:35.726
including sweet and sour pork ribs,

00:09:35.726 --> 00:09:38.853
and then also ordered chicken
fried with green onions

00:09:38.853 --> 00:09:42.047
and lots and lots of ginger,
and then also some clams

00:09:42.047 --> 00:09:43.359
stir fried in black bean sauce.

00:09:43.359 --> 00:09:44.817
Already tasted this, because while I went

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:47.327
to go film him cooking,
he was cooking this,

00:09:47.327 --> 00:09:50.206
and he gave me a piece
right out of the, literally,

00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:53.528
right out of the wok, and
right out of the spatula,

00:09:53.528 --> 00:09:55.945
but I'll taste another piece.

00:09:58.553 --> 00:10:02.720
It's crispy and deep fried, and
inside is pretty fatty pork,

00:10:03.557 --> 00:10:07.194
but it's sweet and sour,
it is a little bit sweet,

00:10:07.194 --> 00:10:08.869
but it's balanced with sourness,

00:10:08.869 --> 00:10:12.952
and you can just taste
how he cooked it so fresh.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.803
And that needs to be followed with rice.

00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:21.323
Mm!

00:10:21.323 --> 00:10:23.102
The clams just came to
our table right now,

00:10:23.102 --> 00:10:25.188
so I'm gonna try them while
they're hot and fresh.

00:10:25.188 --> 00:10:26.851
Clams stir-fried with black bean sauce,

00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:28.907
there's some chilies in
here, and some onions.

00:10:28.907 --> 00:10:31.090
I will just grab that top guy right there,

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:32.590
filled with sauce.

00:10:38.569 --> 00:10:40.647
Oh, that is awesome.

00:10:40.647 --> 00:10:43.518
Oh, those are just bites of joy!

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:47.568
And the black bean sauce has
a wonderful slightly, like,

00:10:47.568 --> 00:10:50.443
well, salty, but like a
preserved taste, and then,

00:10:50.443 --> 00:10:52.539
it is a little bit spicy
from those green chilies.

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:55.050
And you can also really
taste the breath of the wok,

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.757
which is called wok hei,
which is the smokiness

00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:00.811
that only comes as a result
of stir frying something

00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:02.511
on a very high heat.

00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:04.364
And then finally, this
is stir fried chicken

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:06.081
with lots and lots of green onions,

00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:08.460
and what I love is that
they're just full, like,

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.962
mashed chunks of ginger in here as well.

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:14.295
But let me try a piece of chicken first.

00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:19.302
That's my kind of a dish.

00:11:19.302 --> 00:11:23.380
It has a wonderful charred flavor to it,

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.609
and then with a brown gravy sauce,

00:11:26.609 --> 00:11:28.244
and you can really taste
the ginger as well,

00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:30.577
as well as the green onions.

00:11:33.586 --> 00:11:34.503
Ginger, mm!

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:38.003
A little bit of a spiciness to it, too!

00:11:38.003 --> 00:11:39.067
And that is salty.

00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:42.274
That definitely needs
to be eaten with rice.

00:11:42.274 --> 00:11:45.163
I'm gonna go for this clam down here.

00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:47.831
And there are some sliced up
red chilies in here as well.

00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:51.748
Oh, that is just covered
in sauce, and chilies.

00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:00.020
Oh, that's so good.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.770
Mm, and they do taste really fresh,

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.937
and just the way they cooked
them, and this atmosphere,

00:12:08.455 --> 00:12:09.955
I love this place.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.225
I'm down to my final clam, and I promise

00:12:20.225 --> 00:12:24.041
I didn't plan to put
two clams in one shell,

00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:26.539
I just found it like
that, I just kept eating,

00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:29.474
and this was at the bottom
of the stack, a double.

00:12:29.474 --> 00:12:31.674
Look at this beauty and
look at all those toppings.

00:12:31.674 --> 00:12:33.754
Okay, I did add the toppings on top,

00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:35.505
but I promise I didn't add the clam

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:36.727
to the other side of the shell.

00:12:36.727 --> 00:12:40.894
I'm just gonna go ahead and
slurp this entire thing.

00:12:47.388 --> 00:12:49.145
This is the best dish, for sure.

00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:50.405
Oh, that is so good.

00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:53.130
But I also really like the
chicken with the ginger.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.147
Not only is the food good here,

00:12:55.147 --> 00:12:57.132
it's a little bit oily and salty as well,

00:12:57.132 --> 00:12:59.044
and that's partly why it tastes so good,

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:01.271
but what's such great
about this dai pai dong

00:13:01.271 --> 00:13:05.244
is that ambiance, how you're
right in Central Hong Kong

00:13:05.244 --> 00:13:08.512
surrounded by skyrise buildings,
and then within the alley,

00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:10.742
it's just a totally different world.

00:13:10.742 --> 00:13:13.847
Anti is tallying up our bill right now.

00:13:13.847 --> 00:13:16.941
Okay, total price comes to 169.

00:13:16.941 --> 00:13:20.441
(upbeat electronic music)

00:13:22.277 --> 00:13:24.152
We are heading back to the
hotel for a little while

00:13:24.152 --> 00:13:25.402
this afternoon.

00:13:27.113 --> 00:13:29.114
It's hard to believe that
this trip around the world

00:13:29.114 --> 00:13:31.782
for food with Star
Alliance is almost over,

00:13:31.782 --> 00:13:33.795
tomorrow, Ying and I fly from Hong Kong

00:13:33.795 --> 00:13:36.941
back to Bangkok back home, and, yeah,

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:41.284
it has been an amazing trip,
but this is our final dinner,

00:13:41.284 --> 00:13:43.079
and I was just trying to look around

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:46.613
for places to eat in Hong
Kong, and I ran into a blog,

00:13:46.613 --> 00:13:50.232
it's called strippedpixel.com,
and his name is Paul,

00:13:50.232 --> 00:13:53.617
and he gave me some inspiration
to go to a restaurant,

00:13:53.617 --> 00:13:56.775
it's a little ways from here,
we're gonna take the subway,

00:13:56.775 --> 00:14:00.334
might take about 30 minutes,
maybe 45 minutes to get there,

00:14:00.334 --> 00:14:04.428
but it looks like a food mission
that I do not want to miss,

00:14:04.428 --> 00:14:06.940
and as a traveling food lover,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.855
there's nothing better
than taking a food mission.

00:14:09.855 --> 00:14:11.899
Right now, we're at Admiralty Station,

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:15.068
and we're gonna go all
the way up to Fo Tan.

00:14:15.068 --> 00:14:18.568
(upbeat electronic music)

00:14:20.028 --> 00:14:22.989
Made it to Kowloon Tong
Station, and now transferring

00:14:22.989 --> 00:14:26.541
to the east rail line, which
is the light blue line.

00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:29.099
The light blue line is actually a railway,

00:14:29.099 --> 00:14:31.116
and so we're waiting for the train now,

00:14:31.116 --> 00:14:34.222
this food mission is only
building my anticipation

00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:35.805
for dinner tonight.

00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:47.535
That took exactly 32 minutes
to get to Fo Tan Station,

00:14:47.535 --> 00:14:49.291
and it should just be a short walk

00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:50.854
to get to the restaurant from here.

00:14:50.854 --> 00:14:53.409
In the train, we passed
through a mountain,

00:14:53.409 --> 00:14:57.237
and we are in a valley
now, mountains surrounding

00:14:57.237 --> 00:15:00.820
and still skyscrapers,
but it's very quiet.

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:10.746
We took a little walk
through the lush greenery

00:15:10.746 --> 00:15:14.426
and emerged into an apartment community,

00:15:14.426 --> 00:15:17.019
this is called the Wo Che Estate,

00:15:17.019 --> 00:15:19.700
and it's like a little mini city.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.186
We are getting really
close, I can feel it.

00:15:23.186 --> 00:15:25.531
And I'm getting my first
glimpse of the place,

00:15:25.531 --> 00:15:27.864
it's right here, we made it.

00:15:30.178 --> 00:15:33.726
It's called Chan Kun
Kee, and this is a huge,

00:15:33.726 --> 00:15:36.714
open-aired dai pai dong-style restaurant,

00:15:36.714 --> 00:15:38.591
and they've only just
opened for the evening,

00:15:38.591 --> 00:15:40.936
so that's why it's not packed yet,

00:15:40.936 --> 00:15:44.760
but they must have at
least 100 tables in here,

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.659
some of them huge round
tables that can accommodate

00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:50.469
20 people at a table, and
there are a couple of tbales

00:15:50.469 --> 00:15:52.599
where they are already feasting.

00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:55.378
Ah, but there are, I'm sure
within an hour from now,

00:15:55.378 --> 00:15:56.963
it's just gonna be packed out.

00:15:56.963 --> 00:15:59.718
Normally at this restaurant,
they have a pad of paper

00:15:59.718 --> 00:16:02.145
and a pen, and you write down your order,

00:16:02.145 --> 00:16:04.228
but since I don't know Cantonese

00:16:04.228 --> 00:16:07.384
and I can't write Cantonese,
the good news this,

00:16:07.384 --> 00:16:09.828
they do have a picture menu with

00:16:09.828 --> 00:16:10.981
some of their signature dishes,

00:16:10.981 --> 00:16:14.513
so I'm just gonna try to go
find someone and tell them,

00:16:14.513 --> 00:16:17.482
and ask them to kindly
write down our order for us.

00:16:17.482 --> 00:16:19.906
Service is a little bit tricky here,

00:16:19.906 --> 00:16:22.449
but that is a sign of a great restaurant,

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:25.604
I'm not who is working
here, who is serving,

00:16:25.604 --> 00:16:27.971
or who is eating here, but anyway,

00:16:27.971 --> 00:16:30.948
the lady who is serving
beer, she was very kind,

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:33.883
and she helped me to write
down the dishes I wanted,

00:16:33.883 --> 00:16:36.258
and now we gave it to
someone, and hopefully,

00:16:36.258 --> 00:16:38.675
our order is being processed.

00:16:39.595 --> 00:16:43.178
Gonna pour some of this
tea into the basin.

00:16:44.563 --> 00:16:47.020
Oh yeah, that's hot.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.270
Rinse these up, and then...

00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:52.793
You wanna make sure to rinse everything,

00:16:52.793 --> 00:16:54.626
the spoons, the bowls.

00:17:02.169 --> 00:17:05.029
And even the entirety of them.

00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:07.352
Another thing that I need to
point out at this restaurant

00:17:07.352 --> 00:17:10.507
is that on all the tables,
they have a piece of plastic,

00:17:10.507 --> 00:17:13.769
and, because they have
fans which are blowing

00:17:13.769 --> 00:17:15.821
throughout this entire restaurant,

00:17:15.821 --> 00:17:17.883
and there's lots of air movement,

00:17:17.883 --> 00:17:19.800
in order to keep the...

00:17:22.725 --> 00:17:23.968
Thank you.

00:17:23.968 --> 00:17:28.909
In order to keep the plastic
tablecloths from blowing away,

00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:31.484
I think they wet the tables
and then just set them down,

00:17:31.484 --> 00:17:34.572
so the tablecloths are half flapping,

00:17:34.572 --> 00:17:36.534
but it works pretty well!

00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:39.155
The first dish has come out,
and I think they're just gonna

00:17:39.155 --> 00:17:41.713
kinda bring dish by dish,
so I'm not gonna wait

00:17:41.713 --> 00:17:45.060
for everything to arrive,
I'm gonna get started eating.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.126
The first dish is drunken
chicken, and I got 1/2 a chicken,

00:17:48.126 --> 00:17:49.675
and immediately, as she brought this over,

00:17:49.675 --> 00:17:52.692
you could smell the, I
think it's rice wine,

00:17:52.692 --> 00:17:56.238
that it is prepared in,
and there is a whole set

00:17:56.238 --> 00:17:58.461
of quail eggs, I think, on the side,

00:17:58.461 --> 00:18:02.131
and this is a beautiful
chicken served in a metal bowl

00:18:02.131 --> 00:18:04.048
within a wooden vessel.

00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:06.412
And you know it's a good chicken

00:18:06.412 --> 00:18:09.129
when there's still a feather
on the skin over here.

00:18:09.129 --> 00:18:11.703
I'm gonna take this piece right from here.

00:18:11.703 --> 00:18:13.264
Oh, look at that.

00:18:13.264 --> 00:18:14.460
Ah, that's beautiful.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.053
The layers of that is amazing!

00:18:17.053 --> 00:18:18.246
Oh, wow!

00:18:18.246 --> 00:18:20.801
Look at all those layers of chicken!

00:18:20.801 --> 00:18:23.018
And then the skin on the
top, you can see how the skin

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:27.114
will actually just peel
right off of that meat.

00:18:27.114 --> 00:18:28.281
Mm, wow, okay.

00:18:38.233 --> 00:18:39.928
Oh, that is amazing!

00:18:39.928 --> 00:18:40.978
It's served cold!

00:18:40.978 --> 00:18:43.672
And then that texture of the chicken.

00:18:43.672 --> 00:18:46.528
It's chewy, it's a little bit chewy,

00:18:46.528 --> 00:18:50.528
and it has that country
yard bird texture to it.

00:18:52.443 --> 00:18:54.202
Oh, that's awesome.

00:18:54.202 --> 00:18:58.369
And then, although it has a
very strong aroma of liquor,

00:18:59.525 --> 00:19:01.435
it doesn't have a much
strong taste of liquor,

00:19:01.435 --> 00:19:03.457
but you can definitely taste a little bit,

00:19:03.457 --> 00:19:05.321
mostly just like a fragrance.

00:19:05.321 --> 00:19:08.957
It's perfectly salty,
and just that amazing

00:19:08.957 --> 00:19:11.624
muscular texture of the chicken.

00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:19.343
You do have to be careful of
biting into little bone shards,

00:19:19.343 --> 00:19:21.170
because how they've
chopped up the chicken,

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.843
so sometimes, there's a little
piece of bone in your bite.

00:19:23.843 --> 00:19:25.850
The next dish that has
come is a fried fish,

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.358
and I think it's a barramundi,

00:19:27.358 --> 00:19:31.402
and you just have to check
this out, the eyeball.

00:19:31.402 --> 00:19:34.701
It must've been fried on such a hot fire,

00:19:34.701 --> 00:19:38.044
within such hot oil, that
the eyeball just popped out

00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:39.632
like a piece of popcorn.

00:19:39.632 --> 00:19:42.284
I might need my spoon for this.

00:19:42.284 --> 00:19:44.684
Oh, wow, that is very soft.

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:46.063
And yeah, I think it's a barramundi fish,

00:19:46.063 --> 00:19:49.211
and then it's just topped
in a bunch of gravy sauce

00:19:49.211 --> 00:19:52.961
with green onions, and
I think that's ginger.

00:19:54.785 --> 00:19:55.618
Mm!

00:19:56.798 --> 00:19:57.631
Oh yeah!

00:19:58.474 --> 00:20:00.063
That is ginger.

00:20:00.063 --> 00:20:02.509
Oh, the fish is good.

00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:06.539
Crispy on the outside, and
kinda fleshy on the inside.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.478
A little bit salty, a little bit oily,

00:20:08.478 --> 00:20:10.686
and then with that nice taste of little,

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:14.457
of crushed ginger all over
it, as well as green onions.

00:20:14.457 --> 00:20:16.159
For their system, as
they bring out the dish,

00:20:16.159 --> 00:20:17.421
they bring out the dish one-by-one,

00:20:17.421 --> 00:20:19.074
but as they bring out the dish,

00:20:19.074 --> 00:20:21.268
then you have their dishes
that you wrote down,

00:20:21.268 --> 00:20:24.149
and they check it off to
confirm that you got it,

00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:25.796
so we're still waiting on one more dish,

00:20:25.796 --> 00:20:28.541
but the third dish has arrived.

00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:32.612
These are mantis prawns, and these are,

00:20:32.612 --> 00:20:34.515
they're kinda similar to
shrimp, but a little bit,

00:20:34.515 --> 00:20:37.112
or quite a bit different, and I think,

00:20:37.112 --> 00:20:39.679
yeah, they have a pretty
hard outer shell, so,

00:20:39.679 --> 00:20:44.179
I'm gonna need to just reach
in with my fingers here.

00:20:44.179 --> 00:20:45.012
And...

00:20:46.362 --> 00:20:50.295
Maybe I'll pluck off that,
pull off that head first.

00:20:50.295 --> 00:20:52.874
Oh wow, and what's under, oh, okay, I see.

00:20:52.874 --> 00:20:54.215
Actually, come take a look at this.

00:20:54.215 --> 00:20:57.238
Looks like they are
braised in a chili sauce,

00:20:57.238 --> 00:20:59.629
and then there's pieces of
tofu on the bottom here.

00:20:59.629 --> 00:21:01.493
Oh, let me eat one of those
pieces of tofu right now

00:21:01.493 --> 00:21:03.135
so I can taste that sauce.

00:21:03.135 --> 00:21:05.085
Oh, it just looks like
it's purely absorbed

00:21:05.085 --> 00:21:07.963
all of those juices down there.

00:21:07.963 --> 00:21:10.463
Oh, and I can smell cumin too!

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:15.892
Wow!

00:21:19.993 --> 00:21:22.074
Oh, that is delicious.

00:21:22.074 --> 00:21:24.324
Oh, that's like hot chili oil below there.

00:21:24.324 --> 00:21:26.509
When I bit into that piece of tofu,

00:21:26.509 --> 00:21:29.812
the chili oil just exploded
and hit the back of my throat!

00:21:29.812 --> 00:21:32.645
Okay now back to the mantis prawn.

00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:35.952
It kinda looks like a centipede,

00:21:35.952 --> 00:21:38.462
like a cross between a
centipede and a shrimp.

00:21:38.462 --> 00:21:39.295
Oh, there we go.

00:21:39.295 --> 00:21:41.894
Pull off that whole, oh
no, I broke him in 1/2!

00:21:41.894 --> 00:21:43.727
Okay, let me eat that.

00:21:48.983 --> 00:21:49.816
Mm!

00:21:51.973 --> 00:21:54.727
It's similar to shrimp,
but with a little bit

00:21:54.727 --> 00:21:56.521
of a crabby flavor as well.

00:21:56.521 --> 00:21:59.104
And maybe has like a little
more of like a fishy taste

00:21:59.104 --> 00:22:00.622
than shrimp.

00:22:00.622 --> 00:22:04.789
I'm honestly not sure what is
the easiest way to peel these.

00:22:06.584 --> 00:22:10.751
Alright, I think that's a good
piece, I'll eat that there.

00:22:18.595 --> 00:22:20.853
That really kinda tastes like a cross

00:22:20.853 --> 00:22:23.544
between crab and shrimp.

00:22:23.544 --> 00:22:26.108
Yeah, it's kinda stringy, like crab,

00:22:26.108 --> 00:22:28.549
but then it has the taste of shrimp,

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:30.785
but with a little bit of a sweeter,

00:22:30.785 --> 00:22:33.138
kind of more softer texture.

00:22:33.138 --> 00:22:35.305
That's a hot bowl of rice.

00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:38.999
And finally, this is
the last dish I ordered,

00:22:38.999 --> 00:22:41.716
and I didn't actually have
any idea what this is,

00:22:41.716 --> 00:22:44.762
but I just saw it on the
menu, on the picture menu,

00:22:44.762 --> 00:22:46.577
and because of all these chilies,

00:22:46.577 --> 00:22:50.248
that was enough to make me
order it, and it has come,

00:22:50.248 --> 00:22:53.085
and it is just as pretty
as I thought it would be,

00:22:53.085 --> 00:22:55.869
and I think it's actually
fish, slices of fish down here,

00:22:55.869 --> 00:22:58.412
there are just loads of
dried chilies in here,

00:22:58.412 --> 00:23:00.612
I think this is Siamese cardamom,

00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:02.749
you can smell the Sichuan pepper in here,

00:23:02.749 --> 00:23:04.282
you can smell the ginger.

00:23:04.282 --> 00:23:06.353
I'm glad I decided to order this,

00:23:06.353 --> 00:23:09.487
and I had no idea what it
was, but I saw the picture

00:23:09.487 --> 00:23:12.510
right up there, it's right
above where I'm sitting,

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.071
and so I had to order it.

00:23:14.071 --> 00:23:17.404
I'll start with this piece of fish here.

00:23:26.341 --> 00:23:27.673
Oh yes.

00:23:27.673 --> 00:23:30.265
That is as good as I had hoped for.

00:23:30.265 --> 00:23:31.098
Mm!

00:23:31.974 --> 00:23:35.786
Oh, that fish has an
amazing silky texture to it,

00:23:35.786 --> 00:23:38.283
and then there's so many
dried chilies in here,

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:40.382
you can really taste the cumin,

00:23:40.382 --> 00:23:44.599
and also, you can really
taste the, maybe ginger,

00:23:44.599 --> 00:23:47.954
and so many spices going on in here.

00:23:47.954 --> 00:23:51.265
What is this, kind of a nut or spice,

00:23:51.265 --> 00:23:54.245
yeah, there's a lot going
on, and it is creating

00:23:54.245 --> 00:23:57.648
just a medley of delicious spiciness.

00:23:57.648 --> 00:24:00.646
I didn't even realize,
the restaurant is full!

00:24:00.646 --> 00:24:02.740
When we came, it was almost
empty, now it's packed,

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.961
there's not even an empty table.

00:24:04.961 --> 00:24:06.878
Okay, back to the fish.

00:24:07.805 --> 00:24:11.388
Oh, and you do have to
be careful of bones.

00:24:12.431 --> 00:24:14.931
There are bones, lots of them.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:18.506
Let me fish this guy out.

00:24:18.506 --> 00:24:21.589
Oh, I'm so happy I ordered this dish.

00:24:25.248 --> 00:24:28.764
Eat that with rice, that's amazing.

00:24:28.764 --> 00:24:31.931
Let me try one of those dried chilies.

00:24:33.119 --> 00:24:34.653
Oh yeah.

00:24:34.653 --> 00:24:35.746
And I think it's a little spicy,

00:24:35.746 --> 00:24:37.364
but it might kick in in a little bit,

00:24:37.364 --> 00:24:38.705
in a few seconds from now.

00:24:38.705 --> 00:24:40.951
And then on the bottom,
there's some pickled,

00:24:40.951 --> 00:24:45.118
I think preserved mustard
greens, as well as bean sprouts.

00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:49.788
I'm also really loving
the drunken chicken.

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:51.708
And you can see some of these pieces,

00:24:51.708 --> 00:24:54.903
the skin has just started to like...

00:24:54.903 --> 00:24:57.157
Gelatinize, because of its cold, yeah,

00:24:57.157 --> 00:24:59.542
look at that gelatin right there.

00:24:59.542 --> 00:25:02.292
That's like cold chicken gelatin.

00:25:09.806 --> 00:25:10.830
Oh, and that piece from the bottom,

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:13.355
you can definitely
taste the alcohol in it.

00:25:13.355 --> 00:25:15.789
Mm, it's really, really good, though.

00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:20.717
The texture of the chicken
is so wonderfully chewy.

00:25:20.717 --> 00:25:21.848
What?

00:25:21.848 --> 00:25:23.181
Oh, hello, Ying!

00:25:26.248 --> 00:25:27.923
Wow, was that good!

00:25:27.923 --> 00:25:31.143
And the restaurant is
just packed right now.

00:25:31.143 --> 00:25:35.310
I think you have to walk your
bill up to the front to pay.

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:46.009
Wow, wow, wee-wah!

00:25:48.151 --> 00:25:52.713
Okay, we found the line
where you pay for your food.

00:25:52.713 --> 00:25:55.546
Ying is at the cashier now paying,

00:25:56.434 --> 00:26:00.004
and I am just absolutely
marveling at this restaurant.

00:26:00.004 --> 00:26:02.699
It is so huge, there
must be like 1,000 people

00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:06.547
eating right here, and
it's busy, it's chaotic,

00:26:06.547 --> 00:26:10.262
it's everything you want in
a good Chinese restaurant.

00:26:10.262 --> 00:26:12.805
So I'm glad we got here
early to get a table,

00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:16.486
and we are now out of here, but that was

00:26:16.486 --> 00:26:20.802
an unbelievably-memorable
dining experience in Hong Kong.

00:26:20.802 --> 00:26:23.654
It is just insane how
they're able to serve

00:26:23.654 --> 00:26:27.323
so many people at one time,
and maintain the quality

00:26:27.323 --> 00:26:31.240
of the food, and they
have it down to a system.

00:26:32.093 --> 00:26:36.140
Alright, now walking back
through the apartment complex,

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.482
back to the train
station, mission complete!

00:26:38.482 --> 00:26:41.843
We walked back over to
the railroad station,

00:26:41.843 --> 00:26:45.181
that was one of the meal experiences

00:26:45.181 --> 00:26:48.110
that is worth traveling for.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.461
The food was good, the
atmosphere was just pure,

00:26:51.461 --> 00:26:56.108
exciting Hong Kong, and yeah,
I absolutely loved that,

00:26:56.108 --> 00:26:58.422
I'm gonna say that was an ultra successful

00:26:58.422 --> 00:27:01.593
mission accomplished, for food tonight.

00:27:01.593 --> 00:27:05.404
Oh, and it was worth every
minute on the subway to get here.

00:27:05.404 --> 00:27:06.577
I would say that this restaurant,

00:27:06.577 --> 00:27:08.650
it would be really helpful
if you could come here

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.108
if you had a local with you
who could speak Cantonese,

00:27:12.108 --> 00:27:13.893
I didn't really know what
I was doing to order,

00:27:13.893 --> 00:27:17.804
I just had to choose off of the pictures,

00:27:17.804 --> 00:27:20.086
but as I was walking
around the restaurant,

00:27:20.086 --> 00:27:22.606
I saw lots of people had ordered
many, many different dishes

00:27:22.606 --> 00:27:25.360
that all looked
incredible, and if you knew

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.710
how to order them, that
would be even the upper hand,

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.636
but anyway, it's a fantastic restaurant,

00:27:30.636 --> 00:27:33.671
it's worth the trip out here,
we're gonna head back now

00:27:33.671 --> 00:27:36.015
to Hong Kong island, so
I'm gonna end the video

00:27:36.015 --> 00:27:38.440
for today right now,
thank you all very much
