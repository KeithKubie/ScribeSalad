Vsauce!

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.120
Kevin here..

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.729
Imagine a guy transporting thousands of birds
in an enclosed truck, stopped before crossing

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:09.630
an old, dangerous bridge.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.920
His avian cargo makes the truck too heavy
to safely cross.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.200
So how could he make it lighter?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.090
The birds.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.360
What if… he banged on the side of the truck,
scared the birds inside, and caused them to

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.360
fly around?

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.050
If they’re in the air they’ll weigh nothing
and he can safely cross the bridge!

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.180
Right?

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.980
Before we discuss those angry birds, I’d
like to thank Angry Birds 2 and Rovio Entertainment

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.620
for inspiring and sponsoring this video.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.039
It’s amazing how captivated we are by flinging
birds and tumbling tower physics.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.010
Millions of people alter their bird’s trajectory
to compensate for the kinetic energy of air

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.539
blown by fans to perfectly knock out the block
holding up the precarious structure.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.790
Thanks again to them for supporting Vsauce2,
have fun playing Angry Birds 2, but now we

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.120
have to get back to our troubled truck driver.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:18.220
The scared, angry birds are flying inside
his truck as he slowly drives over the bridge…

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.030
Here we go.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.860
Uh oh!

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.530
Don’t worry, don't worry.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.950
Uh.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.750
I'm sure the truck driver and the birds are
fine, the bridge not doing quite as well.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.000
Why didn’t his plan work?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.990
Because he didn’t account for the unseen
physics of bird flight.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.300
Excuse me, bridge.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.300
To fly, a bird has to generate enough lift
and thrust to counteract drag and its body

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.300
weight.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.140
We can calculate that by making weight W,
which equals .3 -- a constant value related

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.250
to the “angle of attack,” which is the
angle of its wings relative to the air, usually

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.609
6 degrees or so… multiplied by the airspeed
V times the mass flow of air, which is airspeed

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:18.120
V times air density d, multiplied by S, which
is the surface area of their wing… y’know

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.180
what…

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.180
?

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.319
Look, calculations aside, I like to think
of this riddle as thousands of uncaged birds

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.549
just freaking out and flapping their wings
inside in this truck.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.569
Some birds are generating a downward force
on the air to create the thrust and lift that

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.180
gets them up off the truck bed.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.069
Some are flying horizontally, using thrust
and lift to stay in the air, and... others

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.810
get in the air and free fall, which reduces
the overall load in the truck by their full

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.109
bird weight.

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:59.319
The important part is that even though the
truck driver can’t see it, air is a fluid,

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.999
and these birds are throwing physical forces
around in every direction as they move within

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.860
that fluid.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.510
Since he’s got thousands of birds in a closed
truck, those forces are going to balance out

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.769
so that the truck’s weight is basically
the same with the birds flying around as it

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.790
was with them just sitting there.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.819
It’s easy to understand his logic, though.

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.079
Thousands of birds are heavy.

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.379
Get them up in the air and they won’t be.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:39.499
But seeing the unseen, like the forces of
flight, requires a high degree of abstract

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:43.620
thinking… and that’s a pretty new concept.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:51.099
Not like last year new but like 50,000 years
ago new, when Homo Sapiens separated itself

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:57.319
from other hominins by entering the era of
“Behavioral Modernity.”

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.669
Abstract thinking is really hard to do.

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:06.060
We’re thousands of years past the Stone
Age, and we still encounter everyday paradoxes

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.609
because we so often miss what we can’t see.

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:17.090
The truck driver’s eyes couldn’t show
him all the complexities of bird flight physics.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.019
I can’t see time.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.530
That’s not a weird thing to admit, nobody
can.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.940
Sure, we can look at a clock, or notice the
effects of time on things like the changing

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.780
of seasons, but we can’t actually see the
dimension of time.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.030
We see representations of time.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.850
And even those can be deceiving.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.860
Here’s an example.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.669
You hate your evil identical twin.

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.569
You want him out of your life, at least for
a while.

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:55.180
So, you put him on a ship to the nearest planetary
system while you stay on Earth.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.920
My evil identical twin is named Bevin.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.270
That’s short for Bad Kevin.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.580
Bevin.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.490
Alpha Centauri is about 4.4 light years away.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.909
If I put Bevin on a ship called Vspace2 and
sent him off at, say, .8c -- that’s 80%

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:20.530
of the speed of light -- he’ll get to Alpha
Centauri in 5.5 years.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.620
If Bevin plants a flag and flies back, he
would return in 11 years.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.010
For me.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.819
11 Kevin years.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:37.190
Distance -- and also time -- seems to work
differently for Bevin.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.450
From his point of view, traveling at .8 times
the speed of light makes Bevin’s distance

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:51.409
contract to just 2.64 light years… which
means it takes him just 3.3 years each way.

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.030
To Bevin, his trip only took 6.6 years.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:06.130
My 11 years of freedom from Bevin were only
6.6 years of banishment to him, which means

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:12.500
my identical twin is now 4.4 years younger
than me.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.699
That unseen element of time just… wasn’t
the same for us.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:25.030
Since we can't actually travel at luminal
speeds -- yet -- we have to explore special

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.430
relativity in the lab and in our minds.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:35.580
And sometimes that's a good thing, because
seeing can deceive us -- it's why I burnt

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.439
my hamburger.

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:40.010
The higher the heat, the better, right?

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.240
I could see the outside of the burger cooking
fast in the pan.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:52.990
But that char is actually making heat conductivity
to the center happen less smoothly.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.849
Instead of engaging the Maillard reaction
that combines sugars and amino acids to bring

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:05.550
out the flavors, higher heat just… scorches
the outside without cooking the center evenly.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:11.669
It tastes bad and the inside is raw.

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:17.979
We can get food poisoning because our eyes
aren’t very good at thermodynamics.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:25.010
But what if you’re the hamburger and you
want to stay uncooked?

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.010
Metal.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:33.030
Even though metal conducts heat to cook things
like burgers, metal also protects against

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.889
unseen heat.

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:40.599
Thermal energy that comes in the form of infrared
radiation exists just below red on the visible

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:42.330
spectrum of light.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:49.110
And infusing protective gear with reflective
metal repels infrared radiation… like this

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:55.440
aluminized emergency blanket, which reflects
about 95% of radiated heat.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:06.460
NASA invented metallized polyethylene terephthalate
for space, but I use it to look nice.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:13.150
When it comes to birds in a truck, evil twins
traveling the cosmos, or cooking burgers,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:17.960
what you see is not always what you get.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.960
Here.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.759
I’ll draw two straight lines.

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:25.090
There.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:32.360
Now just count the lines.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.700
1, 2….3.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:44.690
Even what appears to be the simplest visible
truth can be filled with complexity that we

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:50.950
can only see when... we admit that we can't.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.779
And as always -- thanks for watching.

00:08:55.779 --> 00:09:02.100
Here we go.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:10.130
It didn't really collapse as much as I thought
it was going to.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:24.430
Here we go.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.079
It still didn't really collapse the way I
wanted it to.

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:30.450
Hello.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.389
