[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:09.210
STEFANY SHAHEEN:
Thank you so much.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.460
It's an honor to be
here at Google today,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.320
and I'm very much
looking forward

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.450
to sharing our story with you
and answering some questions.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.550
I'm especially proud to have
Elle and Coach with me today.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.060
We've been on a book
tour for months now,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.650
but Elle has the challenge of
being a junior in high school,

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.820
so getting her out and
having her be part of this

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.670
is a special day for us.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.580
So I want to begin
by just sharing

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.199
some of the numbers,
because often,

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.490
when you hear about diabetes,
what you're hearing about

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.730
are the staggering numbers
you can see on the screen.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.470
And we often forget
what the numbers

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.940
mean in terms of the human price
that is paid for people living

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.460
with a chronic disease.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.880
So you've heard that the
rates of diabetes in America

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.060
are on the rise,
likely, and you've often

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.610
heard that the cost of caring
for long-term chronic disease

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.090
risks bankrupting our
health care system.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.540
But what Elle, Coach, and I
are here to talk about today

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.750
is the personal price that
chronic disease can play.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.380
And we're here to
share the unlikely way

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.310
we have found to cope with
the challenges of living

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.280
with a chronic disease.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.020
I want to begin by giving
you some background about me,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.710
because it will help
inform our story

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.930
and help you understand what
managing a type I diabetes

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.880
reality meant for a type A mom.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.930
So this photo was
taken shortly after I

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.090
graduated from a master's
program at Harvard.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.090
I got to the point at the
end of my time at Harvard

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.790
where I was so pregnant with
our fourth son, William,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.630
who's the baby in
the photo, that I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.060
couldn't fit behind a desk
and had to sit sideways.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.070
And literally, the day after
I finished my last final

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.150
and completed the
program, William was born,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.840
and I graduated
three weeks later.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.670
And so I use this picture as an
example of my delusional state

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.450
that if I was willing to
work hard and pay attention

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.729
to detail and plan incessantly,
that I could make it all work,

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.140
that I could make work work
and school work and manage

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.550
four children under the age
of 8 at this point in time.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.670
And I was able to hold on to
that illusion and delusion

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.560
for a while, actually.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.150
About 11 months
later, we as a family

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.710
went up north to
the White Mountains

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.280
over Thanksgiving weekend.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.420
And Elle had just turned
8 about two months

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.780
before this photo was taken.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.910
And around August of that
year, so a few months

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.330
before Thanksgiving, we noticed
that she wasn't herself.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.860
She seemed agitated,
moody at times.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.460
We couldn't quite put our
finger on what was wrong,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.490
but she wasn't her
enthusiastic, optimistic self.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.270
And I knew it was too soon
for the dreaded puberty years.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.560
She was only just 8.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.310
There were some things
happening at school

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.060
with the transition
of a teacher,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.557
and so I worried maybe
that was affecting her.

00:03:06.557 --> 00:03:08.140
We couldn't quite
put our finger on it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.680
until we were away together
as a family over Thanksgiving,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.660
and her symptoms became so
acute that they were no longer

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.880
something we could
brush under the rug

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.240
or treat as if maybe this
was just something that she

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.620
was coping with emotionally.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.524
So at this point, we just
celebrated Thanksgiving

00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:29.440
with our extended family,
and we had headed up

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.680
with the six of us.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.740
And the first
thing I noticed was

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.350
that after ice cream
for dessert one night,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.230
she was especially thirsty--
couldn't quench her thirst,

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.950
drinking all the time.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.580
And that night we were
in a small hotel room

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.240
and I heard her get
up multiple times

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.531
to go to the bathroom in the
middle of the night, which

00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:50.640
also struck me as odd.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.122
And then the next day,
there was an indoor pool

00:03:53.122 --> 00:03:54.580
in the hotel where
we were staying,

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.810
and she put her bathing suit
on, and the bathing suit

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.600
that had fit her just
fine over the summer

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.004
was now too big, which it's
not supposed to go that way.

00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:03.420
It's supposed to
go the other way.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.420
And I thought, there's
something wrong.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.970
And as you can see here,
her coloring was not good.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.470
She had dark circles
under her eyes.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.353
And I remember distinctly
walking down the stairs

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:17.019
to the lobby of this
hotel, because this

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.450
was before smartphones,
and Googling the signs

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.310
and symptoms of diabetes.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.840
And my brother-in-law, my
husband's younger brother,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.036
lives with type I diabetes, but
he was diagnosed as an adult.

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.410
And my husband and I were
together when he was diagnosed,

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.950
and I remembered vaguely what
symptoms he had described.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.900
And so I started Googling
the signs and symptoms

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.430
on the only computer that
was in the hotel lobby

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.800
to see if I could come up
with some explanation that

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.730
would make me feel better about
what I was seeing in Elle.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.850
Unfortunately, she
had every symptom.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.520
She was excessively thirsty.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.960
She was going to the
bathroom frequently.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.160
She was irritable.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.120
She had lost weight, clearly.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.300
She seemed agitated.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.352
And I said, well, you know,
let's just give it another day,

00:05:06.352 --> 00:05:08.810
because then the next day, she
would wake up in the morning

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.360
and seem OK.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.910
And it wasn't until later
this weekend, on our way home,

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.900
we stopped to get
a Christmas tree,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.264
and she asked if she could
have some hot chocolate.

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:19.430
And she had some hot
chocolate, and couldn't make it

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.030
to the bathroom in time
before having an accident.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.190
And that's when I knew
something was really wrong.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.920
So the very next morning, we
were in her pediatrician's

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.360
office, and unfortunately, her
pediatrician was not there.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.250
I begged the physician
assistant to do

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.710
what was a simple urinalysis in
the office, just a urine test.

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.810
And he did not know us.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.590
We had never seen him before.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.960
And he was dismissive, I
would say, kindly, and said,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.530
well, you know, I think she's
probably just constipated.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.550
She can't possibly
have type I diabetes.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.050
I think let's just give
it another couple days

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.650
and see how she does.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.180
And you have this
moment when you're

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.250
raised by two advocates--
my mom is a US senator.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.030
My dad was a judge and a
lawyer while I was growing up.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.395
I learned how to advocate for
myself and for my children.

00:06:12.395 --> 00:06:13.770
And you always
have these moments

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.040
where you think, am I
just being too pushy?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.050
Maybe I'm being too neurotic.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.330
Maybe I'm being too type A.
Maybe I shouldn't insist.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.990
But there was just
something that said

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.800
we just have to rule this out.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.620
And so I said, well, I know
it's just a simple urine test.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.340
Please just do the test.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.560
And he left the
office and said, fine,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.950
we'll do the test if it'll
make you feel better.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.350
And within five minutes,
he had come back

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.180
into the office with his head
down and said, it's conclusive.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.490
She has type I diabetes.

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.860
You have to go to Boston
Children's Hospital.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.300
And by the time we got
to the emergency room

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.680
at Boston Children's
Hospital, the doctor who

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.590
attended and treated Elle said
if we had gone home that night

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.850
and she had woken up and
had a normal breakfast,

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:57.070
she would have ended
up in a diabetic coma

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.700
and would have been Medevaced
to Boston Children's instead

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.270
of taking her there
the night before.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.350
So that really changed our life.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.530
That was a point
at which I learned

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.080
very hard and fast
that even when

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.130
you work hard and
even when you are

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.200
willing to put as
much elbow grease

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.490
as you can muster into
whatever it is you're tackling,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.020
life can throw you hurdles
that you just can't possibly

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.390
anticipate.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.020
And I have to say
that at that moment,

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.770
I wasn't entirely
convinced that this

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.090
was going to be all that hard.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.465
You don't really
know what you're

00:07:30.465 --> 00:07:32.810
facing until you live with it.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.630
And so for those of
you who don't know,

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.890
type I diabetes is an
autoimmune disease.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.960
It means that Elle's body
does not produce any insulin.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.550
And in this photo,
she's actually

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.080
showing her insulin
pump to Michael J.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.890
Fox at an event where
they were both advocating

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.250
for stem-cell research.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.200
Type I diabetes means that
you're constantly chasing

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.610
healthy blood sugar ranges.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.010
Because your body is no
longer producing insulin,

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.870
you have to take it
in a synthetic form,

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.690
either in a shot or
in an insulin pump.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.080
And you're constantly
making decisions

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.170
about how much insulin your body
needs, because your pancreas

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.440
isn't working.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.900
So this means in Elle's case
that she tests her blood sugar

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.500
by pricking her finger
8 to 10 times a day

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.060
to make sure her blood
sugar is in a healthy range.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.320
It means every time she
puts anything in her mouth,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.230
she has to take either
a shot or tell the pump

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.940
that she needs insulin.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.650
It means that everything
affects her day-to-day safety

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.620
and well-being-- so
exercise, stress, being

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.010
ready to take an exam at school,
can shoot her blood sugar high.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.039
Playing outside in the cold
can drop her blood sugar low.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.530
And low blood sugars
cause seizures, which

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.250
can ultimately lead to death.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.860
And high blood sugars over
extended periods of time

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.240
can cause very complicating
factors and organ damage.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.740
So getting this right,
for a type A mom,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.840
became my singular focus.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.150
And fortunately I have
this incredible inspiration

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.240
in the form of my
oldest daughter, Elle,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.729
and she was willing to
jump in with both feet.

00:09:08.729 --> 00:09:11.270
You know, there was this moment
at Boston Children's Hospital

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.860
where it was 2:30
in the morning,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.210
it took us over 18 hours to
actually be admitted and given

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:23.530
a room, so for that 12 hours,
we were in a tiny emergency room

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.340
room where she
was lying on a cot

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.700
and there was no other
chair in the room.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.830
And it was 2:30 in the morning.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.860
We had finally gotten a room.

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.180
And I felt myself
slipping into that place

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:43.100
of despair, where you
start to self pity

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.310
and feel like, why me?

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.360
Why did this have to be us?

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.250
And then I saw Elle lying in
this bed feeling 100 times

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.630
better, because she finally
had insulin-- insulin she

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.080
needed that had been making
her sick for so long.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.120
And I thought, well, I don't
have the luxury of going there.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.390
There's no room for despair.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.390
We've got to figure out
how to live with diabetes

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.295
and help Elle live her
best life with diabetes.

00:10:07.295 --> 00:10:09.420
And that's really, for me,
where the journey began.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.980
And I followed her lead from
diagnosis to we sit here today.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.430
And I use this
picture because she,

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:19.040
from the very moment
of her diagnosis,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.130
wanted to live out
loud with diabetes.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.620
She wanted to tell
people about it.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.910
She refused to be defined by it.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.890
And she was willing to try
anything to deal with it.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.510
So this was only about eight
months after diagnosis.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.520
She was already trying
an insulin pump.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.570
She, along with Michael J.
Fox and lots of other folks,

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.570
were advocating for
the stem-cell research

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.640
that we so desperately need to
ultimately cure the disease.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.080
And that work actually led
her to the White House,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.210
where she got to
be-- she was one

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.640
of the only children in the
room when President Obama signed

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.720
the executive order that
allows for stem-cell research.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.300
Fast forward eight years,
and that stem-cell research

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.630
is at work right
here at Harvard,

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.000
and really the
researchers at Harvard

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.680
are on the precipice
of ultimately curing

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.080
type I diabetes as a result
of stem-cell research.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.830
And I am 100%
confident we're going

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.180
to see that in her lifetime.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.810
But we followed her lead as
she dove into medical research.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.310
So within 28 days
of her diagnosis,

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.050
she was testing a drug therapy
at Yale New Haven Hospital,

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:27.550
where she was in the
hospital for a month going

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.740
through this process of
testing this new medication

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.660
over the course of two years.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.160
And she was the first pediatric
patient at Mass General

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.166
Hospital to try the
bionic pancreas, which

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:40.040
is what you see here.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.710
She's actually wearing four
continuous glucose monitors

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.910
that they were testing
across her stomach,

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.160
and the IV pole
she's attached to

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.650
has all the algorithms and
the intellectual engine

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.750
that is making the decision
for how much insulin

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.510
her body needed.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.380
So while she was in the
hospital for four days

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.310
in order to test this, today,
just three years later, it

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.030
is now the size of
your smartphone,

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.570
and it's being
tested at diabetes

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.980
camps in Massachusetts.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.970
And FDA is saying
that by 2017, we're

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.260
likely to see an approval
for the bionic pancreas,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.110
or a version of it.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.700
And so again, we
followed her lead.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:22.620
The challenge is that
with type I diabetes,

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.800
it doesn't get easy.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.010
It doesn't get any easier.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.490
So even though she was willing
to try these drug trials

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.140
and she was trying
the insulin pump

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.430
and she was trying
the bionic pancreas,

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.870
every day pricking her
finger 8 to 10 times a day,

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.342
having to count
carbohydrate in everything

00:12:38.342 --> 00:12:39.800
she puts in her
mouth-- she doesn't

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.780
have the latitude of
walking into the cafeteria

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.440
that we just walked through,
picking up something to eat

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.450
and just eating it.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.760
It's a five-step process.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.780
What am I going to eat?

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.821
How much carbohydrate's
in when I'm going to eat?

00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:53.610
Am I coupling it
with any protein that

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.190
will slow the burn in my body?

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.580
How much insulin do I already
have working in my system?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.300
What's my blood sugar right now?

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.480
All before she can take
a bite of anything.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.620
So while she was 100% committed
to making life better,

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.470
the reality was that day to day,
this was a constant challenge.

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.640
And one of the ways
we found together

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.290
to cope with the challenge was
to stay invested and involved.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:24.170
And so that's really what
led us to this unlikely hero

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.080
in our family, Coach.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.490
We ended up co-chairing the
Juvenile Diabetes Research

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.480
Foundation Children's Congress,
which is an advocacy event

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.150
every two years in Washington,
and it brings 150 young people

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.290
from across the
country to DC to share

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:42.370
with new members of Congress
and current members of Congress

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.960
what it's like to live
with type I diabetes.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.360
And we agreed to co-chair
this particular year

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.710
because one of the things that
we had discovered when Elle

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.980
tested the biologic pancreas was
that the regulatory environment

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.430
for approving these devices was
so unclear that industry was

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.550
saying they were no longer
going to be investing

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:04.210
in the advancements with
the bionic pancreas,

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.400
because the roadmap for
approval was very gray.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.670
And so this particular
Congress was dedicated

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:16.530
to advocating with the FDA and
other agencies in Washington

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.140
to create a regulatory pathway
that industry could see

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.399
that would ultimately ensure if
all these boxes were checked,

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:26.440
we could get to a place
where the bionic pancreas

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.330
could be approved.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.520
And again, I say this
because one of the challenges

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.740
is you live with risk
every day, right?

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.050
We're here at Google.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.000
Google knows risk.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.580
You have to take risk in
order to be successful.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.589
And when you put
an insulin pump on

00:14:43.589 --> 00:14:45.130
and it continues to
pump insulin even

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.430
when you have a low
blood sugar, that's

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.840
a risk we're living with.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.880
And it's a risk in
many cases you're

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.171
willing to take because it
means you don't have to take

00:14:53.171 --> 00:14:54.724
12 shots of insulin a day.

00:14:54.724 --> 00:14:56.640
So Ellie right now is
wearing an insulin pump.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.348
You can't see it.

00:14:57.348 --> 00:14:58.131
It's wireless.

00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:00.380
But it's going to continue
to pump insulin in her body

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.200
even if she doesn't need
it, because it doesn't know.

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.860
And so the bionic
pancreas brings

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.590
all this intellectual power,
and helps it understand, well,

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.790
if the blood sugar is dropping,
I'm going to shut the pump off.

00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:14.910
Fighting the FDA to
help them understand

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:18.060
that this is how the technology
can work was a big challenge.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.260
And it's what led us
to want to co-chair

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.260
the Children's Congress.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.370
And it was at this
Children's Congress

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:28.250
that we saw a dog, a
golden retriever, who

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.529
was supporting a little girl.

00:15:29.529 --> 00:15:31.070
At the time, I think
she was about 8.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.240
She was younger than
Elle at the time.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:38.450
And there were 150 children in
the well of the Senate hearing

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:42.580
room, and then another 200
proud parents watching.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:47.440
And I sat and watched this dog
sit up and circle his person

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:53.020
multiple times and try to find
the parents of the young girl,

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.770
and then sit back down
because he couldn't

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.070
find them to make eye contact.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.903
And then two minutes
later, he'd get back up

00:15:57.903 --> 00:16:00.507
and he'd circle her again
until he could finally

00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:01.340
get their attention.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.756
And they came over
and tested her,

00:16:02.756 --> 00:16:04.940
and sure enough, she
had a low blood sugar.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.990
And we had heard about these
dogs because, as chairs,

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.830
we got to see the applicants
who wanted to come to Children's

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.710
Congress, and several of them
had talked about diabetes alert

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.080
dogs.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.480
And you know, I've got my
Harvard degree and I think,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.630
that's impossible.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.020
I'm type A. I'm working so
hard to manage every day

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.810
and help keep Elle healthy,
and I can't figure it out,

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:28.640
and we've been into
all these trials.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.740
How on earth is a dog
going to make this work?

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.136
So I went into this
event very skeptical.

00:16:34.136 --> 00:16:36.510
I didn't think that there was
any way this really worked.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.720
But if it provided some comfort,
then that was a good thing.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.604
And then I saw firsthand
this dog alert his person,

00:16:42.604 --> 00:16:44.520
and she had a low blood
sugar, and the parents

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.690
helped her treat it, and we
went on about the hearing.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.937
And so I couldn't so
easily just push it aside.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.710
We went home from
this Congress on high,

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.600
feeling optimistic that the FDA
was going to create a road map

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.970
and that someday very soon Elle
would have the bionic pancreas.

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.010
But we were also
living with the reality

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.440
that every day
was still so hard.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.275
And at this stage, Elle
was entering puberty.

00:17:10.275 --> 00:17:11.650
And when she was
first diagnosed,

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.410
you saw those photos, she
was 4 feet, 5 inches, and now

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.800
she's 5 feet 8 and 1/2 inches.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.950
And all of that growing
affects diabetes management.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.829
So puberty and hormones--
insulin is a hormone.

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.010
It's also hormone
resistant, so when

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:32.000
you're growing from 4 and
1/2 feet to 5 feet 8 inches

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.960
and you're becoming
a young woman,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.140
that means your insulin
demands are being

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.840
tripled, in some instances.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.180
And that roller coaster we
were right in the middle of.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.360
And yet, we knew from
having been in Washington

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.882
that the reality of getting a
bionic pancreas was years away.

00:17:48.882 --> 00:17:50.090
And we needed some more hope.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:51.923
We needed something
else to look forward to.

00:17:51.923 --> 00:17:54.680
And so I started digging,
and I started learning

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.550
about diabetes alert dogs.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.340
And this is Coach.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.100
Coach is Elle's
diabetes alert dog.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.370
We are incredibly
lucky to have him.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.270
What I discovered
when we first started

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.880
going through the
application process

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.520
is that the industry that
trains and provides service dogs

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.560
is not very well regulated.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.380
And so I was finding
everything from the dogs cost

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.720
$10,000 to you have to
raise $25,000 to get a dog,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.600
to the dog can do
anything you want it to.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.247
It can bring you your slippers
and it can inject your insulin.

00:18:30.247 --> 00:18:32.080
I mean, it got to the
point where I thought,

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.950
this is not going to work.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:35.210
And then we found CARES.

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:38.520
CARES is an organization
that's based in Kansas.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.240
They keep the cost
of their service dogs

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.320
very low because they partner
with a correctional facility

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.240
in Kansas.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.031
And actually, since
we've written the book,

00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:50.790
they've extended to two new
correctional facilities.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.670
And they work with inmates
who meet certain criteria,

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.120
and they train those inmates
to do all the basic training

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.210
for the dogs.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.260
And all that savings that they
realize by not having trainers

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.920
outside of the correctional
facility doing the training

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.880
gets passed along to families.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.880
So when I started looking at
this, I thought, OK, well,

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.550
that seems fantastic.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.850
What a great program.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:17.440
It's an opportunity for people
in the correctional system

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:21.500
to get on the path
to work study.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.690
It's an opportunity
for families like ours

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:27.400
to have a animal that
is much more affordable.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.040
And it just seemed
for the first time

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.840
like maybe we could
give this a try.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.340
They also, it was
very interesting--

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.520
CARES also said they so
believe in their training

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.930
that they would take the dog
back if you got the dog home

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:43.110
and it just didn't fit or
didn't work in your life--

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.300
if it didn't work.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.850
And we thought, OK, well,
this is worth giving it a try.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.810
And then of course the
wait list is 18 months,

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:52.180
because there aren't
enough trainers.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.980
And Elle, as you
know, is one of four.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:59.420
And our second daughter is
really the animal lover.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.590
Elle had been bitten
by a dog as a child,

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:08.346
and so I often wondered,
would this work for her?

00:20:08.346 --> 00:20:09.970
I would never describe
her before Coach

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.550
as an animal person.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:15.460
And I worried that because
Coach would be working for Elle,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.450
he might not be part
of our whole family.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.780
And the rest, Anna, Caroline,
and William, our younger three

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:22.950
children, were
desperate for a dog,

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.010
and the idea of having
a dog come home and not

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.240
be able to be part of the
family just wouldn't work.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.940
So fortunately, CARES
was willing to answer

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.190
all of my hundreds of
questions, and the answers

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.390
were all answers that seemed
like we could make work.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:43.050
So we applied and we waited,
and every time the kids said,

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.880
we really want a dog, I
said, we have one coming.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.410
Just a matter of when.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.800
And we got a little more
time under our belt.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.590
Elle moved her way
through middle school.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.850
And around January
of 2013, we got

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.931
a phone call saying Coach is
going to be ready in March.

00:21:00.931 --> 00:21:02.680
And honestly, before
that, I didn't really

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.520
think much about it.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.644
I sort of-- I had an answer
for the kids every time

00:21:05.644 --> 00:21:07.462
they asked for the
dog, and I still

00:21:07.462 --> 00:21:09.920
had all this skepticism about
whether it would really work.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.630
But there was reason enough to
hope that it was going to be OK

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:15.100
and it was worth a try.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.630
And I didn't think much of it.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.120
And then we got this phone
call and I'm thinking, oh,

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.340
are we really ready for this?

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.060
What's this going
to mean for Elle?

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.120
Elle's lived her whole life
out loud with diabetes,

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.810
but not being defined by it.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.010
She would never describe
herself as a diabetic.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.570
She would tell you
she's a theater kid

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.936
who is a phenomenal--
she loves school.

00:21:33.936 --> 00:21:35.310
That's the part
I would tell you.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:36.720
She's a phenomenal student.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.670
And she happens
to have diabetes.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:40.450
What's it going to
be like when she's

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.820
walking through the world
with a giant yellow dog

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.024
in a bright red vest, and
how will that affect her?

00:21:47.024 --> 00:21:48.690
What is it going to
mean for our family?

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.000
Is this dog going to acclimate?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.690
Can we afford him?

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.947
Will it really work?

00:21:53.947 --> 00:21:55.780
And I was convinced it
wouldn't really work.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.650
But he was really cute and we
would find a way to acclimate,

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:03.450
and maybe it would be a
beneficial part of our journey.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:09.170
And then on a very snowy day
in March, Elle and my husband

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:13.390
Craig took a journey
to Kansas to get Coach.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.110
He was ready at this point.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.660
By the time they met
him for the first time,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.160
he had had 2,000
hours of training.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.440
He had been in the Ellsworth
Correctional Facility

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.450
for about a year of his life.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:29.410
So the way CARES works is they
have puppies that get donated,

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.370
and the puppies
come from bloodlines

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.670
of dogs that have successfully
been service animals before.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.680
And they go through
a screening process

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.530
and go to a foster family,
where, as puppies, they

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.040
get socialized and
they get housebroken.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.430
And then when they get to be
about 3 and 1/2 or 4 months

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.160
they go into this
correctional facility

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.960
and they start working
with a trainer there.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.920
And when the trainer
decides the dog has

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.410
hit all these basic
training milestones,

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.630
they then go back
to CARES, and CARES,

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:01.900
using scent detection--
so they take swabs

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.420
from the insides
of people's mouths

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.050
who are living with diabetes
when they're out of range,

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:08.633
so when they're experiencing a
low blood sugar or a high blood

00:23:08.633 --> 00:23:11.460
sugar, and they train
the dog to alert

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.030
when they detect that scent.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.450
And so all that advanced
training happens at CARES.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.910
So by the time
Elle met Coach, he

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.440
had already been on
an airplane twice.

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.470
He had been living in
a correctional facility

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.400
for the first year of his life.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.380
And when they met
that first time,

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:32.770
and I'll let her describe it
after, it was really magic.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:35.920
And I was panicked at
home, because I was home

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.160
with our other three
children, and I

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.360
had a work obligation that
meant I couldn't travel

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.690
with Craig and Elle and had to
keep the other kids in school.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:49.920
And being separated from
Elle is really difficult,

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.100
because I test her
blood sugars every night

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.030
in the middle of the night
at least twice, because we've

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.880
had situations where she's had
a seizure because of a low blood

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.506
sugar, and she's had
unexplained low blood sugars

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:03.880
in the middle of the night
that she doesn't wake up from.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.080
So to have them be in Kansas
and to have me not be there,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.940
even though my husband
knows how to do this,

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.410
was nerve wracking for me.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:17.380
So I fell asleep the first night
they were away with my computer

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.480
open on my lap, and
I had sent Craig

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.210
a text saying,
please send me what

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.220
her number is when you check
her at 1:00 in the morning.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.600
1:00 in the morning
came and went

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.970
and I don't get a response,
and I start to get panicked.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:32.480
And then I text
him again and say,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.180
why aren't you
responding to your text?

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.270
And then I call and I
can't get him to answer.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.700
And we had had enough near
misses where I was almost

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.241
at the point where I was going
to call the lobby of the hotel

00:24:42.241 --> 00:24:44.420
and ask them to go
knock on his door.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.450
And of course he didn't
remember the time difference,

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:51.696
and so an hour later I get
this flurry of messages.

00:24:51.696 --> 00:24:53.070
You're never going
to believe it,

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.810
but that first night in
the hotel room, Coach

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:02.780
knocked a backpack off
the table to wake them up

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.810
because Elle had
a low blood sugar.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.950
And they're telling me this
through the phone and text

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.837
messages, and I'm
thinking that is absurd.

00:25:10.837 --> 00:25:11.920
There's no way that works.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.540
It's a small hotel room.

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.790
Maybe it was an accident.

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.800
It's a coincidence.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.350
But Elle, in her voice when
I spoke to her the next day,

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.320
was absolutely sure that
he knew what he was doing,

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.030
that he knew her
blood sugar was low,

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.840
and that he was making
sure that somebody woke up

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.424
in order for her to treat it.

00:25:28.424 --> 00:25:30.840
And that, of course, was before
they had any real training

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.180
together, so he didn't
have any signals that they

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.030
had worked out for
how he was going

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:37.830
to tell her when she was low.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.010
And so the training continued.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.380
They graduated, and as
a licensed service team,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.820
they came home.

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.400
And I have to say,
this was the moment

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.120
I feared most, this idea
that she was going to now

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.270
be in the world with her
dog, and how was that

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.760
going to work for her socially?

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:58.300
And I remember getting the phone
call as they were preparing

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.180
to come home from Kansas
with Coach in tow,

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.677
knowing that he had graduated
and they had graduated

00:26:03.677 --> 00:26:05.260
and they were a
licensed service team,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.467
and he was going to be now
going to school with her.

00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:09.550
And she said, mom, you
have to call the principal,

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.769
make sure they
know we're coming.

00:26:11.769 --> 00:26:13.560
And I said, what do
you mean you're coming?

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.162
I thought he'll be at home and
he'll be with you at nighttime,

00:26:16.162 --> 00:26:17.995
but you're not going
to bring him to school.

00:26:17.995 --> 00:26:20.167
And she said, oh yeah, I'm
bringing him everywhere.

00:26:20.167 --> 00:26:22.750
I'm bringing him to school and
I'm bringing him to dance class

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.166
and I'm bringing him to theater
rehearsal, and where I go,

00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:26.650
he's going to go.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.860
And I thought, OK, well,
she's comfortable with this,

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.920
but how is that
really going to work?

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.790
And what will that
be like for her?

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.970
Will she always be
the girl with the dog,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.710
and how can she live with that?

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:39.700
And she doesn't
self-identify as a diabetic,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.610
and how will she
explain all that?

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:48.662
And much to our
amazement and surprise,

00:26:48.662 --> 00:26:50.620
I didn't need to answer
any of those questions,

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.670
because the love
between them and what

00:26:53.670 --> 00:26:57.720
this relationship means to
her was all the explanation

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.730
that anybody needs.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.180
And I share this
picture because, I mean,

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.895
literally this was during
a theater summer program

00:27:05.895 --> 00:27:07.520
where she would leave
the house at 6:30

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.560
in the morning with Coach and
return at about 7:30 at night.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.200
And where he goes, she goes.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.070
And knowing that
they have each other

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:19.560
has created just an unbelievable
sense of relief for me.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.390
To me, the most
unbelievable surprise

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:27.680
as I navigate and have tried
to figure out how this really

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.400
is going to work
long term for Elle

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.050
is that it has triangulated
our dynamic in such a way

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.430
that this is no longer
about diabetes, right?

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.860
She is empowered
as Coach's trainer

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.560
to reward him when he does
what he's supposed to do.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.150
So instead of me
saying to her, when

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.608
did you last test
your blood sugar,

00:27:46.608 --> 00:27:48.590
and you seem like
you might be high,

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:53.800
and did you take enough insulin
for that piece of pizza,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.830
now it's a matter of, what
is Coach trying to tell me,

00:27:56.830 --> 00:28:01.121
and how do I interpret what it
is he's telling me right now?

00:28:01.121 --> 00:28:02.870
And when he does what
he's supposed to do,

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.640
I need to make
sure I reward him.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.280
And diabetes isn't even
in the mix anymore.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.340
It's about their relationship
and the bond they have,

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:12.270
and her role as his trainer.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.060
And that's been a
gift that I never

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.350
could have imagined and
anticipated in all this.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:21.286
And I have to say, I
share this because I

00:28:21.286 --> 00:28:22.660
was so worried
about how it would

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:26.750
be with her at school with
him, and he's part of the team.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.750
He has his own student ID.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:31.140
He's the equivalent
of the school mascot.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.510
As Elle says, he's
a friend magnet.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.160
He's a conversation starter.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.900
And he's allowed her to live
out loud with diabetes in a way

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.950
that we never could
have imagined,

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.960
while keeping her safe.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.460
For me, as Elle's
mother anticipating

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.940
the start of college-- we
started visiting schools

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:53.520
this past month-- and when she
was first diagnosed, and night

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.280
after night I'd be lying awake
waiting to test her blood

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.476
sugar at 1:00 in the
morning, thinking,

00:28:58.476 --> 00:28:59.850
how are we ever
going to do this?

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:02.280
How is she going to live
independently and have

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.870
the life she's intended to
have with the risks that come

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.010
every day with type I diabetes?

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:12.320
And now to know she's got Coach
by her side, who's helping her

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.340
every day, just provides
the kind of reassurance

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.650
I never imagined we could have.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:21.190
And I have to give you just
a couple recent stories

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:23.442
about Coach's alerting.

00:29:23.442 --> 00:29:25.900
A couple weeks ago, Elle was
experiencing a low blood sugar

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.800
and she was late getting
to school, getting

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.170
to class, her English class.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.440
And he had been
trying to alert her,

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.760
and she was a
little disoriented,

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.950
because that's what often
happens when you're low.

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.200
And he was trying
to get her attention

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.780
and pulling on the
leash, and she's trying

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.300
to pull him into the classroom.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.540
And they walk by the nurse's
office, and he stops.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.890
And he takes his leash and
he pulls back on his leash

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.590
and tries to pull her
into the nurse's office

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.330
to get her to test
her blood sugar.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.990
And sure enough, her
blood sugar was 65.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:02.270
So my joke to her is, why do
you make him work so hard?

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.840
But ultimately, those kinds
of things happen every day.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.940
People often say, how
often does he alert you?

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.090
And because he's trained to
alert when her blood sugar is

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:16.310
below 80 or above 200, he alerts
her two or three times a day,

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.626
at least.

00:30:17.626 --> 00:30:20.000
If he can't get her to wake
up in the middle of the night

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.180
because her blood sugar is
low, he comes and finds me.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.540
And that was really the moment
when I stopped being skeptical

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:27.960
and started trusting him.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:31.810
It was about two weeks or so in
after he and Elle had come home

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.290
from Kansas, and it was
about 4:00 in the morning,

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.510
and I'm not trusting him
yet so I'm still getting up

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.551
the middle of the night
and I'm testing her blood

00:30:38.551 --> 00:30:39.780
sugar at 1:00 in the morning.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:41.613
And she was in range
at 1:00 in the morning,

00:30:41.613 --> 00:30:43.210
and I went off to bed.

00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.830
And at 4:00 in the morning
I feel this wet something

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:47.430
on my cheek.

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:49.930
And I was disoriented, and
I'm still not used to the fact

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.910
that we have a
Coach in the house.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:53.830
And so I sort of pushed
him off and said,

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.380
it's all right, Coach.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:00.200
And he then put both paws on
the bed and right on top of me.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.820
And so I, disoriented, and
I got up and I thought,

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.070
well this can't-- I mean,
I just tested her at 1:00.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.650
She was fine, and
maybe he has to go out.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.270
So he wanted me to follow
him up to her bedroom,

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.570
so up I went and
tested her blood sugar,

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.930
and sure enough,
she was low again.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.680
And those things
happen often when

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.100
you're living with diabetes,
with no explanation.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:25.990
And to know that she's got him
and that I have him by her side

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:28.990
has just been an
incredible sense of relief.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:33.170
So the clan is clearly very
happy to have Coach in the mix.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:35.977
As Elle has said from
the very beginning,

00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:37.560
bringing Coach home
was the first time

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.934
she felt like diabetes was
actually giving something back

00:31:39.934 --> 00:31:41.350
to our whole family.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.670
This was us celebrating his
fourth birthday in October.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:47.930
And as you can see, Anna,
Caroline, and William

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:52.140
think the sun rises
and sets over Coach.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.490
And we are very proud
to be here this week,

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.800
because our book just came
out in paperback on Tuesday,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.380
so it's been a very fun journey
to get out and share our story.

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.790
We've been able to help
other families find

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:06.350
their way to CARES,
and we've now got,

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:08.840
because we've been sharing
the story for a while,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.200
we've got families who now have
their own dogs, which has just

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.970
been incredibly gratifying.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:18.400
And actually, CNN just aired
a piece about our story,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.020
and they went into
the prison and got

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.470
to talk to the inmates
who do the training, which

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.000
was a gift for me,
because I had not

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.170
been able to be part of that
since Elle and Craig were

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:28.720
the ones in Kansas.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.530
And to hear the
inmates describe what

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.870
it was like to read the story
and hear how our lives were so

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.660
positively impacted by what they
have been able to do for us,

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.510
it's just been an amazing gift.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.650
So we feel very fortunate.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:46.330
And with that I'd love to
open it up to questions.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.890
And Elle's here and happy
to answer questions, too.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.070
AUDIENCE: So this is
a question for Elle.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.430
You're about to go
to college, or you're

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.280
looking into colleges.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.613
What are you looking forward to?

00:32:57.613 --> 00:33:02.230
What sorts of plans excite you?

00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.530
ELLE: I have no idea yet.

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:09.490
I'm still looking at
schools and figuring out

00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:10.400
different programs.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.870
We just started-- we
just visited Emerson

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.090
and Boston Conservatory.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:19.890
And I found out last week that
I got into Carnegie Mellon's

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:21.182
musical theater summer program.

00:33:21.182 --> 00:33:22.265
AUDIENCE: Congratulations.

00:33:22.265 --> 00:33:23.210
ELLE: Thank you.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:25.620
So I'm really
excited about that.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.170
And Coach will be going with me.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.670
STEFANY SHAHEEN:
Which, for-- that's

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.360
a six-week overnight
program, which

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.700
will be the first time she's
ever been away from home

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.930
for that period of time.

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:39.000
And I should say that
the combination of Coach

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.670
and a continuous
glucose monitor,

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.910
which I can now see
on my phone, make

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.520
me feel very reassured that this
is going to be a good thing.

00:33:49.546 --> 00:33:51.420
AUDIENCE: So I actually
had another question.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.170
So when you mentioned the
training, the people who

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.110
actually train them
in the prisons,

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.770
is there a way for the families
to actually write to them?

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:04.140
I mean, I had an
ACL transplant, so I

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.290
was able to write the
donors anonymously,

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:09.280
but that felt really
an important act to do.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.380
Do they have a way of
your being able to--

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:12.856
STEFANY SHAHEEN:
Unfortunately not.

00:34:12.856 --> 00:34:14.480
They're not allowed
to maintain contact

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.120
with the families of the people.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.453
AUDIENCE: But let's say,
anonymous, because for example,

00:34:18.453 --> 00:34:20.630
the donor's family have
no idea who I am, but--

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:20.714
STEFANY SHAHEEN: Yes, yes.

00:34:20.714 --> 00:34:21.909
We can write to
them, but they're not

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:22.879
allowed to write to us.

00:34:22.879 --> 00:34:23.420
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.530
STEFANY SHAHEEN: So they're
not allowed to reach us.

00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:26.196
AUDIENCE: But they
do get the feedback.

00:34:26.196 --> 00:34:27.570
STEFANY SHAHEEN:
Yes, absolutely.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:28.389
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:29.764
STEFANY SHAHEEN:
And in fact, you

00:34:29.764 --> 00:34:32.420
want to share the
interaction with Michael?

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.650
ELLE: Sure.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:36.800
When I was in Kansas
getting Coach with my dad,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.940
we actually spent a
few hours in the prison

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.139
where our dogs were trained.

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:44.620
And we walked into the
room, and all the inmates

00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.080
were sitting there with the
dogs that they were currently

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.179
training at the
time, and they all

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.300
started tearing up
because they were getting

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.020
so emotional over
seeing these dogs

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:57.510
and seeing them with the people
that they would be helping.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.690
And I got to meet one
of the two trainers

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:03.120
that got to train Coach.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.007
And I was a little
nervous at first,

00:35:07.007 --> 00:35:08.840
because it was a little
intimidating, 'cause

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:13.060
he was a very, very large man.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.780
But he was so sweet,
and got really touched

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.160
that Coach was helping
someone like me

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:25.620
and that he could be a part
of an organization like CARES.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.050
AUDIENCE: One of my daughters
has been, over the last six

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:30.850
months, training service dogs.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:34.590
She's between being a graduate
student in animal behavior

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:37.370
and going to vet school, and
so this is very interesting.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.840
I'm not a dog person.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.410
I have had contact with a
whole series of these dogs

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:44.640
over these last six months.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.900
They're amazing.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:48.540
But the process
of training them,

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.200
so this is what
she's been doing--

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:55.280
can you say more about how--
that particular program is one.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.480
Is there is an infrastructure or
a pipeline for dogs like this,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:06.640
and to what extent do they need
to be specialized early on?

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:13.300
It sounded like Coach had sort
of a service dog background

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.710
and then was trained in
particular skills that

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.810
are valuable here.

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.846
Say more about the training,
because it's a huge project.

00:36:22.846 --> 00:36:23.880
STEFANY SHAHEEN: Sure.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.546
We actually had the
privilege of meeting

00:36:25.546 --> 00:36:28.020
the person who developed the
training protocol for diabetes

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.990
alert dogs.

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:31.700
He himself was a dog trainer
for search and rescue

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.730
and narcotic detection, and
he was also living with type

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:35.380
I diabetes.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.100
And what he discovered was
that the dogs could pick up

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.690
on the scent when
he was low or high,

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.070
and so he developed a
protocol that is used now

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.710
and was used to train Coach.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:47.610
The pipeline-- part of why
we wanted to share our story

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:49.220
was that the single
biggest barrier

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:51.730
to getting more
dogs more affordably

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:55.430
available to families is the
availability of trainers.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:59.350
So there are-- the puppies
are not the problem.

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.040
It's the number of trainers
who are able to train.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.090
And the way that
CARES works, they

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:11.014
don't breed dogs and
let the puppies wait.

00:37:11.014 --> 00:37:12.430
They breed the
dogs and the timing

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.304
of the puppies being
born coincides with when

00:37:14.304 --> 00:37:15.780
a trainer is available.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:21.420
So as soon as the puppy's born,
they are studied and evaluated

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:22.980
to see, are these
dogs going to be

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.630
ready to do what
they need to do?

00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:28.380
So some dogs don't mate
it through the training.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:30.110
In fact, we were
joking that we want

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:31.980
to be on the list
for the dropout dogs,

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.800
because when Elle and
Coach go to college,

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.900
we're going to need
another dog in the house.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:42.770
And there are PTSD,
seizure detection, diabetes

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.550
alert-- CARES doesn't do
this, but there are also

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:48.690
dogs now being trained
in cancer detection.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:51.590
And so what CARES
would explain is

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:55.580
that based on what they
see the dog's abilities,

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.850
they would be either funneled
into diabetes alert or seizure

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:02.180
detection or PTSD.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.550
They also are particular
about which breeds

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.650
get trained for what.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:10.240
So often you're talking about
German shepherds for veterans,

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:13.260
especially, who are
getting dogs for PTSD,

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.210
and that's because
the breed is such

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:18.580
that they're more
intimidating, and their job

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.100
is to protect the perimeter of
a veteran or somebody coping

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.190
with PTSD.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.850
And in fact, there were
multiple veterans in Elle class

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:31.930
who were there for a
dog to help treat PTSD.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:33.830
They use labs and
golden retrievers

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.920
predominantly for seizure
detection and diabetes alert,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.270
especially in young
people, because they're

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:43.020
in situations where the dogs
have to be especially social.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.440
And they say it's
about 2,000 hours,

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:48.800
but Elle works with
Coach every day

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.876
in order to help
him be successful.

00:38:50.876 --> 00:38:52.750
Do you want to share
like the kinds of things

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.980
you do every day?

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.080
ELLE: He needs to
stay very regimented,

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:01.970
so he stays on a very specific
schedule in terms of feeding

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.720
and when I walk him
and stuff like that.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.830
But I also have to
groom him once a week.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:11.220
And I take him on
training walks just

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.440
to make sure that
he is up to date

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.670
and still alert at
all times of the day.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.340
STEFANY SHAHEEN: We had
an interesting dilemma.

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.530
That summer where I showed
you that photo where

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.310
they were both
asleep in the car,

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.870
he was having trouble waking
up in the middle of the night.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:31.982
And there were a couple times
where she was just below range

00:39:31.982 --> 00:39:34.440
when he should have been awake
and alerting, and he wasn't.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.141
And I called the
trainer and I said,

00:39:36.141 --> 00:39:37.390
I don't know what's happening.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:40.116
And she said, well, describe
what the day is like.

00:39:40.116 --> 00:39:41.865
I said, well, they
leave the house at 6:30

00:39:41.865 --> 00:39:43.950
and they're in this
summer program all day,

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:45.780
and then he's getting
home at 7:30 at night

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.300
and we take him for his walk.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.770
And she said, he's exhausted.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.360
He's working overtime
and he needs a break.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.370
So we have to build in
specified sleep time

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.240
where he can sleep
and know she's OK

00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:02.070
and he's sort of off
the clock, not working.

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:04.970
We also often get the
question about play.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.770
Can he ever just be a dog,
or is he always working?

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:11.700
And what we've learned is that
you have to distinguish play

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.780
as a reward.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.510
So he gets to play when he's
done what he's supposed to do.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.260
And then you distinguish
play from work

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.940
by taking the vest off,
taking the working collar off

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.640
and putting the play collar on.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.940
So you'll often see
him outside, if he's

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.834
being rewarded with fetch
or some kind of play,

00:40:26.834 --> 00:40:28.000
he doesn't have his vest on.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.880
He's got his play collar on.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.140
But he also is
really wired to work.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.930
So whenever they're
separated for any reason,

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.980
he's very unsettled, because
he is looking for a job to do.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:41.356
I remember the very first
time they were separated,

00:40:41.356 --> 00:40:42.730
she went to the
mall with friends

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:44.563
and there was not room
in the car for Coach.

00:40:44.563 --> 00:40:47.342
And they'd been together
nonstop for four weeks.

00:40:47.342 --> 00:40:48.800
And the trainer
said, they're going

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.307
to have to get comfortable not
being together all the time,

00:40:51.307 --> 00:40:52.890
because inevitably
there will be times

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.710
when they're not together.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:57.822
So she left the house crying.

00:40:57.822 --> 00:41:01.190
As she's leaving, his nose
is pressed against the glass,

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.610
and then he was very agitated.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.090
And she said, well, he's
was looking for a job to do.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:04.965
Give him a job to do.

00:41:04.965 --> 00:41:07.510
So we put the laundry basket
in the middle of the kitchen

00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:09.640
floor, and he would walk
around the kids' bedrooms,

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.280
pick up the stuffed animals,
put them in the laundry basket,

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.126
get a reward.

00:41:14.126 --> 00:41:15.500
So he is very much
a working dog.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:18.392
He needs to work, and he
needs to stay regimented.

00:41:18.392 --> 00:41:19.850
He goes to the
bathroom on command.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.312
People often say,
how do you know

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:23.270
if he's alerting versus
just trying to tell you

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:24.522
he needs to go out?

00:41:24.522 --> 00:41:26.980
He doesn't tell you he needs
to go out, because he goes out

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:28.680
when he is supposed
to go out, and he

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:32.440
goes to the bathroom on
command, and not otherwise.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.519
Yeah, it's amazing.

00:41:34.519 --> 00:41:36.060
AUDIENCE: And early
on, you mentioned

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:40.490
when you were first
investigating service dogs,

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:44.340
that it was-- you were surprised
at how unregulated it was.

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:50.900
Now, in retrospect, do you think
that there's a need for more?

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.210
Would that be helpful?

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:54.510
What's your sense of
what could be done

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.900
that would be useful there?

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.170
STEFANY SHAHEEN: Yeah, I
have to say diabetes alert

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:00.810
dogs are still very unusual.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.520
There aren't that many.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.790
CARES, which has been in
operation for 10 years,

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.690
has only trained 1,300
dogs total, and not

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:10.100
just for diabetes alert.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.860
It's a new and emerging area.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.280
And I think we need
better research that

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.060
actually demonstrates the effect
these animals can have, not

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.360
just from a
biometric standpoint,

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.610
because actually, Elle's
A1C is better now than it

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.010
was before we had Coach.

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:31.250
So we could tell you that she
actually is in range more often

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.880
and her body is healthier
than it was without him.

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.860
But we need that quantified
in the form of research that's

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.460
not just anecdotal.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.260
But beyond that, I
think the industry

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.750
itself is very poorly regulated.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.440
We've met too many families who
have spent an inordinate amount

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.760
of money, I mean tens
of thousands of dollars,

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.460
have raised money through
philanthropic efforts

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.560
to get a dog, and the dog
comes and doesn't work.

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.240
So there needs to be a
national accreditation

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.520
process that is the standard.

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:05.940
CARES works with one and
abides by it very carefully,

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.550
but there are others that don't.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:12.040
And ultimately, right
now, Coach and Elle

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.530
are protected through
the ADA, because they're

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:18.660
a trained service team and
he has a demonstrated job.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.680
But how many of you have been on
an airplane with a service dog,

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.480
right?

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.860
So there's also this--
it's a very gray area,

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.880
and we need to tighten
it up, because it

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.030
will help the people who really
are in need of a service dog,

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.050
and it will help
the families who

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:36.490
are trying to navigate their
way through this process

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:37.880
and have some assurance.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.600
I mean, CARES has said to
me, they hear from families

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.975
all the time who spent $25,000
and got a dog that didn't work.

00:43:46.975 --> 00:43:49.890
And that's just not right.

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:51.560
AUDIENCE: This is a
question for Elle.

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.000
Since you started at
school, how have you

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.980
found that the school
environment, or maybe even just

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.230
the way your friends think
about these types of issues

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:00.490
have changed, because
you've been living with it,

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:02.656
but have you seen changes
come about in your school,

00:44:02.656 --> 00:44:04.700
or your friends are more
interested in talking

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:08.060
about medical research?

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.250
ELLE: Not necessarily.

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:16.050
He-- like my mom said before,
I don't really classify myself

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:18.280
as a diabetic, so
it's not something

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.410
I talk about very often.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:23.310
It's just sort of a
part of my daily life.

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:28.580
So when I got Coach,
especially as a freshman going

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.550
into this very large
school and trying

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:36.840
to navigate social aspects of
high school, that was hard,

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.140
because I was-- I
felt at the beginning,

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.030
before I even got Coach, that he
might be putting a label on me,

00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:48.580
or just a label that something
might be wrong with me.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.060
But then I got to school,
and they loved him.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.470
He really became a part
of the school community,

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:59.310
and everyone welcomed
him with open arms.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.620
My freshman English class,
they had tennis balls

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.620
on the bottom of our
chairs, and he would always

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:06.460
try to bite them off.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.540
So the next day,
my English teacher

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.900
brought in a bucket
of old tennis balls

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:12.516
for him to chew on during class.

00:45:12.516 --> 00:45:13.890
STEFANY SHAHEEN:
Which she wasn't

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:15.474
supposed to do, by the way.

00:45:15.474 --> 00:45:16.390
ELLE: It was a reward.

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.290
STEFANY SHAHEEN: I know.

00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:20.790
ELLE: But he's really become a
part of the school community.

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:26.580
But in terms of diabetes
being a conversation topic,

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:31.360
I don't think that
has changed as much.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.450
But I'm willing to talk
about it with anyone

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.210
who has questions about it.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.090
STEFANY SHAHEEN: What
we have discovered

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:41.595
is that without Coach, the
topic of diabetes is very heavy,

00:45:41.595 --> 00:45:43.970
because you're trying to
explain the reality of what it's

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.240
like to live with
a chronic disease,

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.370
and what it means that you
can't go to sleep and trust

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:52.020
that you're safe
through the night.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:54.990
But with Coach, it allows us to
have conversations with people

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.330
who are really fascinated
by how Coach works

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.920
and what he does for Elle, that
open the door to information

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.920
and education about what it's
like to live with diabetes.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:06.090
And I think that's
been very empowering.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.840
And part of the reason
we share the story,

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.530
we really wrestled with, do
we want to write this book?

00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.470
Do we really want
to tell the story?

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:14.405
And I remember a
conversation Elle

00:46:14.405 --> 00:46:16.857
and I had, because I felt like
it was up to her to decide.

00:46:16.857 --> 00:46:19.440
I was willing to do the work if
she was willing to put herself

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.330
out there.

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:24.710
And you answer so many
questions about, well,

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:26.660
is it what you ate that
caused your diabetes?

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:30.290
Is it because you
didn't exercise enough,

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:33.050
the confusion between type II
diabetes and type I diabetes,

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:35.870
and lots of people who have
asked her if she's just

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:38.190
training Coach, or
wave their hands

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.070
in front of her face
to see if she needs--

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:41.910
if he's a seeing-eye dog.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:46.020
So for all those reasons, she
wanted to share the story.

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.770
And I think it's been very
empowering in that way,

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:53.180
because it allows us to open
up about life before Coach

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:56.170
and the risks that Elle lives
with every day with Coach

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:58.430
in a way that I think
without him is a much

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.720
harder conversation to have.

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.087
So that's been wonderful.

00:47:02.087 --> 00:47:04.420
AUDIENCE: And then just one
quick follow up-- how has he

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.030
taken to music and theater?

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.970
Does he have any
kind of-- express

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:11.480
any preference or, he just
has to wait quietly backstage?

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.300
ELLE: He loves it.

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.850
He likes it more-- my younger
sister plays volleyball

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:19.630
and my brother plays
baseball and soccer.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.660
And he hates the
noises at the game.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.600
But he loves coming
to rehearsal.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.350
And within a year
of me getting him,

00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:32.076
I was doing a summer
program, and they actually

00:47:32.076 --> 00:47:33.450
wrote a part for
him in the show,

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:37.490
and he had his own little
dressing room backstage.

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:38.680
It was really cute.

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.710
STEFANY SHAHEEN: And they
were both in "Of Mice and Men"

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.840
with Boston Children's
Theater down here,

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:47.020
and that was the worst
for me, because they

00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:49.000
both got killed in the play.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.010
I said, OK, no more.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:52.300
Coach and Elle can't
have something bad

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.350
happen in the play.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:55.760
But it's been amazing.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.690
And as Elle said, I think he
must have had whistle training

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.192
at some point, because he
cannot handle-- I mean,

00:48:01.192 --> 00:48:04.185
he just does not like being in
the gym cheering on Anna with

00:48:04.185 --> 00:48:05.060
the referee whistles.

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.030
It drives him crazy.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.220
We actually had,
and I'll share this,

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:13.660
this is a very present
and pressing story for me.

00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.940
Elle just opened a
show a few weeks ago,

00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:19.670
and we hadn't figured out how
to handle performance nights

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:23.320
with Coach, because there's no
way to keep him safe backstage

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.310
and allow him to do his
job, because he would have

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:29.402
to be crated, and then he'd
have to bark in order to alert,

00:48:29.402 --> 00:48:30.860
and so he'd be
barking in the show.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:33.220
And we've tried a
few different things,

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:35.040
and it just doesn't work.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.920
So opening night, she was
running the show in rehearsal

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:44.170
before the actual opening, and
didn't have a Coach with her,

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.066
had had too much insulin for the
amount of dancing and activity

00:48:47.066 --> 00:48:48.940
she was doing in the
show and not enough food

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:52.830
before the show with nerves,
and her continuous glucose

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:54.541
monitor was alarming
her on her phone,

00:48:54.541 --> 00:48:56.040
but she couldn't
hear it because she

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.050
was on the stage with
the music playing.

00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:00.940
Luckily, it was alarming
me on my phone at work,

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:04.190
and I was incessantly
trying to reach her,

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:06.460
couldn't reach her because
she's on the stage,

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.290
was able to find someone
in the box office

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.950
to go into the theater to
pull her off the stage,

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:13.570
and it took us about two
hours of treating the low

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.780
to get her into a healthy
range so she could perform.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.860
And I use that as an
example because it just

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.542
happened a few weeks ago, and
the juxtaposition of what that

00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:23.000
would have looked
like with Coach--

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.740
so if that had happened
in a rehearsal and Coach

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:26.406
was in the theater
in rehearsal, he just

00:49:26.406 --> 00:49:30.140
would have walked onto the
stage and made her stop,

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:32.420
and made her very aware
of what was happening.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.880
And that's the value
of having him around,

00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.190
why we feel so lucky.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:41.230
One more question, anyone?

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:42.790
Well, this has been such a gift.

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:45.270
I can't thank you enough for
the chance to share our story,

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:49.300
and we look forward to
coming back at a later time.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.317
[APPLAUSE]
