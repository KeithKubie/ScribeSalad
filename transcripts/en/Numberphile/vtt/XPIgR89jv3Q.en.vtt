00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
Alright, we're gonna do some street maths

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.680
here in the outdoors,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.040
which I've heard a lot about.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.260
But first...

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.760
my shoe is untied.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.920
So we need to fix that.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.680
Now, most people would mess around doing some kind of complicated knot,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.840
not me - I'm a mathematician.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.880
I've got maths to do.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.920
Grab the two sides, pass 'em over, boom! There's your knot.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.740
Again, in slo-mo!

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.000
I'd heard about it, you know, on the maths circuit.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.560
People would discuss the way that you tie your shoes, right?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.460
And so â€“ I know it's been around for a long time, I know it's been passed down

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
from mathematician to mathematician.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.960
But I'm not familiar with the earliest case, and I have heard names assigned to it,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.860
but I've not come across any one that particularly sticks.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.820
I just call it "that brilliant way to tie your shoes."

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.960
(Brady) Be honest with me, is that how you do your shoes?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.960
I do genuinely tie my shoes that way

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.160
I know I'm always talking about it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.160
I literally tie my shoes that way.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.160
Up to once a day.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.160
Once it's done, it looks exactly the same, right?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.900
So then people won't go, "That's an unusual knot," right?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.840
But if they actually see it happening

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.980
It's like they've seen a magic trick, right?

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.440
It just blows their mind

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.400
They can't comprehend how a knot can happen so quickly.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.760
But, I'm not startled; I'm a mathematician!

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.820
I know what I'm doing.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.340
Okay, you go from completely undone, it starts the same way as a normal knot

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.560
You do your little foundation thing

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.440
Which in maths is called a trefoil

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.440
It has a minimum of three crossings in that particular knot

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.640
Now to tie the actual bow

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.100
You get one shoelace that's coming out the back

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
You fold it forward and you hold it on its way down

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340
So it goes up over the loop and then down

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.360
This one curls back in the opposite direction

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.360
And again you hold it on the way down.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.780
And then all you do is you take this one on the way down and put it under that loop

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.680
At the same time as taking this one and putting it under that loop

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.000
And then you swap them over to the other hands

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.700
And then you pull them tight, and that is your knot!

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.260
And with a little bit of practice,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.760
Once you tighten it, hold them on the way down,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.640
cross, pull, knot.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.920
So the one that comes out the back, you fold it forward into a loop

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.740
And then you hold it on the way down

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.740
So it goes up and then on the way down you're grasping it

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.980
Same with this one except it goes back

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.420
So it starts at the front, curls back, hold it on the way down

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.800
Now you're gonna take this lace, put it under that loop

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.560
at the same time as taking this lace and putting it under that loop

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.520
So they go past each other

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.600
They swap hands, you pull it tight

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.700
And there's your knot.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.140
People tie their shoelaces, they get one and they loop the other one around

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.140
and they pull it through, which is the normal way.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400
Although I've noticed, of course, Brady wears slip-ons.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.560
(Brady) Why? What's wrong with them?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.460
For those of us who have entered adulthood

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.740
We do it a long, complicated way.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.360
But, the thing is, you end up with a knot that holds your shoe on.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.440
That's the goal here

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.400
My shoelaces

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
Formed with what ordinary people would think is a knot

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.180
Now, nothing of this is a mathematical knot

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.740
Because it has loose ends

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.060
If it has loose ends, you can, in principle, untie it

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.360
And you can form a different knot.
