00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.690
BRIAN: Our guest
today is Bill Ury.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.250
Bill's written and
published several books.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.720
He's here with one of those
books, which is "Getting to Yes

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.730
with Yourself."

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.900
As I read your
press on your site,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.970
it's almost looking at it as
a prequel to "Getting to Yes,"

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.890
which was your first book,
which has been printed

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.760
12 million times
in English and has

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.400
been published in 37 languages.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.880
So we've got quite
an accomplished,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.480
well read individual
with us today.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.260
Other books are
"The Third Side,"

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.040
"Getting Past No," and "The
Power of a Positive No."

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.140
But that's just a small
bit of who Bill is.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.455
And I don't know if--
for those of you who

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:01.650
I sent the link
around to his page,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.610
I'll try not to bore you or
try not to go on for too long.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.725
But he's the co-founder
of Harvard's program

00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:08.350
on negotiation.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.600
And he's currently a
distinguished senior fellow

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.740
at Harvard, correct?

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.870
But this is where it starts to
get really, really interesting.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.920
He's worked providing mediation
services in conflicts ranging

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.330
from Kentucky coal mines to the
Middle East and to the Balkans.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.730
He's worked with Jimmy Carter
to create an organization

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.945
to help avert or
solve for civil wars

00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:40.230
where he's actually
traveled to Indonesia

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.680
and helped to
resolve a civil war,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.660
and in Venezuela to
prevent a civil war.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.640
So later today when you
think you're really cool

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.990
and you've closed that $20,000
upgrade for your client,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.142
think back to this and you'll
put it in perspective, OK?

00:01:57.142 --> 00:01:58.100
It's still really cool.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.710
Go close it.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.390
But put it in perspective.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.920
He's also won several
awards or been recognized

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.630
many, many times for his work.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.710
There were one or two that
jumped off the page for me.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.320
He's won a Distinguished Service
medal from Russia for his work.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.240
So in addition to
everything else that I've

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.420
been telling you, he actually
might be a spy for all we know.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.310
He has a B.A. from Yale
and a Ph.D. from Harvard.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.550
The work that he's done in terms
of global political conflict

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.830
is just part of what he does.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.900
He also works with top
corporate executives

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.290
in training them to learn how to
be better mediators and better

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.490
negotiators.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.560
And what I'm really
looking forward today

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.520
is hearing how you kind of
marry global conflict resolution

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.331
to good business practices.

00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:58.170
And after Bill speaks
with us for a few minutes

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.990
and presents to
us, I hope we can

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.200
have a wide open
conversation around that.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.440
We have between 15 and 20
of his most recent books

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.020
here today, so after the
talk if you'd like one,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.380
please grab one.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.370
If you'd really like one and
there isn't one left for you,

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.000
just get in touch
with me afterwards

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.460
and we'll get a few more
for those people who

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.880
really want them, OK?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.497
So thanks for coming today.

00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:22.080
Welcome, Bill.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.030
Bill, it's all yours.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.440
WILLIAM URY: OK.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.098
Thanks, Brian.

00:03:24.098 --> 00:03:25.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.635
Appreciate it.

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:29.222
That was quite an intro.

00:03:29.222 --> 00:03:30.930
What I want to talk
with you this morning

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.785
is really about
what I think is one

00:03:32.785 --> 00:03:35.960
of the more important, valuable,
useful skills that any of us

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.790
can have in today's
challenging times,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.330
and that's a skill of
negotiation, of getting to yes,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.930
of trying to reach
agreement with others.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.190
And as I've been in
this field ever since I

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.260
was a graduate
student up the way

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.720
here at Harvard
many years ago, I've

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.910
had kind of like a front
seat view on something

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.972
that I call a revolution
that actually accompanies

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.680
the knowledge revolution,
the information

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.210
revolution of which
Google is a part, which

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.830
is a more silent
revolution, but it's

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.010
a revolution in the way in
which we as individuals,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.310
organizations, or
societies make decisions.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.390
Because typically a
generation or two ago,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.980
the main way in
which people made

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.596
decisions was people on the
top of the pyramids of power

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:21.470
gave the orders, and
the people on the bottom

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.080
simply followed the orders.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.310
And now thanks to the
information revolution,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.920
those pyramids of
power are starting

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.520
to collapse into
organizational forms

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.700
that more resemble
networks, flatter

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.850
forms, more horizontal forms.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.930
And as that shifts, the form
of decision making shifts

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.400
from vertical to
horizontal, and another name

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.150
for horizontal decision making
is negotiation, is getting yes.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.500
So that to get our
jobs done nowadays,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.420
we're literally dependent on
dozens, hundreds, thousands

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.090
of individuals,
organizations over whom

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.460
we exercise no direct control.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.710
If we want to get to yes with
them, we have to negotiate.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.030
So let me just actually
ask you, if you don't mind,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.340
a few quick questions about
your own negotiating experience.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.590
Because if you think about
it, what I'm interested in

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.000
is what stops us
from getting the yes?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.690
So let me just ask you to
think about your own experience

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.020
for a moment here and ask
yourself the question of, if I

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.750
were to define negotiation
very simply and very broadly

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.370
as trying to reach agreement
with someone-- you have

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.600
some interests which
maybe you hold in common

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.420
like an ongoing relationship
with a customer,

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.210
and some interests which maybe
are in tension with each other,

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.610
like you'd like to get more
money for your contract

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.130
for Google, and maybe
they'd like to pay you less,

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.960
who do you find
yourself negotiating

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.730
with in the broad sense of the
term in the course of your day?

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.450
Just if you wouldn't
mind just calling it out.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.042
Who do you negotiate with?

00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:49.750
AUDIENCE: Spouse.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.791
WILLIAM URY: Your spouse.

00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:52.910
OK, we'll start with
the hard ones there.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.910
AUDIENCE: Your children.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.230
WILLIAM URY: Your children, OK.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.966
Who else?

00:05:56.966 --> 00:05:57.465
Your what?

00:05:57.465 --> 00:05:58.350
AUDIENCE: Colleagues.

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.558
WILLIAM URY: Your colleagues.

00:05:59.558 --> 00:06:00.750
OK.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.250
Who else?

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.940
AUDIENCE: Internal teams.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.040
WILLIAM URY: Your what?

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.305
AUDIENCE: Internal teams.

00:06:03.305 --> 00:06:04.471
WILLIAM URY: Internal teams.

00:06:04.471 --> 00:06:06.170
Right.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.825
AUDIENCE: CMOs.

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:07.950
WILLIAM URY: What was that?

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.574
AUDIENCE: CMOs.

00:06:08.574 --> 00:06:10.340
WILLIAM URY: CMOs, OK.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.020
CMOs.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.972
Who else?

00:06:11.972 --> 00:06:12.930
AUDIENCE: My teenagers.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.096
WILLIAM URY: Your teenagers.

00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:15.260
OK.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.600
So it's at home, it's at work.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.800
Now if you were to kind of
just make a ballpark estimate

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.392
of how much of your time
do you spend broadly

00:06:24.392 --> 00:06:25.850
speaking in the
course of your day,

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.780
engaged in the process of back
and forth communication, trying

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.210
to reach agreement with
your teenagers, your spouse,

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.380
your colleagues, your clients,
your suppliers, your boss,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.152
the internal
partners, and so on?

00:06:39.152 --> 00:06:40.610
What percentage of
your time do you

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.810
think it would be, what
fraction of the time if you

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.385
had to give it a
certain percentage?

00:06:44.385 --> 00:06:45.508
What would you say?

00:06:45.508 --> 00:06:46.384
AUDIENCE: About half.

00:06:46.384 --> 00:06:46.822
AUDIENCE: Half.

00:06:46.822 --> 00:06:47.700
WILLIAM URY: Half.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.100
Yeah.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.760
How many would agree with that?

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.200
It's at least half?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:53.700
OK.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.070
So we don't always think of
it formally as negotiation,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.000
but in the informal sense,
we're engaged in this process

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.360
from the time we get up in
the morning with our spouse,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.760
teenagers, kids, and so on to
the time we go to bed at night.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.270
And so let me just ask you
a couple other questions.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:18.240
I mean, would you
say, maybe looking

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.000
at the past, say, five or 10
years of your work career,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.585
would you say that
the amount of time

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:26.140
that you spend negotiating,
has it stayed pretty steady?

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:27.690
Does it go down
over time as you get

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.830
maybe more authority
in your job?

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.322
Or does it go up?

00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:33.691
What would you say?

00:07:33.691 --> 00:07:34.232
AUDIENCE: Up.

00:07:34.232 --> 00:07:36.092
WILLIAM URY: How many
say it's going up?

00:07:36.092 --> 00:07:37.100
OK, almost all of you.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.910
So that's the negotiation
revolution in form.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.410
And I've travelled
around the world,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.426
and every country around the
world I see this revolution

00:07:45.426 --> 00:07:47.550
taking place in the way in
which we make decisions.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.810
More and more negotiation.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:50.915
And--

00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:52.070
AUDIENCE: Even in Russia?

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.236
WILLIAM URY: Even in Russia.

00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:53.800
[LAUGHS]

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.480
Even in Russia.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.626
A little slower in Russia,
but even in Russia.

00:07:57.626 --> 00:07:58.500
Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:02.800
Well, you know, I
used to go to Russia

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.990
back in the days
of the Cold War.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:10.820
And even though change
has been slow sometimes,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.474
it's changed a lot
since those days.

00:08:12.474 --> 00:08:14.140
There's a lot more
negotiation going on.

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:18.710
In fact, "Getting to Yes,"
I remember when it first

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.810
came out, there were
some Russian friends

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:25.150
who wanted to translate
it into Russian,

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.311
but they thought
negotiation was subversive.

00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:28.810
They didn't want
to teach people how

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.630
to negotiate because then they
would challenge authority.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.480
But now there are
Russian editions of it.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.860
So one thing that I think might
be useful just for the next,

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.799
you know, we've got
this hour together here,

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.560
is if you have in
mind at least one

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.420
challenging negotiation that
you're currently facing,

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.290
something, it might
be just for yourself.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.880
It might be with
your teenager or it

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.840
might be with your
customer, it might

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.340
be an internal negotiation
with a CMO, or whoever it is,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.650
have in mind some
challenging negotiation, OK?

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.945
Everyone got at
least one in mind?

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.570
So let me ask you a
quick question then

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.300
about the one you just selected.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.860
There are maybe two types of
negotiations we engage in,

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.480
the internal negotiations
inside the organization

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.360
with our colleagues
and coworkers

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.400
and so on, and then there are
the external negotiations,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.276
let's say, with clients,
for example, or suppliers.

00:09:24.276 --> 00:09:25.900
How many of you, just
out of curiosity,

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.420
have just selected an
external situation?

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:29.251
External.

00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:29.750
OK?

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.620
How many of you selected
an internal situation?

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.160
OK.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.970
And just out of
curiosity, if you

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:42.170
had to say which one was
harder, the negotiation inside

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.884
or the negotiation
outside, if you

00:09:43.884 --> 00:09:45.800
had to just make a broad
generalization, which

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.100
personally do you
find more challenging?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.622
Internal negotiations
or external?

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:50.413
AUDIENCE: Internal.

00:09:50.413 --> 00:09:51.214
AUDIENCE: Internal.

00:09:51.214 --> 00:09:52.922
WILLIAM URY: How many
would say external?

00:09:52.922 --> 00:09:54.190
OK.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:56.000
How many would say internal?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.510
OK.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:57.510
Great.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.270
I mean, obviously both
can be challenging.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.360
But the great majority
of hands go up

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.840
on internal, which is
interesting that oftentimes we

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.306
experience the more challenging
negotiations as being

00:10:08.306 --> 00:10:10.430
the ones with the people
with whom supposedly we're

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.763
on the same team working for
the same mission, whatever,

00:10:12.763 --> 00:10:16.220
but those are often
more challenging.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.320
Well over the years, my
passion over the years

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.840
has been helping people
get to yes, individuals,

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.610
organizations, societies, as
Brian was mentioning, even

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.470
in war-like situations.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:32.420
And the thing that sort of
struck me over the years

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:37.220
is when my colleagues and
I wrote "Getting to Yes,"

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.760
the most frequent question
we got for a while was, yeah,

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.020
but how do you get to
yes with the people who

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.280
don't want to get
to yes, you know?

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.900
How do you deal
with people who are

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.850
kind of rigid and
they're intransigent

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.900
or they're using dirty tricks,
or all kinds of things?

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.010
So I kind of specialized
in that for a long time.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:53.710
In fact, my follow
on book was a book

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.010
called "Getting Past No,"
which was negotiating

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.450
with difficult
people, negotiating

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.380
in difficult situations.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:05.120
But over the years I began to
realize that in fact, perhaps

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.070
the most difficult
person we have

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.570
to deal with in a negotiation,
in the process of getting

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.030
to yes, be it with
our teenagers,

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:15.570
our spouses, our
coworkers, or our clients,

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.750
is not what we think it is.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.170
It's not just the
difficult person

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.260
on the other side of
the table, as difficult

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.070
as that person can be.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.730
Actually the biggest
obstacle to us

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.330
getting what we want in
negotiation, curiously enough,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.160
is right here.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.090
It's ourselves.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.340
It's the person on
this side of the table.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.190
It's the person we
look at in the mirror.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:39.870
Because after all, what
could be more internal?

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.839
It feels to me like the more
internal the negotiation goes,

00:11:42.839 --> 00:11:43.880
the more difficult it is.

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.170
What could be more
internal than ourselves?

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.107
And so our biggest
opponent actually,

00:11:48.107 --> 00:11:50.190
the person who's going to
give us the most trouble

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.179
often is the person we're
looking at in the mirror.

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:54.595
I think it was
Teddy Roosevelt who

00:11:54.595 --> 00:11:56.140
once said, if you
could kick in the pants

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.750
the person who's going to give
you the most trouble that day,

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.060
you wouldn't sit for a month.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.360
And so to me, that
obstacle can also

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.760
become our biggest opportunity.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.440
If we can turn our
own inner opponent,

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.070
as it were, into
our biggest ally.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:18.100
And that's really the subject
of this book, my newest book,

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.680
which is "Getting to Yes with
Yourself and Other Worthy

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.780
Opponents."

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.566
And where it lies
is to me it lies

00:12:26.566 --> 00:12:31.020
in our very understandable,
very natural human tendency

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.340
to react.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.020
In other words, to
act without thinking.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.070
I mean, negotiation is supposed
to be goal oriented behavior.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:40.780
You're looking rationally
to advance your objective.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.980
But oftentimes our own emotions,
for example, get in the way.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.360
As Ambrose Bierce
one said, when angry,

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.730
you will make the best
speech you will ever regret.

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.460
And it happens a lot these days.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.420
And so the first and most
important negotiation

00:12:59.420 --> 00:12:59.960
starts within.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.751
And I want to talk a
little bit about that,

00:13:01.751 --> 00:13:04.202
but then I don't want
to go too deep into this

00:13:04.202 --> 00:13:05.660
without really
drawing you out more

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.030
and getting into
your own situations.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.550
But just to highlight a couple
of points here from this.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:16.606
To me, interestingly,
the foundation

00:13:16.606 --> 00:13:21.620
of being able to get
to yes with yourself

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:25.170
is the ability to step
back from the situation.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.992
And I like to use the
metaphor going to the balcony.

00:13:28.992 --> 00:13:30.450
It's almost like
you're negotiating

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.370
with the other
person on a stage.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.320
Part of your mind goes to a
mental or emotional balcony

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.720
overlooking that
stage where it's

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.460
a place of calm, of perspective,
of self-control, where you

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.310
above all can keep
your eyes on the prize.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.030
And for example,
these days there's

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.940
so much going on in our lives.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:56.410
We get texts, we get
emails, we get calls.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.520
There's so much information
flooding in all the time.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.314
And let's imagine you get an
email, an internal message

00:14:04.314 --> 00:14:05.730
from your organization,
and you've

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.354
been left out of an
important decision.

00:14:07.354 --> 00:14:08.912
And you feel irritated.

00:14:08.912 --> 00:14:09.745
You feel frustrated.

00:14:09.745 --> 00:14:10.411
You feel pissed.

00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:15.070
So it's very tempting to just
kind of compose a reply, right?

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.680
And then you get
the satisfaction

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.360
of hitting the Reply
button, but you don't just

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.235
hit the Reply button.

00:14:19.235 --> 00:14:21.080
You hit the Reply
All button and then

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:22.700
it goes to the
entire organization.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:28.030
And there's a button
on that screen

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.410
sometimes, or at
least it used to be,

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.280
which is the Save As
Draft button, you know?

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.610
That's the button that
very rarely gets used.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.350
And you compose it, you
get it out of your system,

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.320
you hit Save As Draft.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.470
That's the balcony button.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.380
And you do whatever
you-- everyone

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.250
has their favorite techniques
for going to the balcony.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:50.710
They might be go for a workout,
go have a cup of coffee

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.380
with a friend, whatever.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:53.970
Take a night to sleep on it.

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.085
Just take a few
minutes by yourself.

00:14:56.085 --> 00:14:59.160
Whatever your technique is for
going to that balcony, you're

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.246
going to come back, look at
that message, that email,

00:15:02.246 --> 00:15:03.870
and you're going to
say, wait a minute.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:07.980
Is this really going to advance
my interests in the situation?

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.110
And you're going to
hit the Delete button,

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.860
and then either going
to pick up the phone

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.120
and call the person,
or even better

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.020
get together with them
if you can do that.

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.650
Because when you're going to
resolve a difference like that,

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.920
it's much easier to do
that with more ability

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.460
to communicate with
a voice, for example,

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.970
than it is through an email.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.950
Emails lend themselves very
much to miscommunication.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.250
They're great for
information transfer,

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:33.780
but not so good for handling
delicate or possibly

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:36.720
emotionally sensitive issues.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.700
So that's kind of
going to the balcony.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.070
You know, if I think about
my own personal experience--

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.040
Brian was asking me
to tell a story too

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.220
about my own personal
experience-- some years ago,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:51.410
I was involved as a third party
in the country of Venezuela.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.135
And it was at a time when
Venezuela, there were,

00:15:55.135 --> 00:15:56.954
like, a million
people on the streets

00:15:56.954 --> 00:15:58.870
calling for the downfall
of the president, who

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.980
was then Hugo Chavez.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:04.350
And about a million
people on the streets

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.700
wanting to support him.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.630
And international
observers worried

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.770
that it might turn
into a civil war.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.380
And I had been asked
by President Carter

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:15.690
to go down and meet with both
parties and talk to them.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.719
And anyway, I had a number
of meetings with both sides.

00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:20.510
I want to talk about
one particular meeting

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.680
I had with President Chavez.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.530
He liked to meet at night,
so we had made a meeting

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.316
at the presidential
palace at 9:00 PM.

00:16:29.316 --> 00:16:30.840
He was a little bit late.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.164
10:00 PM, 11:00 PM.

00:16:32.164 --> 00:16:33.580
Finally at midnight
I'm ushered in

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.370
to see the president expecting
to find him all alone.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:40.990
Instead I find him surrounded
by his entire cabinet.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.780
And he kind pulls up a
seat, says, here Bill.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:44.870
Have a seat here.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.062
And tell me.

00:16:46.062 --> 00:16:47.520
What do you think
of the situation.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.570
What's your impression?

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:50.420
And how are we doing?

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.920
And I said, you
know, Mr. President,

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.590
I've been talking to some
of your ministers here,

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:55.090
I've been talking
to the opposition.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:59.370
And it seems to me we're
making some progress.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:01.550
He said, what do
you mean, progress?

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.185
Are you blind?

00:17:02.185 --> 00:17:03.403
Are you naive?

00:17:03.403 --> 00:17:04.319
What are you, foolish?

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.210
You're not seeing the dirty
tricks the other side,

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:08.001
those traitors on the
other side are up to?

00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:10.859
He proceeded to get furious
and he leaned in very close

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:14.200
to my face and proceeded
to yell at me for, I'd say,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.060
approximately 30 minutes.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.651
Now you put yourself in
my shoes for a moment.

00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:22.359
I'm thinking, well,
hey, that's not true.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.130
We're not foolish.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:24.171
And he's not seeing this.

00:17:24.171 --> 00:17:25.829
And I'm wanting
to defend myself.

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:30.600
But I was able to go to
the balcony for a moment.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.090
And actually one
little technique

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.340
that helped me go the
balcony was a friend of mine

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.370
a few months earlier
had said, you know Bill,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.890
if you're ever in
a tough situation,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.100
he said, pinch the
palm of your hand.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.137
And I said, Arnon, why would
I pinch the palm of my hand?

00:17:45.137 --> 00:17:47.220
And he said, well, because
that'll keep you alert.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.440
And maybe it'll keep
you a little more alert.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.080
So at that moment,
for whatever reason,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.871
I remembered the pinch
the palm of my hand.

00:17:53.871 --> 00:17:56.580
And because at
that mind, in just

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.590
in terms of thinking about
it, I was thinking, wow, two

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.710
years of work all down
the drain, you know?

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.120
You go through all these things.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.450
And I'm sure, tough
customer calls sometimes,

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.390
you can literally,
you know, you think

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:14.930
you might be losing that
important customer, and so on.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:18.400
So at that moment I just was
able to go to the balcony,

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.870
not react.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:21.260
Because if I had
reacted, I mean,

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.180
President Chavez was famous
for giving eight hour speeches.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.880
I mean, the conversation
could go way off the rails.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.480
And that might
have been the end.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.710
But by not reacting, by
going to the balcony,

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:37.310
by listening instead, I was able
to listen, just kind of clear

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:39.800
my mind because I was
able to observe myself

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.740
from the balcony,
just note the thoughts

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.531
and the feelings that
are going through me.

00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:45.400
Just, OK, that's fine.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.677
Now let me pay attention
to President Chavez

00:18:47.677 --> 00:18:49.260
and just give attention
to him and try

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.060
and figure out what
was going on for him.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.340
I mean, why was
he yelling at me?

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.090
What was going on?

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:57.515
Was this some kind of show
for the cabinet and so on?

00:18:57.515 --> 00:18:59.740
What was irritating him so much?

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:04.175
And sure enough, by
just listening to them,

00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:07.780
he could have gone on forever,
but since I wasn't reacting,

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.340
after about a half
an hour he started

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.050
to run a little
bit how the steam.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:12.320
Even he did.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.570
And then I saw, if you
just watch body language,

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.380
I saw his shoulders
sink a little bit.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.670
And in a very weary tone
of voice he said to me,

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.620
so Ury, what should I do?

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.820
That is the sound of
a human mind opening.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.327
Before that, if
someone's angry with you,

00:19:29.327 --> 00:19:31.410
like it's your spouse,
your teenager, or whatever,

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.420
it's very hard to use
reason with someone

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.860
who's in a highly
emotional state of mind.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.160
It's like beating your
head against a stone wall.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.860
But by listening,
he kind of went

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.390
into a different emotional
phase of kind of like, OK.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.480
So what should I do?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.310
And I said, Mr. President,
this is December.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.080
Christmas is coming up.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.130
Last Christmas all the
festivities around the country

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.090
were canceled.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.700
No one had any fun
because of this conflict.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.960
Why don't you just
declare a truce?

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.350
Give everyone a chance to go
to the balcony for a few weeks.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.030
Enjoy the family
with their holidays,

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.530
and maybe when they come
back in January everyone

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.472
will be in a better
mood to listen and see

00:20:10.472 --> 00:20:11.680
if we can make some progress.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.310
He said, oh, that's
a great idea.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.732
I'm going to propose
that in my next speech.

00:20:15.732 --> 00:20:17.440
And then his mood had
completely shifted.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.180
He said, you know,
and over Christmas, I

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.660
think I'd like you
to come with me

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.920
and actually see
around the country.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.920
And you come with me.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.795
And then he said, for
a moment he said, wait.

00:20:25.795 --> 00:20:27.570
If you're always
with me, maybe you

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.119
won't be seen as
a neutral anymore.

00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:30.410
But he said, that's no problem.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:31.550
I'll give you a disguise.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.360
Complete shift.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.150
How?

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:43.080
Because I had been able to get
to yes in a sense with myself,

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:47.949
restrain my own natural
reaction to defend myself.

00:20:47.949 --> 00:20:49.490
You know, it would
have gotten no use

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.180
to get into an argument with
the president of Venezuela.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.570
I was able to go to
the balcony and then

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.340
I was able to shift
that situation.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.070
Just one example.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.450
Let me ask you, just if
I may, what techniques

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:07.560
you use to go to the balcony
in your very busy hectic lives,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.820
either work or personal.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.320
What do you do to
go to the balcony?

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:10.820
Anybody?

00:21:13.354 --> 00:21:14.270
AUDIENCE: Sleep on it.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:15.478
WILLIAM URY: You sleep on it.

00:21:15.478 --> 00:21:16.530
OK.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.530
AUDIENCE: Go for a walk.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.180
WILLIAM URY: Go for a walk.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:18.980
AUDIENCE: Fresh air.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.938
WILLIAM URY: Fresh air.

00:21:19.938 --> 00:21:20.881
Yeah.

00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:21.805
Anything else?

00:21:21.805 --> 00:21:23.889
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] draft
emails, but save them.

00:21:23.889 --> 00:21:26.221
WILLIAM URY: You draft emails
and then save them, right?

00:21:26.221 --> 00:21:26.960
Save As Draft.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.910
OK.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.160
AUDIENCE: Talk to a colleague.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.790
WILLIAM URY: Talk
to a colleague.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.700
Yeah.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.390
Someone else can
be your balcony.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.120
OK.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.730
Good.

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:43.550
Let me, if I may, just
give you one more story,

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.580
and then I want to see
what's on your minds.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.531
And it'll open it up
to conversation here,

00:21:49.531 --> 00:21:51.280
and see what kind of
questions you've got.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.730
But this conversation that
I met with President Chavez

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.126
was 10, 12 years ago.

00:21:58.126 --> 00:22:00.000
But a more recent one
that I got involved in,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.770
which was a business
conversation,

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.900
was about a year,
year and a half ago.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.500
The wife and daughter
of a very prominent

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.610
Brazilian entrepreneur
got in touch with me.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.580
He was the founder of Latin
America's largest retailer,

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.410
really, and build up this
business from nothing.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:21.990
He was a billionaire.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:26.760
And he had sold
half of his company

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:32.420
to a French also
billionaire, president

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.220
of a very large
French conglomerate.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.420
And they'd worked
together for some years,

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.500
and then they'd
had a falling out.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.010
And so they're
fighting over control.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:46.910
And Abilio was the name
of the person I went see.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:51.094
And he was, like,
76 at the time.

00:22:51.094 --> 00:22:53.510
He was going to be chairman
of the board for another eight

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.550
years.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.610
Two and a half years
of just sheer battle.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.380
I mean, every lawyer
you could imagine.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.020
I mean, dozens and dozens
and dozens of lawyers,

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.520
arbitration suits, it
was all over the papers.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.370
I think the "Financial Times"
called it perhaps the biggest

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:13.420
cross-continental boardroom
showdown in recent history.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.820
And it was not just affecting
the immediate parties,

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.440
but their families, 150,000
employees of the company.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.470
It was even straining
Brazil-French commercial

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:25.030
relations.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.820
Anyway, so I sat
down with Abilio.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.110
I didn't know if I could
help, but I sat down with him

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:33.370
in his living room
there in Sao Paulo,

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.280
and I asked them
to tell me a story.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.610
And he told me the story.

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.365
And then I said, then
I realized, you know,

00:23:41.365 --> 00:23:43.620
there's always this negotiation
with the other side,

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.550
and that's extremely difficult.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.240
But as I was saying,
sometimes even more difficult

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.900
is the negotiation
inside ourself.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.570
And what I could
sense inside Abilio

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.800
was he wasn't sure whether he
wanted just continue to fight.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.920
Was a fighter naturally.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.670
You know, just fight and fight.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.490
Or did he really want
to reach an agreement?

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.125
And sometimes we're also torn
in a lot of these situations.

00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:06.900
What is it we want to do?

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.829
So I asked him, Abilio,
what do you want?

00:24:10.829 --> 00:24:11.620
How can I help you?

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.724
What do you really want here?

00:24:13.724 --> 00:24:15.140
And he had a ready
answer to that.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.390
And he said, OK, I want the
stock at a certain price,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.040
I want elimination of
the non-compete clause,

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.500
I want company real
estate, I want--

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.737
and he had named five
or six other things.

00:24:25.737 --> 00:24:27.570
He gave me a laundry
list of what he wanted.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:30.650
He was clear about
what he wanted.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.800
But to me, that's
just the beginning.

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.447
Because oftentimes, we
think we know what we want,

00:24:36.447 --> 00:24:38.030
but we don't know
what we really want.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:40.135
So I asked him,
but Abilio, you're

00:24:40.135 --> 00:24:41.260
a man who's got everything.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.580
You've got your
own private plane.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.030
You can fly everywhere
around the world.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.330
You've got your new family.

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.294
You've got everything.

00:24:46.294 --> 00:24:48.460
Is this is really what you
want to do with your life

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.030
is get involved in
the big dispute?

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.730
I mean, what do you really want?

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.410
What do you most want
in your life right now?

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.930
Anyway, he kind of struggled
with that question for a while,

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.670
but then after a bit
he finally said to me,

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.470
you know what I want?

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:04.780
I want my freedom.

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.420
Freedom.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.835
That's what I want.

00:25:06.835 --> 00:25:08.710
And I said, so what does
freedom mean to you?

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.610
And he says, well, it's freedom
to pursue my business dreams,

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.370
my business deals and so on.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:17.030
And I want free to spend
time with my family.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.180
So once we've gotten
down to that level,

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.810
and oftentimes that's what we
need to do inside ourselves.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.120
Ask ourselves, what is it
truly that's important to us?

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.160
What's the prize?

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.480
From the balcony
that's what we do.

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.497
Then it turned out
once it was clear,

00:25:33.497 --> 00:25:35.080
then I could ask a
follow on question.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.704
I could ask Abilio
the kind of question

00:25:36.704 --> 00:25:40.350
like, OK, so you really
want your freedom?

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.216
Who can give you that freedom?

00:25:42.216 --> 00:25:43.840
Who can give you that
sense of freedom,

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.381
the thing you most
want in the world?

00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:46.920
Who can give that to you?

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.699
Is it your adversary, the
former business partner?

00:25:50.699 --> 00:25:52.990
Is that the only person that
can give you your freedom?

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.130
You're a total hostage to him?

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.720
Or at least to
some extent can you

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.350
yourself give yourself
that sense of freedom?

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.350
And that kind of, like,
opened up a possibility.

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:03.460
He said, OK.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:06.160
Yeah, well maybe I can
give myself that freedom.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.130
So there was this kind of
psychological antecedent

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.510
there inside himself.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:14.810
He said, well, I could go
ahead and pursue business deals

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.100
regardless of what
this other guys doing.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.830
I can go spend time with
my family on a holiday.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.770
And he proceeded
to do those things.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:24.950
And paradoxically,
by doing that,

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.620
he was psychologically less
dependent on the other side.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.250
And it actually made
it easier for me

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.770
then when it came
to trying to find

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.630
a resolution with
the other side.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:39.880
And as it turned out, this
huge colossal, titanic struggle

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.940
that all these lawyers
were [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.050
I met with the
other side in Paris

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:47.924
on a Monday in a
restaurant there.

00:26:47.924 --> 00:26:49.590
And the representative
on the other side

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:50.780
said, so why are you here?

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.550
And I said, you know,
because life's too short.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.535
Life's too short for these
kinds of lose-lose struggles,

00:26:56.535 --> 00:26:57.910
because that's
what often happens

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.249
in battles is each
side's trying to win.

00:27:00.249 --> 00:27:01.290
It's a win-lose struggle.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:04.410
But in the end, what happens
is everyone ends up losing.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.870
And it's affecting everyone.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.985
So he said, so how
would you settle this?

00:27:09.985 --> 00:27:10.860
What's your proposal?

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.235
And I said, well, if we can
just agree on two principles,

00:27:13.235 --> 00:27:15.241
I think maybe we can
maybe make some progress.

00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:16.240
He said, what are those?

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.530
I said, freedom.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.910
Freedom for each individual.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:21.076
Let them go on with their
lives and we'll figure out

00:27:21.076 --> 00:27:23.370
a way to free them
from this struggle.

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:27.020
And dignity because
everyone wants respect.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.580
He said, so what
would that mean?

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.580
And he called me back in
his office the next day

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:31.750
and we looked at it.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.200
And on one piece of
paper we sat down,

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.460
what would be some terms that
would tangibly reflect freedom

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.230
for each individual and dignity?

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.500
That was on a Tuesday.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.200
By Friday we had both
men in a law office

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.470
in San Paulo signing a contract
resolving the whole dispute,

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:52.690
joint press
conference, they then

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:57.280
made a talk to all the employees
of the company together,

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.440
wished each other well in the
future, and it was all over.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.660
And that night, actually,
there was a dinner

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.040
held by my client for, I think
there were about 40 lawyers who

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.640
just arrived in Sao Paulo
for an arbitration lawsuit

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.765
and just from all over
the world, from New York,

00:28:13.765 --> 00:28:15.640
from Paris, from the
Middle East or whatever,

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.890
the best lawyers in the world.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:21.370
And they were out of
a job, as it were.

00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:26.550
So I'm just giving you as an
example that here again, seemed

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.640
like a very complicated
dispute, but it really

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.540
starts within us often.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.010
And so this new book of
mine is about how do we

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.480
get to yes with
ourselves in order

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.480
that we can get to
yes with others?

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.400
It's almost as if I've realized
that we've been negotiating--

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.260
these days, we
need all the tools

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.639
we can get in negotiation.

00:28:47.639 --> 00:28:49.430
And it's almost like
we've been negotiating

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.380
with one arm tied
behind our back.

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.710
Because we've just been
focused on outer influence.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.680
How do we influence
the other side?

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.260
And we've neglected,
sometimes, our ability

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.790
to influence ourselves
who, after all, is our best

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:03.120
instrument for
influencing others.

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.300
And so we can negotiate
with both arms together.

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.300
So that's the
essence of this book.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.970
But at this point
what I'd love to do

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.150
is just to see what's on your
minds in terms of negotiation.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.520
Any questions, any
kinds of subjects,

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.460
any kinds of things that
are giving you difficulty?

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.000
Think back to your
own situation.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.320
What makes them difficult?

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:24.540
Whether its customers,
whether it's teenagers,

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:28.310
or whether you want to talk
about world politics, anything.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.444
Yes ma'am?

00:29:29.444 --> 00:29:31.622
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
in each of these cases

00:29:31.622 --> 00:29:34.768
that there's a million people
around these individuals.

00:29:34.768 --> 00:29:37.188
So I guess my question
is, what do you

00:29:37.188 --> 00:29:42.512
do when you have a toxic person
or in arbitration [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:42.512 --> 00:29:43.990
have the numbers.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.865
How do you get
them-- how often do

00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:50.085
you see them influencing what's
riling up both sides, right?

00:29:50.085 --> 00:29:52.398
So if they're going into
it and you've got a person,

00:29:52.398 --> 00:29:54.549
you can get them alone,
get them talking,

00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:56.174
and the you can get
to this resolution.

00:29:56.174 --> 00:29:59.960
But when you've got these other
people sort of in their ear,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.743
how often do you need
to influence them,

00:30:01.743 --> 00:30:04.450
and what kind of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.260
WILLIAM URY: The
question was, what do you

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:09.990
do about toxic individuals
who may not be at the table

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:12.660
but are kind of poisoning
the well, right?

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.630
So one thing to think
about in negotiation

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.910
is what I like to think
about is there's not just one

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.970
table in the
negotiation to focus on.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.050
In other words,
you and the client

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:27.294
or you and the internal
colleague or whatever,

00:30:27.294 --> 00:30:28.710
always keep in
mind that there are

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.300
three tables in the negotiation.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.050
There's the table where you
and the other side are talking,

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.910
but there's the internal tables
on each side, the people you

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.080
have to go back to and
report to an agreement about.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.788
It might be your boss
or your colleagues,

00:30:42.788 --> 00:30:45.812
whoever, your family, and
the people they [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:45.812 --> 00:30:48.270
And essentially, that toxic
individual you're talking about

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.692
is often sitting at that
internal table as a spoiler.

00:30:51.692 --> 00:30:53.150
They're kind of
trying to block it.

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:57.890
And that's not uncommon
in any negotiation.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.930
Oftentimes, the real
problems in negotiations

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:03.470
aren't at the external table.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.480
It's at the two internal tables.

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.470
Those two internal
negotiations where

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.250
you need to pay
attention to just as much

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:12.820
as at what we think
of as the negotiation

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:14.440
with the other side.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.270
And so how do you disarm
that toxic person?

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:22.520
One is first of all, you can try
and find ways to talk to them,

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.620
find out what their
real concern is.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.170
What are they really
concerned about?

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.069
See if you can.

00:31:27.069 --> 00:31:27.860
And deal with that.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:30.870
If you can't do that then
you've got to think about,

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:36.150
how do you build kind
of a winning coalition

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:39.190
inside the other team that
they neutralize that person?

00:31:41.818 --> 00:31:44.330
But it's not uncommon at all.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:52.430
Right now, for example, well,
my very first negotiation--

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.040
because when I was just
starting off of this field,

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.177
I realized it's not
just in the books.

00:31:58.177 --> 00:32:00.010
You need to get out
there in the real world.

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:05.130
So I got a job working at
a coal mine in Kentucky

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.480
as Brian mentioned.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.720
And this was a situation
where the workforce was

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.745
going on strike
all the time, what

00:32:13.745 --> 00:32:18.610
were called wildcat strikes in
contravention of the contract.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.580
And tensions had
gotten really high

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.630
and there was a lot of anger.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:27.190
And when we got down, my
colleague and I got down there,

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.690
management and the union would
not even sit in the same room

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.306
together.

00:32:30.306 --> 00:32:31.430
That's how bad things were.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.870
So we just shuttled back and
forth for about six weeks

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:36.567
until we had some
proposals on the table

00:32:36.567 --> 00:32:37.900
that both sides were interested.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.320
And they came together and
they reached an agreement.

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.750
And there was maybe, I
don't know, maybe 10 people

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.120
representing labor and maybe 10
people representing management.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.851
And we had a whole big pow wow.

00:32:47.851 --> 00:32:50.100
It was like a peace agreement,
and everyone was happy.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.500
Except for one little
critical detail

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.580
which had to be ratified
by the workforce.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.700
There had to be a vote.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.490
And a week later the vote
took place, almost unanimous,

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.290
in rejecting the very agreement
that their leaders had just

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:04.020
negotiated.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.614
Why they rejected it is partly
because of what you're saying,

00:33:06.614 --> 00:33:09.030
because there were some toxic
individuals who were saying,

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:10.680
hey, don't trust management.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:14.010
Don't trust anything
that they do.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:16.760
Even though the agreement on
the surface and in reality

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.952
was much better for the union
than their existing agreement

00:33:21.952 --> 00:33:23.410
they thought, there
must be a trick

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.030
if management's
signing up to it.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:29.250
So then we had to go back to
square one and try to address

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.940
and deal with that toxicity,
deal with that skepticism,

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:34.270
and go back to square one.

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.520
So it was an everlasting
lesson for me

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:38.500
of dealing with
those situations.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.350
Please.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.840
AUDIENCE: This is maybe
slightly tangential,

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.660
but I think a lot of
people are probably

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.050
thinking about it here.

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.950
You may know that
Google has kind

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:51.110
of a long relationship
with Stuart Diamond who

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.970
comes and teaches these
courses that are always

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.870
sold out all over the place.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.790
And I've taken one
of his courses.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.180
I'm sure you'd want to
remain on the balcony

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.430
in talking about somebody
else who's in the same field,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:11.760
but I'm wondering, his
approach partly to me

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.710
seems to come out of sort of
more of the Stephen Covey type,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.990
more formulaic, seven
steps to this and that.

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:23.030
I mean, he distills his
formula onto a business card

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.409
which he hands out at
the end of the course.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:28.100
His slogan is getting more.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.790
I guess getting to yes was
not enough for a business guy.

00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:33.170
Always got to get more.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:37.730
Anyway, I'm wondering if
you would have any comments

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:42.705
on that kind of an approach
that he lays out-- as I say,

00:34:42.705 --> 00:34:44.455
I think a lot of people
here have taken it

00:34:44.455 --> 00:34:46.060
and are pretty
familiar with it--

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.840
how that kind of contrasts
with your interests.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.239
This whole negotiation
[INAUDIBLE] course is very rich

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.719
and has so many
roots in game theory

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:57.190
and all kinds of other things.

00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:59.360
And I'm just
singling this one out

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.340
because it's probably the
one that people at Google

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.360
are most familiar with.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.340
So I'm wondering if you'd
maybe have any contrast

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.830
or comparisons to your
own approach there.

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.580
WILLIAM URY: Yeah.

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:16.180
I wish I actually was more
familiar with his work,

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:20.370
but I'm familiar with
Stephen Covey's work,

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.070
and Steven Covey was
a friend of mine.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:30.250
And Covey actually, his
approach was very much congruent

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:31.900
with what we're talking about.

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:36.050
He very much believed in
what's called win-win.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:43.540
When "Getting to
Yes" first came out,

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.640
I feel like the bestselling
books about negotiation

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:51.980
had titles like,
"Winning by Intimidation"

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.613
and "Looking Out for #1."

00:35:54.613 --> 00:35:55.520
[LAUGHS]

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.250
I don't know if
you remember those.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:03.795
But "Getting to Yes"
proposed that, yes,

00:36:03.795 --> 00:36:06.770
you want to meet,
satisfy your interests.

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.670
The purpose of negotiation
is to satisfy your interests.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.900
But in ongoing
relationships, just

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.000
as you were mentioning
with game theory,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.740
if you're just playing the
prisoner's dilemma and game

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:26.070
theory, just one round, it
may be in your interests

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.810
to defect rather than cooperate.

00:36:28.810 --> 00:36:31.680
But in any kind of
ongoing relationship,

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.830
be it inside the
organization or be

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:37.600
it a longstanding relationship
with clients or suppliers

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.230
or whatever, it makes
sense to cooperate.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:42.620
It makes sense to cooperate.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.460
And so yes, you want to get
more, more for yourself,

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.930
but one of the best ways of
getting more for yourself

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.570
is actually to expand the
pie, to be creative and expand

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.180
the pie so there's more for
you and more for the customer,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.170
so that there's more for both.

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:08.442
And what "Getting
to Yes" proposes

00:37:08.442 --> 00:37:11.670
is that kind of approach
where essentially, you

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:14.410
look behind positions for,
what are the underlying needs?

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:17.870
What are the underlying
interests, your interests,

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:20.500
and the other side's interests?

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.815
You try to invent
options for mutual gain,

00:37:22.815 --> 00:37:25.620
you try to expand the pie.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.990
And where there are
serious differences,

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:33.300
you make use of
objective criteria

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.390
to decide, what's a fair
way to divide up the pie?

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:41.910
So for example, here,
actually, if you wouldn't mind,

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:45.882
let's do a two minute little
negotiation challenge here.

00:37:45.882 --> 00:37:47.590
If you wouldn't mind
just pick a partner,

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:49.820
the person sitting
right next to you.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.590
And let's do a
negotiation by email.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.305
This will take 30 seconds.

00:37:53.305 --> 00:37:54.980
OK, everyone pick a partner.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:58.060
And just decide who's
going to send the email

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:00.680
and who's going to
receive the email, OK?

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:02.060
So here's the situation.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:07.190
Let's imagine you
two are department

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.500
heads in the same organization.

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.220
Let's say maybe it's
Google, whatever.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.160
You're not co-located.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.993
One of you's here in
Cambridge, one of you's

00:38:12.993 --> 00:38:16.390
there in Mountain
View, wherever.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:17.690
And you have a common boss.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:22.990
And this year the idea's
been, we've got to cut costs.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.945
And so let's say by
the end of the year,

00:38:24.945 --> 00:38:27.420
your common boss comes to
both you and says, look,

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.260
you guys have done a great job.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.360
But Everyone's done a
great job cutting costs.

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.830
And I've got a little extra
money left in the budget.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:35.600
I don't know.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.570
What would be a little
bit significant?

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.622
Would it be, like,
$500,000 or $100,000?

00:38:40.622 --> 00:38:41.330
What would it be?

00:38:41.330 --> 00:38:42.620
AUDIENCE: $100,000.

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.289
WILLIAM URY: Give me a number.

00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:45.080
AUDIENCE: $500,000.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:45.996
WILLIAM URY: $500,000.

00:38:45.996 --> 00:38:47.451
OK, $500,000 left in the budget.

00:38:47.451 --> 00:38:49.700
And he says, I don't know
how to divide it between you

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.500
two different departments.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.390
You guys decide.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:56.830
So here are the rules, OK?

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.306
This is silent.

00:38:58.306 --> 00:39:00.180
Silence done by email,
so there's no talking.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.500
It's just very simple.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.685
The sender, you just
take out a piece of paper

00:39:04.685 --> 00:39:08.000
or if you don't have a piece
of paper, it's fine too.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.460
But just come up
with two numbers

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:14.300
adding up to 500
for your proposal

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.380
for how to divide
up the $500,000.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:22.970
Now it's not so simple to
just say $250,000 for each

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:26.100
because all your people at that
internal table we were talking

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:29.420
about are saying, hey, we
need all $500,000 you know,

00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.220
for sales department
or whatever it is.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.270
We deserve it all.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.770
You know?

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:34.470
That other team, they
don't deserve it.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.844
So you're under
a lot of pressure

00:39:35.844 --> 00:39:38.600
from your team to come back
with as close to $500,000

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.120
as possible.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.860
So you could put down
as if you were emailing,

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:45.400
$500,000 for my
department, zero for yours.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.710
You could put down
$475,000 for my department,

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:49.950
$25,000 for yours.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:52.570
$450,000 for my department,
and $50,000 for yours.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:53.500
There's no creativity.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.990
It's just two numbers here.

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.740
That's all you do.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.040
It just takes 10 seconds.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.850
That's your proposal.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:03.570
Then those of you receive that
number or those two numbers,

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:05.170
you have one decision to make.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.110
Very simple.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.760
Yes or no.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.691
Either you accept
it or you reject it.

00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:11.190
That's it.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.910
There's no follow
on negotiation.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.320
So if you say yes,
you're going to get

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.940
whatever the other
side's proposing.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.100
You're going to get
the $25,000, you're

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.391
going to get the $50,000,
you're going to get whatever,

00:40:20.391 --> 00:40:21.180
the $100,000.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:27.960
If, however, you say no, neither
department gets one penny.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.180
Because the boss has
said, look, if you two

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.570
can't reach
agreement, that's OK.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:33.510
I can find another
use for the money.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.690
So it's very simple.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:37.270
Just two sequential decisions.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.840
First person just picked two
numbers that add up to 500,

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.800
the second person
says yes or no,

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.880
and then we see the results, OK?

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.890
Takes 30 seconds.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.231
No follow on negotiation
and no talking

00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:52.105
unless you just have to
give me the proposal.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.600
Everyone had a chance to
go through the exercise?

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.040
OK, so it's just two
sequential decisions.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.600
Two numbers and then yes or no.

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.570
So I'm curious.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:13.040
How many of you-- have you
all had a chance to do it?

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.130
Yeah.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.395
How many of you by
curious said yes,

00:41:16.395 --> 00:41:18.020
accepted the proposal
you were offered?

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:19.200
OK?

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.920
How many of you
said no, rejected

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.446
the proposal you were offered?

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:23.940
OK, a few of you.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.280
So I'm kind of curious.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.440
We're curious about why other
people reject our proposals.

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.730
So let's just see if we
can learn something here.

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:32.610
So Brian, you
rejected the proposal

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.870
given to by Jonathan, right?

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.718
BRIAN: Yes.

00:41:36.718 --> 00:41:38.490
WILLIAM URY: What
proposal did he make?

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:39.770
BRIAN: $375,000 and $125,000.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.750
WILLIAM URY: $375,000, $125,000.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.380
So $375,000 for him, $125,000
for your department, right?

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.855
And why did you reject it?

00:41:47.855 --> 00:41:51.250
BRIAN: $125,000 was close
enough to zero for me.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:54.980
WILLIAM URY: $125,000, OK.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.450
So you have a very-- OK.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.160
So that's one.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.447
How about-- there were
some others who rejected?

00:42:01.447 --> 00:42:02.030
Yeah, you sir.

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.090
You rejected.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:04.570
AUDIENCE: $350,000 to $150,000.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.140
WILLIAM URY:
$350,000 to $150,000.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:06.800
AUDIENCE: It was fairness.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.716
WILLIAM URY: Fairness.

00:42:07.716 --> 00:42:08.250
Fairness.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:10.880
Now see, this is
really interesting,

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.960
because you have economically
rational decision

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.906
makers who are being offered
a decision between $125,000

00:42:18.906 --> 00:42:23.640
and zero or $150,000 and zero,
and what are they picking?

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.720
Zero.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.080
Why?

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:31.440
Because, as you heard,
perceived fairness

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.840
plays in a very important
role in negotiation.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:39.049
It's either people will
walk away from proposals--

00:42:39.049 --> 00:42:41.590
and we're going to be startled,
because after all, rationally

00:42:41.590 --> 00:42:44.870
speaking, it's in their
interest to accept.

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.690
How many of you, for
example, accepted

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:51.400
a proposal that was
less than $250,000?

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.660
How many accepted?

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.020
OK.

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.560
And when you accepted
that how many of you

00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:59.860
thought to yourself, OK,
I'm going to accept this,

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.910
but I'm going to remember this.

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.622
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.640
Right?

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.160
So that often happens.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.180
How many of you, despite what
I said, went ahead and just

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.860
proposed $250,000,
$250,000 a 50/50 split?

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.220
Anybody?

00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:15.740
You did.

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.756
And why'd you do that?

00:43:17.756 --> 00:43:19.130
AUDIENCE: You
know, in the spirit

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:23.155
of what you were talking about
earlier in terms of freedom

00:43:23.155 --> 00:43:26.630
is the fastest way to
have both parties--

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.340
WILLIAM URY: It was a fast way
to have both parties agree,

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:29.860
right?

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:30.491
OK.

00:43:30.491 --> 00:43:30.991
Yeah.

00:43:30.991 --> 00:43:32.245
OK.

00:43:32.245 --> 00:43:33.620
AUDIENCE: I would
have proposed--

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.090
WILLIAM URY: You would have
proposed-- what was that?

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:36.086
AUDIENCE: Actually, Bob
would have proposed,

00:43:36.086 --> 00:43:38.427
but I would have proposed
to give him $260,000,

00:43:38.427 --> 00:43:40.777
so that next year,
he'd have no excuse.

00:43:40.777 --> 00:43:41.860
WILLIAM URY: There you go.

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.564
OK.

00:43:43.564 --> 00:43:44.730
You know, it's interesting--

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.146
AUDIENCE: This year it looks
like you need more than I do.

00:43:47.146 --> 00:43:49.220
But next year [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.260
WILLIAM URY: He would have
proposed $260,000 he said,

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.550
just to cultivate goodwill.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.010
You know, I asked--

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.624
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] goodwill.

00:43:58.624 --> 00:43:59.832
WILLIAM URY: Then what is it?

00:43:59.832 --> 00:44:02.694
AUDIENCE: It's create the
expectation-- leverage.

00:44:02.694 --> 00:44:03.610
WILLIAM URY: Leverage.

00:44:03.610 --> 00:44:04.110
OK.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:05.570
[LAUGHS]

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:06.290
OK.

00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:07.665
Well, you know,
it's interesting,

00:44:07.665 --> 00:44:10.030
because I once ran
this exercise in,

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.760
I think it was Japan,
just asked that question.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.770
And there was a large
number of people

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:16.150
who adopted that strategy.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:19.341
But when I asked them
why, because in east Asia,

00:44:19.341 --> 00:44:21.340
they tend to believe in
long term relationships.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.423
They were investing in the
long term relationship.

00:44:23.423 --> 00:44:26.120
So for $10,000 extra,
they were investing more

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.017
in the relationship.

00:44:27.017 --> 00:44:28.850
So there are a lot of
ways to approach this,

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:34.880
but the thing is that since
perceived fairness plays

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.940
an enormously important role,
if the other side thinks

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:40.390
you're just trying to
win at their expense, A,

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:46.030
they're going to remember
it, B, or they sometimes

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:47.760
may refuse to deal.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.060
And as you just saw,
they'll just walk away.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.320
They'll accept zero
like Brian did.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:45:00.100
And so the question
is, how can you

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.230
create a situation
in the negotiation

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:05.820
that each side feels like they
got at least a fair shake?

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.860
And it's not just about the
person across the table,

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.880
because as the question
came from before about

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.130
the toxic people,
whoever you deal

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:15.785
with has to go back to their
constituency, to their people.

00:45:15.785 --> 00:45:17.160
In this particular
case, you have

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.600
to go back to your department.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:24.790
They say, how come you
agreed to $100,000?

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.820
They're screwing us.

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.020
So people need to have a logic.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:34.224
And that's why objective
criteria like--

00:45:34.224 --> 00:45:35.640
I didn't give you
any information,

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.660
but like, which is
the larger department?

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:40.010
Which department costs more?

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:44.940
Which department could use
the money better, and so on?

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.660
Some logical thing
so that each side,

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:51.135
there's some narrative
there that each side

00:45:51.135 --> 00:45:53.040
can use to say, OK.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.009
We both deferred to what's fair.

00:45:55.009 --> 00:45:56.550
And so this is just,
again, something

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.980
to think about in negotiations,
the psychology of fairness.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:04.710
Because it may seem
small, but it actually

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:07.894
makes a really
important difference,

00:46:07.894 --> 00:46:09.560
particularly in
long-term relationships.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.810
And this may be
also one reason why

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:20.790
is it that we experience
internal negotiations as more

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:23.670
difficult than external.

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:31.530
It's partly because there's
more emotion involved.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.940
There's a more
ongoing relationship.

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:38.000
Sometimes there's often a lot
more avoidance behavior inside.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.570
We don't want to deal
with difficult conflicts

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.030
because we're afraid
of long-term impact.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.370
Everyone's got their
little black book out.

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:47.680
So again, things to think about.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.930
I know there were some other
questions there, so yeah.

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:51.139
Please.

00:46:51.139 --> 00:46:53.430
AUDIENCE: I realize we could
spend another hour talking

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.971
about what I'm about to ask, so
say as little as you want to.

00:46:55.971 --> 00:46:58.840
But I'm curious for your take
on the situation in Washington

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:04.320
and the inability, it seems, for
the two sides to work together.

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.360
I just would love
your take on what

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.000
may be sort of
causing that or how

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.391
they could make their
negotiations better.

00:47:10.391 --> 00:47:11.890
And actually, in
light of your book,

00:47:11.890 --> 00:47:14.750
I wondered if maybe the
Republican party now feels

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.440
a little bit better
with themselves now

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.100
having majorities
in both houses,

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.500
and maybe that
helps [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:20.540
I don't know.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.290
WILLIAM URY: Sure.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.300
There's been this
stalemate in Washington.

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.130
I mean, it seems like both
parties have been busy

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:32.725
getting to no rather
than getting to yes

00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:34.540
for the last six years.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:42.540
And certainly it's challenging,
even for the next two years.

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:46.240
But to me, it's
a classic example

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:50.100
of the logic of each
side trying to win

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.200
and the end is
they're a stalemate.

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.440
Both sides end up losing.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:56.520
And actually in
these situations it's

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.460
lose-lose-lose because the
American people, our country

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:00.220
loses.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:05.500
Our ability to work
together to build

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.400
a country with good
infrastructure,

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:12.035
with decent pay for people,
with opportunity for everyone,

00:48:12.035 --> 00:48:13.946
that's suffered a
lot in this process,

00:48:13.946 --> 00:48:15.570
as well as our ability
to work together

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:21.620
to solve global problems be
it climate change or anything.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:25.770
And so we've paid
a huge cost for it.

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.375
Essentially they've been playing
a game of an eye for an eye

00:48:28.375 --> 00:48:30.010
and we all go blind.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:36.630
And so how do you change that?

00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:39.250
It's partly process like
things we're talking about.

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:41.620
It's also partly systemic.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.310
I had the opportunity
a number of years

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:47.610
ago to be a facilitator
at what was billed

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:51.140
as a bipartisan
congressional retreat.

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.780
It was held in
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.488
There were about 200
members of Congress.

00:48:54.488 --> 00:48:58.450
About 100 Republicans, 100
Democrats with their spouses

00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:59.280
and so on.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.404
And it was interesting to
me that when you actually

00:49:01.404 --> 00:49:05.520
got people together, first of
all, we asked them questions.

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.900
We broke them to small groups.

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.110
Let's say we had maybe four,
each group per conversation

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.140
we had four congressman
from each side, about eight.

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:17.510
But I asked them,
what's this like?

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:19.930
Why'd you go into politics
in the first place?

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.100
And what's the toll of
this kind of conflict?

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.600
And it was interesting,
particularly

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.140
hearing from them and their
spouses of just how unpleasant

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.300
and how contrary to
whatever they'd hoped to do.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.550
Because you spend a
lot of time trying

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:37.480
to get into Congress, and then
you can do nothing basically.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.370
It's frustrating.

00:49:38.370 --> 00:49:40.140
And it was interesting,
a lot of them

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.580
said to me that they'd spent
more time visiting with people

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.660
across the aisle
on the train ride

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:50.651
from DC, because we were all
on one train that got hired up

00:49:50.651 --> 00:49:53.150
to Hershey, Pennsylvania, than
they had in the previous four

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:54.660
years.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:59.750
So to me it's partly about
breaking down those walls.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:03.140
But once they got
talking with each other,

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.670
I could really see there
was real potential.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.090
One of the problems is
that in the old days,

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:10.860
or what seems like
the old days when

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.245
there was more kind of
collaboration, cooperation,

00:50:13.245 --> 00:50:16.300
it was partly because there were
lot of informal relationships

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.390
that existed, partly
because people

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:20.760
used to live more in Washington.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.760
Now they live more in
their own districts

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.040
and they fly back
every Friday night.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.275
When they used to
live in Washington,

00:50:30.275 --> 00:50:32.750
their kids went to the
same schools, you know?

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:34.760
The Little League
or whatever it was.

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.786
They got together.

00:50:36.786 --> 00:50:41.245
And so one thing I've
found is that informal time

00:50:41.245 --> 00:50:43.870
where you can have cross-cutting
relationships that aren't just

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:47.430
that you're a Democrat and
that you're a Republican can

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.390
kind of humanize the situation.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:52.300
Because right now it's
descended into a lot

00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:55.070
of blaming, a lot
of finger pointing.

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:58.230
And this is where it goes back
to getting to yes with yourself

00:50:58.230 --> 00:51:04.600
which is more about, OK, taking
responsibility for yourself.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:09.386
I'd love to see people
say-- like two spouses.

00:51:09.386 --> 00:51:12.010
You can blame each other or you
can say, look, I'm responsible.

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:14.835
I'm 100% responsible
for our relationship.

00:51:14.835 --> 00:51:16.915
And then other person's
100% responsible

00:51:16.915 --> 00:51:17.790
for the relationship.

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:20.520
So the Democrats
are 100% responsible

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.080
for the-- instead
of just saying,

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.670
oh, it's all the
Republican's fault.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:26.200
Or the Republicans are
100% responsible for what's

00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:26.750
going on.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.210
And just a different modality.

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:33.840
And it may seem hard, but
I've seen many examples

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:40.530
of bipartisan cooperation,
starting with Ted Kennedy.

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:44.470
I mean, for example, he
was a classic, you know,

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:47.050
liberal battler, but he also
knew how to build bridges.

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:49.890
He always worked
with Republicans.

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:50.820
It's been done before.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:53.120
It can be done again.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.580
And I'm hoping, back to
your question, that now,

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.050
because of what you
said, the Republicans,

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:02.130
now that they control
both houses of Congress,

00:52:02.130 --> 00:52:04.590
they're under a little
pressure to deliver

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:07.120
because they've got to deliver.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:09.330
They're not just the
minority party anymore.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:11.720
So they've got to deliver.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:12.900
And they want to deliver.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.870
And President Obama also,
he wants to deliver too.

00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:19.810
He's got two years left
to accomplish his legacy.

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:23.040
And so I'd say there's
an incentive now

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:28.160
if they can learn these methods
of getting to yes, which

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.300
is instead of
attacking each other,

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:31.620
attack the problem together.

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:35.577
Sit down, try and figure
out what the incentives are.

00:52:35.577 --> 00:52:38.035
That little exercise we just
did about perceived injustice,

00:52:38.035 --> 00:52:39.580
there's a lot of that going on.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.000
When I talk to Democrats
and Republicans they think,

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.759
oh, they stung us there.

00:52:43.759 --> 00:52:45.050
We're going to sting them back.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:46.320
That kind of gotcha game.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.800
Everyone's got
their black books.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.900
We've got to learn
to get beyond that.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.150
BRIAN: OK, it was great, Bill.

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.930
Thank so much for coming.

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:53.830
WILLIAM URY: It was
my pleasure, Brian.

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:54.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:54.430
BRIAN: Yep.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:55.513
WILLIAM URY: It was great.

00:52:55.513 --> 00:52:56.580
Yep, my pleasure.
