00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.790
Okay Michael, so here's this theorem that

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.340
you, you so desperately wanted. You ready?

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.130
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.905
&gt;&gt; I'm going to read it to you, because you can't read. In a two player

00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:15.500
zero-sum deterministic game of perfect information, minimax equals maximin.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.380
&gt;&gt; Alright you told us what minimax was,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.640
but you didn't tell us what maximin was.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.270
&gt;&gt; Well maximin is like minimax, except the

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.834
other way around. So a is trying to. [LAUGH]

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:25.350
&gt;&gt; You know, one side is trying to minimize

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.430
the maximum, the other side is trying to maximize the minimum.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.540
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.920
&gt;&gt; It's exactly what we described before, just depends upon whether you're

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.790
looking at it from a's point of view or b's point of view.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.640
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see, like, which, do you choose

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.440
a column first or do you choose a row first?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.200
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so whether you go a first followed by b,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.780
or b first followed by a. You're end, going to end up

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.180
in the same, with the same result. And that, more importantly,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.390
or at least as important, there always exists an optimal pure

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.360
strategy for each player. In other words, you can solve those

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.980
games and you know what the answer is. Once you write down

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.280
the matrix. You just do Minimax, or you do Maximin and you

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.160
end up with the proper answer. And now you know what the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.820
optimal players would do. Now there is a subtlety here which

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.020
I got it a little bit in the previous slide, when I

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.500
talked about rational agents. And what we're sort of assuming in everything

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.840
that we discuss here is that people are always trying to maximize

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.500
their rewards, okay? So we define the, the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.690
reinforcement learning problem that way. That my goal is

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.170
to find a policy that maximizes my long

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.520
term expected reward. You know so I'm trying to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.680
find, to get the best reward that I

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.160
can. And what you're assuming here is that everyone

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.060
else is doing the same thing and they're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.440
assuming that everyone else is doing the same thing.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.990
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.180
&gt;&gt; DOes that make sense?

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.300
&gt;&gt; It does thought I'm a little bit stuck on this

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.920
word optimal at the moment. Right. Well, that's what I'm trying

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.200
to get at actually. That optimal here really means I'm

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.850
maximizing the reward that I can get, and I'm assuming everyone

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.100
else is doing the same thing. And I'm, furthermore, I'm assuming

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.960
that they're assuming that everyone else is doing the same thing.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.850
&gt;&gt; So, so I guess I'm wondering whether. Whether this theroem is

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.650
vaccus in a sense that are we defining optimal to be mini max.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.880
&gt;&gt; What we're defining optimal to be, I think.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.720
So that's a good questino. I think I would unroll the vaccus one level by saying

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.580
this. Optimal here, basically has to be optimal

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.100
in respect to what? And the respect of

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.130
what here is the underlying assumption that everyone

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.090
is trying to maximize their rewards. And that

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.980
everyone knows this. So, in a world where

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.920
you have perfect information. It's zero-sum. Then, the strategy

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.880
of Minimax and Maximin give you the same answer.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.660
And that furthermore there is always some place where the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.440
column and the row cross, the best column and the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.960
best row cross. And that is always going to be

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.730
the solution to that particular game. Now, if we weren't

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.190
in a two-player zero-sum deterministic game of perfect information, that

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.660
might not be the case. But in a case where

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.410
we're in this sort of simplest version, where everyone's being.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.600
Rational, that is, optimal, that is, trying to maximize their, their

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.830
own reward. And assuming everyone else is maximizing their own reward, this

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.260
is the right thing to do. Now, I've got a little

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.030
weasel word here as well which we're going to get to in

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.490
a moment which is this notion not just of a strategy

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.600
but of a pure strategy. [INAUDIBLE] There's a reason why we have

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.480
notions of pure strategies because in the end as we get

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.950
more complicated we're going to have to do it with impure strategies.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.100
&gt;&gt; Mmm.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.650
&gt;&gt; Okay, but are you with me so far?

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.720
&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.930
&gt;&gt; So basically all that stuff we did in AI with game trees and search

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.613
is kind of what you would expect people to do if they knew everything. [LAUGH]

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:37.630
&gt;&gt; So, So, I feel like I could prove this theorum in the case of trees

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.770
because you just prop, you just kind of

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.260
commute values from leaves up to the root.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.220
&gt;&gt; And, it, it doesn't matter. There is no notion of who goes first or

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.280
who goes second. So there's just going to be

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.130
one answer, to that process. It's not obvious

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.890
to me, how to show it, if you, once you've. Turn the tree into a matrix, that

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.090
that matrix, I guess because it captures the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.810
same information, it ought to be the case that

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.690
this is still true, but like, I'd have to kind of sit down and think it through.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.320
&gt;&gt; No, and it's, so, so, to help you

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.730
think it through, I guess what I would suggest is

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.700
if you have the matrix, you can create a

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.370
tree that's consistent with it. Because every row and every

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.410
column represents a strategy. You don't know what

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.029
that strategy is, but you can, since it's

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.880
a finite matrix. You can construct a tree

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.630
that is consistant with that major. In fact, possibly

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.860
an infinate number of them, I'm not sure,

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.020
but you can certainly construct at least one that

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.540
is consistent with it. And then once you

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.732
have the tree you just do what you said.

00:04:28.732 --> 00:04:29.232
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:30.840
&gt;&gt; Alright, good. So we've got this

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.760
fundamental result and now what we're going to

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.710
do is we're going to try to be a bit more interesting. But it

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.390
is important to go through this because now we've

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.042
got some basic vocabulary and some basic building blocks okay?

00:04:41.042 --> 00:04:41.880
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.178
&gt;&gt; Alright.
