MALE SPEAKER: Our
presenter today

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.750
at Google Talks--
Annalee Newitz,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.920
who is the founding editor
of the web site IO9.com.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.800
I am from Venezuela.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.830
I see it in Venezuela.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.230
I have friends in Korea
that see it in Venezuela.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.540
And she just published
this fantastic book

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.630
that came out last
week in paperback.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.870
It is about scatter,
adapt, and remember.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.410
And she's going to take us
through a travel, a visit

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.700
through the universe
and through time,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.090
and tell us how we will survive.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.057
So with that, I
think Annalee, we

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:38.390
are going to enjoy this so much.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.070
So a big applause
to Annalee, please.

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:45.850
ANNALEE NEWITZ:
Thanks very much.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.470
So I'm a science
journalist, which

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.150
means that what
I do when I write

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.620
is look at science and
culture in context.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.340
That's usually how I
explain it to people

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.240
who wonder what that is.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.440
And sometimes, that
context can be quite small.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.010
Like, it might be the
context of a laboratory

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.530
where people have
made a discovery

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.690
and what it was like to do that
and how that discovery happened

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.030
and how they got funding.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.710
And sometimes the
context is a really big.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.260
Like, deep time, or what
happened on Earth over the past

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.040
3.5 billion years
since life evolved.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.380
My most recent book
project, as Jose mentioned,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.150
is about this much
larger context.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.120
And I have to admit that
my inspiration for writing

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.170
this book was not actually
a sense of being moved

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.940
by the vastness
of space and time,

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.390
but my interest in
disaster movies,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.230
and specifically
Godzilla movies.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.010
So you probably all know that
I'm pretty excited right now

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.420
because there's a new
Godzilla movie coming out.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.020
I was interested in the idea
of, as a science journalist,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.540
what would be the real life
equivalent of a disaster movie?

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.940
Like, a horrific disaster movie.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.740
Not one of these small scale
ones where a building burns

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.470
down or a town is
flooded, but something

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.630
where the entire planet is
being eaten by giant monsters.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.970
What would be the real life
scientific equivalent of that?

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.150
And it turns out
to be these events

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.320
that we call mass extinctions.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.410
And there have been
five of these events

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.630
already since life evolved on
Earth-- since multicellular

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.320
life evolved, I should say.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.510
And that's what I'm going
to talk to you about today

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.940
is what these events are, how
life made it through them,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.830
and what the future
of humanity is

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.110
as we face what really may
be a new mass extinction.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.690
And we can talk about
that maybe in Q and A,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.720
the evidence for and against
the next mass extinction.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.360
Basically, a mass extinction
is any time when 75% or more

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.600
of all species on
the planet die out

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.870
over a period of about a
million or 2 million years.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.970
Those numbers are huge,
but a million years

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.160
in geological time is
actually quite short.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.490
I have a little
illustration for you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.570
that I like of
geological time here.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.530
And what you can see
from this drawing

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.820
is that actually, when
geologists look back

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.890
at history-- and
oftentimes, they actually

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.400
will be looking at a cliff
face where they can see layers

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.280
in the rock-- often
the boundaries

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.430
between geological periods are
marked by mass extinctions.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.140
Because these are times when
because of that 75% number--

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.510
you have to think about that,
75% or more of all species

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.600
die out-- basically means that
an entire set of ecosystems

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.567
die and a new set rise
up to replace them.

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:50.400
So when you're looking
in the fossil record,

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.483
it's easy to see those
events because suddenly you

00:03:52.483 --> 00:03:56.410
see, for example, no more
trilobytes or no more

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.430
of a particular kind of animal.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.830
No more megafauna, giant
dinosaurs, and such.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.600
These mass extinctions
of this magnitude,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.750
there's only been five so far
in the history of the planet.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.940
The more I was
researching, the more

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.190
it became clear that
there were commonalities

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.391
between these different
mass extinction events.

00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:20.890
And I should say, there have
been plenty of other extinction

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.670
events, by the way,
where only say 30% or 40%

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.770
of all species on
the planet die out,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.194
which is already a
huge catastrophe.

00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:30.860
If that happened to
us now, we would all

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.090
be starving and probably
dealing with plagues.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.490
So none of those are
fun, but the mass

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.100
extinctions, these are the ones
where you see this huge spike,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.260
where it's just literally
almost all life expires.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.470
And what's common
between these big events,

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.890
these big mass
extinctions, is usually

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.600
they're precipitated by
some kind of terrible event.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.070
The most recent mass extinction
that you've probably all

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.750
heard about is the one that
destroyed most of the dinosaurs

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.820
65 million years ago
when an asteroid smashed

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.560
into the planet and there were
also mega volcanoes going off

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.440
in India.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.620
There's some debate
over what happened next

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.150
after the asteroid
hit the planet.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.570
But we do know is that
ultimately over time-- first,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.800
there were explosions and fire
and things like that-- but

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.000
over time, what happened was
that that event set off climate

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.970
changes across the planet.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.290
And that was really what
killed off most of the animals.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.450
And we see this happening
again and again.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.390
In all five of these previous
mass extinctions, what's

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.790
happened is some horrific
event-- maybe mega volcanoes,

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.980
I'll talk a bit about that
in a second-- maybe cosmic

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.960
radiation, but ultimately,
the long term death,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.950
that 1 million years of
horrible everybody dying

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.620
is caused by habitat changes
and by climate changes.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.160
So you can already see
why, for example, now,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.900
scientists are a
little bit concerned

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.160
that we may be entering into
a new phase of mass extinction

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.220
because we are entering
a phase of extreme, what

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.420
a geologist would call
perturbations in the carbon

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.460
cycle.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.940
Which is to say, climate
changes caused by carbon loading

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.380
in the atmosphere.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.370
These events can be
associated, as they are today,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.999
with extinctions.

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.290
Before I talk to you about
my favorite mass extinction,

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.820
because I have one--
everyone who studies

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.400
this stuff does-- I want to
tell you a little bit more

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.440
about those perturbations
in the carbon cycle.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.580
I want to talk about
Snowball Earth.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.460
How many people know
what Snowball Earth is?

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.330
OK, a few of you have studied
your ancient Earth history.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.800
So basically, it's interesting
to think about this time

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.030
period, which happened shortly
after the evolution of life

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.150
on the planet because
it's a good example of how

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.490
life forms have been changing
the environment on the planet

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.070
since life evolved.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.230
So humans love to think
about themselves in general,

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.250
but one of the things that we
love to think about ourselves

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.370
is it we're the
only animals that

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.620
ever came along and changed
the habitat on the planet

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.650
to the point where we are
causing climate changes.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.360
Well it turns out that about
2 billion years ago, there

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.580
was another life form
on the planet that

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.520
was changing the environment
much more than we ever did.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.340
And that life form was is
known as cyanobacteria.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.010
And there is, in fact,
cyanobacteria now, too,

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.630
distant descendents of
this early life form.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.820
It's also known as
blue green algae.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.640
Your friend, blue green algae.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.750
So here's what's awesome
about cyanobacteria.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.480
At the time they evolved, which
was about 3.5 billion years

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.975
ago-- they're really early life
forms-- they had an innovation

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.500
that no other life
form had, which

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.390
was that they
could live in water

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.250
and use a photon to split a
water molecule to get energy

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.550
out of it.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.140
And the only byproduct
of this was oxygen.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.430
Well, the thing was, at
that time, the atmosphere

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.820
on the planet was
mostly methane-based.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.320
So all of the archaea
and all the other life

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:25.120
forms living around
didn't use oxygen

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.810
in their respiration cycles.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.040
So they're all
hanging out saying,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.760
I love my clean,
methane-based environment.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.750
Everything is great
because there's

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.350
no terrible pollution
from oxygen, for example.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.880
But then these guys
come along, and they've

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.340
got this great innovation--
photosynthesis.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.170
And they can spread anywhere,
live anywhere, anywhere there's

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.497
light and water.

00:08:48.497 --> 00:08:50.830
And the planet is mostly
covered in water at this point.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:51.890
They can live there.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.930
And so they just
start farting out

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.030
tons of oxygen, tons and
tons and tons of oxygen,

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.900
to the point where they're
poisoning the planet.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.370
Literally, all of the life forms
that were around at that time

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.040
either perished or
actually went to become

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.844
quite similar to the organisms
that now live in volcanic vents

00:09:11.844 --> 00:09:13.010
at the bottom of the oceans.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.180
Those may be distant relatives
of these early creatures

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.010
destroyed by oxygen.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.017
No one would ever consider this
Snowball Earth event, which

00:09:22.017 --> 00:09:24.350
I'll tell you about in a
second, to be a mass extinction

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.735
because it took a
really long time.

00:09:26.735 --> 00:09:29.360
It was on the order of a billion
years, as opposed to a million

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:29.940
years.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.450
But what happened
catastrophically

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.310
is as oxygen levels were
raised in the atmosphere,

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.300
the planet started to cool down.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.680
This was at a time when the
sun itself was actually cooler.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.810
It was actually that long
ago that the sun was not

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.400
sending out as much heat.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.630
More oxygen in the
environment means cooler,

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.550
just like more carbon in the
environment means warmer.

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.750
And eventually, you started
to get these ice caps

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:57.710
on the planet.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.450
And the more ice caps
you had, the more light

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.700
was reflected, which
meant the ice caps would

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.060
grow and grow and grow until
basically-- many geologists now

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.110
believe that that's kind
of what we had for a while.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.320
The entire planet
with covered in ice.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.240
How did this
cyanobacteria survive?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.050
Is a big question.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.560
People often talk
about, well, there

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.680
was maybe like a little ring
of goo around the equator

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.490
where the cyanobacteria hung out
and kept polluting everything.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.260
Basically, the
Snowball Earth cycle

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.860
ended because of volcanism.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.710
Lots of volcanoes
were going off,

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.450
loading the environment
with carbon,

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.750
warming things up and eventually
returning the carbon cycle

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.370
to a more even keel.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.010
But that's how the
carbon cycle works

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.410
is it's always vacillating
between these ice

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.790
houses and these greenhouses.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.440
We couldn't probably have a
Snowball Earth at this point

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.510
because the sun is a
bit warmer and it's

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.140
unlikely we would have such
as an intense runaway icehouse

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.860
effect.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.401
But certainly at that time, it's
believed that possibly there

00:10:58.401 --> 00:11:00.170
were three of these events.

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.370
So humans are not
the only ones who

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.150
pollute the environment
with our gases.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:08.560
We're just the most recent and
the most famous to ourselves.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.430
So let me tell you about the
very best mass extinction ever.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.780
When a mass extinction
happens, as I mentioned,

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.220
it's not like
Snowball Earth where

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.930
it takes a really
long time and there's

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.360
these kind of long periods
where changes are taking place.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.180
They're taking place quickly.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.570
And the worst mass
extinction that ever happened

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.550
was 250 million years ago at
the end of the Permian period.

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.370
This is before
dinosaurs evolved,

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:38.200
so you can't imagine
giant monsters

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.530
lumbering around on the planet.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.190
It was a period when there was
a lot of life in the oceans.

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.520
There were some animals
on land, and plants.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.340
And the earth actually had one
super continent called Pangea.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.590
So all the continents were
kind of pushed together.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.000
And it was a continent that
stretched from the North Pole

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.150
down to the South Pole.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.680
So it was a long,
not really narrow,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:01.980
but it was a long kind of
vertical continent, as opposed

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.650
to earlier versions
of Pangea, which

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.440
were all at the
bottom of the planet.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.190
That was a bad time
when that happened.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:13.669
So we have this
nice big continent.

00:12:13.669 --> 00:12:14.960
Everything's going along great.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.920
Life has been evolving
and diversifying.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.120
There's lots of plants.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.940
And suddenly, or perhaps not
so suddenly, a mega volcano

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.010
starts going off in
what is now Siberia.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.680
And it's not a big
explosive volcano.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.100
It's the kind of volcano where
a crack opens in the earth

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.780
and lots of lava oozes out.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.100
And along with
that lava, you get

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.180
a lot of toxic gases, a
lot of greenhouse gases.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.290
That's going on for
about 1,000 years.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.550
So we have a volcano that
is emitting gas and lava

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.550
into the environment for
1,000 years, roughly.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.650
Scientists aren't sure
if it started and stopped

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.320
or if it just kept gushing.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.600
But it released so much lava
that actually, if you do visit

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.220
Siberia today, you can go
see the area-- it's just

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.310
called the Siberian
traps, quite beautiful

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.520
now-- which is
all volcanic rock.

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.280
But at the time, it's
estimated that probably

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.180
the amount of lava would
have covered northern Europe.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.562
So it was a huge amount.

00:13:21.562 --> 00:13:23.820
But, as I mentioned
earlier, of course

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.640
the death toll from
this event was not

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.890
from flaming waves of death.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.830
Because lava is actually
moving pretty slowly.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:36.080
So it's not like you
couldn't do the action movie,

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.100
like, I'm running
away from the lava.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.430
You actually could
have done that,

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.610
and animals did run
down out of the North.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.090
But the problem was
all of the carbon

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.710
loading in the environment.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.640
So you get a lot of the
same-- at that time, we now

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.420
see traces in the rocks of that
era of the same exact kinds

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.210
of problems that we're
dealing with today.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.030
There was incredible
ocean acidification.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.120
There were anoxic, dead
places in the ocean where

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.240
there was so little
oxygen that animals just

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.340
couldn't survive there.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.810
Corals died off.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.910
In fact, there are
beautiful coral reefs

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:15.630
that just were gone.

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.290
It was very, very difficult for
life to continue in the ocean.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:22.270
And of course, on land, there
was almost total devastation.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.440
In fact, it's estimated
that 95% of all species

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.850
died off during this period
after the volcano had

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.499
been erupting.

00:14:29.499 --> 00:14:31.040
And it was because
of climate change.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.890
It was because you had
this incredible greenhouse

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.351
situation.

00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:37.350
One of the scientists who
I talked to about this

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.140
said, what came
after this period,

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.940
he likes to call slime world.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.700
Because basically,
it was a great time

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.720
to be slime because there were
a lot of dead bodies to eat

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.930
and slime adapt really
well to acidic environments

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.690
in the water and
environments on land

00:14:54.690 --> 00:15:00.240
where the situation
is sort of terrible.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.660
One of the only remaining
survivors on land, this event,

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:12.340
was a four legged animal
here called Lystrosaurus.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.630
Lystrosaurus kind
of became my mascot

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.210
while I was writing this
book, partly because it looks

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.700
a little bit like
a pig and a lizard,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.070
which is always This animal
is called a synapsid.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.440
They're often called
mammal-like reptiles

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.980
because they were reptiles
that over time began

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.120
to evolve more and more
mammal-like features

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.670
and eventually, the ones
that didn't go extinct

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.840
evolved into mammals.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:43.910
So this is kind of our
evolutionary uncle here.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.750
It's because of these creatures
that we're here today,

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.670
and because of their heartiness
in the face of this disaster.

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.240
There's a lot of
theories among geologists

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.740
about why they survived
because of the fact

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.000
that after this horrific
mass extinction,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.140
they were pretty much
the only land animal.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.390
There were animals
that were aquatic.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.410
There were animals that
were kind of alligator-like.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:11.810
These guys somehow managed to
not just survive, but speciate,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.250
meaning they evolved into many
different species over millions

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.660
of years.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.960
They migrated down from the
northern parts of the continent

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.660
to the southern part
of the continent,

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.920
so that when the mega continent
broke up into two continents,

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.080
there were already just
tons of Lystrosaurus

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.090
and its offspring in
the southern continent.

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.030
And they were just
incredibly adaptable.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.170
They were burrowers,
which meant-- in fact,

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.000
we found some amazing
skeletons of them

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.120
recently inside their burrows.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.500
They may have been adapted
to environments that already

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.340
had a lot of dirt
and gunk in the air.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:46.209
That's possibly one
reason they survived.

00:16:46.209 --> 00:16:48.000
It may have just been
that they were lucky.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.280
There may have been no predators
that survived that ate them.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:55.750
Because basically, they were
kind of the cows of the era.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.340
They would have been a
really nice, tasty treat.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.090
I talked to an environmental
scientist who said yeah,

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.190
they're just like cows.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.920
They weren't very big.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.460
They were sort of dog sized.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.119
And I don't know how
tasty they would.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:15.650
But the point is, nobody
was really eating them.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:19.150
The point is, if these
creatures could survive,

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.290
it gives us a good
way of understanding

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.829
how other animals make
it through these kinds

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:26.430
of catastrophic events.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.670
And that's what
brings me to humanity.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.820
One of the things that I saw
again and again in looking

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.320
at animals that survive mass
extinctions was that they had

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.530
a lot of things in common with
Lystrosaurus, for example,

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.960
which is they could adapt
to many environments.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.110
They could eat almost anything.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:56.250
And they were able to
spread out away from danger.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:00.419
One of the things that people
have as animals-- just thinking

00:18:00.419 --> 00:18:02.960
about people as animals, and
not getting worried about things

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.670
like science and wearing
awesome dresses like the people

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.300
in this picture
are-- as animals,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.610
we are an invasive species.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.820
We're terrific at going into
new areas and adapting to them.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.790
We terrific at scattering
in the face of danger

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.180
to get into better
circumstances.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.210
And, as I am fond of pointing
out, we can eat garbage,

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:29.210
and it seems to be just
fine, as you've perhaps

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.110
seen in your life.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.660
So we have the baseline
characteristics

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.910
of a species that can survive
one of these disastrous events

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.100
that lasts for these
long periods of time.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.380
The thing that we have
that, as far as we know,

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.140
Lystrasaurus did not have,
and many other survivors

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.250
of mass extinctions
like birds did not have,

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.180
is that we have an ability
to record our history.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.750
We have science and technology
which use the scientific method

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.960
to explore problems and come
up with solutions to them.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.000
So we are actually
able to figure out

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.580
that we might be headed into
a mass extinction, which I'm

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.070
highly doubtful that
Lystrasaurus did.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.830
Because we can know
that, because we actually

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:17.580
discovered things like carbon
cycles 50 years ago or so,

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.210
we're able to make
plans for the future.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.121
And that was what I really
became interested in,

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:25.120
and that's what a large
part of my book is about

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.410
is how we can learn
from what's gone on

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:31.580
before on the planet from these
disasters and these extinctions

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:34.890
and what we can do to
plan for the future.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.190
So the question is,
if you're looking

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.670
to the future with
survival in mind--

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.830
if you are taking the
warnings that we're

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:49.940
getting about climate change and
animal extinctions seriously,

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.810
what are the steps that we
can take as a civilization

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.380
to prepare ourselves to survive?

00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:01.590
One of the first things that
I think we have to consider

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.210
is the fact that
human beings right now

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.090
are starting to live
mostly in cities.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:12.510
So I wanted to look at a
near-term future scenario

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.700
for how humans might
start surviving.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.160
And when I say
near-term, I really

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.730
mean the next 100
to 200 or 300 years,

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.410
so it's not particularly
near-term, like it's not

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.845
next year, but in the
rather near future.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.810
More than half of humans are
already living in cities.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.435
And over the next
100 years, it's

00:20:32.435 --> 00:20:34.560
likely that those numbers
are really going to jump.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.030
We may be up to something
like 75% of people living

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.080
in cities by the
end of this century.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:46.000
So how do we change our cities
to be robust against disaster?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.820
So first of all,
as I've mentioned,

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.570
one of the big problems
with mass extinction

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:51.870
is climate change.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.790
So how do we start making cities
that are more sustainable?

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.440
How do we start building so
that they can survive things

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.170
like floods, which are
inevitable with climate

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:03.860
change, earthquakes, which
are inevitable because we're

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:07.050
in California, and other kinds
of disasters which might be

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:11.596
even more outlandish, like
rocks from space or radiation

00:21:11.596 --> 00:21:12.095
from space?

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:17.940
One of the things that
we need to think about

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:23.390
is-- and I have this building
with biology injunction

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:28.220
here, because one of the ways
that these kinds of disasters

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.330
take place, these
mass extinctions,

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.580
is not particularly exciting.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.120
Mega volcanoes actually
are kind of exciting.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.660
Asteroids from space, pretty
good on the exciting scale.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.760
But generally, when you start
having these climate changes,

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.370
the reason why
animals die out is

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.630
because of famine
and starvation.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.370
It's really simple.

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:53.160
When you start having
habitats change,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.420
food sources become
less and less available.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.120
Herbivores that eat plants--
if the climate changes,

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.010
those plants are no
longer available.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:05.510
If those herbivores die out, the
carnivores that eat them also

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.010
die out.

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.850
So you get this kind
of knock-on effect

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.590
where the food webs, which
are the webs of who eats whom,

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.020
start to unravel.

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.940
So if we're going to
focus on how humans

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.310
can live in the future to
survive that kind of disaster,

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.780
A, we have to focus on
places where we're living,

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.970
and B, we have to
focus on how we

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:28.390
can use those places to
maintain our food security

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.480
and to maintain sustainability
so that we're not trashing

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.490
the places where we're
actually building our food.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:40.220
This means partly
rethinking our technology

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:45.430
to incorporate things like
bio mimicry and biology.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.950
That can be as simple as
turning to alternative sources

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:54.180
of fuel-- solar fuels,
biofuels, anything that's

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.080
carbon neutral or
carbon negative.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.590
But more
futuristically, we could

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:02.070
be starting to think
about how cities

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.620
can function like
environmental systems.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.750
And this is something that
very few people realize

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:10.140
is going on in environmental
science right now,

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.170
but there's a huge
push to just gather

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:18.390
shit loads of data on how
environmental systems work.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.490
To literally go into an
environment or habitat,

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.460
count how many
animals are there,

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.670
count the kinds of
things they're eating,

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:28.390
trying to figure out
all of the inputs that

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.890
go into an environmental
system and all

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.530
of the outputs that result.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.610
And the inputs are
strange and surprising.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.070
For example, there's
a team in Canada,

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.820
at University of
British Columbia, that's

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:46.060
been studying the
composition of the microbiome

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.610
in forests that
are being farmed.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:52.270
They're just looking to see
if farming forests over time

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:54.800
is changing the kinds
of bacteria that

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.297
are available to the
trees in the soil.

00:23:57.297 --> 00:23:59.380
Bacteria, of course, are
very important for trees,

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.130
because they help with
all kinds of things

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.150
like nitrogen uptake
and other processes.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.760
So what they found is that
yes, farming in forests

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.370
actually cuts down on the
diversity of the microbes

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.290
that you have
available in the soil.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:18.270
And that's, again, a very
data-intensive process.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.042
I was talking to their
field scientists,

00:24:20.042 --> 00:24:22.000
and they were like yep,
we just go into forests

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.280
and collect chunks
of soil and sequence

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:29.440
it to find out what genetic
material is in there.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.150
So there's a huge data
gathering effort right now.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:36.290
Over time, people are going
to be using programs to crunch

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.040
that data to simulate
environments to think about how

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.930
do you, for example, put
inputs into an environment

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.860
or a habitat that change
the way it behaves?

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:52.380
Maybe you can change the
way crops can survive

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.250
in different kinds of climates.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:58.660
Maybe you can change the
way crops produce sugar

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.866
so that you can take
more energy from them.

00:25:01.866 --> 00:25:03.240
There's all kinds
of ways that we

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.740
can intervene in environments
in a sustainable way

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.320
to also make them
fit in with how

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.620
humans are living in cities.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.650
The other thing that we
need to be thinking about

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.200
as we head into
future is actually not

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:21.470
just making cities that
function like a metabolism

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:23.220
or that interact with
their environment

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.900
better once we understand
how environments function,

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.330
but actually building
our city environments

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.530
using biological materials.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.780
So one of my favorite examples
of what I'm talking about

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.171
are self-healing materials.

00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:38.170
You've probably heard of
self-healing materials.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.710
There's a lot of
self-healing polymers

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.500
that are used right now as
ship sealants, for example.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.420
When they're exposed to heat,
the cracks will close up.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.180
Here, what I have is a couple
of pictures from a science

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.420
project that a group
of undergraduates

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.250
did for the IGEM
competition, which

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.930
is an annual synthetic
biology competition.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.910
And what they created was
self-healing concrete,

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:07.130
which is made with bacteria.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.930
It's modified bacteria, and they
referred to it as BacillaFilla,

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:15.730
which, if you're a bio geek,
is a really hilarious joke.

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.790
They were using
bacteria that basically

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.370
had been modified
to extrude epoxies

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.920
when in contact with cement.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.710
So as you can see
here, we can see

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.250
a crack that had been
made in some cement.

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:31.920
This is obviously magnified.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.700
They smeared a bunch of
bacteria on it, and over time,

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.480
that bacteria grew
to fill in the crack.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:41.790
And it extruded these
epoxies, which actually

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:45.052
made that concrete
stronger in the end.

00:26:45.052 --> 00:26:46.510
I should add, by
the way, that when

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.190
people do these kinds of
synthetic biology projects

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.950
where they're trying to
create biological materials,

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:55.060
one of the important things
is building a kill switch

00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:00.760
into the bacteria so you're
not going to get runaway cement

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.517
tumors forming on your
head and things like that.

00:27:03.517 --> 00:27:05.100
Although that is,
obviously, a danger,

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.910
because things can go wrong.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.980
So it's important that
this is regulated.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.780
What they've done
here is show us

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.210
a glimpse of what cities
might be like in a future

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.710
where we start building with
modified biological materials

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.050
that are, in fact, still alive.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:22.010
So not building with
dead trees, but building

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:25.880
with living materials that
could in fact heal themselves.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.910
Which is very
sustainable, and in fact,

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.204
in a city like San
Francisco, where I live,

00:27:30.204 --> 00:27:31.995
would be fantastic
because we're constantly

00:27:31.995 --> 00:27:37.390
in danger of quakes weakening
infrastructure because

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.160
of cracks, and things like that.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:44.650
You can imagine in the future--
I talked to this architect

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.070
in New York who works a lot
with synthetic biologists who

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.400
said his vision for
a city in the future

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:57.000
is basically something that
looks like a ruin that would be

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.700
covered in scars that had formed
from self-healing buildings,

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.890
covered in vines that have
been modified to do things

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:11.200
like purify water, or covered
in vats that are bubbling up

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.410
cyanobacteria that have been
modified to produce fuels.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.730
One of the outputs
of cyanobacteria

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.760
can be hydrogen
fuel or other fuels,

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.080
depending on how you modify it.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.100
It would be this city that was
partly alive and partly made

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:30.180
of standard city
materials, but it

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.770
would look like this ruin
covered in plants, covered

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.350
in scabs, but it would be
this living, vital city that

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:41.030
was almost indistinguishable
from the nature around it.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.940
So it would be kind
of like visiting

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.920
an ancient city of the
Maya-- stumbling across it

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.840
in the forest, in the
jungle, and yet, it

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.140
would be almost like
a living organism.

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.780
The idea behind that,
of course, again,

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:59.420
is always about trying to make
human habitation on the planet

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.230
as close as possible to the
already existing ecosystem

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.760
so that we halt this
process, this mass extinction

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.165
process that's caused
by climate changes.

00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:13.380
The fact is that
even if we manage

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.730
to completely change the
way our cities behave,

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:22.350
geoengineer the planet,
fix the environment,

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.590
live in beautiful cities
that look like trees

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:29.680
and become elves or whatever
else we're going to do,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.560
there's still a basic problem.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.150
I mentioned to you earlier
that these previous mass

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.470
extinctions, one was
caused by mega volcanoes.

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.840
Another was caused by a giant
ball from space smashing

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.370
into Mexico.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:45.230
And these aren't problems
that are going to go away.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.210
We actually live on a
tectonically active planet.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:51.390
Volcanoes could come
back at any point, really

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.430
big mega volcanoes.

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.967
By the way, Yellowstone
is not one of those.

00:29:55.967 --> 00:29:57.300
You can ask me about that later.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.400
People always ask me
about Yellowstone.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.920
That's not as dangerous as some
of the other mega volcanoes

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.540
that we're looking at.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.790
That would just screw things
up for a couple of years,

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.680
as opposed to a millennium.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.970
So what do we do about that?

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:16.940
And the question is really
aimed at a far future look

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.770
at where humanity
would go to survive.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.270
If we expect to
survive as a species,

00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:26.160
we can't continue to stay here.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.150
We have to eventually think
about taking our species

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:34.600
off the planet and into space
habitats or other worlds.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.950
Because put it this way-- if
the whole planet is smashed

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.800
by an asteroid, we'd like to
have a backup civilization

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:44.100
somewhere else so that
humans can continue on.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.570
So the question
is, first of all,

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:55.310
what is this time scale on
which this might happen?

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:59.360
People often think, why don't
we just go to space tomorrow?

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.860
I mean, there's a
Mars mission plan.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:05.670
We're all going to go move to
Mars in like a decade, right?

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:10.240
I think that we have to think
about our move towards space

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:15.020
as being something that is
a much longer scale plan.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:16.790
A very long term plan.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.370
And I think a good
thought experiment

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:24.300
for that is to recall that the
first time that humans crossed

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.250
an ocean to colonize
a new continent

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:33.540
was about 50,000 years ago when
humans left Asia and took boats

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:37.290
very much like this one, these
reed boats, down to Australia,

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:41.000
and many thousands of years
later to the Americas, as well.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.210
And they were able to do that.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.150
They were able to
take their reed boats,

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:48.560
get to a new continent,
and inhabit it.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.190
But it wasn't until
about 500 years ago

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.800
that boats were able
to completely transform

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.370
human culture and create global
trade and the global culture

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.420
that we think of as being
human culture today.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.260
There was a really
big lag time between

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.120
first successful deployment of
boats for a cross-ocean voyage

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.320
and global culture created
around a whole shipping

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.570
trade and a whole
shipping system.

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.040
So I don't think it's going to
take 50,000 years this time.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.320
I think we probably
can accelerate

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.800
the process a little bit.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.024
But I think that it may
take longer than we think,

00:32:27.024 --> 00:32:29.190
and that there's going to
be a lot longer that we're

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.850
going to have to spend here
on Earth analyzing things

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.290
like ecosystems and environments
and changing the way

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.500
that we live on the earth
before we can go to space, not

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.120
the least of which
because we're going

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.050
to need to invent
alternative fuels if we

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:46.790
want to go to space.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.130
I hate to break it to
you, but rocket fuel?

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:51.595
Kind of last
century's technology.

00:32:51.595 --> 00:32:53.970
We're going to need something
more sustainable than that.

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:54.850
We're going to
need something that

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.540
works a lot better than that.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.880
And also, when we go to space,
we're going to need ecosystems.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.550
We still eat things.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:05.010
We still need bacteria in
our guts to be healthy.

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:08.290
So we're going to need to
bring all these environments

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.530
from Earth with us
into space, probably

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.440
in a very modified version.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:17.091
Let's just talk about
space for a second.

00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:22.840
If we're going to actually have
a sustainable space culture

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.370
equivalent to that culture I
was talking about where we had

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.210
those shipping lanes where
boats could cross the ocean all

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:33.540
the time and bring you awesome
crap from other countries,

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.750
we're going to need something
like a space elevator.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.660
This is just one of many kinds
of big engineering projects

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:44.080
that have been suggested as
alternatives to using rockets

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:48.390
to get people and things out of
the gravity well of the planet.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:51.120
The biggest expense in
terms of energy and money

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.720
is always, how do you get
the heck out of the gravity

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.370
well and into space?

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.380
What we need is a renewable
way of doing that.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.410
So in the '90s, some
researchers at NASA

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.070
actually took an idea that
had been tossed around

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.130
amongst futurists
and science fiction

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:10.780
authors for a while
to actually talk about

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.540
how what would a space
elevator really be like?

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:20.120
The idea is just that you
have-- it's a bit futuristic--

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:25.100
but the idea is that you float
a counterweight on a tether

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:28.020
that's attached to
the planet-- and it's

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:34.310
about 60,000 miles up-- and
it's attached at the equator,

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:37.350
and it's basically in
geostationary orbit

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:38.760
around the planet.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.670
And this tether that's
anchoring your counterweight

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:45.739
to the planet is the
big question mark.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:47.803
We understand how a
counterweight works.

00:34:47.803 --> 00:34:49.469
Maybe we'd capture
an asteroid to do it,

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:52.250
or something like that,
because this is the far future.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.810
But what would actually be this
lightweight, amazing material

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:59.070
that would link the Earth
with this counterweight?

00:34:59.070 --> 00:34:59.820
We don't know yet.

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.990
There's a lot of theories.

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:02.910
But the idea is
that you would have

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:07.440
some kind of robotic device
that would climb up that tether.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.420
It's referred to generally as
a tether in the space elevator

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.787
community.

00:35:11.787 --> 00:35:13.370
They have an annual
meeting every year

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.040
where they talk
about possibilities

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.700
for how you would
build this tether.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.970
The robots, by the way,
we've got, as you know.

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.880
You can easily build a robot
that can climb up a rope.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:25.980
Especially if your rope is
mostly in a zero gravity

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:29.260
situation, it's
very easy to pull up

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.890
an elevator car that
might be quite large.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:38.490
Here you can see in this
NASA artist's conception.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.499
You would have a pretty
darn big elevator car.

00:35:42.499 --> 00:35:44.040
It would take you
probably three days

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.780
to get up that
tether into space.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.900
So it's like a sleeper car.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:49.090
And people are going up.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.280
And also, again,
materials are going up.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.930
This is a way of pulling
materials out of the gravity

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:58.650
well so you can start actually
constructing things in space.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.020
Because again, that's going
to save you a lot of energy.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.530
It's going to save
you a lot of money.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.490
If you actually had a
working space elevator

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.910
and you had a tether
made of carbon nanotubes

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.340
or whatever we end up
building it out of,

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:16.740
you can be pulling people
up out of the gravity well

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.000
three times a day.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.890
So you could actually have a
sustainable, repeatable way

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:25.090
of getting people and
objects into space.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:27.320
And that would
really be the gateway

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.290
to a true space-going
civilization.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:35.660
But we don't really know what
that would be like in the end,

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.400
going into space.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.270
Humans, in order
to live in space,

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:43.009
would have to probably
be modified in some way.

00:36:43.009 --> 00:36:45.300
We'd have to be genetically
modified in the same way we

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.250
might genetically
modify our plants to be

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.220
more sustainable, for example.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.425
We would need to resist
radiation damage.

00:36:52.425 --> 00:36:54.300
If we were going to go
live on another world,

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.920
we might need to
be able to breathe

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.760
in other kinds of atmospheres.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.500
And that's a huge
leap to think about.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.100
When I was
researching my book, I

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:05.754
kept interviewing synthetic
biologists and asking them,

00:37:05.754 --> 00:37:07.670
so when are we going to
start modifying humans

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.990
so they can live in space?

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.160
Even though people are
kind of studying this,

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.390
I could not get a
single biologist

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:17.100
to go on record saying we
would ever modify humans, ever.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.430
Simply no.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.890
Which is probably a good sign.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.280
But I would up asking the
science fiction writer

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.900
Kim Stanley Robinson, who wrote
the "Red Mars" series, which

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.450
is fantastic, if
you haven't read it.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.450
So all of his novels
include this idea

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.760
that humans will be genetically
modifying themselves

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.910
out the wazoo all the time
in order to live in space.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:41.690
And I said, well, OK,
none of these scientists

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.850
will admit they would
ever want to do this.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.756
So how are we going to do that?

00:37:45.756 --> 00:37:47.630
What's your idea as a
science fiction writer?

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.440
Like, how are we going to make
that leap from here, where

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.580
we will never modified
the germ line because it's

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.350
our precious, bodily germ
line, to modifying ourselves

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.140
like crazy?

00:37:57.140 --> 00:38:00.340
And he said, it's
going to be longevity.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.730
As soon as we have a
way to modify our genome

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.480
to live longer, that'll
open the gateway.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.770
And people will start
to be willing to think

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:11.320
about other ways of
modifying their genomes

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.920
and other ways of
changing the species.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.580
So that was his theory as
a science fiction writer.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.660
Scientists have no theories
yet because they're not

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:23.810
going to do it.

00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:27.110
So somewhere in between those
two possibilities, I think,

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:29.315
lies our future as a species.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.280
I want to conclude by
saying that what we've

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.470
seen from previous
mass extinctions

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:40.470
and previous transformations
in the history of the planet

00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:43.390
is that ultimately,
the one thing that's

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:46.650
held in common between all
these life forms that survive

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:47.990
is that they evolve.

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:50.290
And so the question
is, will humans

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:53.960
evolve because we intervene
in the process of evolution,

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.390
change our genomes
so that we can

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:59.879
be more compatible with
environments in space,

00:38:59.879 --> 00:39:01.420
change our genomes
so that we're more

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.560
compatible with
environments on Earth?

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:06.920
Will we change the genomes of
many of the plants and animals

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:11.480
around us to make them function
better with human needs,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.950
transforming plants
to be better biofuels,

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:17.350
transforming animals to
be working companions

00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:20.140
that are more functional?

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.840
We just don't know
what will happen.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.150
But we know that there
will be these changes.

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:27.050
And when we look back, of
course, to our ancestors

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:31.880
like Homo Erectus, it's
obvious that these changes

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.570
have taken place before.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:37.560
And there's no reason to
think that won't again.

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.220
And we do have-- as
I said, as animals,

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.970
we have these basic
survivor traits.

00:39:42.970 --> 00:39:44.960
We are going to make it through.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.930
The question is
just, will we make it

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:51.910
through in a horrible state
of famine and poverty?

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.050
Or will we take measures now to
start planning for disasters,

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:59.080
planning for mass extinctions,
and building a better

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.060
civilization that is a
survivable civilization so

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.120
that we can live in style and
maybe one day go to space?

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:10.220
So that's the decision
that we have to make now.

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:12.280
The good news is, we'll survive.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.600
But also the bad news is even
if we make wretched decisions,

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.870
we'll probably
also survive, too.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:22.730
So there could be a very
dark survival scenario.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:27.347
We have time for Q and A now,
so I'll open it up to you guys.

00:40:27.347 --> 00:40:29.215
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:39.500
AUDIENCE: Any promising
exoplanets for us to move to?

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:45.500
ANNALEE NEWITZ: It's funny,
we don't know of any yet.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:49.230
NASA and ISA are in the process
of developing instruments that

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:51.620
might actually allow us
to analyze atmosphere

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.380
on other planets.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.810
Right now, we can't
really do that.

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:58.770
We do know that it's looking
more like super earths probably

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:00.520
have continents,
which is good news,

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.950
unless we want to
modify ourselves

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.486
to be aquatic animals.

00:41:04.486 --> 00:41:06.110
Within our own solar
system, of course,

00:41:06.110 --> 00:41:08.610
there's places like
Europa, despite what

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:11.600
we were told in the movie
2010-- all these worlds

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.700
are yours, except Europa.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.210
Europa is a moon
of Jupiter that has

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:20.640
an ocean beneath its icy crust.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.650
So there may be a
possibility of life

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:26.891
there, growing life there for
us to eat, things like that.

00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:28.390
But then there's
always the question

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:33.880
of if we go to a planet and
there's already life there,

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:37.420
how ethical is it for us
to go and insert ourselves

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.480
into that ecosystem?

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.250
So my feeling is
probably in the end,

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.330
we'll end up living in
synthetic structures

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.600
that we build in space.

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.680
The science fiction writer
Iain Banks always said,

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.260
a planet is a terrible
use of matter.

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:59.790
Because you could always just
take a planet apart and turn it

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.090
into a giant halo world
and there'd be a lot more

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:03.950
surface area.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.780
Again, you'd only want to
take apart a dead world.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:09.690
You don't want to rack
some exo ecosystem.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:16.410
That is my sense of where we
might be going, if we're lucky.

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:18.656
But so far, I think
we're just going

00:42:18.656 --> 00:42:20.280
to have to stick with
our solar system.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.700
So maybe Europa.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.930
Next you're in Europa.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:26.510
AUDIENCE: I was curious, what
are your thoughts on things

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.720
like fracking and
how it's affecting

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:31.670
climate change versus
what's going on

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:36.010
with the natural progression
of the Earth, anyway?

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.730
ANNALEE NEWITZ: I think
fracking is a last ditch effort

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:43.042
to suck the last fossil
fuels out of the planet.

00:42:43.042 --> 00:42:45.625
It's kind of like when you get
to the bottom of the mayonnaise

00:42:45.625 --> 00:42:47.220
jar, and you're like sticking
your tongue in the bottom,

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:48.200
like.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.630
Probably none of you do that
because mayonnaise is gross.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.720
But it's basically the
equivalent of that.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.270
And I think it's testimony
to how desperate we

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.675
are for fuel and energy.

00:42:58.675 --> 00:43:03.120
It's obviously a terrible
long-term solution.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.950
What we really need
to be focusing on--

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:09.020
and luckily what even in our
government here in the U.S.

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.690
is gently trying to focus
on, especially the Department

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:15.200
of Energy, are alternative
fuels that are carbon neutral.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.180
So whether that's
biofuels or-- I'm

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:21.180
a particular fan of
solar fuel generators.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.190
There's a group at Berkeley
that's partnered with a group

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:30.190
at Caltech called the Center
for Artificial Photosynthesis.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.020
And what they're
trying to do is build

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:37.120
a device that is ultimately kind
of like a photovoltaic device.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.410
But it also uses water.

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:42.900
It produces a
hydrocarbon liquid fuel

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.160
that is from sunlight and water.

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.660
It's particularly
seductive to me

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.670
because you can work with the
existing fuel infrastructure

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:57.040
that we already have, which is
designed around liquid fuel.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.200
One of the big problems
with solar and wind energy

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.530
is storage.

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:03.190
How do you store that energy?

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:05.680
So if you could get
liquid solar fuel,

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.290
this hydrocarbon, that
might be a really great way

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.710
to transition into
an alternative fuel

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:15.390
source without having to change
the infrastructure as much,

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:20.739
because changing the energy
infrastructure is a huge cost.

00:44:20.739 --> 00:44:22.780
Although, of course,
building fracking facilities

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.920
is also a huge cost.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:27.600
So it would really be nice
to see people investing

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.860
in alternative
infrastructures, too.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:35.570
I guess the short answer is
TLDR fracking is a dead end.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.610
Alternative fuels are
going to be the way

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:40.216
to survive long term.

00:44:40.216 --> 00:44:41.590
AUDIENCE: Great
to have you here.

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:43.860
Thanks for coming out.

00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.720
You've touched briefly on
the self-healing materials.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.735
And I was wondering if
it's just the concepts

00:44:51.735 --> 00:44:52.610
and the competitions.

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:54.110
I haven't done any
research on that,

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.100
but it's really
interesting to me.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:59.870
If there are already some
materials that have been used,

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.940
and how the regulators and the
government are reacting to it.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.850
What do you hear?

00:45:03.850 --> 00:45:05.816
What do you read about it?

00:45:05.816 --> 00:45:07.190
ANNALEE NEWITZ:
So yes, there are

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:11.170
a few self-healing materials
that are in use now.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.176
The self-healing
polymer materials

00:45:13.176 --> 00:45:14.550
that I was mentioning
before that

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:18.800
are used in sealing
ship holes, for example,

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:24.280
and other industrial uses, those
are biomimetic in the sense

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.710
that they're trying to
imitate a biological process,

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:28.980
but they're not
actually biological

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.320
like the BacillaFilla
that I mentioned to you.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.260
I am not aware of any
product like BacillaFilla

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.640
that's on the market.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.224
There are certainly in the
pipeline at various research

00:45:40.224 --> 00:45:40.765
institutions.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:47.840
Self-healing materials generally
are a huge focus of interest,

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.900
both for defense
and for industry

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.770
because if you can
have, for example,

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.030
a self-healing material that
when you shoot it with a bullet

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:04.700
closes up again-- there actually
is a transparent polymer that

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.030
can do that.

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.960
I saw a great like
a Discovery Channel

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.820
special where they showed it.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.820
Again, not in widespread
deployment, but in the research

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.930
stage.

00:46:13.930 --> 00:46:17.740
So it's a very big area of
investment in material science

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:21.320
right now, and you'll find a
lot of material science labs

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.400
that are focusing on
that particular area.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.970
And like I said, it's
sustainable as well

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:31.820
being a possible way of thinking
about building materials

00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:34.960
as a part of the
living environment

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.650
instead of as
something that's dead.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:39.650
AUDIENCE: Some years ago
in Scientific American,

00:46:39.650 --> 00:46:43.520
there was an article on one
possible mass extinction

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:47.710
mechanism of if we kill
off enough of aerobic life

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.289
in the upper layers
of our oceans,

00:46:49.289 --> 00:46:51.080
there's some perfectly
happy anaerobic life

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.340
down in lower layers that could
come up and start farting us

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.330
all to death with
hydrogen sulfide.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:00.390
Have you heard any more
updates to that theory?

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:02.130
ANNALEE NEWITZ:
Actually, there was

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:07.270
a paper that came out just
a few weeks ago about that.

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:10.090
And it was actually looking at
the Permian mass extinction,

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:14.230
which I was explaining to
you in such glowing terms.

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:17.040
And one of the
theories now is that

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:22.690
a methane-producing microbe was
adding to the greenhouse gas

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:24.810
loading in the
atmosphere at that time.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:28.135
So basically, what can happen
is, as you probably know,

00:47:28.135 --> 00:47:31.720
if you get acidification
in the oceans,

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.850
oftentimes that can lead
to all algal blooms.

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:39.640
And so if you get some
of these toxic bugs that

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.750
are producing things
like methane gas,

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:44.820
they might start thriving
in the environment

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.390
that we consider to be toxic,
which is probably like revenge

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:54.530
for Snowball Earth
in some broad sense.

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:57.150
Yeah, no one knows for sure.

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.820
But it is a theory,
and it's certainly

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.490
something that could happen.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:05.520
As you probably remember,
when we have big oil spills,

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.110
for example, one
of the outcomes can

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:11.620
be bacteria eat a lot
of the oil and produce

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.970
these anoxic zones in the ocean.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:18.320
So bacteria can be involved
in a lot of processes

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:22.170
that create life
for the bacteria,

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:26.440
but then destroy habitats
for other creatures in them.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:32.690
Yes, bacteria and other
microbes are probably

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:35.280
deeply involved in
mass extinctions.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.010
And of course, now we
know that the human body

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.980
is host to so many
biological organisms that

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.030
keep us healthy, too, so
changing our environment

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:46.120
can actually be killing
off the microbes

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.350
in our bodies that
are keeping us alive.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.140
Basically, the
future is studying

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.640
the environment
created by microbes

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.630
and how that affects us.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:03.230
Most realistic movie or fiction
about a disaster on Earth?

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:06.654
I would have to say-- I'll just
pick on Kim Stanley Robinson

00:49:06.654 --> 00:49:08.070
because this is
actually something

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.090
that he writes about a lot.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.130
He has a novel that came
out a couple years ago

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.750
called 2312, which
I think is probably

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:14.830
my favorite novel of his.

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.320
I highly recommend it.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.470
It's set, not surprisingly,
in the year 2312.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:24.810
It's about a future where
a lot of the geoengineering

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:28.090
and biological engineering
ideas I've been discussing today

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:30.270
have actually come to pass.

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:36.400
There are radical bioengineering
and environmental remediation

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.480
groups who come back
to Earth from space

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:44.680
and their goal is to raise
Florida out of the ocean

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:49.900
again because Florida has
been completely submerged,

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:53.340
and of course, displacing
many people and many animals.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.310
So they are engaging
in this sort

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.270
of a blending of
environmentalism

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:02.070
and geoengineering and
slowly raising that.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:05.480
They're also repopulating
parts of the United States

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.950
with wolves, as well, which
is really interesting.

00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:09.790
They're actually
parachuting wolves

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:13.260
in from their spaceships where
they've been growing them

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.320
in their space habitats.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.170
It's actually quite a beautiful
image, these wolves parachuting

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:22.824
down into their new environment.

00:50:22.824 --> 00:50:24.740
I think the thing that
I like about that is it

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.550
is about this environmental
disaster that we're facing now,

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:32.510
but it imagines a future where
environmentalism is deeply

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:36.580
connected to geoengineering
and bioengineering,

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:39.470
that those two groups
are no longer at odds

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:45.250
and they've figured out a way
to use scientific interventions

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:47.730
into the environment
and into habitats

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.190
to remediate the environment.

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:51.570
So they're not
viewing bioengineering

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:56.610
as the enemy, but as a tool
to fix the problems that we

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.020
have on the planet.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.570
That's very utopian.

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:01.610
I think that would be
a fantastic outcome.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:03.050
I don't know how likely it is.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:06.390
But it's certainly a very,
very realistic picture

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:08.410
of what climate
change would be like,

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:12.040
and then a hopeful picture
of how we would fix it.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:16.379
AUDIENCE: What's your opinion
about technology singularity?

00:51:16.379 --> 00:51:17.670
ANNALEE NEWITZ: Technology and?

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:18.586
AUDIENCE: Singularity.

00:51:22.056 --> 00:51:24.890
ANNALEE NEWITZ: I think
that the future belongs

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:28.310
to environments and
ecosystems and biology.

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:38.140
And I think we're far more
likely to have a good future

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:43.220
if we work on treating the
planet like a computer.

00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:45.240
Instead of trying
to turn the planet

00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:50.520
into a substrate for our
brains to jack off forever

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.150
to zombies and plants,
which sounds really

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:58.710
good in some ways, maybe what
we might think about instead

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:02.420
is that the planet itself
is an incredibly complicated

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:06.030
mechanism with many
inputs and many outputs,

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.680
and that our long
term goal could

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.560
be to understand all
of those and actually

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:15.740
start intervening meaningfully
so that we're actually

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.340
shepherding the entire
environment of the planet

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:23.150
and using our technology to
maintain sustainable ecosystems

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:26.110
and to maintain the planet at
a temperature that we enjoy.

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:27.860
We like it a little cool.

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.720
We like those ice caps.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.720
As you may know, the
ice caps are actually

00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.436
kind of an unusual thing
for the planet to have.

00:52:34.436 --> 00:52:35.810
For most of the
planet's history,

00:52:35.810 --> 00:52:37.050
there have been no ice caps.

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:40.360
It's been warmer, more
carbon in the environment.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.860
But if we can
start to figure out

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:47.440
how to control this amazing
machine that we live on,

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.790
maybe we can intervene
and prevent those ice caps

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:56.030
from going away and keep the
ecosystems that we enjoy here.

00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:59.330
And then maybe we can
go into space, as well

00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.020
and bring our ecosystems
along with us.

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:08.850
And I think that's a much more
hopeful view of life evolving.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:11.160
I feel like evolution
and change really

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.620
need to characterize
our future, not

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:17.490
uploading in a kind
of static world.

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:22.620
AUDIENCE: Climate changing is
coming toward us very fast.

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.130
What do you think
that Google people,

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:27.890
as a powerhouse of
internet, have to do?

00:53:30.384 --> 00:53:32.300
ANNALEE NEWITZ: One of
the things about Google

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:35.470
is that it's already
creating a sort

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:38.950
of small, utopian
community, despite all

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:41.060
of the pitfalls along the way.

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:45.760
I think that as a company,
Google is actually

00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:50.480
actively trying to invest
in futuristic, sustainable

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.070
technologies in a way that
actually really surprises me

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:55.510
all the time.

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:58.720
I read the other day
that Google X now

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.800
has to add a little
pinch of science fiction

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.710
to every project, which
could be actually disastrous,

00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:07.475
but that's a good start.

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:14.860
To add to that
more specifically,

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:17.100
I think that one of
the things that Google

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.350
has shown other
companies is that there

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:22.110
is a potential
for learning a lot

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:23.940
from massive amounts of data.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:26.710
And as I hinted earlier, what
environmental science needs

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:29.380
right now is massive
data gathering

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:31.880
and massive simulations
based on that data

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.600
so that we can
start to understand

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:35.210
the machine that's the planet.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:37.210
And so I think that
Google provides

00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:41.360
a nice model for how
that could be done.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:45.360
How you sell advertising
to environmental simulation

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:50.870
technology, I leave to the
future to figure that out.

00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:54.070
AUDIENCE: So you've talked a
lot about genetic engineering

00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:57.000
and genetic
evolution that we can

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.870
use on ourselves to
go towards the future.

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.435
But what cultural
and social evolutions

00:55:01.435 --> 00:55:03.700
do you see as also
being, or possibly

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:06.160
more necessary, in
order for us to have

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.620
a more positive
outlook for our future?

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.560
ANNALEE NEWITZ: That's
a huge question.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:18.620
And one of the things that I
consciously did in this book

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:21.300
and in my research was
focus on the science

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:23.490
and the technology and
the engineering questions,

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:26.830
because many of those are
close to being solved,

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:30.690
which is great news for
engineers and scientists

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:32.460
because yay, we've
fixed everything.

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:35.540
Now we just have to
get implementation.

00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.510
How do we scale it
and how do we get

00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:41.960
people to adopt these
radical ways of looking

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.520
at the environment
or the future?

00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:49.330
I think the main things that
we need to change, really, are

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:51.040
how we plan for the future.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.540
I think that's one
of the biggest issues

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:59.010
that humans have to deal with
is thinking in terms of not just

00:55:59.010 --> 00:56:00.970
next year, but what's
going to happen

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:03.010
in a generation or
two generations.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:05.052
And I think that's one
of the big problems

00:56:05.052 --> 00:56:06.760
that people who talk
about climate change

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.210
deal with, because they're
talking in these 100 year time

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.590
spans, and ordinary
people say, well,

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:14.160
how can you tell from a
computer simulation what's

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.870
going to happen in 100 years?

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:17.890
It's very hard to
answer that question.

00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:20.772
To us, that might be like,
well, duh, of course.

00:56:20.772 --> 00:56:22.230
Because we've put
in all the inputs

00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:25.070
and we have a picture
of what might happen,

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:29.350
a statistically likely
picture of what might happen.

00:56:29.350 --> 00:56:31.110
There's many things
that we can do.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:33.220
There's science
education to get people

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:35.436
thinking about this stuff.

00:56:35.436 --> 00:56:37.060
There's ways of
getting people to think

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:43.270
about changing how we treat
the environment by thinking

00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:46.020
about things like food
security and energy security

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:49.360
instead of saving the animals,
which I really want to save

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.330
the animals, but that's
a hard sell for people.

00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:56.460
But if you can say, we're
saving the future of food

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.850
or we're saving the
future of energy,

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.580
that allows groups like
the Department of Energy,

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:05.050
which is really investing
heavily in alternative energies

00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:09.800
right now, that helps them
frame the story in a more

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.690
pallatable way for people
across the political spectrum.

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:16.770
So I think it involves reframing
the questions a little bit.

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:19.340
That's why I like to
use the term survival,

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:21.130
because I think that
everyone understands

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:25.670
the value of surviving and
their lineage surviving.

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:32.510
And I think hopefully,
our ideas are

00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:34.470
going to evolve alongside
the technologies.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:37.350
And I just want to finished
with a somewhat utopian thought

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:40.320
here, which is
that when you start

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.660
getting frustrated about how
people aren't changing quickly

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.860
enough to fix things, consider
the fact that we didn't even

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.190
know that there was a
carbon cycle 50 years ago.

00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.950
We really didn't.

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:54.410
We didn't realize that
what humans were doing,

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:57.930
our Industrial Revolution, was
equivalent to a mega volcano

00:57:57.930 --> 00:57:59.640
going off in Siberia
for 1,000 years.

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.520
We just didn't know that.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:04.930
And 50 years later,
environmental issues

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:07.030
and alternative
energy issues are

00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:12.140
at the top of many
political leaders' lists

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.880
of things they at least have
to pay lip service to, if not

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:20.570
actually engage in terms of
policy and policy changes.

00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:23.640
So that's a huge--
that's one generation

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:27.900
we went from totally
clueless to actually starting

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:29.650
to think about
solving the problem.

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:33.880
So humans actually do
solve things over time.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:35.930
We also screw things
up, I realize that.

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.470
There's the whole
Middle Ages issue.

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:44.460
But at the same time,
I have hope that

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.350
in perhaps even a
shorter time span

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:49.680
than we thought may be able to
solve some of these problems.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:50.580
Thanks very much.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:53.030
[APPLAUSE]
