00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.950
 
so so welcome to this session in which

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
so so welcome to this session in which
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.580
so so welcome to this session in which
we are discussing trust in science with

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590
we are discussing trust in science with
 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.490
we are discussing trust in science with
Peter Doherty and Steven Chu both of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
Peter Doherty and Steven Chu both of
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.349
Peter Doherty and Steven Chu both of
them Nobel laureates as you know and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
them Nobel laureates as you know and
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.820
them Nobel laureates as you know and
you'll have met them already today now

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830
you'll have met them already today now
 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.040
you'll have met them already today now
I'll run the conversation between us for

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
I'll run the conversation between us for
 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.509
I'll run the conversation between us for
a while and then I will come out to the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
a while and then I will come out to the
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.519
a while and then I will come out to the
audience for questions as well which we

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529
audience for questions as well which we
 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.590
audience for questions as well which we
shall listen to through these also so

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600
shall listen to through these also so
 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.310
shall listen to through these also so
trust in science surveys by people like

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
trust in science surveys by people like
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560
trust in science surveys by people like
the Pew trust charitable trust or it's

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
the Pew trust charitable trust or it's
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.209
the Pew trust charitable trust or it's
awesome re in the UK tell us that

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
awesome re in the UK tell us that
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.310
awesome re in the UK tell us that
actually scientists are a very trusted

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
actually scientists are a very trusted
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.319
actually scientists are a very trusted
group of people and trust in scientists

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
group of people and trust in scientists
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.100
group of people and trust in scientists
is increasing and we as scientists know

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
is increasing and we as scientists know
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.310
is increasing and we as scientists know
that scientists are trustworthy people

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320
that scientists are trustworthy people
 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.650
that scientists are trustworthy people
but there is also there are also clear

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
but there is also there are also clear
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.869
but there is also there are also clear
cases where trust in science seems to be

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
cases where trust in science seems to be
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.700
cases where trust in science seems to be
evaporating so first of all let me just

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
evaporating so first of all let me just
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.340
evaporating so first of all let me just
start by saying do you think that people

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
start by saying do you think that people
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.640
start by saying do you think that people
do have trust in science Steve I think

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650
do have trust in science Steve I think
 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.210
do have trust in science Steve I think
in general yes they do have a trust but

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220
in general yes they do have a trust but
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.469
in general yes they do have a trust but
it's a strange kind of trust because

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479
it's a strange kind of trust because
 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.469
it's a strange kind of trust because
it's a trust because we see there it's

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479
it's a trust because we see there it's
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.999
it's a trust because we see there it's
not a strange country it makes perfect

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
not a strange country it makes perfect
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.230
not a strange country it makes perfect
sense

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
sense
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.560
sense
we have no axe to grind most of us don't

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
we have no axe to grind most of us don't
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.510
we have no axe to grind most of us don't
aren't making money on this there's no

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
aren't making money on this there's no
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.440
aren't making money on this there's no
financial entanglements but yet in that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
financial entanglements but yet in that
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.069
financial entanglements but yet in that
same Pew survey there is a strange thing

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
same Pew survey there is a strange thing
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.679
same Pew survey there is a strange thing
growing there's a growing uncertainty

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689
growing there's a growing uncertainty
 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.640
growing there's a growing uncertainty
about vaccines that vaccines might not

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650
about vaccines that vaccines might not
 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.609
about vaccines that vaccines might not
be good for you and yet it vaccines have

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
be good for you and yet it vaccines have
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.450
be good for you and yet it vaccines have
had a profound influence on human health

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460
had a profound influence on human health
 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.270
had a profound influence on human health
there is a disconnect between what

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
there is a disconnect between what
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.490
there is a disconnect between what
scientists think what the public thinks

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
scientists think what the public thinks
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.580
scientists think what the public thinks
and what some other embedded industries

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590
and what some other embedded industries
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.260
and what some other embedded industries
think about climate change and so they

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
think about climate change and so they
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.700
think about climate change and so they
actually break down and go through this

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
actually break down and go through this
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.929
actually break down and go through this
list and some of these attack points are

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939
list and some of these attack points are
 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.609
list and some of these attack points are
genetically modified crops again there's

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619
genetically modified crops again there's
 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.170
genetically modified crops again there's
a fraction of very vocal loud people who

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
a fraction of very vocal loud people who
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.540
a fraction of very vocal loud people who
say that this is inherently dangerous

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
say that this is inherently dangerous
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.240
say that this is inherently dangerous
and they tried to stoke fear and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250
and they tried to stoke fear and
 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.440
and they tried to stoke fear and
suspicion about

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450
suspicion about
 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.430
suspicion about
and yet the thing about genetically

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440
and yet the thing about genetically
 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.500
and yet the thing about genetically
modified crops is it's used in the right

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
modified crops is it's used in the right
 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.729
modified crops is it's used in the right
way you know Monsanto was very tone-deaf

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739
way you know Monsanto was very tone-deaf
 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.830
way you know Monsanto was very tone-deaf
but if using the right way it can

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840
but if using the right way it can
 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.900
but if using the right way it can
actually feed many more people keep

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910
actually feed many more people keep
 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.170
actually feed many more people keep
developing people's farms functioning in

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180
developing people's farms functioning in
 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.330
developing people's farms functioning in
a way that could feed people with less

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
a way that could feed people with less
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.699
a way that could feed people with less
pesticides less herbicides and so on and

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709
pesticides less herbicides and so on and
 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.040
pesticides less herbicides and so on and
so again you know there are these

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050
so again you know there are these
 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.020
so again you know there are these
conflicts and I think things like that

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030
conflicts and I think things like that
 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.690
conflicts and I think things like that
are growing yes it's interesting the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700
are growing yes it's interesting the
 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.970
are growing yes it's interesting the
vaccines you guys particularly in fact

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980
vaccines you guys particularly in fact
 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.009
vaccines you guys particularly in fact
things that the distrust of vaccines is

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019
things that the distrust of vaccines is
 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.160
things that the distrust of vaccines is
interesting because it goes right across

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170
interesting because it goes right across
 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.070
interesting because it goes right across
the spectrum in different ways from left

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080
the spectrum in different ways from left
 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.000
the spectrum in different ways from left
to right yeah a lot of the rejection of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010
to right yeah a lot of the rejection of
 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.880
to right yeah a lot of the rejection of
vaccines that we see for instance in

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
vaccines that we see for instance in
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.840
vaccines that we see for instance in
Australia would be on the one hand

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850
Australia would be on the one hand
 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.990
Australia would be on the one hand
you've got very well-to-do women

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000
you've got very well-to-do women
 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.840
you've got very well-to-do women
particularly who reject vaccinations for

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850
particularly who reject vaccinations for
 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.120
particularly who reject vaccinations for
various types of reasons to do with

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130
various types of reasons to do with
 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.170
various types of reasons to do with
personal empowerment and and and and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180
personal empowerment and and and and
 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.720
personal empowerment and and and and
they may believe some of the propaganda

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730
they may believe some of the propaganda
 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.630
they may believe some of the propaganda
around the MMR vaccine and so forth even

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640
around the MMR vaccine and so forth even
 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.270
around the MMR vaccine and so forth even
though that's been so rigorously refuted

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280
though that's been so rigorously refuted
 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.880
though that's been so rigorously refuted
by so many scientific studies and on the

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890
by so many scientific studies and on the
 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:26.990
by so many scientific studies and on the
other hand you'll have this sort of

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000
other hand you'll have this sort of
 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.420
other hand you'll have this sort of
alternative lifestyle community that

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
alternative lifestyle community that
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.960
alternative lifestyle community that
will it will it will reject the vaccine

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970
will it will it will reject the vaccine
 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.539
will it will it will reject the vaccine
approach though much of actually the

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549
approach though much of actually the
 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.670
approach though much of actually the
failure to uptake vaccines is simply

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680
failure to uptake vaccines is simply
 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.180
failure to uptake vaccines is simply
disorganization and nothing not getting

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190
disorganization and nothing not getting
 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.940
disorganization and nothing not getting
around to it then but on the under GM

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950
around to it then but on the under GM
 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.940
around to it then but on the under GM
side it really polarizes on what one

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950
side it really polarizes on what one
 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.560
side it really polarizes on what one
thinks is the left of the political

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570
thinks is the left of the political
 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.880
thinks is the left of the political
spectrum and it was very much stood up

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890
spectrum and it was very much stood up
 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.160
spectrum and it was very much stood up
on Monsanto and the way they went about

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170
on Monsanto and the way they went about
 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.800
on Monsanto and the way they went about
it and the suspicion that Monsanto is

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810
it and the suspicion that Monsanto is
 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.210
it and the suspicion that Monsanto is
trying to take over the world seed

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
trying to take over the world seed
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.460
trying to take over the world seed
supply and they're going to control

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470
supply and they're going to control
 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.559
supply and they're going to control
farmers and they're going to dictate and

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569
farmers and they're going to dictate and
 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.530
farmers and they're going to dictate and
and they have dictated in some senses

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540
and they have dictated in some senses
 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.479
and they have dictated in some senses
which have really been quite obnoxious

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489
which have really been quite obnoxious
 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.319
which have really been quite obnoxious
but then there's the great advantages of

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329
but then there's the great advantages of
 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.479
but then there's the great advantages of
for instance trying to make drought

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489
for instance trying to make drought
 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.909
for instance trying to make drought
resistant grains and so with using GM

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919
resistant grains and so with using GM
 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.430
resistant grains and so with using GM

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.930
you're injecting to children so we had
an instance in Australia for instance

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:56.940
an instance in Australia for instance
 

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.110
an instance in Australia for instance
where a formulation of the influenza

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120
where a formulation of the influenza
 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.879
where a formulation of the influenza
vaccine and influenza vaccines are

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:01.889
vaccine and influenza vaccines are
 

00:08:01.889 --> 00:08:03.920
vaccine and influenza vaccines are
problematic at various levels I work in

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:03.930
problematic at various levels I work in
 

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.140
problematic at various levels I work in
the influenza area but this influenza

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.150
the influenza area but this influenza
 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.290
the influenza area but this influenza
vaccine was actually causing fever in

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:09.300
vaccine was actually causing fever in
 

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.930
vaccine was actually causing fever in
some small children and when children

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940
some small children and when children
 

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.159
some small children and when children
small turn will get fever they go into

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:13.169
small turn will get fever they go into
 

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:15.649
small turn will get fever they go into
febrile convulsions and at least one

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:15.659
febrile convulsions and at least one
 

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:17.750
febrile convulsions and at least one
child was severely damaged by this so

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:17.760
child was severely damaged by this so
 

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.450
child was severely damaged by this so
that vaccine was just not acceptable but

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460
that vaccine was just not acceptable but
 

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.610
that vaccine was just not acceptable but
there was no reason to think it would do

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620
there was no reason to think it would do
 

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.740
there was no reason to think it would do
that I mean the flu vaccines are made

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:24.750
that I mean the flu vaccines are made
 

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.810
that I mean the flu vaccines are made
every year and all the rest of it so it

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:26.820
every year and all the rest of it so it
 

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.610
every year and all the rest of it so it
was an aberration the vaccine was the

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620
was an aberration the vaccine was the
 

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.260
was an aberration the vaccine was the
vaccination would stop very quickly but

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:30.270
vaccination would stop very quickly but
 

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.540
vaccination would stop very quickly but
but so there are some instance like the

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:32.550
but so there are some instance like the
 

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.000
but so there are some instance like the
measles mumps rubella story is based in

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.010
measles mumps rubella story is based in
 

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.500
measles mumps rubella story is based in
a very bad paper that was published

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:36.510
a very bad paper that was published
 

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.170
a very bad paper that was published
unfortunately in The Lancet which is a

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180
unfortunately in The Lancet which is a
 

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.790

leading scientific journal should never
 

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.350
leading scientific journal should never
be published very limited number of

cases it turns out later they were
 

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.890
cases it turns out later they were
selected in various ways which quite

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:45.900
selected in various ways which quite
 

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.800
selected in various ways which quite
unethical and but what the guy who is

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:48.810
unethical and but what the guy who is
 

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.660
unethical and but what the guy who is
the key to the study was saying not

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:50.670
the key to the study was saying not
 

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.300
the key to the study was saying not
saying it's not a problem for vaccinate

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.310
saying it's not a problem for vaccinate
 

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.769
saying it's not a problem for vaccinate
against

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:53.779
against
 

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:55.960
against
measles mumps and rubella what's a

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:55.970
measles mumps and rubella what's a
 

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.410
measles mumps and rubella what's a
problem is to combine the three and so

00:08:59.410 --> 00:08:59.420
problem is to combine the three and so
 

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.239
problem is to combine the three and so
he wasn't trying to say don't vaccinate

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:01.249
he wasn't trying to say don't vaccinate
 

00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.929
he wasn't trying to say don't vaccinate
he was saying don't use this vaccine and

00:09:03.929 --> 00:09:03.939
he was saying don't use this vaccine and
 

00:09:03.939 --> 00:09:07.949
he was saying don't use this vaccine and
and that's sort of sort of evolved into

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959
and that's sort of sort of evolved into
 

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.319
and that's sort of sort of evolved into
the idea that vaccination is dangerous I

00:09:11.319 --> 00:09:11.329
the idea that vaccination is dangerous I
 

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:13.799
the idea that vaccination is dangerous I
think one of the first things I was told

00:09:13.799 --> 00:09:13.809
think one of the first things I was told
 

00:09:13.809 --> 00:09:19.689
think one of the first things I was told
wit by I think was Francis Collins one

00:09:19.689 --> 00:09:19.699
wit by I think was Francis Collins one
 

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:20.949
wit by I think was Francis Collins one
of the first things he was asked by

00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959
of the first things he was asked by
 

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:22.600
of the first things he was asked by
presidents Trump is what are you gonna

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:22.610
presidents Trump is what are you gonna
 

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:25.059
presidents Trump is what are you gonna
do about vaccines and autism so you know

00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:25.069
do about vaccines and autism so you know
 

00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:27.340
do about vaccines and autism so you know
so it's it's it's in the it's in Trump

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:27.350
so it's it's it's in the it's in Trump
 

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.360
so it's it's it's in the it's in Trump
world public psyche let's pan out a bit

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:31.370
world public psyche let's pan out a bit
 

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.090
world public psyche let's pan out a bit
and talk about bad papers because that's

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:34.100
and talk about bad papers because that's
 

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.319
and talk about bad papers because that's
also something perhaps that is

00:09:35.319 --> 00:09:35.329
also something perhaps that is
 

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:37.689
also something perhaps that is
undermining trust in science there is a

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:37.699
undermining trust in science there is a
 

00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:40.960
undermining trust in science there is a
feeling that there is scientific

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:40.970
feeling that there is scientific
 

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.949
feeling that there is scientific
misconduct out there and that people are

00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959
misconduct out there and that people are
 

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.079
misconduct out there and that people are
fraudulently publishing papers or these

00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:47.089
fraudulently publishing papers or these
 

00:09:47.089 --> 00:09:50.139
fraudulently publishing papers or these
bad papers are being published of course

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:50.149
bad papers are being published of course
 

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:52.389
bad papers are being published of course
it's a very small number but when you

00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399
it's a very small number but when you
 

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:54.340
it's a very small number but when you
have things like retraction watch going

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:54.350
have things like retraction watch going
 

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.619
have things like retraction watch going
on that sort of highlights this to the

00:09:56.619 --> 00:09:56.629
on that sort of highlights this to the
 

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:58.059
on that sort of highlights this to the
public do you think there's a problem

00:09:58.059 --> 00:09:58.069
public do you think there's a problem
 

00:09:58.069 --> 00:10:01.030
public do you think there's a problem
with scientific misconduct or I let's go

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040
with scientific misconduct or I let's go
 

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.799
with scientific misconduct or I let's go
with bad papers let's start with bad

00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:02.809
with bad papers let's start with bad
 

00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:06.670
with bad papers let's start with bad
papers there are a lot of bad papers in

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680
papers there are a lot of bad papers in
 

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.439
papers there are a lot of bad papers in
the sense that so here publish that

00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:11.449
the sense that so here publish that
 

00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:14.290
the sense that so here publish that
you're maybe not as careful about all

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:14.300
you're maybe not as careful about all
 

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.389
you're maybe not as careful about all
the controls you have to do and the

00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399
the controls you have to do and the
 

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.309
the controls you have to do and the
pressure to publish is mounting mounting

00:10:18.309 --> 00:10:18.319
pressure to publish is mounting mounting
 

00:10:18.319 --> 00:10:21.490
pressure to publish is mounting mounting
mounting and so there are many things

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:21.500
mounting and so there are many things
 

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.650
mounting and so there are many things
especially in the bio I come from

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:23.660
especially in the bio I come from
 

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.480
especially in the bio I come from
physics which you know there's a

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:25.490
physics which you know there's a
 

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.519
physics which you know there's a
theoretical basis and there are other

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:27.529
theoretical basis and there are other
 

00:10:27.529 --> 00:10:30.429
theoretical basis and there are other
things you can do and when I start going

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:30.439
things you can do and when I start going
 

00:10:30.439 --> 00:10:33.160
things you can do and when I start going
in biology 25 30 years ago in the early

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.170
in biology 25 30 years ago in the early
 

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.369
in biology 25 30 years ago in the early
90s that long ago I heard the expression

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:36.379
90s that long ago I heard the expression
 

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:41.160
90s that long ago I heard the expression
in my hands this is what we get

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.170
 
 

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.919
 
that's not science

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:43.929
that's not science
 

00:10:43.929 --> 00:10:45.879
that's not science
you're supposed to be publishing

00:10:45.879 --> 00:10:45.889
you're supposed to be publishing
 

00:10:45.889 --> 00:10:47.939
you're supposed to be publishing
something that anyone can reproduce and

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:47.949
something that anyone can reproduce and
 

00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:51.549
something that anyone can reproduce and
and so so this is one of the issues and

00:10:51.549 --> 00:10:51.559
and so so this is one of the issues and
 

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:53.679
and so so this is one of the issues and
so there's a lot of things so I think

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:53.689
so there's a lot of things so I think
 

00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:55.780
so there's a lot of things so I think
scientists have to take up a bit higher

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:55.790
scientists have to take up a bit higher
 

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.269
scientists have to take up a bit higher
responsibility the number of purposely

00:10:58.269 --> 00:10:58.279
responsibility the number of purposely
 

00:10:58.279 --> 00:11:00.610
responsibility the number of purposely
fraudulent things is very small but

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:00.620
fraudulent things is very small but
 

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.139
fraudulent things is very small but
there's this other thing that is

00:11:02.139 --> 00:11:02.149
there's this other thing that is
 

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:04.720
there's this other thing that is
encroaching so it reproducibility of

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:04.730
encroaching so it reproducibility of
 

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.910
encroaching so it reproducibility of
papers is becoming in geology a huge

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920
papers is becoming in geology a huge
 

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.460
papers is becoming in geology a huge
problem

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.470

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.830
problem

has become environments and yes part of
 

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.660

it is the complexity of these systems I

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:14.670
it is the complexity of these systems I
 

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.390
it is the complexity of these systems I
think physics looking at physics as an

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:17.400
think physics looking at physics as an
 

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.030
think physics looking at physics as an
outsider a physicists on the whole

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040
outsider a physicists on the whole
 

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.870
outsider a physicists on the whole
pretty straight

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880
pretty straight
 

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.820
pretty straight
I mean physicists are trained as

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:22.830
I mean physicists are trained as
 

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.260
I mean physicists are trained as
scientists that they're very bright

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:24.270
scientists that they're very bright
 

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.860
scientists that they're very bright
people as anything

people as anything
 

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.270
people as anything
I mean Alfred Nobel thought the

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:29.280
I mean Alfred Nobel thought the
 

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.590
I mean Alfred Nobel thought the
businesses were the smartest people on

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600
businesses were the smartest people on
 

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.180
businesses were the smartest people on
earth that's why the people who sit on

earth that's why the people who sit on
 

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.720
earth that's why the people who sit on
the stage first the physicists and the

the stage first the physicists and the
 

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.570
the stage first the physicists and the
chemists then the Medeco and then the

but the point about biomedical science

00:13:28.889 --> 00:13:28.899
but the point about biomedical science
 

00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:31.650
but the point about biomedical science
is it's moving forward at an incredible

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:31.660
is it's moving forward at an incredible
 

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.019

there were three or four of us on a

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:17.009
there were three or four of us on a
 

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:18.620
there were three or four of us on a
research paper and we all understood

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:18.630
research paper and we all understood
 

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.509
research paper and we all understood
what was going on we knew the technology

00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519
what was going on we knew the technology
 

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:21.769
what was going on we knew the technology
and we could make wonderful

00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:21.779
and we could make wonderful
 

00:16:21.779 --> 00:16:23.629
and we could make wonderful
generalizations because we couldn't do

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639
generalizations because we couldn't do
 

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:26.569

the experiments it was much more fun and

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:26.579
the experiments it was much more fun and
 

00:16:26.579 --> 00:16:28.850
the experiments it was much more fun and
we were having my theoretical physicist

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860
we were having my theoretical physicist
 

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.370
we were having my theoretical physicist
and that's not really true but now

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:33.380
and that's not really true but now
 

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.780
and that's not really true but now
because of the enormous power of

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:35.790
because of the enormous power of
 

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:38.210
because of the enormous power of
technology much of which has actually

technology much of which has actually
 

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.009
technology much of which has actually
come from the physicists and the

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:40.019
come from the physicists and the
 

00:16:40.019 --> 00:16:41.420
come from the physicists and the

engineers who have given us these
 

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.900
engineers who have given us these
wonderful instruments and then from the

wonderful instruments and then from the
 

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.639

computational people who do the analyses
 

00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:49.550
computational people who do the analyses
but because of that power of technology

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560
but because of that power of technology
 

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.340
but because of that power of technology
every subfield has become much more

every subfield has become much more
 

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.559
every subfield has become much more
complex and much more specialized and

when we do a study say a cancer study or
infectious disease study we may be

nobody on that research paper is
 

00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:07.029
nobody on that research paper is
actually right across the whole thing

00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039
actually right across the whole thing
 

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:09.740
actually right across the whole thing
it's not just not possible to be right

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:09.750
it's not just not possible to be right
 

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.500
it's not just not possible to be right
across it and so I mean Trust is

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:12.510
across it and so I mean Trust is
 

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.409

as an aside when I remember watching the

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:17.250
as an aside when I remember watching the
 

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:19.159
as an aside when I remember watching the
press conference from the LHC results

00:17:19.159 --> 00:17:19.169
press conference from the LHC results
 

00:17:19.169 --> 00:17:22.010
press conference from the LHC results
and I was amazed by how much agreement

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020
and I was amazed by how much agreement
 

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.260
and I was amazed by how much agreement
there was between people when they were

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:24.270
there was between people when they were
 

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.699
there was between people when they were
looking at the results and I asked a

00:17:25.699 --> 00:17:25.709
looking at the results and I asked a
 

00:17:25.709 --> 00:17:29.210
looking at the results and I asked a
theoretical physicist how come

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220
theoretical physicist how come
 

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.940
theoretical physicist how come
everybody's in agreement and he said

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:31.950
everybody's in agreement and he said
 

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:32.990
everybody's in agreement and he said
well the thing about physics

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000
well the thing about physics
 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.480
well the thing about physics
experimental physics physics is that

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:35.490
experimental physics physics is that
 

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.039
experimental physics physics is that
it's so expensive that we all have to

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:37.049
it's so expensive that we all have to
 

00:17:37.049 --> 00:17:39.690
it's so expensive that we all have to
agree before we do the experiment

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:39.700
agree before we do the experiment
 

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.750
agree before we do the experiment
and I don't know that's true but is

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760
and I don't know that's true but is
 

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.210
and I don't know that's true but is
there a problem in physics it seems to

science to the general public
Steve no for a lot of reasons but one of

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:31.640
Steve no for a lot of reasons but one of
 

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.670
Steve no for a lot of reasons but one of
the things that's the driving force in

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:33.680
the things that's the driving force in
 

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.350
the things that's the driving force in
the media is to sell copy because the

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360
the media is to sell copy because the
 

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.510
the media is to sell copy because the
print media the televised media all the

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520
print media the televised media all the
 

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.910
print media the televised media all the
media are competing with these bubble

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:42.920
media are competing with these bubble
 

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.890
media are competing with these bubble
knitter Internet things where you only

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:44.900
knitter Internet things where you only
 

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.380
knitter Internet things where you only
talk to your friends and old friends

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:47.390
talk to your friends and old friends
 

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:48.760
talk to your friends and old friends
talk to their friends and they don't

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:48.770
talk to their friends and they don't
 

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.120
talk to their friends and they don't
talk to others and they wanted to

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:52.130
talk to others and they wanted to
 

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.760
talk to others and they wanted to
compete and so how do you compete you

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:54.770
compete and so how do you compete you
 

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.000
compete and so how do you compete you
actually present the other side the

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.010
actually present the other side the
 

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.950
actually present the other side the
alternative view and they will search

00:23:59.950 --> 00:23:59.960
alternative view and they will search
 

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.140
alternative view and they will search
long and hard for some alternative view

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.150
long and hard for some alternative view
 

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.580
long and hard for some alternative view
and so unfortunately some very minority

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:06.590
and so unfortunately some very minority
 

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.820
and so unfortunately some very minority
position then almost gets elevated to

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:09.830
position then almost gets elevated to
 

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:13.420
position then almost gets elevated to
the same position as as you know much

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:13.430
the same position as as you know much
 

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.060
the same position as as you know much
more serious science and so that is very

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:16.070
more serious science and so that is very
 

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.450
more serious science and so that is very
disturbing the other thing is

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:18.460
disturbing the other thing is
 

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:21.250
disturbing the other thing is
the quality of scientific employers the

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:21.260
the quality of scientific employers the
 

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.350
the quality of scientific employers the
number of quality science reporters is

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360
number of quality science reporters is
 

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.420
number of quality science reporters is
diminishing and and that that's a

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:25.430
diminishing and and that that's a
 

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.340
diminishing and and that that's a
problem yeah I mean particularly a

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:27.350
problem yeah I mean particularly a
 

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.750
problem yeah I mean particularly a
problem in the print media where the

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760
problem in the print media where the
 

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.020
problem in the print media where the
under enormous pressure because online

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.030
under enormous pressure because online
 

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.550
under enormous pressure because online
information free information and so

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:33.560
information free information and so
 

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.220
information free information and so
forth and and so that we've been losing

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:36.230
forth and and so that we've been losing
 

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.480
forth and and so that we've been losing
a lot of a lot of our good science

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:37.490
a lot of a lot of our good science
 

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.190
a lot of a lot of our good science
journalists but we also have middie a

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200
journalists but we also have middie a
 

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.800
journalists but we also have middie a
very substantial media organizations for

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:41.810
very substantial media organizations for
 

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:43.900
very substantial media organizations for
instance which will simply not report

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:43.910
instance which will simply not report
 

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.850
instance which will simply not report
anything factual on climate change they

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:45.860
anything factual on climate change they
 

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.980
anything factual on climate change they
will go to any alternative source and

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:47.990
will go to any alternative source and
 

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:52.090
will go to any alternative source and
that I mean Fox News for instance which

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:52.100
that I mean Fox News for instance which
 

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.060
that I mean Fox News for instance which
will will simply in anything serious

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.070
will will simply in anything serious
 

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.740
will will simply in anything serious
they if they report it they will

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:56.750
they if they report it they will
 

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.410
they if they report it they will
trivialize it and so we're getting a

00:24:59.410 --> 00:24:59.420
trivialize it and so we're getting a
 

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.800
trivialize it and so we're getting a
deliberate dissembling in elements in

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:02.810
deliberate dissembling in elements in
 

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.750
deliberate dissembling in elements in
the media on the other hand of course we

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760
the media on the other hand of course we
 

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.620
the media on the other hand of course we
have sort of people who are professional

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:07.630
have sort of people who are professional
 

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.330
have sort of people who are professional

the rest of us who who try to do the

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:15.110
the rest of us who who try to do the
 

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:16.480
the rest of us who who try to do the
right thing and try to do a reasonably

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:16.490
right thing and try to do a reasonably
 

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:19.180
right thing and try to do a reasonably
good job and unfortunately it doesn't

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:19.190
good job and unfortunately it doesn't
 

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:22.120
good job and unfortunately it doesn't
really I think it often fails to get

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.130
really I think it often fails to get
 

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.040
really I think it often fails to get
across to people the essence of science

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:24.050
across to people the essence of science
 

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.810
across to people the essence of science
and how it actually works and what it

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:25.820
and how it actually works and what it
 

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.490
and how it actually works and what it
does and what it's what our strengths

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:27.500
does and what it's what our strengths
 

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.230
does and what it's what our strengths
and limitations are it often comes

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:29.240
and limitations are it often comes
 

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.820
and limitations are it often comes
across as sort of gee wizards and this

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:30.830
across as sort of gee wizards and this
 

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.740
across as sort of gee wizards and this
wonderful stuff but but the other thing

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:32.750
wonderful stuff but but the other thing
 

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:35.290
wonderful stuff but but the other thing
about on one side you says what we

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:35.300
about on one side you says what we
 

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.380
about on one side you says what we
reported this story and that's it and

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:37.390
reported this story and that's it and
 

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:39.970
reported this story and that's it and
the other side just wants to repeat over

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:39.980
the other side just wants to repeat over
 

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:42.400
the other side just wants to repeat over
and over and over again because as I

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:42.410
and over and over again because as I
 

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.820
and over and over again because as I
said this morning you know I may not

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:45.830
said this morning you know I may not
 

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.410
said this morning you know I may not
have said it in public but I said it in

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:47.420
have said it in public but I said it in
 

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.910
have said it in public but I said it in
you know in breakfast Lucy from peanuts

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:51.920
you know in breakfast Lucy from peanuts
 

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.950
you know in breakfast Lucy from peanuts
cartoons she has her hand she's shaking

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960
cartoons she has her hand she's shaking
 

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.010
cartoons she has her hand she's shaking

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:57.020
and says I may not be right but I'm loud
 

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.850
and says I may not be right but I'm loud
and and the present the current

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:00.860
and and the present the current
 

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:09.180
and and the present the current
president United States is is all that

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.950
 
so I'm following a track you started

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960
so I'm following a track you started
 

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.290
so I'm following a track you started

that medium maybe not doing a good job
 

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.900
that medium maybe not doing a good job
in getting across the way that science

in getting across the way that science
 

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.820
in getting across the way that science
operates but perhaps that's also true of

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000
started
 

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.730
started
because they were learned here's what to

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740
because they were learned here's what to
 

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.670
because they were learned here's what to
memorize and so we're totally rewriting

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:28.680
memorize and so we're totally rewriting
 

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.230
memorize and so we're totally rewriting
education in physics chemistry

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240
education in physics chemistry
 

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:34.430
education in physics chemistry
especially is to say no we want to teach

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440
especially is to say no we want to teach
 

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.070
especially is to say no we want to teach
people how to think and so that's the

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080
people how to think and so that's the
 

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.530
people how to think and so that's the
most important thing and where we were

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:39.540
most important thing and where we were
 

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.260
most important thing and where we were
going backwards and so this is a new

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:42.270
going backwards and so this is a new
 

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.690
going backwards and so this is a new
realization that we were doing it all

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700
realization that we were doing it all
 

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.220
realization that we were doing it all
wrong it's only when you get to graduate

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:46.230
wrong it's only when you get to graduate
 

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.140
wrong it's only when you get to graduate
school and postdoc that you begin to

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:48.150
school and postdoc that you begin to
 

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:50.410
school and postdoc that you begin to
teach people how to think again but boy

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:50.420
teach people how to think again but boy
 

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:52.520
teach people how to think again but boy
most people don't go to graduate school

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:52.530
most people don't go to graduate school
 

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.100
most people don't go to graduate school
and become postdocs they have to learn

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:55.110
and become postdocs they have to learn
 

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.500
and become postdocs they have to learn
this in grade school high school and

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:57.510
this in grade school high school and
 

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.900
this in grade school high school and
college there's something about our

00:27:59.900 --> 00:27:59.910
college there's something about our
 

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.850
college there's something about our
education system that actually turns

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860
education system that actually turns
 

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.190
education system that actually turns
large numbers of people off science

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200
large numbers of people off science
 

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.190
large numbers of people off science
totally and and and you get people who

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200
totally and and and you get people who
 

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.350
totally and and and you get people who
are highly intelligent people educated

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360
are highly intelligent people educated
 

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.870
are highly intelligent people educated
in the more arts side of things if they

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880
in the more arts side of things if they
 

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.640
in the more arts side of things if they
come across anything that's science for

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:13.650
come across anything that's science for
 

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.810
come across anything that's science for
instance in a book that will immediately

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820
instance in a book that will immediately
 

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.720
instance in a book that will immediately
drop it immediately turn off and I

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:17.730
drop it immediately turn off and I
 

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.990
drop it immediately turn off and I
that's pretty unfortunate given that

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000
that's pretty unfortunate given that
 

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.180
that's pretty unfortunate given that
given this transformational power of

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:23.190
given this transformational power of
 

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.320
given this transformational power of
science on our lives that the fact that

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:24.330
science on our lives that the fact that
 

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:25.610
science on our lives that the fact that
were always having all having to make

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.620
were always having all having to make
 

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.050
were always having all having to make
science-based decisions all the time

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:27.060
science-based decisions all the time
 

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:29.060
science-based decisions all the time
whether it's about climate change or

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.070
whether it's about climate change or
 

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.160
whether it's about climate change or
GMOs or whatever it's pretty important

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:31.170
GMOs or whatever it's pretty important
 

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:32.540
GMOs or whatever it's pretty important
that we should have some kind of proper

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:32.550
that we should have some kind of proper
 

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.520
that we should have some kind of proper
grounding in it to enable us to make the

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:34.530
grounding in it to enable us to make the
 

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.250
grounding in it to enable us to make the
right decisions so right yes it seems a

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260
right decisions so right yes it seems a
 

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.900
right decisions so right yes it seems a
pretty fundamental challenge a grand

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:38.910
pretty fundamental challenge a grand
 

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:41.030
pretty fundamental challenge a grand
challenge for Humanity if you like to

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:41.040
challenge for Humanity if you like to
 

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.620
challenge for Humanity if you like to
have a generator to have the next

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:42.630
have a generator to have the next
 

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.120
have a generator to have the next
generations come up and be ready for

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:44.130
generations come up and be ready for
 

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:45.470
generations come up and be ready for
this well the great news

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480
this well the great news
 

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.020
this well the great news
is that you know like the four or five

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.030
is that you know like the four or five
 

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:52.210
is that you know like the four or five
steps to reform or whatever or sobriety

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:52.220
steps to reform or whatever or sobriety
 

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.010
steps to reform or whatever or sobriety
at least we know we were doing it wrong

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:55.020
at least we know we were doing it wrong
 

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.380
at least we know we were doing it wrong
before

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:56.390
before
 

00:28:56.390 --> 00:29:00.020
before
so that's the first step and and we're

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.030
so that's the first step and and we're
 

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.700
so that's the first step and and we're
doing a lot of experiments at Stanford

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:01.710
doing a lot of experiments at Stanford
 

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:05.210
doing a lot of experiments at Stanford
and everywhere else I think to try to

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:05.220
and everywhere else I think to try to
 

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.430
and everywhere else I think to try to
say how do you get you know how do you

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440
say how do you get you know how do you
 

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.980
say how do you get you know how do you
measure how people can actually assess

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:09.990
measure how people can actually assess
 

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.840
measure how people can actually assess
information and I think and how do you

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:11.850
information and I think and how do you
 

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.850
information and I think and how do you
actually get them to do it one of the

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:13.860
actually get them to do it one of the
 

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:17.060
actually get them to do it one of the
things that we found really powerful is

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.070
things that we found really powerful is
 

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.060
things that we found really powerful is
you start to ask questions in class and

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:20.070
you start to ask questions in class and
 

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:23.030
you start to ask questions in class and
let them go in a little group of one two

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:23.040
let them go in a little group of one two
 

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:23.450
let them go in a little group of one two
or three

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460
or three
 

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:26.080
or three
for a few minutes and then come back and

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.090
for a few minutes and then come back and
 

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.970
for a few minutes and then come back and
that begins to cement a lot of things

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980
that begins to cement a lot of things
 

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.760
that begins to cement a lot of things
and so it's not the professor drones on

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:31.770
and so it's not the professor drones on
 

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.830
and so it's not the professor drones on
they take the notes and everything you

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840
they take the notes and everything you
 

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.270
they take the notes and everything you
don't need to take the notes it's all

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:35.280
don't need to take the notes it's all
 

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.480
don't need to take the notes it's all
you can post it and everything else and

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:37.490
you can post it and everything else and
 

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.480
you can post it and everything else and
getting people engaged in real-time is

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:41.490
getting people engaged in real-time is
 

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.470
getting people engaged in real-time is
very very important yes I suppose that

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480
very very important yes I suppose that
 

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.570
very very important yes I suppose that
is sorry I keep on finding new tracks to

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580
is sorry I keep on finding new tracks to
 

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.549
is sorry I keep on finding new tracks to
go but I suppose the social side of

00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559
go but I suppose the social side of
 

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:51.169
go but I suppose the social side of
science is so important to get across

00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179
science is so important to get across
 

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:53.060
science is so important to get across
because again I think science is quite

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.070
because again I think science is quite
 

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.110
because again I think science is quite
often thought of as a rather

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120
often thought of as a rather
 

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.409
often thought of as a rather
individualistic activity yeah it's a

00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419
individualistic activity yeah it's a
 

00:29:57.419 --> 00:29:59.150
individualistic activity yeah it's a
very cooperative activity basically I

00:29:59.150 --> 00:29:59.160
very cooperative activity basically I
 

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.930
very cooperative activity basically I
mean the a good laboratory is really a

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940
mean the a good laboratory is really a
 

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.480
mean the a good laboratory is really a
sort of social social microcosm isn't it

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:05.490
sort of social social microcosm isn't it
 

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.190
sort of social social microcosm isn't it
I mean you've got all these interactions

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200
I mean you've got all these interactions
 

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.890
I mean you've got all these interactions
going on and a lot of what we do because

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:09.900
going on and a lot of what we do because
 

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.960
going on and a lot of what we do because
you have to do so many different types

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:11.970
you have to do so many different types
 

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.640
you have to do so many different types
of measurements you'll have a whole

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:13.650
of measurements you'll have a whole
 

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.289
of measurements you'll have a whole
bunch of people all coming together on a

00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:15.299
bunch of people all coming together on a
 

00:30:15.299 --> 00:30:17.419
bunch of people all coming together on a
particular particular experiment or a

00:30:17.419 --> 00:30:17.429
particular particular experiment or a
 

00:30:17.429 --> 00:30:19.520
particular particular experiment or a
particular problem and working very

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:19.530
particular problem and working very
 

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:21.500
particular problem and working very
closely together on it so it's I think

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:21.510
closely together on it so it's I think
 

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.600
closely together on it so it's I think
something people miss if they move out

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:23.610
something people miss if they move out
 

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.640
something people miss if they move out
of Sciences that is that sort of

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:25.650
of Sciences that is that sort of
 

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.630
of Sciences that is that sort of
collegiality and cooperativity questions

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640
collegiality and cooperativity questions
 

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.090
collegiality and cooperativity questions
now's your chance yes please um there's

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:32.100
now's your chance yes please um there's
 

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.010
now's your chance yes please um there's
a microphone which you need you need to

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020
a microphone which you need you need to
 

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.360
a microphone which you need you need to
use a microphone so we can hear you if

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:35.370
use a microphone so we can hear you if
 

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:37.820
use a microphone so we can hear you if
you said to me I mean maybe we don't

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:37.830
you said to me I mean maybe we don't
 

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.110
you said to me I mean maybe we don't
what's your suggestion for future

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120
what's your suggestion for future
 

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.690
what's your suggestion for future
biomedical or just researchers in

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700
biomedical or just researchers in
 

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.380
biomedical or just researchers in
raising or increasing truth in research

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:48.390
raising or increasing truth in research
 

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:53.030
raising or increasing truth in research
in science what's your suggestion for

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:53.040
in science what's your suggestion for
 

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.000
in science what's your suggestion for
for increasing truth I mean for those

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.010
for increasing truth I mean for those
 

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.180
for increasing truth I mean for those
trust in science truth

00:30:59.180 --> 00:30:59.190
trust in science truth
 

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.490

working with young biomedical scientists

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500
working with young biomedical scientists
 

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.460
working with young biomedical scientists
I and I in which I've been doing sort of

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:04.470
I and I in which I've been doing sort of
 

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.430
I and I in which I've been doing sort of
50 years I I don't think I've ever come

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440
50 years I I don't think I've ever come
 

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.650
50 years I I don't think I've ever come
across a situation where I've thought

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:09.660
across a situation where I've thought
 

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.920
across a situation where I've thought
that anyone's faking anything I've done

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:12.930
that anyone's faking anything I've done
 

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.870
that anyone's faking anything I've done
what Steve this is I've had people

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880
what Steve this is I've had people

repeat things maybe ask the question in
 

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.700
repeat things maybe ask the question in
a somewhat different way so it's not

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:19.710
a somewhat different way so it's not
 

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.200
a somewhat different way so it's not
positive not so obvious that it's a

I think young scientists particularly on

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820
I think young scientists particularly on
 

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.410
I think young scientists particularly on
a very very very dedicated to this idea

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:27.420
a very very very dedicated to this idea
 

00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.930
a very very very dedicated to this idea
of integrity of the integrity of the

of integrity of the integrity of the
 

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.810

science it's it can be a bit corrupted

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820
science it's it can be a bit corrupted
 

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.840

would would add that there the there's a

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:40.410
would would add that there the there's a
 

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.890
would would add that there the there's a
flowering of new methods of measuring

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:42.900
flowering of new methods of measuring
 

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.130
flowering of new methods of measuring
things there are physical methods there

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:46.140
things there are physical methods there
 

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.660
things there are physical methods there
are biochemical methods there are social

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:47.670
are biochemical methods there are social
 

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.630
are biochemical methods there are social
methods all and so all these different

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640
methods all and so all these different
 

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.630
methods all and so all these different
tools can be used to have to actually

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640
tools can be used to have to actually
 

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.000
tools can be used to have to actually
figure out what's really going on the

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.010
figure out what's really going on the
 

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.220
figure out what's really going on the
reproducibility has to be a standard in

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:58.230
reproducibility has to be a standard in
 

00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:59.630
reproducibility has to be a standard in
every lab a very high standard of

00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640
every lab a very high standard of
 

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.450
every lab a very high standard of
reproducibility and the willingness to

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460
reproducibility and the willingness to
 

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.890
reproducibility and the willingness to
go on tests yourself by having it could

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:06.900
go on tests yourself by having it could
 

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.600
go on tests yourself by having it could
be wrong get a different way of

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:08.610
be wrong get a different way of
 

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:10.460
be wrong get a different way of
measuring and even a different tool and

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:10.470
measuring and even a different tool and
 

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.460
measuring and even a different tool and
that also adds to that I mean you know

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:13.470
that also adds to that I mean you know
 

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:15.530
that also adds to that I mean you know
the criticism of climate science where

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:15.540
the criticism of climate science where
 

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.120
the criticism of climate science where
people say these people are faking and

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:17.130
people say these people are faking and
 

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:18.380
people say these people are faking and
that sort of thing is just ridiculous

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:18.390
that sort of thing is just ridiculous
 

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.360
that sort of thing is just ridiculous
because you look at a climate science

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:20.370
because you look at a climate science
 

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.470
because you look at a climate science
group I'd not might feel but I chaired a

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480
group I'd not might feel but I chaired a
 

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.020
group I'd not might feel but I chaired a
big research group Advisory Committee

big research group Advisory Committee
 

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.940
big research group Advisory Committee
for a time in this area and basically

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:28.950
for a time in this area and basically
 

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:30.590
for a time in this area and basically
what you've got is very very smart

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600
what you've got is very very smart

oceanography these sorts of areas these

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:34.800
oceanography these sorts of areas these
 

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.340
oceanography these sorts of areas these
are a really smart very dedicated very

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:37.350
are a really smart very dedicated very
 

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.950
are a really smart very dedicated very
professional people the idea that they

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960
professional people the idea that they
 

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.070
professional people the idea that they
could be corrupted to falsehood by some

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080
could be corrupted to falsehood by some
 

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.190
could be corrupted to falsehood by some
sort of conspiracy of the elders is

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200
sort of conspiracy of the elders is
 

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.290
sort of conspiracy of the elders is
absolutely absurd I mean it simply could

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:48.300
absolutely absurd I mean it simply could
 

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.890
absolutely absurd I mean it simply could

if you say they're corrupted long enough

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:55.350
if you say they're corrupted long enough
 

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.790
if you say they're corrupted long enough
people might believe it yeah people say

00:32:58.790 --> 00:32:58.800
people might believe it yeah people say

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.610
 
I would like to as a journalist to

media today is its logic is managed by
 

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:31.440
media today is its logic is managed by
economical fact factors but sometimes I

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:31.450
economical fact factors but sometimes I
 

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:34.740
economical fact factors but sometimes I
have a feeling also that journalists are

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:34.750
have a feeling also that journalists are
 

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:41.730
have a feeling also that journalists are
not fully I can't their subjects when

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:41.740
not fully I can't their subjects when
 

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.330
not fully I can't their subjects when
they interview researchers or scientists

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:45.340
they interview researchers or scientists
 

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:54.570
they interview researchers or scientists
and have some sum of over over too much

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:54.580
and have some sum of over over too much
 

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.590
and have some sum of over over too much
respect for scientists and also is there

00:33:58.590 --> 00:33:58.600
respect for scientists and also is there
 

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.080
respect for scientists and also is there
a responsibility from the scientists

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:01.090
a responsibility from the scientists
 

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:04.950
a responsibility from the scientists
side whom I I think sometimes think

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960
side whom I I think sometimes think
 

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.130
side whom I I think sometimes think
generally star stupid and they can say

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:08.140
generally star stupid and they can say
 

00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:11.310
generally star stupid and they can say
whatever they like and it gets published

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320
whatever they like and it gets published

do you have a comment on that either my

do you have a comment on that either my
experience with journalists particularly

00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:21.940
experience with journalists particularly
 

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.420
experience with journalists particularly
being in Australia which is dominated a

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:24.430
being in Australia which is dominated a
 

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:26.130
being in Australia which is dominated a
bit by Murdoch media which is

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:26.140
bit by Murdoch media which is
 

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:29.970
bit by Murdoch media which is
problematic the and and the the very

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:29.980
problematic the and and the the very
 

00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:31.980
problematic the and and the the very
actually a very small number of science

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:31.990
actually a very small number of science
 

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:33.720
actually a very small number of science
journalists so that you would find

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:33.730
journalists so that you would find
 

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:35.040
journalists so that you would find
yourself being questioned about some

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:35.050
yourself being questioned about some
 

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.930
yourself being questioned about some
sort of science issue but by someone who

00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:36.940
sort of science issue but by someone who
 

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.330
sort of science issue but by someone who
basically reports on football it would

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:39.340
basically reports on football it would
 

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.910
basically reports on football it would
always put it in an adversarial have the

00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:41.920
always put it in an adversarial have the
 

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.320
always put it in an adversarial have the
serial mode because that's the way they

serial mode because that's the way they
 

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.390
serial mode because that's the way they
think about things very difficult to

00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:45.400
think about things very difficult to
 

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.940
think about things very difficult to
actually get get something across I sort

actually get get something across I sort
of we sort of gave up actually on the

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:49.990
of we sort of gave up actually on the
 

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:52.920
of we sort of gave up actually on the
idea of making it work better so what we

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:52.930
idea of making it work better so what we
 

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:57.120

did it was an initiative from a former

Jaspan and he come out to it at the
 

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.290
Jaspan and he come out to it at the
Melbourne age which is quite a

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:07.300
Melbourne age which is quite a
 

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.320
Melbourne age which is quite a
reasonable newspaper not Murdoch and and

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:10.330
reasonable newspaper not Murdoch and and
 

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:12.900

under 800 word pieces on their their
area of expertise and we'll put that

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:34.630
area of expertise and we'll put that
 

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.560

think scientists have the responsibility

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:18.520
think scientists have the responsibility
 

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.150
think scientists have the responsibility
to communicate what they're doing and I

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160
to communicate what they're doing and I
 

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:23.310
to communicate what they're doing and I
haven't actually had that reaction with

haven't actually had that reaction with
most journalists it's not adversarial

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:26.410
most journalists it's not adversarial
 

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.480
most journalists it's not adversarial
and there's a genuine attempt to try to

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:30.490
and there's a genuine attempt to try to
 

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:31.380
and there's a genuine attempt to try to
learn what we do

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:31.390
learn what we do
 

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:35.010
learn what we do
and and Einstein famously said many

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:35.020
and and Einstein famously said many
 

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.500
and and Einstein famously said many
times things but he said make simple

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:37.510
times things but he said make simple
 

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.470
times things but he said make simple
things as simple as possible but no more

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480
things as simple as possible but no more
 

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.640
things as simple as possible but no more
and and he was a master at reducing

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:44.650
and and he was a master at reducing
 

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:47.490
and and he was a master at reducing
things to very simple but absolutely

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:47.500
things to very simple but absolutely
 

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.480
things to very simple but absolutely
correct statements and so I think as

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:51.490
correct statements and so I think as
 

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.690
correct statements and so I think as
scientists that should be the ideal and

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:54.700
scientists that should be the ideal and
 

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.480
scientists that should be the ideal and
so if a journalist or the public or

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:57.490
so if a journalist or the public or
 

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.820
so if a journalist or the public or
whatever does not understand what we're

00:37:59.820 --> 00:37:59.830
whatever does not understand what we're
 

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:04.410
whatever does not understand what we're
doing it's largely our fault

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:04.420
doing it's largely our fault
 

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.340
doing it's largely our fault
and so if scientists have that attitude

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:07.350
and so if scientists have that attitude
 

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:11.730
and so if scientists have that attitude
rather than you know I'm so smart and if

00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:11.740
rather than you know I'm so smart and if
 

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.080
rather than you know I'm so smart and if
you don't understand what I'm doing

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:13.090
you don't understand what I'm doing
 

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.550
you don't understand what I'm doing
shame on you

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560
shame on you

it can go a long way to actually getting

it can go a long way to actually getting
a much more receptive audience I was

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:19.930
a much more receptive audience I was
 

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:21.420
a much more receptive audience I was
actually more referring by the

actually more referring by the

questions that journalists can ask you
it's certainly true then after you get a

never really fully understood this until
after I got the Nobel Prize and it

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:55.870
after I got the Nobel Prize and it
 

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.280
after I got the Nobel Prize and it
wasn't only on December 10 in 1997 I'm

and so but the public has a different
 

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.840
and so but the public has a different
view of that and and so I so you try to

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:30.850
view of that and and so I so you try to
 

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.900
view of that and and so I so you try to
guard against it and try as hard as you

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:33.910
guard against it and try as hard as you
 

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:36.120
guard against it and try as hard as you
can not to ramble on

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:36.130
can not to ramble on
 

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:40.290
can not to ramble on
but it's so tempting

00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:40.300
 
 

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.410
 
do your inside communications you do

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:43.420
do your inside communications you do
 

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.700
do your inside communications you do
your utmost to try and tell the story in

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:47.710
your utmost to try and tell the story in
 

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.920
your utmost to try and tell the story in
a way that your audience is going to

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:49.930
a way that your audience is going to
 

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:50.760
a way that your audience is going to
understand it

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:50.770
understand it
 

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.310
understand it
and so so it's what sort of a learning

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:53.320
and so so it's what sort of a learning
 

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.960
and so so it's what sort of a learning
curve for most of us because most of us

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:54.970
curve for most of us because most of us
 

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:57.210
curve for most of us because most of us
before this for the Nobel Prize we don't

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:57.220
before this for the Nobel Prize we don't
 

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.790
before this for the Nobel Prize we don't
spend much time on the public stage but

00:39:59.790 --> 00:39:59.800
spend much time on the public stage but
 

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.410
spend much time on the public stage but
but once you're on the public side you

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:01.420
but once you're on the public side you
 

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.180
but once you're on the public side you
learn a lot of things very quickly but

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:03.190
learn a lot of things very quickly but
 

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.820
learn a lot of things very quickly but
one thing is that no matter how crazy a

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:05.830
one thing is that no matter how crazy a
 

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:07.650
one thing is that no matter how crazy a
question may seem and we're not getting

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:07.660
question may seem and we're not getting
 

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.300
question may seem and we're not getting
that from this audience but how crazy it

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:09.310
that from this audience but how crazy it
 

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.520
that from this audience but how crazy it
may seem the last thing you ever do is

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:11.530
may seem the last thing you ever do is
 

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.410
may seem the last thing you ever do is
humiliate the question in any way

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:13.420
humiliate the question in any way
 

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.320
humiliate the question in any way
whatsoever because as soon as you do

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:16.330

that even if they think the question is
crazy too you lose your audience you

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:22.570
crazy too you lose your audience you
 

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.500
crazy too you lose your audience you
have to try the best you can do is say

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:25.510

and more and more science now is going

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:35.890
and more and more science now is going
 

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.220
and more and more science now is going
to open access where the scientist pays

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:38.230
to open access where the scientist pays

ahead of time so I mean publication of

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720
ahead of time so I mean publication of
 

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.660
ahead of time so I mean publication of
an article even even online cost

and all the rest of it so so in many

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:47.320
and all the rest of it so so in many
 

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.430
and all the rest of it so so in many
cases we're now paying ahead of

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440
cases we're now paying ahead of

publication basically so that the

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760
publication basically so that the
 

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.520
publication basically so that the
article will be an open-access article

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:53.530
article will be an open-access article
 

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:54.030

look at an open-access scientific paper

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:04.990

it's a totally different type of writing

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:07.870
it's a totally different type of writing
 

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:10.530
it's a totally different type of writing
it can be quite incomprehensible and you

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:10.540
it can be quite incomprehensible and you
 

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.640
it can be quite incomprehensible and you
can come to cut some quite wrong

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:11.650
can come to cut some quite wrong
 

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.220

conclusions if you don't understand how

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:14.230
conclusions if you don't understand how
 

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:16.530

that process actually works and how the

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:16.540
that process actually works and how the
 

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:19.250
that process actually works and how the
publication process works but I think

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.260
publication process works but I think
 

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.020
publication process works but I think
I'm not sure physics I don't know but

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:22.030
I'm not sure physics I don't know but
 

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.020
I'm not sure physics I don't know but
but I think more and more of

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:24.030
but I think more and more of
 

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.460
but I think more and more of
publications is to open ax well well

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:26.470
publications is to open ax well well
 

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:29.490
publications is to open ax well well
first let me make a small correction the

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:29.500
first let me make a small correction the
 

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.140
first let me make a small correction the
scientists actually pay whether it's

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:31.150
scientists actually pay whether it's
 

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:33.840
scientists actually pay whether it's
open access or not paid charges the only

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:33.850
open access or not paid charges the only
 

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:35.460
open access or not paid charges the only
the only exceptions would be the

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:35.470
the only exceptions would be the
 

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:38.040
the only exceptions would be the
for-profit journals and nature of

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:38.050
for-profit journals and nature of
 

00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:40.410
for-profit journals and nature of
science itself but but virtually every

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:40.420
science itself but but virtually every
 

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:43.980
science itself but but virtually every
other whether you pay pay charges you

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:43.990
other whether you pay pay charges you
 

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.590
other whether you pay pay charges you
pay extra you can get it open access and

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:46.600
pay extra you can get it open access and
 

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.500
pay extra you can get it open access and
what you describe is a serious problem

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:49.510
what you describe is a serious problem
 

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:52.350
what you describe is a serious problem
and so one is trying to figure out how

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:52.360
and so one is trying to figure out how
 

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:56.220
and so one is trying to figure out how
to do that yes these articles could be

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:56.230
to do that yes these articles could be
 

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:59.100
to do that yes these articles could be
very technical but the first step is you

00:42:59.100 --> 00:42:59.110
very technical but the first step is you
 

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.920
very technical but the first step is you
know how do you give the wider audience

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:01.930
know how do you give the wider audience
 

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:05.130
know how do you give the wider audience
this open access the paywall is still a

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:05.140
this open access the paywall is still a
 

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:08.520
this open access the paywall is still a
very serious barrier yes yeah because

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:08.530
very serious barrier yes yeah because
 

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.350
very serious barrier yes yeah because
although open access is going there

00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:10.360
although open access is going there
 

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:12.750
although open access is going there
still there's an increasing dominance of

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760
still there's an increasing dominance of
 

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:16.260
still there's an increasing dominance of
those top-tier journals that people are

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:16.270
those top-tier journals that people are
 

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:17.640
those top-tier journals that people are
trying to get into to get their names

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:17.650
trying to get into to get their names
 

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.440
trying to get into to get their names
made in science and those are not

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:19.450
made in science and those are not
 

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:20.700
made in science and those are not

those absolutely in fact you know why
you know I'm learning chemistry I

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:28.890
you know I'm learning chemistry I
 

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:31.670
you know I'm learning chemistry I
actually go to Khan Academy and they

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680
actually go to Khan Academy and they
 

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.070
actually go to Khan Academy and they
teach me what's radix Reduction

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:34.080
teach me what's radix Reduction
 

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:38.090
teach me what's radix Reduction
you know reduction oxidation I'm not so

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:38.100
you know reduction oxidation I'm not so
 

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.460
you know reduction oxidation I'm not so
proud I'm willing to admit that these

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:40.470
proud I'm willing to admit that these
 

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.830
proud I'm willing to admit that these
things are great and and they are

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:42.840
things are great and and they are
 

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:44.570
things are great and and they are
wonderful and you know what the sad

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:44.580
wonderful and you know what the sad
 

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.820
wonderful and you know what the sad
thing is a lot of the online courses

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:46.830
thing is a lot of the online courses
 

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.460
thing is a lot of the online courses
with the interaction between the student

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:49.470
with the interaction between the student
 

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:52.370
with the interaction between the student
and the machine is actually making a

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:52.380
and the machine is actually making a
 

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:54.800
and the machine is actually making a
bigger dent in education than the formal

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:54.810
bigger dent in education than the formal
 

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:59.720
bigger dent in education than the formal
lecture and so we have to up our game as

00:44:59.720 --> 00:44:59.730
lecture and so we have to up our game as
 

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.140
lecture and so we have to up our game as
lecturers in universities because it's

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:03.150
lecturers in universities because it's
 

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.540
lecturers in universities because it's
going to be very good and also gets to

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:05.550
going to be very good and also gets to
 

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:08.599
going to be very good and also gets to
be universal education in many places

00:45:08.599 --> 00:45:08.609
be universal education in many places
 

00:45:08.609 --> 00:45:11.900
be universal education in many places
where you don't have places like

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:11.910
where you don't have places like
 

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:15.020
where you don't have places like
Stanford it's right particularly in a

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:15.030

country like Australia with you know
 

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:18.980
country like Australia with you know
it's an enormous country and people are

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:18.990
it's an enormous country and people are
 

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:21.620
it's an enormous country and people are
stuck in country towns someone of

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:21.630
stuck in country towns someone of

essentially distance education for a

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:29.670
essentially distance education for a
 

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:31.760
essentially distance education for a
very long time and that is moved into

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:31.770
very long time and that is moved into
 

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:33.650
very long time and that is moved into
this type of area with exactly the type

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660
this type of area with exactly the type
 

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.180
this type of area with exactly the type
of technology that Stephens talking

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:35.190
of technology that Stephens talking
 

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:38.599
of technology that Stephens talking
about that basically it's initially when

00:45:38.599 --> 00:45:38.609
about that basically it's initially when
 

00:45:38.609 --> 00:45:41.090
about that basically it's initially when
people started to do this they've found

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:41.100
people started to do this they've found
 

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.490
people started to do this they've found
if they had to answer the questions from

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500
if they had to answer the questions from
 

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.500
if they had to answer the questions from
their students coming back it was taking

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:45.510
their students coming back it was taking
 

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:47.690
their students coming back it was taking
all their time then they analyzed it and

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700
all their time then they analyzed it and
 

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.040
all their time then they analyzed it and
they found there were a limited number

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:49.050
they found there were a limited number
 

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:51.080
they found there were a limited number
of questions they developed essentially

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:51.090
of questions they developed essentially
 

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.300
of questions they developed essentially
machine answers and everyone is

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:53.310
machine answers and everyone is
 

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.090
machine answers and everyone is
perfectly happy with that and it works

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:56.100
perfectly happy with that and it works
 

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.160
perfectly happy with that and it works
extremely well so there are not that
