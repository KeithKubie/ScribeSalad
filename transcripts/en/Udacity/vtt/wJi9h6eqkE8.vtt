00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.955
learned how to use permissions, move time consuming processes

00:00:06.955 --> 00:00:09.540
of the UI thread, and were introduced to the basics

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.410

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.990
where we'll create more activities and learn how to navigate

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.700
