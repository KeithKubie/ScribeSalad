00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.680 position:70%
&gt;&gt; It is my pleasure now to introduce
Cate-Cooney, who joins us from the University

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.260
of the Arts in Philadelphia, where
she is the coordinator of the TPS.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.900
That's the Teaching with
Primary Sources Program.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.060
Trained as both librarian and art
historian, Cate is comfortable

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.320 position:58%
with the digital and physical realms.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.720 position:75%
She began her career by creating the digital
library for decorative arts and material culture

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.460
and later worked as an art
historian at Princeton University.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.280 position:70%
More recently Cate was headed of the printed
book and periodical collection at Winterthur,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.740 position:64%
where she taught connoisseurship of the
book using rare books as primary sources.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.640 position:66%
It is my sincere pleasure to welcome Cate.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much, Cheryl, I
appreciate that kind introduction.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.800
And I'm excited to be here this
evening talking to you all.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.510 position:75%
So, I'm here today to talk about analyzing
primary sources using Library of Congress tools.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.490 position:69%
Specifically we'll be considering
photography and we'll follow a guide created

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.450 position:75%
by the University of the Arts called "Look Back.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.580
See Further."

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.560 position:56%
Studying photographs and drawing
connections between primary sources,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.600
from the Library of Congress
and local collections.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.410
My objectives for today are, to
familiarize you with the University

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.040 position:63%
of the Arts online guide to photography.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.950 position:61%
To aid an understanding of
photographs as primary source material,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.700 position:69%
to get comfortable using Library of Congress
TPS, that's Teaching with Primary Sources,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.130
analysis tool for photography, and
provide an introduction to Library

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.610
of Congress photography resources
available online.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.680 position:73%
So, I'm here to today to talk about "Look Back.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.450
See Further."

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.830 position:69%
Studying photographs and drawing connections
between primary sources from the Library

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.940
of Congress and local collections.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.900 position:66%
This guide is available of the University
of the Arts' website and a link to the URL

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.220
at the presentation so you
can be sure to have it.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.700 position:67%
The University of the Arts created this
guide to studying photographs meant for use

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.650
in the classroom or as an
inspiration for teaching.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:18.680 position:75%
The guide is intended to help users build visual
literacy skills using photography as the medium.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.230 position:63%
Visual literacy can be defined as making
meaning of images through analysis

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.090 position:75%
and interpretation and using images effectively.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.540 position:75%
As you likely know, visual literacy is a
component covered in many educational standards,

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.420 position:75%
including common core and other state standards.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.400 position:63%
For instance, English language arts
standards asks students to, I'm quoting,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.890 position:73%
"Integrate visual information with other
information in print and digital text," and to,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.310 position:69%
I'm going to quote again, "integrate and
evaluate content, presented in diverse media

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.190 position:58%
and formats, including visually and
quantitatively, as well as in words."

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.870 position:67%
So, we're going to focus on the first part
of our definition, making meaning of images

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.110 position:56%
through analysis and interpretation.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.110
The guide, "Look Back.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.980 position:66%
See Further.," can be used to help develop
the visual literacy skills of looking,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.500
describing and evaluating content.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.770 position:64%
Using historical photographs in the
classroom is a great way to spark inquiry

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.590
and built visual literacy skills.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.220 position:69%
My goal today is to have us look at
photographs as sources in and of themselves,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.530 position:58%
rather than as illustrative material.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.060 position:64%
We're not going to take an idea and then
find photographs to illustrate that idea.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:52.990 position:75%
Instead, we're going to look at photographs and
see what questions and ideas those images raise.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.000
So, here's what I'm on the
hook for this evening.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.700 position:61%
First I want to briefly give you the
context in which the guide was created.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.840 position:63%
Then I will discuss analyzing
photographs using the TPS analysis tool.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.100 position:64%
From there we will delve into looking at
three different types of images together.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.210
A portrait, a street scene
and a recreational image.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.730 position:61%
Through analyzing these images
together we will see how looking at art

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.230 position:73%
and specifically photography can lead to
discussions and investigation of larger issues.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.150
Finally, I will do a brief
exploration of Library

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.250
of Congress photograph collections
of interest to educators.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.530 position:75%
So the University of the Arts joined the
Library of Congress's TPS educational consortium

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.110
with the goal of connecting,
teaching and learning to the arts

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.170
by using the arts visual arts,
music, literature, theater,

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.000
dance, architecture and on and on.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.760 position:61%
Students can investigate how humans use
creative activity to express celebrate,

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:04.400 position:66%
explore and question their individual,
cultural and national identity in history.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.150
Their place in the universe.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.300 position:75%
The arts provide a medium for exploring history,
science, language, mathematics, philosophy,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.420 position:56%
you get the idea, it goes on and on.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:23.530 position:66%
For the TPS program we developed week long
courses in which teachers would engage

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.120 position:59%
with various media as primary sources.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.180 position:70%
And teachers find it engaging and exciting
to work with something that is both pervasive

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.130 position:58%
in our popular culture as photography
is, but also an artistic medium

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.820 position:58%
with a century and a half of history.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.500 position:58%
From this course we made a printed
guide to studying photographs for use

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.330 position:66%
by teachers and students in the classroom.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.020
This guide is available online as
a PDF, via the U Arts TPS website,

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.160 position:66%
and it's in the teacher resources section.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.550 position:61%
So, again, we'll link to it at the end,

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.740
I just want you to be aware
that it is out there for you.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.140 position:66%
We wanted the guide to act as a model for
what teachers might do in their classroom,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:15.160 position:72%
including the idea of connecting the library's
online resources to resources available

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.220 position:61%
to teachers in their local collections.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.070 position:67%
The guide connects primary sources from the
Library of Congress collections to objects

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.480
in the collection of the
Library Company of Philadelphia.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.400 position:73%
Our thought was that the guide could be printed
out and used in the classroom, or used online.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.740 position:66%
Teachers can work through the exercises
with students at a variety of grade levels

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.210
or they can look at the guide on
their own and use it as a model

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.450
for analyzing other images
that might be of interest.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.470
So, let's jump right in to
looking at and analyzing images.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:56.300 position:70%
I'm going to model the method with this image
and then talk about the TPS analysis tool.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.760
So, here's where I'm going to
ask you to start participating.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:07.310 position:69%
We're going to take a look at this image and
we start by describing exactly what we see.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.560 position:59%
So, take a good bit of time to look at
the image and describe what you see.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.230
You don't have to try to be clever
or astute, you just have to look.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.880 position:72%
There's no training required for this, just
the time and the willingness to stick with it.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.970 position:67%
So, I'm going to set a timer for 30 seconds
so we can just sit and look at this image.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.050
So, we just thinking about
what we see in the photograph.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.190
Just describe what you see.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.520 position:56%
So, I see some people are looking
at it and wondering things about it.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:00.630
They see people and trees,
mountain, maybe homes.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:05.350 position:66%
Some people are getting into the idea of
feelings, what they feel when they see it.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.940 position:75%
Great. And people are starting to ask questions.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.420
What could it be?

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.120
So, did anything jump out at you?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.110
What did you notice first?

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.950 position:69%
If you are having a hard time getting going,
you can start with a few questions like,

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:27.540
"What objects, people or animals
do you see in the picture?"

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.390
Somebody saw tiny people and flat
buildings with a question mark.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.160
I agree, flat buildings.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.340
And I like that some people are
noticing what they don't see.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.060
They don't see vehicles.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:46.680 position:64%
So, you might find that your observations
naturally lead into reflections,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.770 position:59%
such as wondering where this scene is.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.830 position:70%
A few people have said, "Are these barracks?"

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:57.020 position:58%
Some people have wondered when it
was taken, is this an old photograph?

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.270
What are the buildings and
what are the people doing?

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:06.110 position:66%
People are wondering, maybe you can wonder
where the photographer was positioned

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.760 position:58%
and who the photograph was meant for.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:14.090 position:69%
So, what do you wonder about the photograph.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.050 position:61%
Oh, Faith, I'm excited that you started
wondering about the composition.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.330
You noticed three different tiers.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:27.240 position:70%
Wondering what the photograph was for, Adrian
was wondering what could it have been for.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.490
I love all these questions.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.110
When is it, where is it, is the
ground covered in dust or in snow?

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.420
And why is there a lack of
structure to the right?

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.870 position:59%
What else do we not see in this image?

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.300
And Amy wondered if it appears to
be an internment camp in the west,

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.970 position:70%
why the environmental shot, why was it taken?

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.200
Isolated, but telephone poles.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.010 position:59%
Observations such as icy buildings and
a desolate landscape with mountains

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:02.540 position:69%
in the background lead to concrete questions
such as, "Where was this picture taken?"

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.680
Or they might lead to reflections.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.550 position:63%
The observation&lt; "The buildings are of
the same size and are arranged in rows,"

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:14.410 position:66%
might make you reflect, "I wonder if
these are barracks or military buildings?"

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.990
Leading to the question,
"What are those buildings?"

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.150 position:70%
It's best not to get caught up in the details
of whether something is an observation

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:27.820 position:64%
or reflection or a question, instead,
let your curiosity lead and try to record

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.460 position:58%
as many of your thoughts as possible.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.760 position:58%
Does it seem time has stopped and it
seems everything is very intentional.

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.200
I love your observations.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.190
It's just fantastic.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:43.140 position:70%
So, the questions lead to ideas for research.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.240 position:63%
Some of the research can be simple, such
as looking at the cataloging record,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.740 position:61%
which is pictured and also linked here.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:54.470
I intentionally did not give you
the cataloging information first,

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.140 position:72%
since it might affect our observations to know

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.700
that this is an image of a
Japanese internment camp.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:08.190 position:75%
Or that it was taken by the famous photographer,
Ansel Adams for the US War Relocation Authority.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.480 position:56%
So, I've given you a little bit of a
chance to read this about this item.

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.630 position:63%
I want to go back to the picture though,

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.780 position:61%
because I think it's a little more
interesting than the cataloging record.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.640
So, having no context for the image
allowed us to ask any question,

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.280 position:63%
without feeling like we were supposed to
have known something about the picture.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:34.030 position:73%
However, now that we do have that information,
do you find that you have additional questions?

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.980
Now that you know more, what
more do you want to know?

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.500 position:66%
Are there areas for further investigation?

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.810 position:69%
Yes, is that why the composition is so good?

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:49.830
I think Ansel Adams definitely --

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:55.220
his professionalism is showing
in this image, isn't it.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.530 position:69%
Questions of point of view, what is included

00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:02.470
and excluded are especially
important in photography.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.190 position:75%
Oh, I'm starting to see some of the things
you're wondering about and I want to read these.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.220 position:72%
People are wondering if the camp still exists,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.530 position:73%
how much does a professional artistic technique
affect the message or lens on the image?

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:21.880 position:56%
People want to know how big the camp
was, what was the artist message

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:27.250
with composing this shot that
emphasized the mountains?

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:28.780
Is it propaganda?

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.790
So, these questions and questions
of point of view, what's included

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.350
and excluded are especially
important in photography.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.070
A medium which can be manipulated.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:44.580 position:67%
For instance, I see that somebody's noticed
that there are no fences around the camp.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:48.780 position:64%
You might wonder, if this is an
internment camp, why don't we see fences,

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.650 position:67%
why don't we see barbed wire, armed guards?

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.000
Where was Adams when he was
taking this picture, right?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.570
Where's he situated?

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:03.110 position:66%
Well, a little research informed me that
Adams was instructed not to include things

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:07.610 position:61%
like the fences, the barbed wire, the
armed guards in his photos of the camp.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.950
Remember he was asked by the
US War of Relocation Authority

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.230
to take these pictures and
they wanted those left out.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.510
Adams actually took the photograph
from the top of a guard tower,

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:23.330 position:59%
which not only gave a panoramic view
of the camp, but ensured the trappings

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.490 position:75%
of confinement would be excluded from the image.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:32.040 position:66%
How an image was made is also an important
consideration when looking at photography.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.590
The technology itself affects
the resulting image.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:41.110 position:66%
So, the extraordinary depth of field in
this image, the fact that the tiny details

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.380
in the middle and the background
are crisp and focused is due

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:49.150 position:67%
to the large format camera that Adams used.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:53.720 position:64%
The Library of Congress created a tool to
help students record their observations

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.820
and capture their reflections and
questions about a primary source.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.790
Here it is, it's called the
TPS Analysis Tool and remember,

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.940 position:58%
TPS is Teaching with Primary Sources.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.890 position:58%
So, here's a TPS analysis tool filled
out for an Ansel Adams example.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.110
You see that you can select the
format of your primary source.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.750 position:59%
I selected photographs and prints, and
I recorded some of our observations.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:24.030 position:64%
Lots of buildings and roads, mountains in
the background, tiny people in the road,

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:35.310 position:70%
bushes and trees, black and white, etc., etc.
So, there are also reflections, questions,

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:41.720 position:67%
where is it, who took the photo, why was it
taken and ideas for further investigation.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:47.780 position:63%
The tool is available on the Library of
Congress website in the teacher section.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:54.410 position:73%
You can't print out blank forms or you can fill
it out online or download and email the form.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.820
Here we see the teacher's guide to
analyzing photographs and prints.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.330 position:64%
As you can see, students are encouraged
to go back and forth between the columns.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.210
There's no correct order.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:11.140 position:75%
As we observe details and identified what we saw
in the image we naturally reflected and wondered

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.120
about what we were seeing and
then generated questions about it.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.910
But it's a circular process,
it can go back and forth.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:21.860
It's not necessarily linear.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.850
So, let's give this image a try.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.100
Here's a photographic portrait.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.760
Again, what do you see?

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.260
I'm going to set the timer again
for 30 seconds so we can look

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.970 position:56%
and then let's describe it together.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.890
Well, this is a good image
for noticing fine details.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:48.980 position:64%
People are saying that he looks stern,
he's formally dressed, the frame is worn,

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:55.450 position:69%
he's wearing some sort of a tie or an ascot,
he's very well dressed and looks severe.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.600 position:63%
What do you notice about his expression?

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.660
Oh, somebody noticed the Kodak EPY,
which might date the photography.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.450 position:67%
I will note up at the very top of the image
you see in yellow it says, "Kodak EPY."

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:16.020 position:69%
That's actually an artifact of photographing
the photograph and digitizing that,

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.610
rather than the image itself, which
is just within that brown frame.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:27.670 position:70%
A very stern look, perhaps one you might give
your children when they are being difficult.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.860 position:67%
Stern but possibly smiling around the eyes.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:34.710 position:59%
And a few of you noticed his clothing.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.270 position:59%
What do you notice about his clothing?

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:42.190 position:64%
Do you feel like it provides any clues to
his personality or his social standing?

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:50.310 position:75%
So, his clothing a lot of people are saying that
maybe he's wealthy or of a high social standing.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.750
It looks very formal.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:57.190 position:73%
So far nobody says it looks casual, so I almost
don't feel like I should ask this question, is,

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.890
"Whether you would describe
it as formal or casual?"

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:03.790
But how do you think he was
trying to present himself?

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:09.870 position:67%
What do you wonder about who took the
photograph or why the photograph was taken?

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:13.370
Long skinny fingers, doesn't
look like a tough worker.

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.750
I'm loving your descriptions.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:15.680
It's really interesting.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.950
So, the picture is a portrait.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.140
It's a portrait of John Sachse.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:29.410
It was taken by the photographer,
Robert Cornelius in 1841 or 1842.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:33.270 position:69%
It's a type of photo called a daguerreotype.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:40.170 position:72%
A daguerreotype is a unique photographic image
on a polished sheet of silver-plated copper.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:46.570 position:59%
The process was invented in France in
1839 and alter that year Cornelius set

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.960
up the camera he built himself
and made what is now thought

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:55.630 position:72%
to be the earliest existing American portrait
photograph, which is shown here on the screen.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:00.530 position:56%
Cornelius was an amateur chemist who
experimented with photography trying

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:04.300 position:59%
to make the daguerreotype process fast
enough to be used for portraiture.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.650 position:66%
These images require a long exposure time,

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:11.980
during which the subject must
remain as still as possible.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.230 position:58%
So, several of you noted that he
looked almost pained in that picture.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:20.350 position:67%
He had to sit still for a really long time.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.400
So, as you can see, he certainly
perfected the technique

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.140
by the time he photographed
Sachsen in 1841 or so.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.530 position:70%
This self-portrait that you see on the screen
is from the Library of Congress collection

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.720 position:67%
and we discuss it in our guide, "Look Back.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.740
See Further."

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.110
There are so many questions to
consider with these portraits.

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:44.380 position:64%
You can think about how you would compare
Cornelius's self-portrait or his portrait

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:50.810 position:58%
of Sachse to the selfies and pictures
of friends that we take today.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.130
Somebody mentioned earlier
that the picture looked

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.880
like it might have been small,
and, in fact, it was.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:04.340 position:69%
It makes you wonder, who is the audience
for a single 2 1/2" by 3 1/4" daguerreotype?

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.930 position:58%
Well, who's the audience for a selfie
that somebody posts on Instagram?

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:14.380
Cornelius opened Philadelphia's
first daguerreotype studio.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:19.270
He took portraits of people who
paid $% for a small daguerreotype.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.740 position:66%
Just the right size to hold in one's hand.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.580
The images were slow to make
and expensive to purchase.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:31.020
A person may have only ever had one
portrait done in her entire life.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:36.990 position:66%
How would you present yourself if you were
only being photographed once in your life?

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.530
Somebody asked, "Was it expensive?"

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.360
It was expensive.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.640
$5 doesn't seem like much now,
but it certainly was then.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.330
So, portraitures a really good way
to engage students with looking

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.560
at photography for the first time.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.290
Portraits are familiar.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.600 position:64%
Most of us have many portrait photographs
of ourselves or our loved ones,

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:03.400 position:69%
but historical portrait photographs are also
strange, because the photographic process,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:09.460
fashion and social cues were all
quite different 175 years ago.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:14.610 position:75%
Using portrait photographs is a great way to get
students started with talking about identity.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.500 position:66%
Who they are and how to understand others.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.850
I'm going to pause a second here to
see how you would present yourself

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.070
if you were being photographed
only once in your life.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.680
Teresa said she'd be smiling
and Jennifer would be young.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.620
I think I'd be both.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.940 position:59%
So, now that we've gotten started with
a portrait, we can go ahead and move

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:39.920
onto something a little less
immediately accessible.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.270
And that is a street scene.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.950 position:56%
So, once again, I'd like to ask you,
"What do you see in this picture?"

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:52.970 position:73%
Again I'm going to set the timer for 30 seconds
so you can have a look and start thinking.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.880
You guys are pros at this, you've
already started jumping right

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:02.390
in with all these great questions
and observations about bare trees,

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:06.680
leading you to wonder what the
season was and where this could be.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.200
Maybe somebody sitting on a car or
sitting on a car without a horse,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.200 position:69%
is this a cemetery, could be fall or winter.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.460
Oh, yeah the shadows could tell
you what time of day it is.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:23.740 position:69%
So, building on your knowledge from the
portrait, could you describe the photograph?

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:30.420 position:61%
Are there any clues in the color, tone,
surface marks, that give you ideas

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.740
as to how the image was made
or how old it might be?

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.400
The clothing could date the
photograph, somebody said.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.990 position:69%
And somebody's noticed maybe this is another
daguerreotype, maybe that's some silvering.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:47.540
Noticing the change in tone,
it's kind of a sepia color.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:54.720 position:72%
Well, the title tells us that this is the
entrance to Independence Square, Philadelphia.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:22:00.790 position:58%
It was taken between 1840 and 1856,
so we really don't know exactly when,

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.850
but we have a span of dates.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:08.370 position:66%
So, looking at the image, what do you
wonder about the place, what do you wonder

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:13.330 position:73%
about the connection of the people in the image
to the place where they were photographed?

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:18.790 position:73%
Since we know a little bit about daguerreotypes
now, we know that it was made at a time

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.220 position:72%
when photography was neither common, nor easy.

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:28.660 position:69%
We can assume that the choices of location,
subjects and their poses are all deliberate.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.240 position:69%
And people are wondering why there's a gate.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.490
If this is Independence Square,
why is there a gate?

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.170
Was the gate locked?

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.140
Well, here's what I believe
is the same place today.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.840 position:59%
A screen shot from Google Street View.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.340 position:66%
Google Street View is a fun way to compare
historic images with the present day.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.430 position:58%
It's an exercise that can be done
with students of many different ages.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:54.030 position:59%
And it's really fun and sometimes it's
easy and sometimes it's really hard,

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.640
because buildings change
and street layouts change.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.540 position:63%
This one was a little hard to nail
down, but I think I got the right place.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.060
And Teresa's been there, wonderful.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.650
So, I'm going to go ahead and
move on to our final photograph.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:14.810 position:75%
For our final photograph we'll look at something
quitter different from the ones we have seen.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.380
So, what do you see?

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.970
I'm going to set my timer
again while we all look.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.000
So, this one is already bringing
up questions about technology.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.040
You all noticed -- it seems like
you've all noticed right away

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:37.690 position:59%
that you have two images side by side.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.050 position:59%
Are there any other things you notice?

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:43.340 position:61%
You notice that the woman is diving and
that there's a city in the background.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.680
That's a good eye.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.540
The same picture's been taken,
but from different time stamps

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.690 position:58%
or angels, is what Patricia has said.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.710 position:58%
So, we did, we all noticed that there
are these two images side by side.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.300
It's a stereograph card.

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.870 position:61%
Stereographs are two nearly identical
images, mounted side by side on a card.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:08.370
When looked at through a special
viewer and you can see the woman

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:12.620
in these two images is looking
through a special viewer.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.950 position:75%
This image takes on a three dimensional quality.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.870
Viewing stereographs became
a very popular entertainment

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:23.680
for middle class people during
the Victorian era.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:29.960
We know that this stereograph
card dates from around 1892.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.830 position:56%
Sporting activities were becoming
increasingly popular in this period.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:39.860 position:58%
Women were taking part in recreations
like archery, bicycling and swimming.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:45.010 position:59%
Women were appearing in public in ways
that were not previously accepted.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:51.910 position:70%
During this period we see more and more
images of the new woman on stereograph cards.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:57.410 position:59%
A simple entertainment can have a much
deeper meaning if we delve into it.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.440 position:67%
It is, it's kind of like a view master toy.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:05.980 position:64%
So I only have a brief time left, I would
love to just talk about stereograph cards

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:11.530 position:63%
and all your great observations, because
you've been so engaged, it's really fun.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.870
But, I should talk about the
vast photographic resources

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.010 position:72%
that are available at the Library of Congress.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:23.180 position:75%
There are more than a million items from the
prints and photograph division available online,

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.490
so let's just talk about a few
related to today's presentation.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:32.100 position:69%
I would like to encourage you to explore the
library's prints and photograph division.

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.190
It is a treasure trove.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:40.660
Our first image way back several
-- what, 40 minutes ago almost --

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.440
came from the collection
of Ansel Adams' photographs

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.730 position:69%
of Japanese American internment at Manzanar.

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:54.350 position:75%
This is a collection of about 200 images, mostly
portraits, that Adams took at the camp in 1943.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:26:00.850 position:69%
In addition to the portraits the
collection documents daily life at the camp.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:05.470 position:63%
Adams himself donated the collection to
the library, stating that the collection

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:11.590 position:66%
of his work was to show how the Japanese
Americans at the camp overcame what he saw

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:18.040 position:72%
as a great injustice, by building themselves a
meaningful life, despite losing their property

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:22.820
and livelihoods and being
isolated in a remote environment.

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:27.780 position:73%
An excellent essay accompanies this
collection and can be accessed in that articles

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.090 position:64%
and essay tab under the collection title.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.930
And here's the book that Adams
published with these images.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.750
It's called born free and equal.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.400
And it's available in digital
form on the library site.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.520
And I just wanted to show another
example from the collection.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.310
Here are three school children.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.780
The Robert Cornelius portrait
of Sachse, his self-portrait,

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:57.550 position:69%
and the Philadelphia street scene are all in
the library's collection of daguerreotypes.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:02.840 position:61%
Most of the 700 or so items in the
daguerreotype collection are portraits,

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:09.680 position:75%
such as this one of a man named Edward Jay Roy,
but as we saw, there are also some street scenes

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.710
and landscapes, as well as
reproductions of works of art.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.730 position:56%
Diving Woman came from the library's
collection of stereograph cards.

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.860
We've already discussed the
technology of the stereo card.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:26.840 position:61%
The fact that the library had more than
52,000 of these cards is a testament

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.450 position:63%
to their popularity as an entertainment.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:34.430 position:61%
More than 8000 are available in digital
form and may be searched online.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:40.180 position:66%
Stereo cards were first produced in the
United States in 1851 and remained popular

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.680 position:72%
through the earliest part of the 20th century.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:47.510 position:61%
They are excellent for studying popular
culture, historic scenes and places,

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:54.100 position:58%
including things like events, such as
the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.650
The library has a fun feature
called, "Mystery Stereographs,"

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.840 position:67%
where they post a stereograph card for
which they cannot find complete information

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:09.840 position:69%
and they ask us to help find a -- help solve
the mystery of who and what, when, or why.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.460
This is the one that I took a
screen shot of a few weeks ago.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.110 position:63%
So, I think there's a new one up by now.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:21.650 position:58%
You can find photographs by searching
the library catalogue at loc.gov

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.890 position:73%
or you can check out the library's Flickr page.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.270 position:61%
I'd like to thank you for your time
and attention today and please do check

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.720
out our guide to studying
photographs, "Look Back.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.920 position:64%
See Further.," which is hyperlinked here.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:39.010 position:66%
In it you will find three of the exercises
we did today with additional information

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.900 position:58%
about each image, as well as
analysis of two more types of images.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:48.820 position:64%
I encourage you to have a look at the
guide, download it, print it and I wanted

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:54.960 position:66%
to thank you also for your great comments,
it was really really fun to work with you.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.680
&gt;&gt; Cate, thank you so much.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.780 position:66%
This is Cheryl Latterly [assumed spelling]
again, from the Library of Congress.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:07.630 position:75%
And I want to say that the conversations were
rich and lively and you seemed very very engaged

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:12.780 position:75%
and I know I'm leaving with lots to think
about, so thank you for participating and thanks

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:16.890
to Cate for facilitating
such a good conversation.
