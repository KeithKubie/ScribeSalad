00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.640
- [Kim] Hi, this is
Kim, from Khan Academy,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.080
and today I'm learning
about the Second Amendment

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.467
to the U.S. Constitution,
which states that,

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:10.170
"A well regulated militia being necessary

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.050
to the security of a free state,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.214
the right of the people
to keep and bear arms

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:16.160
shall not be infringed."

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.810
To learn more about the Second Amendment,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.270
I talked to two experts.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.030
Alan Gura is a lawyer
who successfully argued

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.050
two landmark Second Amendment cases

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.450
before the Supreme Court.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.500
Adam Winkler is a professor at UCLA Law,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.920
and the author of
"Gunfight: the Battle Over

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.230
the Right to Bear Arms in America."

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.630
Professor Winkler, why did the
framers include an amendment

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.950
on the right to keep and bear arms?

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.640
- [Adam] Well, really,
there's been some debate

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.870
over what the meaning of the
right to keep and bear arms is,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.590
but the most common view,
and the view supported by

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.020
the United States Supreme Court,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.880
is that the Second Amendment
protects individual liberty,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.970
in particular, the right
to keep and bear arms

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.570
for self-defense.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.580
Back in the founding era,
the framers were concerned

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.543
about self-defense in terms
of armed state militias,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530
made up of common citizens

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.810
who would prevent federal overreach.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.740
So the federal government wouldn't be able

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.060
to run roughshod over the
liberties of the people

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.830
because of these armed state militias.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.510
So the Second Amendment was
in part about protecting

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.360
those armed state militias.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.200
Indeed the fear behind
all of the Bill of Rights,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.743
was that the Constitution gave
the new federal government

00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:31.670
too much power and the federal government

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.750
would use that power to inhibit liberty.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.730
So that was the self-defense
of the founding era.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.960
- [Alan] When we look at the text,

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.876
the first thing that
people should focus on

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.690
is the phrase "the right of the people,"

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.180
and, in particular, the
word "the" before "right,"

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.970
I think that might be actually
the most important word

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.490
in the amendment,
because what it tells us,

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.270
is that the right of the people,

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.520
which is the subject of this amendment,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.400
is a pre-existing right.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.440
And the fact that this
was a pre-existing right

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.880
tells us that the framers thought

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.640
that there was something
that was out there,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.757
in their legal system,
that they were preserving

00:02:07.757 --> 00:02:11.810
against violation, and in
fact, that is the case.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.123
In English law, since well
before the Revolution,

00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:19.050
it had been settled and determined

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.413
that people had an individual right

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:25.820
to have arms for self protection,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.100
and this right was
understood to enable people

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.940
to protect themselves both
against criminal private violence

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.010
as well as the right of
people to protect themselves

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.060
against some encroachment
upon their liberties

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.540
by a tyrant or by a misguided king.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.597
This was a right that the framers

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:49.170
were well acquainted with in English law,

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.060
and they were very
perturbed that the British,

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.720
during the time of the Revolution,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.225
were violating this right.

00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:57.797
There were various
instances of the British

00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:02.330
disarming Americans,
obviously in an attempt

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.620
to keep the colonists from revolting,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.040
and in an attempt to prevent
them from resisting the king.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.980
The Battle of Lexington
and Concord, of course,

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.160
which started the Revolution,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160
was nothing but a British
march upon the armories

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.270
in those towns, and
the attempt to suppress

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.790
the right to arms.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.530
And so, what you saw
was when the time came

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.247
for a Bill of Rights,
you saw five out of seven

00:03:29.247 --> 00:03:32.690
states propose a Bill of Rights,

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.930
and the only provisions
common in all the demands

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.440
for a Bill of Rights, were the right

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.618
to religious freedom
and the right to arms.

00:03:40.618 --> 00:03:43.810
Now, the framers were
not necessarily concerned

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.470
about the sort of modern gun control,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.840
which is in controversy today.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.010
- [Adam] Today we have a
different kind of self-defense,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.350
we generally think about
with the Second Amendment,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.800
and that's about individuals defending

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.880
themselves against criminals.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.450
It's a very personal kind of liberty,

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.110
defending yourself
against someone trying to

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.960
take away your life, your health,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.500
your property, the life
of your loved ones.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.530
And one thing that I think to remember is

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.270
that this kind of change in the meaning

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.790
of a constitutional amendment over time

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.770
is very common among our
constitutional rights.

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.780
As we take the underlying principles

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.230
that are embodied in the text,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.547
and we apply them to modern circumstances.

00:04:24.547 --> 00:04:26.490
- [Kim] What about in this early period

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.250
with the Articles of Confederation.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.940
Did state constitutions also
protect the right to bear arms?

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.550
- [Alan] Yes, there
were state constitutions

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.190
that protected the right to bear arms,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.910
most notably the
Pennsylvania Constitution,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.681
Article 13 of the
Pennsylvania Constitution

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:47.050
provided "That the people
have a right to bear arms

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.320
for the defense of
themselves and the state."

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.530
And Vermont's Constitution,
the following year,

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.060
chapter one, article 15
copied that language,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.000
and you would see other late 18th century,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.120
early 19th century constitutions
keep this language,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.130
or some version of it,
and what you would notice

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.380
is that this language,
of course, talks about

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.690
the two dimensions of
the right to bear arms.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.420
The people have a right to bear arms

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.010
for the defense of themselves,

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.690
that can only be
interpreted as self-defense,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.640
and also for the defense of the state,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.882
that is, they can use those
arms that they individually have

00:05:21.882 --> 00:05:24.741
and gather together and
work to defend the society

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:29.741
from some force that's attacking them.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.370
- [Kim] This is really fascinating.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.349
My background is in U.S. history,

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.737
and I know that one of the reasons

00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:41.720
that the framers decided that
they needed a Constitution

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.210
that would change the form
of the U.S. government

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.230
from what it had been under
the Articles of Confederation,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.741
was Shays' Rebellion,
when a group of armed

00:05:51.741 --> 00:05:56.290
farmers from western Massachusetts
marched on Springfield.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.390
So they had kinda taken
their military past

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.690
as a militia, in the Revolutionary War,

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.350
and then turned that against
the new U.S. government

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.840
instead of the British government.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.990
Did the framers have any reservations

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.980
about trying to protect militias

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.210
in light of Shays' Rebellion?

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.180
- [Adam] The founders did have concerns

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.180
about armed militias, as
exemplified by Shays' Rebellion.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.917
They were worried about
self-proclaimed militias,

00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:26.917
groups of, basically armed
uprisings in disguise,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.410
that claimed the mantle of a militia,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.810
but were really just troublemakers
who were taking up arms.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.720
And that was kind of how Shays' Rebellion

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.400
was thought of at the time.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.710
And that's why when we think
about the Second Amendment,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.380
we should focus on that
language that the framers

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.940
were sure to include,
which is that the militias

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.200
must be well regulated, right?

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.007
So the Second Amendment itself says

00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:52.930
"A well regulated militia being necessary

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.800
for the security of a
free state, the right

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.250
of the people to keep and bear arms

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.420
shall not be infringed."

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.313
And so, they understood
that there was a militia,

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.540
common citizens who took up arms

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.840
to help defend the state and nation.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.380
But they recognized that the militia

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.432
must be well regulated,
disciplined, orderly,

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:16.210
subject to appropriate command.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:20.200
It wasn't a right for
any self-proclaimed group

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.390
of radicals to get together
and grab their guns,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.348
it was, instead, a right to
have an orderly state militia,

00:07:27.348 --> 00:07:30.630
which was an important
source of national defense

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.170
at the time of the founding era.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.770
- [Kim] So, I see that
the Second Amendment

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.220
and the Third Amendment,
which bans the government

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.180
from quartering soldiers
in people's houses,

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.110
both reflect fears about standing armies,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.355
and also the dangers of having

00:07:46.355 --> 00:07:49.840
very strong government military power.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.430
Today we have a very strong
government military power,

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.020
and a standing army, so to what extent

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.020
are those concerns still relevant today?

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.110
- [Alan] Well those concerns
are still relevant today,

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.629
we're very blessed in America that we have

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:06.490
a long tradition of civilian control

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.800
over the military, and in our culture

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.800
the military has not been
used to suppress the people,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.540
that's not been our experience,

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.810
but it has been the experience, sadly,

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.313
in many other places,
including through today.

00:08:20.313 --> 00:08:22.380
Now, what the Second Amendment reflects

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.035
is the notion that the
government should not

00:08:25.035 --> 00:08:27.080
have a monopoly on force.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.340
There has to be some
means that people might

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.655
still retain the ability to act,

00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:35.840
to defend themselves,
whether that's against

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.520
a private individual, felon, miscreant,

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.270
or whether it's against
something more nefarious.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.040
- [Adam] Our understanding
of what's necessary

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.270
for national defense is very different

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:48.980
than it was in the founding era,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.624
because our society is so much different.

00:08:51.624 --> 00:08:54.770
We don't have militias
of ordinary citizens

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.759
the way we once did,
back in the founding era,

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:02.078
and we don't have troops
occupying peoples' homes

00:09:02.078 --> 00:09:04.440
the way the founders did.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.104
But nonetheless, I think the
Second and Third Amendment

00:09:07.104 --> 00:09:11.045
both have principles embodied in that text

00:09:11.045 --> 00:09:14.060
that remain relevant for today,

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.560
and should not be thought
of as dead letters

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.430
just because the particular concerns

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.900
that gave rise to them no
longer remain our concerns.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.360
Because the principles they embody

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.490
are more important and more enduring.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.302
- [Alan] We have been blessed with

00:09:30.302 --> 00:09:35.302
peaceful transitions of power,
with a vibrant democracy,

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.460
perhaps, at least some aspect
of our happy experience,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.790
relative to those of our
friends and ancestors in Europe,

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.440
is that we do have a culture

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.070
that includes the widespread private arms.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:55.130
And that may have a beneficial effect

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.580
in making sure that
everybody plays by the rules

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:03.050
and observes normal political
conventions and norms.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.260
- [Kim] So what are some
of the major Supreme Court

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.470
cases that have shaped our understanding

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.770
of the Second Amendment?

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:10.107
- [Adam] The first one was a case called

00:10:10.107 --> 00:10:13.655
"United States versus Miller,"
that arose in the 1930s.

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.474
In Miller, you had a
situation where an individual

00:10:16.474 --> 00:10:21.474
was a gangster and he was
caught with a sawed off shotgun,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.610
which at the time, and still now,

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.670
does require a special tax stamp

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.380
that Mr. Miller did
not have, and he argued

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.510
that the Second Amendment
secured his right to this weapon.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.560
The government took the
case to the Supreme Court,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.603
and at the conclusion
of the somewhat confused

00:10:39.603 --> 00:10:42.290
opinion, the Supreme
Court remanded the case

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.250
back to the district
court for a determination

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.540
as to whether or not the sawed off shotgun

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.140
was an arm of the type whose possession

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.650
is protected by the Second Amendment.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.150
Subsequently, Mr. Miller was murdered,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.563
so perhaps he needed a gun
of some kind, after all,

00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:01.310
but we never got the
answer to that question.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.340
So I would read that
case, as other people do,

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.130
and say "Look, obviously the Supreme Court

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.620
thought there was some
individual right to arms."

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.617
If the court had held that there

00:11:10.617 --> 00:11:12.399
was no individual right to arms,

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:14.610
it would have been a much simpler opinion,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.890
they would have just said so and that

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:17.980
would've been the end of the matter.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.460
But instead, because
more evidence was needed

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.070
relating to whether or not this was an arm

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.910
of the type that Mr. Miller could possess,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.690
that shows that there was
some right there, at issue.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.980
Much more helpful, of course, is the case

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.397
that I argued in the Supreme Court,

00:11:30.397 --> 00:11:35.189
D.C. versus Heller, which
was a coherent, detailed

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:39.603
fully briefed and
exhaustively opined matter

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.620
which struck down various
Washington, D.C. gun control laws.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:49.830
The main laws at issue in Heller were

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.890
a District of Columbia law that banned

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.180
the possession of all handguns
by people, effectively.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.600
And also, a law that prohibited people

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.160
from having operative
firearms in their home.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.747
You can have a long gun,
a rifle or a shotgun,

00:12:04.747 --> 00:12:08.327
in your home in D.C., but
you could never render that

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:12.810
operational, for use as self
defense inside your home.

00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:15.120
Oddly enough, you could
use it in self defense

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.720
in a place of business,
just not at your home.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.880
- [Adam] The most important
case on the Second Amendment

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.450
is District of Columbia against Heller,

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.890
where the court held,
for the very first time,

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:27.190
that the Second Amendment protects

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.805
an individual right to bear arms

00:12:28.805 --> 00:12:32.010
and struck down a gun control law.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.360
That was a very important case,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.760
a landmark ruling, that has led

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.700
to many, many, many
court cases challenging

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.480
the constitutionality of a wide
number of gun control laws.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.240
The Supreme Court has
not again stepped into

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.815
the Second Amendment, with one exception,

00:12:48.815 --> 00:12:53.470
the court in a case called
"McDonald versus City of Chicago"

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.450
held that the Second
Amendment applied equally

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.750
to the federal government and to the state

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.440
and local governments.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.730
One thing to remember about
our constitutional rights

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.980
is that they don't automatically apply

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.550
to the state and local governments.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.490
But the McDonald case held
that the Second Amendment,

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.390
and the principles of the Second Amendment

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.350
nonetheless apply to the states, as well.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.900
And that's pretty common as well,

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.440
over the course of the 20th century

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.890
the Supreme Court has held that nearly all

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.800
of the provisions of the Bill of Rights

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.490
apply equally to the state
and local governments.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.763
- [Kim] How about limits
on the Second Amendment?

00:13:29.763 --> 00:13:32.830
I mean, I couldn't own a tank, right?

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.780
What sort of limits may
the government place

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.540
on the right to keep and bear arms?

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.960
- [Alan] Well, the Second Amendment,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.850
like other rights, has some limitations.

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.940
The first limitations are, of
course, as with all rights,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.450
given to us by the scope
of the actual rights.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:49.660
There are many things that simply

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.110
aren't included in a particular right.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.004
The right of free speech, for example,

00:13:54.004 --> 00:13:57.560
guarantees you the right
to speak in some ways,

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.611
but perjury of speech,
terroristic threats or speech,

00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:02.610
extortion is a form of speech,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.750
none of those are traditionally protected.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.023
And likewise, there are
going to be some arms

00:14:07.023 --> 00:14:08.913
that are going to fall outside

00:14:08.913 --> 00:14:11.406
of Second Amendment protection.

00:14:11.406 --> 00:14:13.431
The Heller case tells us how to

00:14:13.431 --> 00:14:16.102
go about discovering those limits.

00:14:16.102 --> 00:14:20.000
The Amendment, we are told,
presupposes that people

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.310
will have arms that people
would expect to find

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.970
in common use for
traditional, lawful purposes.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:31.690
And so, while a handgun or a rifle

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.980
is a type of arm that people would keep

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.840
for self defense, for hunting, for sport;

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.790
a tank or a bazooka is
usually not something

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.733
that you would wish to
access for some traditional,

00:14:44.733 --> 00:14:47.230
recognized, lawful activity, right?

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.130
I mean, very few people would use a tank

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.810
to defend themselves against a mugger

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:53.400
on the street, right?

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.800
- [Adam] I mean, as a
matter of practicality,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.200
even if we didn't have a Second Amendment,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.760
there's no possible way we're going to

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.750
disarm the entire civilian population.

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.320
So, the guns are here to stay.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.350
The question is how can
we exist with civilian

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:10.660
armament and good and
effective gun control?

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.260
And I think that history and tradition

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:13.970
can provide some of those answers.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.950
In the same way that we try to understand

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:17.900
what does the text of
the Constitution mean,

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.450
and what are the principles
that that text embodies,

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.300
we look to history and tradition,

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.210
how have Americans lived
under that Constitution,

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.690
over these 200-odd years.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.030
We should also look to
that history and tradition

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.510
in seeing the limits of
those constitutional rights.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:35.240
And one thing I think is very clear

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.410
from the history and
tradition of gun rights

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:41.130
and gun regulation is
that there's ample room

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:43.310
to regulate firearms.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.820
The founding fathers had gun control laws,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.290
we had gun control laws in the wild west,

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.160
even though that was the heart
of America's gun culture,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.230
we've had gun control laws all through

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:55.907
American history, and
they're part of the story

00:15:55.907 --> 00:15:59.000
of the Second Amendment, as much as

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.770
the six-shooter and
the right to bear arms.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.230
- [Kim] So we've learned that
the framers' concern over

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.480
protecting the right
to bear arms originated

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.860
in the experiences of
the American Revolution,

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.170
in which militias played a central role

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.500
in winning independence
for the United States.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.100
But a lot has changed
since the Revolution.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.270
The U.S. military has grown, and arms

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:20.050
have gotten a lot more powerful.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.990
Alan Gura suggests that the lack

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.771
of a government monopoly on force

00:16:23.771 --> 00:16:27.590
is a key component of the
peaceful transitions of power

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.710
that characterize American democracy.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.130
Adam Winkler, however,
argues that there's always

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.880
been some form of gun
control in the United States,

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.270
even in the wild west.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.130
