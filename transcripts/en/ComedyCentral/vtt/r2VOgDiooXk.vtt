00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.534
(upbeat music)

00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:03.837
(cheering)

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.276
- Festivus for the rest of us.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:11.778
- Festivus for the rest of us.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.580
- Festivus (clangs) for the rest
of us.

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:16.149
- I have a lot of problems with
you people

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.817
and now you're gonna hear about
it.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.185
- We got a grievance.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.254
- People who drink coffee
through a straw,

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.856
I hope you die from the wax

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:25.892
and the plastic that
melts as you suck it up

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.126
into your dumb mouth.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.961
- Why do men say they're
pregnant with their wives?

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:30.596
- The lady's doing all the work.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:31.998
Why are you trying to
take some of the credit?

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:32.999
- Anytime I'm on an airplane

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:34.233
and a brother's staring
at the seat in front

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.602
of him and there's no TV on the
seat back,

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.438
you leave that brother alone.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.673
- There might not be
anything worse than people

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:41.607
who chew with their mouth open.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.509
- Either close your mouth when
you chew,

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.812
or leave your mouth wide open

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.713
and don't chew at all

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.249
and throw the food into your
throat.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:51.951
- No soup for them!
