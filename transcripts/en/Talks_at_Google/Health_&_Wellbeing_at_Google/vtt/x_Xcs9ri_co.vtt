[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.324 --> 00:00:07.740
SPEAKER: I want
to start out first

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.666
by just giving a little
explanation or back

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.085
story about why we're here.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.760
I have what you would
call a pretty complicated

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.615
orthopedic history.

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:24.240
I don't want to go
into all the detail.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.600
But I've had 17
surgeries on my joints.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.409
Really long story.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.870
There's a lot of causes.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.680
There's genetics.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.550
There's my personality.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.322
I'm stubborn.

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:40.780
I come from a small town, didn't
have a lot of information,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.655
and things like that.

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:47.529
But as you can imagine, I've
done and seen a lot of things.

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:50.070
I've had surgeries a lot of you
probably have never heard of,

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.710
and I hope you never hear of.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.600
Tried procedures, modalities.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000
I've had stem cell injections.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.940
I've had all kinds of things.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.710
And when I look back
on it, I learned a lot.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.640
And at the end of it
all, I said to myself,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.170
I wish everyone else knew this.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.850
Or I wish I knew that then.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.380
And so I wanted to pick
some people in my past

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.500
that if I had known them when
I was 16, before this all

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.645
happened, what would have
changed because I don't want

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:31.270
anyone else-- I'm
not saying any of you

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.250
are going to have-- this
won't happen to everyone.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.410
I'm like a 0.001% kind of case.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.770
But there's a lot of things
that could be prevented.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.980
So I actually ran into
Gray's work actually

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.130
after the 17 surgeries.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.470
I had all this surgery.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.946
And my body was not moving well.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.820
I had all this cartilage
put back in my body.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.100
But still in pain.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.200
And hearing about
his work and how

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.550
he explains movement, all
these things, one thing

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.990
I want to share with you is
this is stuff that all of us

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.390
should know in high
school, grade school.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.730
This should be our health class.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.830
These are things we should know
to make decisions, health care

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.710
decisions.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.460
There's no reason why you
only a physical therapist

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.877
or an elite trainer should
know some of the stuff

00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:27.460
that Gray's going
to talk about today.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.400
So that's why invited Gray here.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.261
And I've seen Gray talk
to fitness professionals,

00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:35.760
medical professionals,
those people.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.960
But there's no reason why he
can't talk to the rest of us.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.080
This is all stuff we should
know to help us make decisions.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.174
So I don't want to steal
any more of Gray's time.

00:02:45.174 --> 00:02:48.790
He's a physical
therapist, strength coach,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.940
works with elite athletes,
works with the military.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.370
There's a ton of
things I can say.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.441
He's written two books.

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.690
"Movement," I recommend
everyone really read that one.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.030
That's my favorite of the two.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.113
They're both great though.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.945
But without further
ado, Gray Cook.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:03.820
GRAY COOK: Thank you.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.790
I'm excited to do this because
it's really easy to lecture

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.110
to a group of your peers
because you can drop terms

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.490
and terminology and systems that
everybody is supposed to know.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.220
But when I got invited
to do this, and some

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.780
of the conversations I had
with Steve preparing for it,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.300
he alluded to the fact that when
he looked at our systematic way

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.060
we look at human
movement, it just

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.000
looks like a good
engineering approach.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.230
And that's probably because
he's heard me make analogies

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.060
like the human movement,
information system,

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.490
and other information processing
have many common problems.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.820
One of the first ways I
talk to patients or athletes

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.670
is, is this a hardware
or software problem.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.650
Sometimes, your structure,
the structure of your body,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.770
is the reason you can't get
that next thing out of movement.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.470
And sometimes,
it's the function.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.030
It's the processing.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.060
It's real easy in
health care for us

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.010
to just look at you
as a bag of parts.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.220
Your name isn't x.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.890
It's knee.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.850
You're the knee in room three.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.650
Right?

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.550
And as long as we do what
we gotta do for the knee,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.709
then yeah, you're taking
some anti-inflammatories,

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:20.800
but we upset your stomach.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.180
Oh, now, you're a GI problem.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.138
Oh, we're going to get
you over somewhere else.

00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:27.230
And many of the things we
do, I'll be honest with you,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.780
are to cover up your symptoms
so you'll leave us alone,

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.660
not to make you more
independent and make

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.600
that independence sustainable.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.550
You graduate from high school.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.554
You can read and write
letters enough to get

00:04:41.554 --> 00:04:43.470
through the rest of your
life or go to college

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.290
or do something else.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.520
And you can do the same thing
with numbers, just enough,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.190
hopefully, to stay
out of debt, if you

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.640
know how to work the numbers.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.440
But most of us
graduate high school

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.670
not knowing how to
read, write, or correct

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.210
faulty movement patterns.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.740
I would suggest that many of
you can correct your movement

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.480
patterns just by
changing your lifestyle,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.810
not by adopting new
exercise practices.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.640
Your lifestyle could
be compounding that.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.830
But unless we have
systems and filters that

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.490
point us right to
where the problem is,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.190
you're just going to meet a
bunch of people with a hammer.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.480
And guess what happens
when you've got a hammer?

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.000
Everything looks like a nail.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.920
So you just look
like a nail to them.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.750
OK?

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.460
If they have a
screwdriver, and so on.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.080
OK?

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.210
So there's many, many things
that I can talk about about

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.540
the way the human brain
operates this sensory apparatus

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.090
because most people look at
the body as muscles and joints

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.420
to move us from place to place.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.260
There's only two things we
do with our body-- locomotion

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.880
and manipulation.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.660
We tweedle with stuff and
interact with our environment,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.330
or we move from space to space.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.620
Everything in your
brain is set up, almost,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.140
to do that because unless you
can engage your environment,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.290
whether that environment
is very social with a lot

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.220
of other people, or it's
absolutely natural with rocks

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.650
and sticks and avalanches
and snakes and stuff

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.220
like that, either
way, you've got

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.470
to pick up that information.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.110
How do you pick up
that information?

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.110
Data points or patterns?

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.180
Because the human
movement learning system

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.970
does some things that we still
can't do with software yet.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:22.470
OK?

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.450
We've got computers that
got pretty good at chess.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.080
They still can't
throw a curve ball.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.927
We don't know the
algorithms to do that.

00:06:30.927 --> 00:06:33.010
And the minute it knows
how to throw a curve ball,

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.870
it can't switch up and
throw something else.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.380
It becomes a highly specialized
robot throwing curveballs.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:38.950
All right?

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:45.010
So what we do on the front
end of movement is perception.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.850
And when we teach
you an exercise

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.270
or teach you how
to be an athlete

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.500
or teach you how to do your
next new sport you just

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.050
watched on YouTube, we
focus on the behavior.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.900
What's the best way
to change behavior?

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.330
Change perception.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.300
If I change your perception
of something that's going on,

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.440
the natural driving force,
the same driving force that

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.792
makes every kid learn
to walk on their own--

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:09.000
we don't use personal trainers
or physical therapists

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.500
for that.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.850
Kids learn to walk on their own.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.550
And when you think about
going from a blob--

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:20.650
they can't even roll over--
to running in two years,

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.950
going from where you are now to
an Olympic gold medal does not

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.830
have as much processing in
your brain as that does,

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.930
going from the blob to the
running thing, no help at all.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.860
I need you to be thinking
of that because there

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.770
is a distinct difference
in what we would do, say,

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.100
with code or software and the
way we've got to program this.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.390
And I hope I can tell you
the story of how that works.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.430
And at the end,
if I stay on time,

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.750
I'd like to show you a real
time example of what that means.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.990
We don't write movement code.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.260
So thinking that
we can change it

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.000
is not really honoring the code.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.230
We're just hacking in.

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.730
Oh, I can get your core to fire.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.070
I can get your ankle to move.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:06.740
Oh, I can get your cardio up.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.530
All we're doing
is hacking a code

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.820
that maybe we don't
particularly appreciate

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.710
because almost every time
we do something in fitness

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.710
to make you better, damn if
we don't make three mistakes.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.489
If we go back 50
years in our history,

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:24.030
the people that used to exercise
in this country on a regular

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:30.420
basis seemed healthier and more
fit than the people who didn't.

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:31.770
That's not the same anymore.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.370
The people who exercise
regularly right now

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:37.880
in our culture are more fit than
people that don't, but they're

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.530
not more healthy.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.120
They actually have more
musculoskeletal issues

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.730
than people who
choose not to express

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.940
their self physically
three times a week

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.030
in a package of exercise.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.550
Exercise is a friggin'
risk factor now for health,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.940
not fitness.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.716
Exercise will allow you to do
more of what you want to do.

00:08:57.716 --> 00:08:59.840
Just keep doing more of it
and you'll do more of it

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.020
until you blow up.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.300
But is it really
making you healthier

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.080
when 80% of the
runners in a given year

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.930
will not be able to run.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.887
And they want to
run, but they can't.

00:09:11.887 --> 00:09:15.790
They created a health
issue trying to be fit.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.190
Don't put your fitness on
a movement dysfunction,

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.070
and you won't have to see that.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.070
I think we need to learn to
read movement code better first.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.160
And if we can read
that code better,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.840
I think there are a lot of
brains in the world that just

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.490
have a slight paradigm shift.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.860
Don't look at me
as a bag of parts.

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.410
Don't tell me that structure
always governs function,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.860
because it doesn't.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.510
Structure has a big
influence on function.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.270
But let me ask you a question.

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.280
Does a right-handed
tennis player

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.474
have twice the bone
density in this forearm

00:09:49.474 --> 00:09:51.140
because they were
born that way and it's

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.014
a good thing they played
tennis on this side?

00:09:53.014 --> 00:09:56.900
Or did the act of squeezing the
crap out of that tennis racket

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.030
at impact create more
compressive forces

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.560
on the bone, which put in action
a thing called Wolff's law

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.750
that adds greater bone
density any time we're

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.224
going to need greater stress.

00:10:07.224 --> 00:10:09.390
You don't just get bigger
muscles when you work out.

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.070
Your bone density goes up.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.950
So a lot of times,
function governs structure.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.530
When kids start throwing
really early in their life,

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.430
overhand, they remodel their
entire shoulder mechanics.

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.610
And I can see, when
you're 35 years old

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.431
and haven't picked up
a baseball in 20 years,

00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:27.930
that you through a
lot when you were

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:33.222
a kid just by the signature
that it left on you.

00:10:33.222 --> 00:10:35.680
We have a little saying in the
clinic when an athlete comes

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.669
through and they've run their
self right into the ground.

00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:40.210
Running has left a
bigger mark on you

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.120
than you left on running.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.672
You embarked on this journey
to leave a mark on running.

00:10:45.672 --> 00:10:47.630
And it left a mark on
you that's probably going

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.080
to be here for a few months.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.510
Let's see if we can go back
and resume the activity

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.580
with integrity so you
can achieve independence

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.350
and you can sustain that
as long as possible.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.520
All right, I'm not an engineer.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.710
And I'm a redneck with dyslexia.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:09.200
So I was challenged in every
academic endeavor I ever

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.220
approached because I
couldn't memorize things

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.890
that I couldn't put in a pattern
or a sequence that made sense

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.010
to me.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.550
But once I could, I didn't
have to remember it.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.924
Now, I also happen to
be pretty good in art.

00:11:20.924 --> 00:11:22.840
A lot of people thought
I took art all the way

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.480
through high school
to keep my GPA up

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.810
just enough to play football.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:28.677
And that also was true.

00:11:28.677 --> 00:11:30.260
But when I got to
University of Miami,

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.520
I realized that most
of my peers were

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.620
taking volumes and
volumes of notes

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.060
in anatomy, gross anatomy.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.902
We spent our whole
summer on gross anatomy

00:11:40.902 --> 00:11:42.360
because to be a
physical therapist,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.840
you've got to be able to
really interact and almost name

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.010
every muscle in the body.

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.330
The MD's looked at
muscles in groups.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.260
We looked at the
organs in groups.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.010
But we looked at the
muscles individually.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.580
I drew pictures.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.510
And it helped me because
I could close my eyes

00:11:58.510 --> 00:11:59.980
and then rotate that
picture in my head.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.354
And it helped me
start to develop

00:12:01.354 --> 00:12:02.980
an appreciation for movement.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.450
I didn't really fit
the academic model.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:09.170
But it really helped
me having, I guess,

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.207
the dyslexia, but also
maybe a little bit

00:12:11.207 --> 00:12:12.790
of photographic
memory because as soon

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.990
as I could see a pattern, I
could see when it would deviate

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.970
from the norm enough where it
would actually change itself.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.510
So that's what got me here.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:26.121
And if I can find a pattern,
I think I can interact,

00:12:26.121 --> 00:12:27.370
I think I can see some things.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.244
And if I can't find a
pattern, a lot of times

00:12:29.244 --> 00:12:30.736
I won't comment on it.

00:12:30.736 --> 00:12:33.540
It gave me an advantage
against some of my obstacles.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.191
And I never forgot
some of the things

00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:36.690
I learned in physical
therapy school

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.064
because over here,
we're learning

00:12:38.064 --> 00:12:40.350
about the neurological system.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:41.200
And I tell you what.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.340
If a family member
in your lifetime

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.410
has a stroke, a CVA,
cerebral vascular accident,

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.190
we don't put them
on weight machines,

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.910
and we don't put
them on a treadmill.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:56.210
If they lose their ability to
walk with nice, fluid stride,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.830
that recognizable stride that's
been part of their movement

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.871
signature all their life,
and all of a sudden you

00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:03.330
see your mom or dad
dragging a foot,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.380
it's going to hit
you pretty hard.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.010
They come to our clinic.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.520
They don't walk
in parallel bars.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.140
They don't walk on a treadmill.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.570
They got to get
down on the ground

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.551
and go through
Operating System 101.

00:13:14.551 --> 00:13:15.050
Why?

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.280
Because the first time
they learned to walk,

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.130
they had to crawl first.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.530
It is not me trying to make
them humble or humiliate them.

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.780
If they fall in Walmart, they're
going to have a lot worse time.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.450
I'm going to confront every
fear you've got right here.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.450
And we're going to engage
that natural operating

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.150
system because the part of a
stroke that most people don't

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.970
realize is part of
your brain died.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.110
But another part of your
brain, within a window,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.130
is willing to take
that information

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.870
and actually remodel
your walking platform.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:47.300
But if we focus too much on
your walking and not enough

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.970
on what got you there,
we'll never get there.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.400
If we make your walking about
just strengthening that toe

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.910
so you don't drag it,
we are dishonoring

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.860
the operating system that
made you walk the first time.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.340
And that's the big
problem we got.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.092
So I've been a
physical therapist.

00:14:04.092 --> 00:14:05.050
I was a strength coach.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.110
I was very, very much
into orthopedics.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.760
And I was trying to get my
board certification specialize

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.456
and change the world
my own little way.

00:14:11.456 --> 00:14:15.300
And then I was
brought to my knees,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.150
humbly, by that first little
girl right there, Jessica.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.600
One reason is she had colic.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.270
Therefore, by default,
I got insomnia.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:24.780
Right?

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.400
So we spent a lot
of time about 3:00

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.650
in the morning just looking
at each other saying, what

00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:29.590
am I going to do with you.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.340
And she's like,
well, I don't know.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:31.902
What am I going to do with you?

00:14:31.902 --> 00:14:33.360
And I watched her
teach herself how

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.670
to walk the very first time.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.600
And I offered nothing
but a safe environment.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.820
Right?

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.510
Get your scissors off the floor.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.580
Get the sharp
corners out of there.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:44.290
And she did it.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:45.850
She pulled it off.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.000
And the funny thing is, when we
watch, as physical therapists,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.690
the child go from barely
crawling and rolling

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.140
to running, as long
as a child meets

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.130
their developmental
milestones, meaning

00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.510
they hit crawling by here.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.840
There's a window.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.340
As long as they
make that window,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.510
we don't measure how
much their ankles move

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:05.970
or how strong their biceps are.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.560
Make your window.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.980
When they don't make the
window, that's when we go in

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.009
and look and see what can we do
to add that more sensory input.

00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:17.550
Well, we've got
children all the time

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.965
that skip that crawling phase.

00:15:18.965 --> 00:15:21.300
Well, how do you
make a child crawl?

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.300
Favorite toy goes in a tube.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.650
They'll figure it out.

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:25.510
Right?

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.814
You can't walk in that tube.

00:15:26.814 --> 00:15:27.980
You can't roll in that tube.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.030
You've got to
crawl in that tube.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.550
And so that's the way we do it.

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.590
Perception drives behavior.

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.480
And most of us try to
change our movement behavior

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.380
without changing the
way our body perceives

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.210
the environments
and the obstacles

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:47.140
that we call exercise,
play, recreation, work.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:52.310
So second sister comes
along, completely

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:54.140
different set of
movement skills.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.640
But they both make walking
right at the same time.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:57.880
One crawled forever.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.520
One rolled, crawled
for about five minutes,

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.220
got through the stage, but
did it enough to do it good

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.586
and moved on.

00:16:04.586 --> 00:16:06.960
Then a few years back, I don't
know if you guys remember,

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.220
but the NFL was locked out.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.201
I do a lot of work with
the NFL in the spring.

00:16:11.201 --> 00:16:12.950
You leave a redneck
at home in the spring,

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:13.980
you get another kid.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.870
So I think 21, 18, four.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.860
Stuff happens.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.000
OK.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.630
We'll move on from that.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:27.190
That helped me really
look at the top

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:30.600
notch physical therapists
and strength coaches

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.460
and chiropractors.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.230
I mean, we work
with all disciplines

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.147
because as far as
I'm concerned, I

00:16:35.147 --> 00:16:37.730
was in a tribe called physical
therapy, but I left that tribe.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.188
I'm in a tribe
called movement now.

00:16:39.188 --> 00:16:43.570
And if you're doing the movement
stuff, you're in the truck.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:47.520
Greg Rose, the co-director
of the Titleist Performance

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.930
Institute is a chiropractor.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.580
We're best buddies.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.910
He lectures with us.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.080
We lecture with him.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.172
And he makes a
statement all the time.

00:16:56.172 --> 00:16:57.630
If you're getting
treated right now

00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.570
and you can tell the difference
between a chiropractor

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.444
and a physical therapist,
they're not as good

00:17:01.444 --> 00:17:05.560
as they could be because we're
merging the best of everything

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.819
that makes you move and
trying to protect ourself

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:08.569
from our own BS.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.270
And one of the best ways we
can do that is first move

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:13.190
well, then move often.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.170
What is well?

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.839
That's where I started my work.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.099
If I can define
"well," then that

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:24.300
works because all this
is is natural selection.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.410
Environments like
organisms that are

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.640
willing to adapt and respond.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.171
If you specialize too much,
stuff is going to change,

00:17:32.171 --> 00:17:33.670
and you're going
to get left behind.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.130
If you don't specialize
enough to survive

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.850
the immediate
things here, you're

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.460
going to get left behind too.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.730
So there's an interplay,
a relationship

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.410
between every organism
in every environment.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.610
You've got to perceive and
receive the information.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.776
You've got to respond to it.

00:17:47.776 --> 00:17:50.040
If you deplete your energy
resources in one direction,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.748
you're not going to
be left in the other.

00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:53.190
So I'm going to
take this around.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.830
But I've got to start
philosophical first.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:01.430
About 1980, we didn't do well.

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.320
Exercise was, how
much can you do?

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.190
How often are you exercising?

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.840
And when I was getting
my undergrad degree

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.080
in exercise science,
we looked at exercise

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.610
three different ways--
frequency, intensity,

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.580
and duration.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.990
Right?

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:17.590
How often are you doing it?

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.990
How intense are you doing it?

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.800
And when you do it,
how long can you do it?

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.050
And that's all we cared about.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:27.850
So most runners are so busy
focusing on their "quantified"

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.730
life-- their Fitbit, their
heart rate, their VO2,

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.860
their body comp, but you can
hear them running 50 yards

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.190
away.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.820
Can you hear an Indian
running 50 yards away?

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.110
Can you hear an
aboriginal hunter-gatherer

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.301
running 50 yards away?

00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:45.800
No, because they wouldn't be
hunting if you could hear them.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.740
And if you work with
some martial artists

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.840
and see how they
can go from a stance

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.404
to a sprint barely making
any noise, that's integrity.

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:58.820
That's respecting
the environment.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.600
Right?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.060
But if you're so
tuned in to your iPod

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.150
that you can't hear
the boom, boom, boom--

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.870
how many people in here have
noise-canceling earbuds?

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.300
I fly a lot so I got some.

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.250
Put them in.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.510
Don't plug it into anything.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:14.510
Hit the noise canceling.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.250
And go for a walk or a run.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.620
And it'll sound like somebody
is dropping a jackhammer.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.360
And that's you
dropping a jackhammer

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.000
because the lack of integrity
that you hit the ground with.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.740
So that beats up your fascial
system, your muscular system,

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.420
your tendons, and your joints.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.580
So I think there should
be a minimum quality

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.320
because you could
take move out of this

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.220
and it would almost
work in any profession

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.990
for a skill set you're
trying to develop.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.630
Hit a minimum
level of competency

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.010
before you start asking
me about quantities,

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.749
or what's your minimum
level of quality.

00:19:46.749 --> 00:19:48.790
I had a lot of fitness
professionals this summer.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:50.530
A lot of people are still trying
to get their head around that.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.120
I'm like, let me
make a different.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.330
How many single people
I got in the audience?

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.160
There we go.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.954
I can have every one of
you a date in five minutes

00:19:57.954 --> 00:19:59.370
as long as standards
don't matter.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.760
Right?

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.730
You just assumed I
was going to match you

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.030
with Mr. Or Mrs. Right.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:05.560
No, I'm not.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:11.880
I'm just going to put you with
somebody because we didn't talk

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.220
about the minimum standards that
are making this being single

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.630
so difficult right now.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.360
But that's the whole point.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.850
When anybody asks a
question about exercise,

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.530
the subject of the sentence
is not the exercise,

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.970
it's who is receiving it.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.690
That's the subject
of the sentence.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.000
And yet, we will have
a long blogs about,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.020
should I front
squat or back squat.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.200
Should I cycle if I have
knee problems or just swim?

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.177
What should I do?

00:20:37.177 --> 00:20:38.260
We don't know who you are.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.184
You're asking a random question
for a specific problem.

00:20:41.184 --> 00:20:43.100
Guess what kind of answer
you're going to get.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.300
Unbelievably random and
probably not too applicable.

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.440
You've got to move
well enough to respond.

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.770
Your response is based on that
perception and that behavior.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:58.550
Act on feedback loops,
minimizing failure.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:02.700
Almost every reason we're doing
our kids a disservice right

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.550
now in athletics is because
Mom and Dad and many coaches

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.190
are operating on a
success strategy.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:14.710
How do I mold this kid
into the next blank?

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.710
Wrong.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.220
It's not the way you do it.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.536
At every level of
movement, at every level

00:21:22.536 --> 00:21:24.160
of physical development,
at every level

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.930
of social development, at every
level of teamwork or whatever,

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:28.470
just don't fail.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.080
And if you don't
fail long enough,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.370
you will be in position to
make the moves up when you can.

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:38.080
But I need your movement
health at a non-failure.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.410
Then I need your movement
literacy, your ability

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.262
to read and write
movement patterns.

00:21:42.262 --> 00:21:43.720
I'm not asking how
fit you are yet.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.120
I'm saying, can you go all
the way down on this knee

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:46.620
and come up?

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:47.390
That's called a lunge.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.660
Can you do it on this knee?

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.919
Can you go all the way down
and come all the way up

00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:51.460
on both feet?

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.550
That's called a squat.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.700
Can you cover the
developmental movement patterns

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.300
that got you here?

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:56.675
And if you can't,
don't you think

00:21:56.675 --> 00:21:57.770
that's the starting point?

00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.350
Or do you think
your training heart

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.433
rate's the starting point?

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:06.120
Move often enough to adapt.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.280
Here's the thing that
blows a lot of people away.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.630
If I introduce you to a
completely new activity,

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.080
in the first three to
four-- some people will

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.750
say five or six-- weeks
of that new activity,

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.374
your strength graph
looks like that.

00:22:19.374 --> 00:22:20.540
And then it looks like that.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.410
It sort of tapers off.

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.500
Your greatest gains
are always going

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.140
to be in the introduction
of a new movement pattern.

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.860
And yet, in that three to four
weeks, your body changes not.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.740
Your bone density
hasn't changed yet.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.950
Your fascia hasn't had
a chance to remodel.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:38.825
Your muscles aren't
doing anything different,

00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:39.741
and they're no bigger.

00:22:39.741 --> 00:22:41.830
And you probably haven't
even lost that much fat.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.030
What happened?

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.030
Your timing, your
coordination, your processing,

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.300
your perception, and your
behaviors got better.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.700
And just in that
amount of time, you

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.900
have refined your software
because your body is not

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.469
going to allocate precious
resources-- calories, right?

00:22:59.469 --> 00:23:01.760
I'm going to hold on to that
Guinness as long as I can.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.920
I'm not going to--
your body's not

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:09.440
going to allocate its precious
resources to making new tissue

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.589
or developing your legs
and removing tissue

00:23:11.589 --> 00:23:13.630
from your upper body
because now you're a runner.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:14.588
It's not going to move.

00:23:14.588 --> 00:23:17.450
It's not going to reorganize
anything architecturally

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.150
until it maximizes
software first.

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.280
Isn't that when you should
probably upgrade a device?

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.920
When the software hits
the limits of the hardware

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.630
can hold?

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.980
And that's when the
body gets a ping.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.530
And your bones get
a little denser.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.240
And your arches get
a little higher.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.770
And your core gets
a little tighter.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:34.910
And your shoulders go back.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:36.285
And your lung
volume goes up, not

00:23:36.285 --> 00:23:38.030
because your lungs got bigger.

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.740
That's not good lung volume.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.150
That's really good lung volume.

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:42.460
It's not hard to see.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.140
But your body won't start
morphing and changing

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:50.420
and adapting until your
software is optimized.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.640
But what if you learned
how to rock climb or cycle

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.990
or paddle a canoe or do some
mixed martial arts or just

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:00.674
do spin class with a really
bad movement pattern?

00:24:00.674 --> 00:24:01.590
You're four rows back.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:05.700
The spin teacher can't see
your knee caved in like that.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.320
You're not doing it well.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.740
But you're doing it often.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.640
You just hit Save on a
pretty shitty document.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.490
Right?

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.400
Because when we impose
stress and load and variety

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.420
and complexity on a movement
pattern, your body assumes,

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:28.560
oh, we've done all we
can do at software.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.310
Let's start morphing hardware.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.400
Is a bone spur the
result of that maybe?

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.255
How about a stress fracture?

00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:40.630
There's only three things
walking around this planet that

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.430
get stress fractures--
human beings,

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.344
race horses, and
greyhounds, or racing dogs.

00:24:47.344 --> 00:24:49.260
And if we would leave
the horses alone and let

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.885
the dogs do what they want, they
wouldn't get stress fractures.

00:24:51.885 --> 00:24:54.210
But we push them into places
they wouldn't otherwise

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:54.880
go in nature.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.590
And we do the same
thing to ourself.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:25:00.070
And so we don't recognize
stress fractures in nature

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:04.470
except in people who like
quantities more than qualities.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.540
Nothing in nature breaks
that rule, not one.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.060
And we've lost our standard
of authentic human movement.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.287
Where do we find it again?

00:25:12.287 --> 00:25:13.870
Well, we've got a
lot of people trying

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.611
to eat like we ate 10,000 years
ago, called the paleo diet.

00:25:16.611 --> 00:25:18.360
If you're not going
to move like they did,

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.984
don't worry about
eating like they did.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:26.190
Principle 2-- now, you
go into health care,

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.770
the Hippocratic
Oath says do no harm

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:30.380
because in your enthusiasm
to help somebody

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.890
through this challenging
episode in their life,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:37.370
you can often remove one
problem and create two.

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.220
If we are going to interact
with your movement life,

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.789
if I'm going to see you,
my first order of business

00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:44.830
is to protect you from
things that could make you

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.220
worse in your immediate future.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.790
And if that means
you're a runner,

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.857
and I got to pull
you off running,

00:25:49.857 --> 00:25:52.190
I am not saying you don't run
for the rest of your life.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.317
I want you back.

00:25:53.317 --> 00:25:54.650
That's where your flow state is.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:55.990
That's keeping
you off of Prozac.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.490
Right?

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.150
I'm all for that.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.630
But not today.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.600
You take your BMW to the shop.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.427
The mechanic's not going to run
along beside you in a school

00:26:05.427 --> 00:26:07.010
zone while you're
running your errands

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.490
and diagnose your car's problem.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.156
They're going to be
like, leave it here.

00:26:10.156 --> 00:26:11.675
You go over there.

00:26:11.675 --> 00:26:13.300
I almost got to do
that with your body.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.780
So sometimes, we've got
to stop a bad behavior

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.400
or break a bad pattern before
I can re-install a new one.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.970
Otherwise, guess
which one you're

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.290
going to run more frequently?

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.050
The one that's most accessible.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.770
So your bad running
stride, you need

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.815
to forget that while I'm
opening up your hip mobility

00:26:27.815 --> 00:26:29.940
and showing you a different
way to train your core.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.790
And believe it or not, I'm
going to have you doing cardio

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.530
the whole time.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.510
But it's going to look a
lot more like a VersaClimber

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.160
or a jump rope until
you learn to hit

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.610
the ground with integrity and
store the energy like you're

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:39.820
supposed to.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:40.320
OK?

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:42.380
A lot of people don't
like to hear that.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.480
They'd just rather put
a strap on this knee,

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.590
use Ibuprofen as
a breakfast food,

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.030
don't let me interfere
with your run.

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.660
All right?

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.270
And as Mark Twain said, denial
ain't just a river in Egypt.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.910
To be clear, I got to protect
you before I correct you.

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:01.010
Now, when I'm doing
corrective exercise,

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.080
that's different because
I magnify your mistakes.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.200
I put you in a situation
where it's absolutely obvious

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.560
that your mistake is magnified.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.890
I did this a long time
ago with people who

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.429
would get in the squat rack.

00:27:12.429 --> 00:27:14.220
And they would shift
all the way over here.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.817
And you try to, hey, get
back up in the middle.

00:27:17.817 --> 00:27:20.400
The language of movement is not
written in words and pictures.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.290
So trying to coach somebody
with visual pictures and words

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:25.770
has to go through three filters
of their own personality

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.650
before it gets to
where it needs to be.

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:31.280
If I know somebody is
squatting off line,

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.170
I get one of those slick
little slide boards

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.630
and put the little parachute
booties on both feet

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:36.630
and say, squat down.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:37.838
And this foot just spins out.

00:27:37.838 --> 00:27:39.990
And I'm like, squat
without that spinning out.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.800
That's really hard.

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:41.710
I got to concentrate.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:42.210
Good.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.990
Next week you won't have to.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:47.519
But right now, squat right there
without your foot spinning out.

00:27:47.519 --> 00:27:48.810
You don't have the slide board?

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.934
Put on your slickest socks.

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:51.027
Go find a hardwood floor.

00:27:51.027 --> 00:27:53.110
Try to squat down with
your feet pointing forward.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.060
Whichever one's
spinning out is the one

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.110
you're pushing off
of in the squat rack.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.340
We could easily fix that.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.881
But I'm not going
to fix it while you

00:27:59.881 --> 00:28:01.570
got 300 pounds on your back.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:02.270
OK?

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.660
And we don't tune your car
when it's running wide open.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.150
Cut my hands off.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.470
So we don't need to.

00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.200
By the way, of
the three things I

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.430
said-- protect,
correct, or develop--

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.560
which is training wheels?

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.610
Do training rules make
you a better cyclist?

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.260
No, or they'd be using
them in the Tour de France.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.722
One guy just passes you on
the mountain with the training

00:28:23.722 --> 00:28:24.930
wheels.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.368
I gotta get me some of those.

00:28:26.368 --> 00:28:29.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:34.330
The training wheels actually
don't correct or develop you.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:39.020
They simply protect your
child from allowing a mistake

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.260
to become an accident.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.660
That's it.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.240
And there's two ways to
get a kid riding a bike.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.522
One is let him worry about
propulsion without balance.

00:28:46.522 --> 00:28:48.480
The other is get them
one of those bicycles you

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.620
see it REI now that
have no pedals on them

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.510
and let them get
their balance first.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:53.630
There's no right way.

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:55.838
And if you have a wrench,
you can take the pedals off

00:28:55.838 --> 00:28:58.120
of any bike and put it
back on when you want to.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.600
The point being, all
those training wheels do

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.940
is let your child develop
confidence and interact

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:08.454
in an activity so they
will have the drive

00:29:08.454 --> 00:29:10.620
to deal with the few falls
that are going to happen.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.290
Every kid is going to
fall with that bike.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:15.480
And that's my job.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:15.980
OK?

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.340
I'm out there with the first
aid kit, first time riding.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.840
All right, they're
going to go down.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.350
We've got to get over that.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:25.050
But I think you all understand
that those training wheels

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:27.140
don't make better bikers.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.430
They give them the illusion that
they can cycle long before they

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:31.980
have the competency to.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:36.040
But we always have the
intention of taking these off.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.857
Now, if you dial your fitness
life back a little bit--

00:29:38.857 --> 00:29:40.940
we used to walk in a gym
with a bunch of machines.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.090
Those machines aren't
there to help you.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.360
They're there to protect you.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.940
Sit down and push out.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.090
You can't hurt yourself.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:48.790
We tried.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.180
We've run every idiot we could
find through the seated-- you

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.380
can't hurt yourself.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:53.880
OK?

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.430
If both your hands are
here, you can't even

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:57.888
stick this hand in there and
let the weight stack come down

00:29:57.888 --> 00:29:58.600
on it.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.590
So no illusions.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.520
We don't need to train
you by body part.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.880
The reason we put you on
those lines of equipment

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.510
is so we don't have to talk
to you and interact with you.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.990
And you're a rat on a wheel.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.259
And you are burning calories.

00:30:12.259 --> 00:30:12.800
That's right.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.520
But you're not going to
do anything outside any

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.280
better because your
biceps got stronger.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:25.220
So many of the things we
do in health and fitness

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.200
simply protect you
from getting worse

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.020
because we just don't
have the interest

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:34.610
or system to say exactly
what you need to do next.

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:38.020
Principle 1-- do it well
before you do it often.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:38.920
Did I say perfect?

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.790
No.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.100
Well enough.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.680
2-- if we're going to
have engineered selection

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.040
of what opportunities
I should expose you to

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.270
and which ones I should
pull you back from

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.130
and which ones I should amplify
until you can read and write

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:57.729
them better, that's protect,
correct, and develop.

00:30:57.729 --> 00:30:59.270
If I believe those
two things, then I

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.730
got to create a systematic
approach that works even when

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:03.800
I leave the room because if I'm
the only one holding those two

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.980
principles, it's hard
to put my name on a sign

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.400
and five people
do the same thing.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.609
And we've got to have a
systematic approach in health

00:31:10.609 --> 00:31:11.400
care with movement.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.089
And yet, we don't.

00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:16.620
More about that in a second.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.370
Principle 3 guided me to create
a systematic group of filters

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:27.530
that allow me to use Principle
2 to enable Principle 1.

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.750
It takes a while to do this.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:31.070
You read books like
Simon Sinek, where he's

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.547
talking about start with why.

00:31:32.547 --> 00:31:34.880
And you look at some of the
major innovations we've got.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.860
And it's just a
better why statement

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.410
that sent us to a better
how should we do that,

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.480
and what should be the outcome.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.850
And I try to step way, way back
out of the movement sciences

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.840
and say, listen, we're
making advancements

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.660
everywhere else because we get
the bullshit out of the way.

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.190
We get the dogma out of the way.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:55.210
We get the opinions and
paradigm shifts out of the way,

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:57.520
and oh, it's absolutely clear.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.800
And that's the whole
point of today's message.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.920
It's way more simple
than you think.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:07.130
Now, a couple years
ago, a martial artist

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:10.750
showed a 14-year-old
how to break a board

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.260
with her fist or his fist.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.060
That same board would
have broken that fist.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.310
But under the care
of a martial artist,

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:22.010
with breath and posture and
everything that they did,

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:24.210
they're breaking a board.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:25.980
Did that martial
artist know anything

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.800
about the anatomy of the hand
or how powerful the tricep was?

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.010
And did that kid have to
put on any weight at all

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:34.720
to break that board?

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:36.154
No.

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:38.195
There's a perfect software
programme right there.

00:32:38.195 --> 00:32:40.790
A good martial artist,
a good dance teacher,

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:44.300
a good gymnastics teacher is
programming movement software

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.360
better than we are unless
they focus on success

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.850
instead of non-failure.

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:53.030
If you go for success too early,
you're going to hurt somebody.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.552
You've got to
remember-- I mean, I

00:32:54.552 --> 00:32:57.010
think we were all really happy
to see Peyton Manning go out

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:58.530
on top with a Super Bowl.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:32:59.650
Most of us were, I guess.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:00.733
But you've got to realize.

00:33:00.733 --> 00:33:03.690
He's probably the last of
the three-sport athletes

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.020
we'll ever see?

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.900
Not only have most
eight-year-olds decided

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.820
on the sport they're going to
play at the professional level,

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:11.236
they've also decided
the position.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.410
Everybody knew that your
last name like Manning,

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.500
you're going to end
up playing football.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.280
But his dad was
smart enough to know

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.410
baseball instills a different
set of movement skills

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.490
and teamwork skills.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.340
And so does basketball.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.290
Plus, we got to
keep this kid busy.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.130
So you got a three-sport
athlete right up

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.150
until the time it's time
to get a scholarship.

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:35.030
And then you use the
scholarship for what it's for.

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:37.655
And then you take that and honor
it with a professional career.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:42.370
That's my blue sky statement.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:43.150
Right?

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:45.460
That's the way it ought to be.

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.960
But if we don't do
something right now that's

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.320
practical and can be
implemented anywhere,

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.670
then really all I'm doing
is exposing a problem

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.020
that we all know we have.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.690
All I did was break it down from
a series of principles that's

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.170
based on the way organisms
and environments act

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.065
in the original operating
system that you started with.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.820
Everything I just
said you would think

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.710
is part of a standard
operating process

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.280
in health care,
teaching, coaching,

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.050
and training movement.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.870
It's not.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:22.489
I'm here to expose
common mistakes

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:25.900
in movement programming and tell
you how we're trying to fix it.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.570
Much of what we're
going to cover

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.100
can apply to you
right now, meaning

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.260
you can vet some of
this stuff on your own

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:37.969
without a pro
standing next to you.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.650
Steve realized very quickly
that even though he'd

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.540
met a lot of
professionals, none of them

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.230
were using a clear,
logical, standard operating

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.949
procedure for deductive
reasoning of, is this

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.340
my hardware problem
or software problem.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.710
Not one of his 17 surgeries
was a brain surgery,

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:55.639
if I'm correct.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.139
Right?

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:58.960
So nobody questioned
your software.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.440
They only questioned
his hardware.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.730
And if you've got a hammer--

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.980
If we look at your body
with an x-ray or MRI,

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.792
we can find something wrong.

00:35:08.792 --> 00:35:10.250
Does that mean
that's what's wrong?

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.920
No.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.500
It just means
you're not perfect.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.280
And I think we're all
perfectly aware of that.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:19.470
How do we know
there are mistakes?

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:23.160
Well, did you know that
the number one risk

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.000
factor for a future
musculoskeletal injury

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.640
in your life is a
previous injury?

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.270
And the second thing
is the severity

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.260
of the previous injury.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.060
I can't do nothing about that.

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.089
I can't go back in time.

00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:40.630
But it should make you think a
little bit outside of the box.

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.410
Most of us in here
that have been injured

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:46.210
enough to have to not play,
not train, or stay out of work

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.840
also met a health
care professional

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.892
that helped us with that.

00:35:48.892 --> 00:35:51.350
Now, there's only two outcomes
when those are the first two

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.070
predictors of a future injury.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.840
Either every injury leaves
you a little bit less

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.540
than you originally were.

00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:01.950
Or we did not completely serve
your rehabilitation needs.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:03.520
Both statements are true.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.390
If you have a
permanent disability,

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.440
I should alert you
of that before we

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.540
cease to have a relationship.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:13.400
And if you could potentially get
back to where you were before,

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.599
I must tell you if
you're there yet or not.

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:17.390
And just because your
insurance quit paying

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:18.931
or because your low
back pain is gone

00:36:18.931 --> 00:36:20.224
doesn't mean you're functional.

00:36:20.224 --> 00:36:21.390
See, I have a lot of people.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.806
They're pain free
in three visits.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.937
They still can't do that.

00:36:27.937 --> 00:36:30.020
They still can't play golf,
but they're pain free.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.360
So most people
after every injury

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:34.460
just get a little
bit smaller life.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.650
Oh, I used to do that, but
I don't do that anymore.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.200
I used to do that, but
I don't do that anymore.

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.170
So as your life gets smaller,
you're in the illusion

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:41.544
that you think
you're functional.

00:36:41.544 --> 00:36:42.260
And you're not.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.801
And then all of a sudden, you
get to go do an extreme weekend

00:36:44.801 --> 00:36:46.860
and boom, back goes
out, foot flares up,

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.230
or something like that.

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:51.550
So we are the problem.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.730
If you've previously
been injured

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.800
and you've been through
a health care model

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.790
and we didn't either alert you
to a permanent, longstanding

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:01.830
problem, or get you back
to what you had before,

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:03.680
we didn't really do
anything but stand

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:08.301
there while you were trying
to get better in the process.

00:37:08.301 --> 00:37:10.050
This may be a little
bit painful to watch.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:12.910
But I got a back story for it.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:16.680
This is a biomechanical
analysis of a young gymnast

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.630
doing a squat.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:21.080
Now, we put little markers here.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.960
And a computer creates an
image of what she's doing,

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.834
like a moving
x-ray, if you will.

00:37:25.834 --> 00:37:27.750
You've got blue lines
right here because she's

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.130
standing on two force plates.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.870
And the one thing I want you
to look at, the blue line

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:34.540
is supposed to go through
your architecture.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:35.540
That's the stress point.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.240
That's the alignment.

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.580
When the blue line goes
outside of your joint,

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.890
that's sheer force.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.530
That's rotational torsion.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.674
That's basically what
happens to your ACL,

00:37:46.674 --> 00:37:48.340
the anterior cruciate
ligament we're all

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.460
getting ready to hear about
because it's football season

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.140
and we're going to
watch SportsCenter.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.750
And it's getting
ready to happen.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:03.080
This girl, a gymnast,
blew out her ACL,

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.730
went through surgery
and rehabilitation,

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.020
and was released
both by her surgeon

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.320
and her physical therapist,
and actually went back

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.890
and started competing again and
got this biomechanical analysis

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:22.110
of her squatting pattern a month
or two after the entire thing

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.580
was done.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.926
The alarming thing is they
did surgery on her left knee.

00:38:31.672 --> 00:38:33.380
See, it doesn't matter
what her name was.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.170
It could have been
Jennifer or Diane.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:38.050
Her name on the
chart was left knee.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.530
And the left knee
looks damn good.

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:43.464
They didn't fix her.

00:38:43.464 --> 00:38:45.380
They just strengthened
her knee after surgery.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.000
Four months after
this video was taken,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.640
she blew the other knee
in the sport she loved.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.780
She's part of a
female ACL epidemic.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.780
It has nothing to do with
the way a female is built

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.610
or hormones or anything
else because those have all

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.230
been side stories
in the news we've

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.280
tried to use to explain it.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.450
We saw this occur
when females started

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.096
playing more field
and court sports

00:39:14.096 --> 00:39:15.970
and were allowed to at
the high school level,

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.857
but weren't allocated the same
training time as the boys.

00:39:18.857 --> 00:39:20.690
Oh, yeah, you can play
softball, basketball.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:23.630
You can run track,
do whatever you want.

00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:26.360
There's no weight room for you.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.970
See, we learned
that the hard way.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.690
When we expect these young
things out of a male's body,

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:33.040
we give them the time and
the off-season training.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.350
The sports-minded girls just
went from sport to sport

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:38.930
to sport, and never getting
the physical architecture

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.400
to support the activities
they were doing.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.990
So if we give them
access to play,

00:39:42.990 --> 00:39:44.870
why don't we give them
access to training correctly?

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:45.480
We didn't.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.650
And we created a problem.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.740
And now we're solving
it with surgery

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:54.760
instead of proactive teaching,
coaching, and training.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:59.040
Return to sports
rate-- 40% to 50%

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:01.040
of the people who have
that ACL surgery actually

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.630
return to the original sport
at the level they were going.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:07.130
The rest, life changes.

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:10.270
But they've also got a
30% chance of re-injury.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.680
But it doesn't matter which
side, which tells me it's

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.790
a pattern, not a part, that's
causing these knee injuries.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:19.280
And who controls the patterns?

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.280
We've got to reprogram movement.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.690
Getting the new cartilage
doesn't do anything

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:27.000
if the brain doesn't
honor the alignment

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.809
and support shock absorption and
integrity of the new cartilage.

00:40:32.809 --> 00:40:34.850
Dysfunctional movement
patterns that are habitual

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:37.130
rarely change unless
specifically addressed.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.030
We've got to identify
that as not good enough.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:41.750
and change it.

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.890
Her entire support system
was looking at the part.

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:47.760
Her doctor, her physical
therapist, her parents,

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.520
everybody said, hey, we got
a new ligament in the knee.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.702
All is good.

00:40:51.702 --> 00:40:52.660
You don't hurt anymore.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.310
All is good.

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.740
Oh, the scar is
looking wonderful.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.073
Put some more Vitamin E on that.

00:40:56.073 --> 00:40:57.410
All is good.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:40:59.240
Nobody's watching her move.

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.450
The whole reason she blew
her knee in gymnastics,

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.640
which is not a contact
sport, is because she

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.862
was landing in valgus collapse.

00:41:06.862 --> 00:41:08.820
But somebody was just
seeing if she could stick

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.340
or landing, not if she
landed with integrity.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.940
And those are two
different things.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.156
A good athlete can stick
the landing ugly as hell

00:41:16.156 --> 00:41:17.780
because they compensate
better than us.

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.260
I got to work with NFL players
all through the spring.

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.890
They compensate
better than we do,

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.940
which is why they get
to do what they do.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:31.510
ACL patients of both
sexes on average

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.080
control their body weight
with a similar level

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.660
as do 60-year-old
healthy controls.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.170
That means regardless of
where in your life you are,

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.630
you blow your knee
out to the point

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:44.660
where you've got to get an
ACL reconstruction in the two,

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.050
three, four, five months
of rehabilitation that

00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:51.060
follow that, even
with all that care,

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.850
you immediately
advanced your life.

00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:56.200
And you're moving like
a normal 60-year-old.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.960
I don't want that
for my daughters.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.350
I don't want for your sons.

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.350
But that's what's going
to happen because that's

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.750
what the statistics say.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:08.149
This is not simply a
sports medicine statistic.

00:42:08.149 --> 00:42:09.940
If you're one of those
injured individuals,

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:14.520
your trajectory of your
entire movement life changed.

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.690
I'll bring it back around
because we got to do stuff

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:17.820
with these guys too.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.570
It's almost funny to look
at "injury rates" in the NFL

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.780
because everybody in the
NFL is going to get injured

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.110
and has been injured.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:29.540
It's an activity with
a 100% injury rate.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.800
But I delivered this
statistic at the NFL

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.170
combine two years ago because
we'd go into to combine.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.120
We're there testing.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.980
And one of the greatest things
about doing movement screening,

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.810
what we do at the combine now,
is it sends a positive message

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:45.436
down through college.

00:42:45.436 --> 00:42:47.060
If you're bigger,
stronger, and faster,

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.020
but you gave up movement
integrity to get there,

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.970
we don't want you
because you're not

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.835
going be here long
because you know

00:42:54.835 --> 00:42:56.820
that's what NFL stands for.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.340
Right?

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.035
Not For Long.

00:43:00.035 --> 00:43:01.490
That's what it stands for.

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.990
OK.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.720
That is the way that I think
the 14, 15 season in the NFL,

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:12.720
that's the distribution of
injuries over the entire season

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.900
over all the teams.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:19.690
We see some clusters here--
ankle, knee, thigh, shoulder.

00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:21.016
Those are big clusters.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.890
Now, we could
individually evaluate,

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:30.960
do MRI's on all these parts
preseason for everybody.

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.600
Or we could simply
find a movement pattern

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.730
that confronts every one of
those joints in a pattern,

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:39.540
your lunge pattern,
a standardized lunge

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.150
pattern, because when you
lunge, that's your deceleration

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:43.400
direction change.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.090
And that is the number one
thing in field and court sports.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:50.394
That's the movement pattern
that says how durable are you.

00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:52.810
Are you going to be able to
hold up to this kind of thing?

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:54.130
So that's the movement pattern.

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:57.270
So that one movement
pattern confronts

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:02.100
777 out of 1,345 of
those injuries, 58%.

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.350
I could have seen that before
because if that movement

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:08.820
pattern looks ugly on one side,
both sides, or causes you pain,

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:11.590
you're already in that group,
and you just don't know it yet.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.220
Now, if that causes a problem, I
can easily put you on the table

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:22.550
and look at the knee, the thigh,
the shoulder independently.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:27.010
But if I look at the knee, the
thigh, and the shoulder first,

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.924
I'll never see the pattern
because the whole is always

00:44:29.924 --> 00:44:31.340
greater than the
sum of its parts.

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:33.489
And health has told you
if your parts look good,

00:44:33.489 --> 00:44:35.030
everything else will
fall into place.

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:36.640
It's the other way around.

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.110
The Hall of Fame is full of
people with pretty bad parts.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:41.890
They were more
resourceful with the way

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:43.650
they used them, with
the way they managed

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.050
their physical resources.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.980
So here's the good news.

00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.280
Since we can't go back
in time and do that,

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.800
what are the other three
factors that actually predict

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.200
your future movement
health, the obstacles you're

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.760
going to have to confront
in your movement life?

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.970
Pain with any movement test, not
joint test, but movement test.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:05.030
Do a movement pattern.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.140
Make sure it's reliable.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.050
Did you have pain?

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.487
If so, you're already hurt.

00:45:09.487 --> 00:45:11.820
You just don't know it yet
because your brain is already

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.090
avoiding those activities.

00:45:13.090 --> 00:45:15.880
But what if that is the movement
pattern you should be doing?

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:19.440
Then we've got to
figure out why.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:24.280
Ankle flexibility is showing
huge, absolutely huge.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:24.945
Why?

00:45:24.945 --> 00:45:26.320
It's the number
one injury you're

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:28.153
going to get in high
school athletics that's

00:45:28.153 --> 00:45:31.460
really-- you rolled your ankle.

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.880
When the pain goes away, does
that mean the ankle is normal?

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.410
No.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:37.460
No, and we've been
seeing huge things

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:39.120
in as many different
populations as we

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.230
can find-- fire service,
paratroopers, NFL,

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.880
14-year-old female
soccer players.

00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.200
It's all the way across.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.220
If that ankle doesn't
move, then don't just

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.300
think of it mechanically.

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.520
If that ankle doesn't move,
the sensory perception

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.154
coming up through that
ankle is just like water

00:45:56.154 --> 00:45:58.320
going through a garden hose
that you're standing on.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.230
I'm not getting as
much information

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:01.660
from a restricted joint.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.500
So the reason we got
to do our flexibility,

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:05.870
guys, is not so you can
have the architecture

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:07.190
of a perfect joint.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:10.200
The more information you
can give to the processor,

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.700
the more the processor can
do with the information.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:15.070
So having stiffness
is inexcusable

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.220
if there's a way
to get around it.

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.160
So if you've got to
start your journey back

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.690
into movement health, start it
with flexibility and realize

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.780
you're not finished
when you get flexible.

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:28.260
You're just providing your brain
with more sensory information.

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.400
And now, you've got to
do things well enough

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:35.650
to adapt so you can
do them often enough.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.410
Movement screening
and balance testing

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:39.270
are the other
things that predict,

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:41.949
is this going to be a good
running season for you.

00:46:41.949 --> 00:46:44.240
Is this going to be a good
Spartan race season for you?

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.980
Is this going to be a good
triathlete season for you?

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.660
So how do we use the
principles to fix movement?

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.740
Here they are.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.780
But we've got to have
those systematic filters

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:58.540
we talked about.

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:01.840
Well, back in the early
days, back in, say,

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.740
the mid-'90s, every one
of us saw this coming.

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:06.910
We saw these bad patterns.

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.575
But we all tried to just
write new programs to keep

00:47:09.575 --> 00:47:10.950
that from-- oh,
we just got to do

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.530
twice as much core with them.

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:14.970
We just need more flexibility
work and that'll do it.

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:16.920
And yet, a surprising
statistic came out

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:20.880
of the military that said-- way
back in the 1980s-- it's not

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:25.270
tightness or weakness that
seems to cause greater injuries.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:27.060
It's left-right asymmetry.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:30.340
It's when the sides of the
body just don't balance out.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.360
And you don't have to
be perfect balanced out.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.680
Out here at skill
level, these hands

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.330
are nothing like each other.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.640
But if I can tell which
way you swing a golf club

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:43.060
or throw a ball by looking at
your core, it's gone too deep.

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.930
You've imbalanced your
body to a disadvantage.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:47.546
10% imbalance we'll accept.

00:47:47.546 --> 00:47:49.170
And it's actually
pretty normal to see.

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:51.237
Anything greater
than that is probably

00:47:51.237 --> 00:47:53.070
going to start robbing
from your efficiency.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.460
I'm not saying you
can't do your job.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.480
I'm saying it's going to start
robbing from your efficiency.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.490
All we were doing were trying to
write better exercise programs.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:03.040
And I was part of that problem.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.970
I was guilty too.

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:04.470
Right?

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:05.770
We're just writing programs.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:08.061
Everybody, just do this
program, you'll be bulletproof.

00:48:08.061 --> 00:48:10.396
Here, eat that diet,
you'll be bulletproof.

00:48:10.396 --> 00:48:13.920
It's not the way it goes because
you can't fix anything that you

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.986
don't fully understand.

00:48:14.986 --> 00:48:16.360
And I started this
off saying, we

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.410
need to read that movement code
before we start hacking it.

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:20.000
OK?

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.020
Oh, you've got a week core,
so 4,000 crunches from now,

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.330
you'll be perfect.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:25.285
No, you won't.

00:48:25.285 --> 00:48:27.160
You'll just be hunched
over a little bit more

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.650
because your abs are so
over-trained now you can't

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:31.930
stand back up like you need to.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:34.880
We built filters that
capture movement patterns

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:38.360
below the qualitative standard,
regardless of program.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.860
I've got no bias.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:41.482
I'm certified in
Pilates mat work.

00:48:41.482 --> 00:48:42.690
I'm certified in kettlebells.

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.314
I'm certified in
Olympic weightlifting.

00:48:44.314 --> 00:48:45.090
I have no bias.

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:47.536
I don't care how you train
or what exercises you do.

00:48:47.536 --> 00:48:49.410
If they're working for
you, I can measure it.

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.680
And if they're not,
I can measure it.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.960
So there's 1,000 different ways
to connect you with movement

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.870
flow, with your thing.

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:58.290
You want to surf?

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.500
I can show you exactly
how to warm up, cool down.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.510
Surfing might take care of every
movement problem you've got.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:04.800
Do it right.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.950
Screen it out.

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:08.930
Most of the things
you love to do,

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:10.692
we can keep you fit right there.

00:49:10.692 --> 00:49:12.150
You've just got to
make sure you're

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:13.520
moving well going into it.

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.200
And then it feeds the system.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.670
And the system keeps growing.

00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:18.560
If you're perpetually
in an activity that

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.430
keeps you imbalanced, here's
your minimal effective dose

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:23.140
of supplementation
and cross-training

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.150
that keeps you balanced out.

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:26.140
I respect your time.

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.350
I want you to play way
more than you train.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:29.254
All right?

00:49:29.254 --> 00:49:31.420
Because when people train,
I just don't like the way

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:32.160
their faces look.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.550
And when people play, their
faces just look better.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:36.560
Right?

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:39.010
There's less cortisol in
this face than this face.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.989
So we got a strength coach,
a physical therapist,

00:49:45.989 --> 00:49:48.030
another physical therapist,
and athletic trainer.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.590
Danville, Virginia,
and if you don't

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:51.610
know where that is and
you saw the first season

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.150
of "Moonshiners,"
that's where that is.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:55.020
OK?

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.270
We're not near there.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:57.260
We're that zip code.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:57.760
OK?

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:02.120
So liquor comes in a
jar where I'm from.

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.270
Anyway, we had four
county high schools

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:07.580
and the city high school.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:09.650
And we were
dissatisfied with how

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:12.344
proactive we could be
with kids getting injured.

00:50:12.344 --> 00:50:14.510
So we had nothing to lose
because we had no research

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.770
grant.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:16.561
We had no money coming
from a shoe company.

00:50:16.561 --> 00:50:19.360
We had nothing except an
extra hour in the morning

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:22.450
before work started.

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:23.940
And I'm leading this group.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:27.320
And together, we started
talking about maybe

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.754
we should do movement screening.

00:50:30.754 --> 00:50:33.170
But we're going to do something
no one's ever done before.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:35.450
We're going to build all
this disadvantage into it

00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:37.147
to make ourselves better.

00:50:37.147 --> 00:50:39.480
Malcolm Gladwell talked about
it in "David and Goliath."

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:42.030
Some of the best
situations we've ever seen

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:47.610
came out of constriction,
came out of limited resources.

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:49.941
We wanted to capture movement
signs before symptoms.

00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:51.190
Think about that for a minute.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:53.565
The reason we're making progress
with cancer and diabetes

00:50:53.565 --> 00:50:56.334
is early detection,
not treatment.

00:50:56.334 --> 00:50:57.250
How about orthopedics?

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.104
What do we do?

00:50:58.104 --> 00:50:59.520
We wait until your
back's hurting.

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.110
And then we work
backward and say, well, I

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:01.970
think it's your core.

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:02.790
And then he's
going to say, well,

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:03.830
I think he's got stiff hips.

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:05.430
And I'm like, his
arches have fallen.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:06.560
We're all right.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:08.600
And we're all wrong
because all three of those

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.680
aren't equally part
of what's happening.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.800
One is the bottleneck
of the situation

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.300
until we remove it and measure
the difference it made.

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.390
And then we remove the
next one and the next one.

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:21.280
Signs before symptoms, we do
it in almost every other organ

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:24.960
system of the body
except movement.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.370
And we wait until your hurting.

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:27.730
And we walk backward.

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:29.270
And you can't deny
what we're saying

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:31.850
because we're all talking
chicken or the egg to you.

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:33.130
OK?

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:36.260
We wanted to capture
patterns before data points.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.430
The patterns speak way
louder than the data points.

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:40.670
And the worst pattern?

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:42.920
That's where we look
for data points.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.460
Right?

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.370
We wanted nearly anyone to be
able to administer the test.

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:51.115
The front line of defense isn't
my physical therapy office

00:51:51.115 --> 00:51:52.860
or Greg Rose's
chiropractic office.

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.156
The front of defense
is the athletic trainer

00:51:55.156 --> 00:51:57.030
at the high school, the
science teacher who's

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.210
coaching softball.

00:51:59.210 --> 00:52:01.160
Right?

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.656
Your running group leader,
your yoga instructor,

00:52:04.656 --> 00:52:06.030
that's the front
line of defense.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.740
The drill instructor,
the fitness chief

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.520
at the firehouse, that's
who's running this stuff.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:13.520
And that's what we built
movement screening for.

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:19.780
It must be inexpensive
with respect

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.467
to time, space, energy, and
cost, or it won't make it

00:52:22.467 --> 00:52:23.300
to the high schools.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.990
It won't make it to
where it's needed.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:29.834
We've been movement screening
kids in Rwanda right now.

00:52:29.834 --> 00:52:31.000
They don't have playgrounds.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.350
They don't have shoes.

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:35.260
And they actually move better
than the kids in our country

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.870
that have playgrounds
and shoes and coaches

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.100
and whistles and FitBits.

00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.980
We must filter for a minimum
acceptable level of movement

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.940
quality, not maximum level.

00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.860
And we must check
movement competency

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:51.990
before physical capacity.

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:58.060
If we can do all those things,
I think we'll be right.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:01.180
These are our standard.

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.899
Now, these are simply tests.

00:53:02.899 --> 00:53:05.190
But ones a blood pressure
cuff, and one's an eye chart.

00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:07.856
And even though they're test
can give us a distribution,

00:53:07.856 --> 00:53:09.230
all we're really
looking for when

00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:11.320
we do this is, am
I going to give you

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.510
a driver's license or not.

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:14.590
And it's a screen.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:18.470
If you test legally blind,
then we know what to do.

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:21.000
We've got to go
investigate something.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.010
And if you test hypertensive,
we've got to figure out why.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:25.567
That's all a screen is for.

00:53:25.567 --> 00:53:27.400
And that's what a
movement screen should do.

00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:29.030
If you're not
hypertensive and you

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:30.890
can read the line
you're supposed to read,

00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:31.904
get on with your life.

00:53:31.904 --> 00:53:34.320
Vision ain't the reason you're
not going to be successful.

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.580
And hypertension
isn't the reason

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.050
you're not going
to be successful.

00:53:37.050 --> 00:53:39.330
And if you score good enough
on the movement screen,

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:40.930
the reason you're
not winning races

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:42.370
isn't because of your movement.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:44.950
It might be because of your
tactical or technical strategy.

00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:48.460
But it's not because of
your physical presence

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:51.620
because people with your
exact same physical resources

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:52.570
are winning.

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:53.320
It ain't physical.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.700
Following these
self-imposed rules,

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:04.240
we sort of found a GPS
of how you should move.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.420
And we got it off the
original operating

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.330
system, these milestones.

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:12.000
Now, it doesn't look like this
because it's really hard for me

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.420
to get NFL players to do this.

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:15.640
It looks like that.

00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.810
But believe it or not, even
though these don't look exactly

00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:21.900
like exercises we
do, each one of those

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.130
is a squeeze point or a
pinch point that says,

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:27.090
if you don't have the mobility
or motor control to cover

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.690
the pattern, you'll flunk.

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:31.630
Each one of these,
if it hurts, it's

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:33.320
a health problem, not
a fitness problem.

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:37.830
And if you can't do it,
it's a literacy problem, not

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:39.230
a capacity problem.

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:40.980
You can't even read
and write the pattern.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:42.200
Why are you loading it?

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.910
So we may not load
one of those patterns.

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:45.310
Your squat could be beautiful.

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:46.420
Your lunge sucks.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.342
You don't get to
load your lunge.

00:54:48.342 --> 00:54:50.800
I don't want to see you hopping
around with a split stance.

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:53.216
And I sure don't want to see
you lugging dumbbells around.

00:54:53.216 --> 00:54:55.980
Because what happens when
we load a bad pattern?

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.590
We hit Save on a
shitty document.

00:54:58.590 --> 00:54:59.190
OK?

00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:01.900
We don't want to do that.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.800
In current levels of
athletic testing right now,

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:08.870
it's very vogue to run her and
jump her off these force plates

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:11.480
and see if that knee caves in.

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.730
But when you run and jump,
that's four body weights.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.281
That's gravity times four.

00:55:16.281 --> 00:55:18.030
When you're just
standing there squatting,

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:21.180
that's gravity times
one body weight.

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.860
Why do we fast forward
and go right to here?

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:27.040
Because if the knee
caves here, it's

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:29.120
a movement reading
and writing problem.

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.400
And if it caves
here as well, that's

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.460
just magnified with load.

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:36.220
If it doesn't cave
here, but caves here,

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:39.120
we're not fit enough
to do the activity.

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.860
But if it caves at
both places, we're

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:44.440
not even literate enough
to take the loads.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.690
Separating those two groups
and not seeing them same way

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:50.800
is literally the
technology we tapped into.

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:54.150
Now, it doesn't take long
to fix any of this stuff

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.140
if you aim better.

00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:57.740
And I say this all the time.

00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:59.290
Everybody who goes
to sniper school

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:00.860
already knows how to shoot.

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.830
Why are they going
to sniper school?

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:06.010
To learn how to aim.

00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:08.640
They're going to hit everything
they ever aim at instead

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.252
of hoping they hit something.

00:56:11.252 --> 00:56:12.960
And that's what I
think we do in fitness.

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:13.793
Oh, your back hurts?

00:56:13.793 --> 00:56:14.930
Hey, try these exercises.

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:15.639
They work for me.

00:56:15.639 --> 00:56:18.096
Well, unless you're willing to
go in their medicine cabinet

00:56:18.096 --> 00:56:20.100
and dig all that crap
out too, I wouldn't

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.520
take that kind of advice
because all they're doing

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:24.646
is you're going to sample
yet another thing that

00:56:24.646 --> 00:56:27.270
may be giving you good feedback
and you know how to measure it.

00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:29.080
And it may be giving
you horrible feedback,

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.667
and you don't have
a reason to stop.

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:36.650
We built three
simple little tools.

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:39.850
Technology is going to come
behind us and probably improve

00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:40.790
every one of those.

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:46.920
But right now, in about 10
minutes, 10 to 15 minutes,

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:50.240
15 to 20 minutes, we can look
at your movement competency,

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:53.300
your movement health, and
your movement capacity.

00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:55.360
They're feedback loops
that feed each other.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.190
If you screen movement,
and we find you just

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:00.930
can't move on one pattern,
we set you right up

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:03.120
with an exercise that
will help you perceive

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.260
and behave in that
pattern better.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.980
And we retest it.

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.750
If you have pain in
any of those patterns,

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.460
we created a medical
movement screen

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.620
because we were sick
and tired of letting

00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.340
injury, previously, be a
risk factor for the future.

00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:18.540
We got to tighten it
up on the rehab end,

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.920
just like we got to tighten
it up on the fitness floor.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:24.000
And if you move good
enough to learn,

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.606
let's throw some loads at
you and see what direction

00:57:26.606 --> 00:57:27.480
you want to learn in.

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.110
Do you want to learn
to be more endurance?

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:30.590
Do you want to learn
to be more strength?

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:32.173
Do you want to learn
to be more agile?

00:57:32.173 --> 00:57:34.540
Do you want to learn
to be more springy?

00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:35.820
What is it you want to learn?

00:57:35.820 --> 00:57:38.200
We can direct you right
there, and let know,

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:40.760
do you have a physical
barrier to skill acquisition.

00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:47.890
Now, believe it or not we've
been adopted in the NHL

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:49.450
combine, the NFL combine.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:52.820
We're being used in MLB.

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:55.790
Most of the special
operations and special forces

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:58.820
use what we do.

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:01.190
We're not really
used in grade school.

00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:03.010
We're not really
used in high school.

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:04.440
Some colleges do.

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:05.700
Some colleges don't.

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.100
We started at the top,
not because we wanted to.

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.960
We know stuff will trickle down.

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:12.890
Early adopters will do it first.

00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:15.710
But it was not made
for special populations

00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:19.160
because we can use an eye chart
throughout your entire life

00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:19.930
span.

00:58:19.930 --> 00:58:21.390
So I can compare
an eight-year-old

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:22.139
to an 80-year-old.

00:58:22.139 --> 00:58:25.250
Or I compare an eight-year-old
you to an 80-year-old you.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.750
We keep switching
up movement screens

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:29.330
every time you get older.

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:32.540
It's OK if you flunk a few
more tests because-- it's OK

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:34.520
if you flunk a few more lines.

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.630
But if I don't use the
same movement standard

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:39.010
across your lifespan,
I can't tell you

00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:41.427
which way your life
should be going if you ask

00:58:41.427 --> 00:58:42.635
me a question about movement.

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.347
I'll know I've done my
job when this message goes

00:58:49.347 --> 00:58:51.680
all the way around the world
and comes back to Virginia.

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.480
And the cool thing was it did.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:56.180
Right before I came
out here, a girl

00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:58.620
who'd been dealing with
knee pain for two years.

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.620
Her coach had said,
go to the clinic.

00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:02.004
Your movement screen sucks.

00:59:02.004 --> 00:59:04.170
She was scared she's going
get pulled out of sports.

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:07.836
Two visits, she had two years
of knee pain for no reason.

00:59:07.836 --> 00:59:08.960
She just wrote that letter.

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:13.810
And it's what people think
they have to do to move.

00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:14.310
All right?

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:16.300
When animals hurt,
they don't move.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:18.390
When babies hurt,
they don't move.

00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:20.270
When we hurt, we still
move because we think

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:21.530
that's all we're left with.

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:23.470
And we know it's
good for us to move.

00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:25.720
If every time you ate broccoli,
you threw up, I'd say,

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.161
quit eating broccoli
for a while.

00:59:27.161 --> 00:59:29.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.480
If you want to see authentic
movement, just ask a pro.

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.170
And the pro is not
in the black shirt.

00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:39.270
OK?

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:40.920
Here's what I want to do.

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.930
If we got time, I think as
people were coming in the door,

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:46.540
we asked a simple
question-- can you

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:49.160
touch your toes-- because we
often find a lot of people

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.060
get stuck in that
movement pattern.

00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:52.360
So I think we asked you.

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.319
Do we have some people in here
who can't touch your toes.

00:59:55.319 --> 00:59:56.680
All right.

00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.522
Is there a medical
reason you can't?

00:59:59.522 --> 01:00:01.730
So you don't have steel rods
in your back or anything

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:02.310
like that.

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.240
Good, if you would be
willing to volunteer,

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.120
I would love to see if we can
reprogram that really quick.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.980
You want to do that?

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.750
I promise it won't
take too long.

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:14.770
If it does, maybe I need
to do my job better.

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:15.490
Who we got?

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:23.850
Now, we're going to try to
be as scientific as possible.

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.640
So how many people we have?

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.430
We have two?

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:30.060
OK, I'm going to get both
you guys to stand right here.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.540
And face your accusers.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:36.410
Feet together, touching
both at the heel and toe.

01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:38.157
And just show us your toe touch.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.190
That's not bad.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:43.340
All right?

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.122
And what I want you to do
is step back over here.

01:00:46.122 --> 01:00:47.830
So you didn't make it
quite to your toes.

01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:49.670
And I want each of you
using one of these planks.

01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:50.878
You can go on down that side.

01:00:50.878 --> 01:00:53.590
And all I want is your toes
are up and your heels are down,

01:00:53.590 --> 01:00:55.230
but everything is
still together.

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:56.140
OK?

01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.622
Now, they've got to be touching.

01:00:57.622 --> 01:00:58.830
And you can step on this one.

01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:01.920
That way it's-- now, I'm going
to ask you to do something

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.410
that's going to feel
extremely awkward.

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:07.600
I'm going to ask you to
take your knees apart

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.050
without taking your feet apart.

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:10.550
The only way you're
going to be able

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:11.880
do that is to bend and do that.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.590
And I'm going to basically
slide this between your knees.

01:01:13.590 --> 01:01:15.505
So just bend your
knees as best you can.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.899
And put that right between.

01:01:16.899 --> 01:01:17.690
I'll let you do it.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:18.820
Put it right between.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.500
Yeah, good.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.420
Little more space.

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.395
Go ahead and bend them.

01:01:24.395 --> 01:01:25.820
Balance, I got you.

01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.440
Good.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.250
Now, here's what
we're going to do.

01:01:29.250 --> 01:01:33.194
I want you to stand up straight
and just work out your balance.

01:01:33.194 --> 01:01:34.110
And this may help you.

01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:35.484
Squeeze the towel
I just gave you

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:38.080
and see if it helps you stand
up straight a little better.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.410
Now, put your hands
over your head.

01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:42.404
And just breathe for a minute.

01:01:42.404 --> 01:01:44.070
And while your hands
are over your head,

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:45.550
I want you to do this.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.850
When you bend down
and touch your toes,

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:50.000
I want you to go
as far as you can.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.699
And when you hit that first bit
of tension, crush the towel.

01:01:53.699 --> 01:01:55.990
When the towel allows you to
move a little bit further,

01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:58.790
you still won't make
it to the floor.

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:00.950
At that point, cheat
and bend your knees.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:02.740
But every time, I
want you to make

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:04.590
it all the way to the
board or the floor.

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:06.024
So go ahead and do one.

01:02:06.024 --> 01:02:07.940
On your way down, you're
going to get tension.

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.030
Squeeze the towel, squeeze
the towel, squeeze the towel.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:10.490
Now cheat.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:12.050
Bend your knees and make it
all the way to your toes.

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:12.870
Bend your knees.

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:14.690
You don't have to hold
your knees straight.

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:17.240
Good, come back up.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.760
Don't forget to breathe.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.480
Look up when you go all the way
up, and really try to balance.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.830
And do it again.

01:02:22.830 --> 01:02:26.440
Squeeze first, bend your knees
second, make it to your toes

01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.770
every time.

01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:30.530
It's real good to let
that air out going down,

01:02:30.530 --> 01:02:33.550
bring it back in coming up.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.480
Work your balance
out the whole time.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.020
Good, keep going.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:44.450
Good, we're going to do
about three or four more

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:46.079
at your own pace.

01:02:46.079 --> 01:02:47.370
But I want you to do one thing.

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:49.260
You're touching your toes
way better than you're

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:50.150
standing up straight.

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:53.187
So at the very top, if you
know your butt's sticking out

01:02:53.187 --> 01:02:55.270
a little bit and your
shoulders are still forward,

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:58.470
really try to get
as tall as you can.

01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:01.210
Don't lean backward, just
get the top of your head

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.790
as close to the
ceiling as possible.

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:03.960
Good.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:06.900
Two more, each of you.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:09.080
Don't forget that exhale.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.340
Good, cheat at the
bottom if you need to.

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.210
But quit cheating if
you don't need to.

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:18.000
Squeeze the towel first,
bend the knees second.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.010
This is your last rep.

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.290
And what I want you to
do before you get off

01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:26.150
that board is hold your towel
and step forward over the board

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:28.000
so your heels are up
and your toes are down.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.310
So you can grab your
towel do it doesn't fall.

01:03:31.310 --> 01:03:32.510
Step across the board.

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:33.720
And now, do the opposite.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:34.910
Heels are up.

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:36.860
Toes are down.

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:38.530
Feet are together.

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:40.560
Roll up the towel a
little bit thicker.

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.410
Put it between your
knees, and repeat.

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:48.540
Just like the shampoo
bottle says, just repeat.

01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:49.454
There you go.

01:03:49.454 --> 01:03:50.370
They're self-starters.

01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:52.010
Ah, make it all the
way to the ground,

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.439
even if you have to
bend those knees like it

01:03:54.439 --> 01:03:55.230
looks like a squat.

01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:56.430
There you go.

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:58.100
Straighten up at the top.

01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.340
Cycle those breaths.

01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.510
Get your breath in sync
with your movement.

01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:06.630
How come martial arts
and yoga and Indian clubs

01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:07.944
are all about 4,000 years old?

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:09.860
And they never disconnect
movement and breath?

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.400
And we've got to remember
to breathe when we move.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.580
Breathing was never
disconnected from movement.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.299
Breathing is what makes
yoga work really great.

01:04:18.299 --> 01:04:20.590
If you find out, your hardest
movement patterns in yoga

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.630
are also the ones where
you're not breathing.

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:23.790
Breathe first.

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:25.580
Then let the movement unfold.

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.110
So you're inhaling up.

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:30.201
Exhale on the way down.

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:30.700
Good.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:34.025
Get those toes every time, even
if you got to bend your knees.

01:04:34.025 --> 01:04:34.980
I like it.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.250
Good.

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:37.060
You keep going, OK?

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:38.560
I'm going to pull
him off the board.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.020
You keep going.

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:39.280
Come on.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.080
Step off of here.

01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:40.910
All right?

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:42.520
Now, just drop your arms.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.190
Don't think about anything.

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:45.080
Touch your toes.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:45.590
Just do it.

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.750
Touch your toes.

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:48.570
Good.

01:04:48.570 --> 01:04:49.810
OK?

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:50.960
Let me see your towel.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.460
I got it.

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.967
Step on off of there.

01:04:52.967 --> 01:04:54.300
Now, don't think about anything.

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.175
Just touch your toes.

01:04:55.175 --> 01:04:55.930
Just do it.

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:58.140
There you go.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:01.840
Now, all I did was broke a
pattern to make a pattern.

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.600
Do I have anybody who
can touch your toes?

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.641
You can touch your toes?

01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:06.140
Prove it.

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.010
I don't believe you.

01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:09.267
I think everybody's dishonest
until proven otherwise.

01:05:09.267 --> 01:05:09.850
There you are.

01:05:09.850 --> 01:05:10.870
OK, you're not lying.

01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.911
Now, I'm going to get you
to do one thing for me.

01:05:12.911 --> 01:05:13.920
Come right over here.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.147
Put your heels and buttocks
up against the wall.

01:05:18.147 --> 01:05:20.480
Keep your feet together, just
like they did, but attempt

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.810
that toe touch one more time.

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:24.710
Right.

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:26.110
And that's exactly
what they felt

01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:29.870
like because we've seen people
up here that are here, here.

01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:30.770
Watch this.

01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:33.260
If I take all of
this body weight

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:38.390
and put it forward without
putting that backward,

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:40.560
then I actually turn
on my hamstrings

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.606
to keep me from
breaking my nose.

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:44.480
And that's why you didn't
go all the way down

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.420
because you would fall forward.

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.350
What I did is made
you face uphill,

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:50.840
make you face down hill.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:55.210
I was scrambling the vestibular
information, the inner ear

01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:57.870
information with your
proprioceptive information

01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:59.710
with your breathing
and everything.

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:02.050
And the toe touch had
been a repeated pattern

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:03.160
that wasn't complete.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.993
And that's why you
couldn't touch your toes.

01:06:04.993 --> 01:06:07.300
And so all we did
is made you balance

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:08.620
while you were stretching.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:11.222
Because most people stretch
and then do exercise.

01:06:11.222 --> 01:06:12.930
And it was really hard
for you to balance

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:15.096
when we were first going
off because you were really

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:16.100
stuck to the ground.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.560
But Earth changes.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.590
Feet have to change.

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:22.290
So what I did is threw you
into a much more adaptable

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:24.410
environment down there
and forced you to do it.

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:25.730
You're breathing.

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.930
And you're also touching
your toes every time,

01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:30.950
whereas before, every time
you tried, you failed.

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:32.940
I had to touching
your toes every time.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.230
And we were just taking
away your training wheels.

01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:38.340
The first squeeze told
you to engage the front.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.370
But when you engage the
front, what happens?

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:42.470
You automatically
short circuit the back.

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:44.890
So the tight hamstrings, the
glutes, and the low back,

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:47.260
they shut down when
you fire the front.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.850
It's the way the
body stays efficient.

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:51.270
When I'm doing a bicep
curl, my triceps turn off.

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:52.830
Why waste energy?

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:57.060
So we had the first cue that
pinged the front, shut down

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:57.830
the back.

01:06:57.830 --> 01:06:59.444
The second cue says, go ahead.

01:06:59.444 --> 01:07:01.360
It's more important to
touch your toes than it

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.740
is to lock your knees back.

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:05.260
But each one of you bent
your knees less every time.

01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.827
Now, if you want to
maintain that toe touch,

01:07:07.827 --> 01:07:10.285
do that one drill before you
leave the house in the morning

01:07:10.285 --> 01:07:11.920
and before you go
to bed at night.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.590
And that's it.

01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:14.340
And after about a
week, you're probably

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:15.580
going to adopt that pattern.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.050
And you'll probably start
moving and dressing and putting

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:19.630
on your shoes in a
slightly different way.

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:21.921
And you may not lose it even
if you don't do the drill.

01:07:21.921 --> 01:07:24.180
But do it consistently
twice a day.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.084
It doesn't take nearly
as long as I took it.

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:27.250
I was just running my mouth.

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:28.900
You could have done
it in three reps.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.090
But that's the whole point.

01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:31.290
We sync your breath.

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:32.850
We make you be adaptable.

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:34.920
And we break a fixed pattern.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.230
And you've already touched
your toes, and so have you.

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:39.460
And all I had to do was get
the old pattern out of the way

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:39.959
first.

01:07:39.959 --> 01:07:42.092
So I like to do that trick.

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:44.050
And you guys were well
on your way to doing it.

01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:45.850
You could have probably got
there without me because you

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:46.920
made an improvement.

01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.490
But we've seen improvements
go way further.

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:52.445
So we wouldn't try to write
a new movement pattern

01:07:52.445 --> 01:07:54.570
or change your movement
life without first breaking

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:55.930
some of the old patterns.

01:07:55.930 --> 01:07:59.510
So that's a guy with
dyslexia programming brains.

01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:00.560
That's all I got.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:01.369
Thank you.

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:04.243
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.820
AUDIENCE: So I work with a lot
of people with herniated disk.

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:18.060
And I can I use FNS to
do that same movement?

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.880
GRAY COOK: If they have a
herniated disk in their past,

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.660
but it's not
currently exacerbated.

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:28.300
Because any time the movement
strain produces pain,

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.630
we actually say we've
got enough information.

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:33.550
So we go into a lighter
load movement screen.

01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:35.680
And I can see how that
disk is interacting.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.990
So the minute a
movement causes pain,

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:40.260
we immediately
switch the filter.

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:42.670
And we come over
here and do what

01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:44.710
I call a lighter
duty movement screen

01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:47.535
to see which movement
patterns are painful

01:08:47.535 --> 01:08:48.910
and which ones
are dysfunctional.

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:52.580
Let me tell you a story about
the way low back architecture.

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.970
So whether it's arthritis
or herniated disk,

01:08:54.970 --> 01:08:56.480
we often see this.

01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:57.770
Ah, that hurts my back!

01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:59.560
Or ah, that hurts my back.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:00.851
And then I'll say, well, turn.

01:09:00.851 --> 01:09:02.350
Yeah, that's a
little uncomfortable.

01:09:02.350 --> 01:09:03.600
That's a little uncomfortable.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.081
Stand on your left foot.

01:09:06.081 --> 01:09:06.580
Oh, good.

01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.092
Stand on your right foot.

01:09:09.092 --> 01:09:10.800
Does it hurt to stand
on your right foot?

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.979
No.

01:09:11.979 --> 01:09:15.920
Now, every movement pattern you
saw before-- forward, backward,

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.872
rotation, rotation--
was painful.

01:09:18.872 --> 01:09:20.840
Right?

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:22.176
But which one was dysfunctional.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.700
We don't attack it.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.000
We never work on your
dysfunctional patterns.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.370
We become so absorbed-- I
guess because of our empathy

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:33.550
or whatever, we
become so absorbed

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:35.920
in your painful
patterns that we forget,

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.410
you've got a lot of other
patterns that are broken,

01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:40.800
probably contributing
to the problem.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.066
But which patterns hurt?

01:09:42.066 --> 01:09:43.649
Because that's what
you want me to do.

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:46.390
You want me to make the
ones that hurt go away.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:49.279
But if I do a democratic
representation

01:09:49.279 --> 01:09:53.350
of your medical movement,
we get four categories.

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:55.620
Is that normal?

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.120
Touching your toes is normal.

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:00.290
But what if I can touch
my toes, but it hurts?

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:04.790
I'm actually
functional, yet painful.

01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:05.860
All right?

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:09.540
What if I can't
make it to my toes?

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:13.280
If it's painful, I'm
dysfunctional and painful.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.450
And that's the big
problem in health care.

01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:17.120
Am I moving poorly
because I'm in pain?

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.870
Or am I in pain because
I'm moving poorly?

01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:19.994
Can't answer that question.

01:10:19.994 --> 01:10:22.750
So what we do is we would
run you through six or seven

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:26.610
different movement patterns,
see which ones provoke symptoms,

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:29.000
and which ones don't, but
yet, are still dysfunctional.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:32.730
And believe it or not, we
have much greater ability

01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:34.800
to change your
movement architecture

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.550
by removing your
dysfunction because I

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:39.140
can't make your back worse
working on your balance.

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.840
I can make your back
worse by forcing patterns

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.180
that don't want to go yet.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.960
So very many times, when we
go for a medical movement

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.615
screen, which is a little bit
different than the functional

01:10:48.615 --> 01:10:50.820
movement screen, people
think, oh, I just got a bang

01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:51.867
through these patterns.

01:10:51.867 --> 01:10:53.450
Well, that's how you
got the herniated

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:55.930
disk in the first place,
going into a pattern where

01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:57.230
you didn't have integrity.

01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:59.250
And that whole pain was
just a signal saying,

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:01.880
disharmony, disharmony,
don't go any further.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.150
So if you've got
pain, we can easily

01:11:04.150 --> 01:11:06.780
map out the pain behavior
and dysfunctional behavior

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.940
and have you on your
corrective exercise right away.

01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:13.460
The movement screen is, if you
just can't do the patterns,

01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:16.380
but it's not by pain.

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:19.320
So if the disk is causing pain,
different movement screen.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:22.920
If it's in your history, but
it's no longer causing pain,

01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.940
then we can probably
see what's left

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:27.170
and what needs to be done
just by doing with that.

01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:29.520
But the minute one of
those patterns causes pain,

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.800
we do a different
test and sample it

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.550
a different way because
your category just

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:35.174
changed from a movement
fitness problem

01:11:35.174 --> 01:11:36.590
to movement health problem.

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:38.113
Is that helpful?

01:11:38.113 --> 01:11:38.900
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.710
GRAY COOK: The other
thing about disk--

01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:42.960
is it neurologically
involved, meaning a disk

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.390
that we see on MRI is
not a problem if we

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:48.990
don't see the nerve
problem associated with it.

01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:51.170
If you've just got a
little bulge somewhere

01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:54.140
but I can't tell it
from any other test,

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.070
we keep an eye on it.

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:57.952
But there's a good chance
that-- I don't know.

01:11:57.952 --> 01:11:59.660
You get a little on
the other side of 30,

01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:01.170
the disk actually
dries up anyway.

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:04.200
So not many people are
herniated disk after 35 anyway.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.190
They're getting
arthritis after 35.

01:12:06.190 --> 01:12:09.320
The disk herniation window
is between about 25 and 35,

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.340
when the disk is
still very hydrated.

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:16.810
AUDIENCE: So do you think
that movement issues or muscle

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:20.330
issues are primarily caused
by activities that we

01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:26.640
do, like sports, or more by
posture and gentle activities

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.990
that we do for longer
periods of time every day?

01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:33.120
GRAY COOK: I definitely
think our lifestyle

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.830
and our movement habits
are an equal contributor.

01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:41.750
I think the reason that the
sports and the activities

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:43.830
compound things is
not only because we

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:48.810
go from pretty much a sedentary
life to a all-out weekend

01:12:48.810 --> 01:12:50.110
warrior mentality.

01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:55.670
But the message that we're
getting in fitness right now

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:57.490
is just push through it.

01:12:57.490 --> 01:12:58.850
Work through it.

01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:02.540
And I think in our culture,
for about the past 30 years,

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:04.900
we confused
discomfort with pain.

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:06.080
We hear no pain, no gain.

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:06.730
Right?

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:08.640
If it hurts in your
muscles, push on through.

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.730
If it hurts in your
joints, you're probably

01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:12.020
going to blow something out.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.930
And so that's a first
perspective difference.

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:16.670
But working out, being
physically active,

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:18.540
having a very robust
and active lifestyle,

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.770
means you're a little bit
uncomfortable sometimes.

01:13:20.770 --> 01:13:22.082
The chair is not quite as soft.

01:13:22.082 --> 01:13:23.540
You're sitting on
a stability ball.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.970
But it's funny how we go
completely from comfort

01:13:25.970 --> 01:13:27.010
to pain.

01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:31.370
And yet, our ancestors, and even
babies, use discomfort to say,

01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:33.792
oh, maybe I should adopt
a different behavior.

01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:35.250
So what's the first
thing to happen

01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:38.890
when we see the whole minimalist
running thing come around?

01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:39.390
All right?

01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:41.830
I'm running 10Ks in
shoes that thick.

01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:43.560
Hey, barefoot running's cool!

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.160
Take off your shoes-- shin
splints, plantar fasciitis.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.820
And I just cut my
toe off on a rock.

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.030
Right?

01:13:51.030 --> 01:13:52.180
That's not the point.

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:55.820
These are people who actually
followed a fitness fad

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:59.160
and didn't grow their
self into that situation.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.120
So I think a lot of the things
we do in fitness, there's

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.326
no filter to keep us out.

01:14:05.326 --> 01:14:07.450
I mean, if you want to show
up to a kettlebell boot

01:14:07.450 --> 01:14:10.620
camp on the beach
Sunday morning, you can.

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:13.310
And I'll show you all
the weird, wacky stuff

01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:17.030
we do with kettlebells,
not vetting your movement,

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:19.200
not vetting your
metabolic capacity,

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.710
not vetting your shoulders,
not vetting your grip strength,

01:14:21.710 --> 01:14:24.150
not even asking you if you
wake up with a stiff neck

01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:25.170
every now and then.

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:30.240
So I think the access to fitness
has become so competitive

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.615
that we'll say anything to
get your ass in the door

01:14:32.615 --> 01:14:33.990
and get you to
pay us some money.

01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:39.370
And we'll promise you anything
without proactively screening

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:41.980
and assigning you the
dosage of fitness you need.

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:46.510
And so I tell people, let's do
the minimum checklist first.

01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:49.270
Are you covering six to
seven hours of sleep?

01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:50.850
Are you covering your nutrition?

01:14:50.850 --> 01:14:52.450
Are you covering your protein?

01:14:52.450 --> 01:14:54.660
Are you covering your hydration?

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:56.127
Are you waking up with pain?

01:14:56.127 --> 01:14:57.460
Are you dealing with discomfort?

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.180
And then, what are the
activities you're doing?

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:05.520
And are you really
exercising in a robust way

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.980
with your movements?

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.930
Or are you just
doing the one thing?

01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:12.540
I just wrote a article
called "Movement Food."

01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:14.500
We're all on this
whole food kick,

01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:17.280
meaning if you
eat correctly, you

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.100
should be able to minimize your
supplementation unless you've

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:22.080
got an absorption problem.

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.660
Well, if you're having fun in
your life and you're out there

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:29.470
and you're active and you're
always doing something,

01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:31.930
but you don't have a
formal exercise program,

01:15:31.930 --> 01:15:34.190
there's a lot to be said
that I may see less movement

01:15:34.190 --> 01:15:38.420
problems in you than somebody
who is dogmatically pursuing

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:41.440
this regimented fitness
goal without even matching

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.470
their self to the program.

01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:45.790
So they're both problems.

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:49.880
And I can tell you which
one it is with the testing,

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:53.310
meaning if you're asking me,
is it organism or environment,

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:57.360
I can easily tell you if you're
broken as far as your receiving

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.170
signals and behaving correctly.

01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:01.897
I can tell that in about
30 minutes of testing,

01:16:01.897 --> 01:16:02.980
maybe even less than that.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:05.300
Or are you just doing
things in your environment

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:07.300
that aren't pointing you
in the right direction?

01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.810
They're just consistently
breaking you down.

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:09.622
You think it's you.

01:16:09.622 --> 01:16:10.030
It's not.

01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:11.571
You stuck yourself
in an environment,

01:16:11.571 --> 01:16:12.880
you don't need to be in.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.130
AUDIENCE: What can we
do to be our own coaches

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:19.240
and detect broken
patterns we may have?

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.850
GRAY COOK: I think
it was in 2003,

01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:23.160
I published a book called
"Athletic Body in Balance."

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.560
And actually, it's the other
book that you mentioned.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:29.360
I wrote it for you, meaning if
you don't want to see anybody,

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:32.080
and if you want to work
through this on your own,

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.290
there's a way you can
movements screen yourself.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.480
There's a way you
can confront that.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.070
And there probably
is about a 50% to 60%

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:43.230
play you can resolve
that on your own.

01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:47.500
My buddy, Kelly Starrett, has
an amazing website, MobilityWOD,

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:49.390
self-corrective tools.

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:50.449
Peter Egoscue has.

01:16:50.449 --> 01:16:52.240
There's a lot of
self-correction out there.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.660
The big problem
is are you trying

01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.200
to fix something that's
painful or dysfunctional?

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.890
Because if it's painful,
there's something

01:17:01.890 --> 01:17:03.150
that happens with pain.

01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:05.520
Pain is almost like trying
to program a computer

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:06.492
with a virus on board.

01:17:06.492 --> 01:17:08.450
You're better off just
not even to mess with it

01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:10.200
because you're going
to make things worse.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.570
And what we've studied,
we've actually created pain

01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:13.570
where there wasn't pain.

01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:16.284
We can inject saline in
little joints in your back

01:17:16.284 --> 01:17:17.200
and have you do stuff.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.730
And what we found out is if
you're in pain, when you move,

01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:25.920
your responses to movement are
inconsistent and unpredictable.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.570
That's not a good
learning platform.

01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:31.400
So if you're trying to
fix a painful problem,

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.040
it's going to be much
more difficult for you

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.330
than if you're just trying
to fix a movement problem.

01:17:36.330 --> 01:17:39.420
So if you've got a stiff lower
back and it just gets tight,

01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.350
but you don't have
a pain issue, then

01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:43.900
it's going to be much easier
to fix that on your own.

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.940
If you're in a pain
issue, it's going

01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:48.310
to be hard for you to learn
how to do anything different

01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:50.500
because that pain
signal interrupts

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.480
anything that could be positive
or good feedback learning.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.870
So if it's pain-driven,
I'm not saying

01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:59.310
you can't do it on your own.

01:17:59.310 --> 01:18:01.790
But it's probably a
habit or a pattern that's

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:04.890
been there so long, we need to
put you through some filters

01:18:04.890 --> 01:18:05.650
to catch it.

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:08.110
If it's just a
movement issue, you

01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:10.530
should easily be able to
work through it on your own.

01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:12.720
The only problem is,
you've got to be patient.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.300
All right?

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.356
So the number one
thing people want

01:18:15.356 --> 01:18:16.730
to do in their
fitness program is

01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:20.020
they feel so guilty for
being in a sedentary society

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.649
that you just feel like an
extra 30 minutes of sweat

01:18:22.649 --> 01:18:25.190
is going to somehow undo sitting
on your ass most of the day.

01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:26.040
And it won't.

01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:28.760
So it's better to
exercise intelligently.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.150
And it's amazing where,
when people just get so

01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:35.290
beat up that they just do
some tai chi for a month,

01:18:35.290 --> 01:18:36.730
or yoga on the
beach for a month,

01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:37.980
and they come back to it.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.480
And they're bigger,
faster, stronger

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.330
than they've ever been
simply because they

01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:43.000
rebalanced their self.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.620
But if it's a true pain issue
and you haven't had resolution

01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:52.390
with it, I would say the
best approach-- get tested

01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:55.010
or evaluated periodically
by a professional

01:18:55.010 --> 01:18:58.450
and fix it on your own because
a good professional can tell you

01:18:58.450 --> 01:19:01.100
what self-help to consume
and which one not to consume.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:05.219
So I don't need to
count your reps.

01:19:05.219 --> 01:19:07.260
But I do need to point
you in the right direction

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:08.926
if you're not getting
there on your own.

01:19:08.926 --> 01:19:10.860
So I think sometimes
training and coaching

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:13.680
is much better done
by periodic assessment

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.460
and letting you work it out on
your own with some good advice

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:20.269
than me standing over you
giving you words in your ear,

01:19:20.269 --> 01:19:22.310
thinking that's going to
reprogram your movement.

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:25.210
So I think it's sometimes better
to involve a professional once

01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:26.560
to get perspective.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.520
But then it's better for you,
and it's more sustainable,

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:32.420
if you can be a big part of
the solution on your own.

01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:33.420
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:34.295
GRAY COOK: All right.

01:19:34.295 --> 01:19:35.520
Thank you.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.570
