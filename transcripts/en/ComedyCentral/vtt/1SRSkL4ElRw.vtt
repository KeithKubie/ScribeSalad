00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.703
President-Elect Donald Trump

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.338
will be taking office
immediately

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.006
and then heading off
to vacation this weekend,

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.108
but he's already got his eye
on 2020.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:10.611
In an interview
with the <i>Washington Post,</i>

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:12.145
Trump said
he's looking forward

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.148
to trademark his next campaign
slogan, which is not gonna be,

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.317
<i>"Do svidaniya,</i>
American comrades."

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:18.852
-(laughter)
-It's...

00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:22.055
In 2020, he plans to run
with "Keep America Great,"

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.024
showing just how confident he is

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.393
that there will still be
an America

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:27.961
-in four years.
-Nah. -(laughter)

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:30.964
But people online
were quick to point out

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.599
that they'd heard that phrase
somewhere before.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.334
Oh, yes. "Keep America Great"

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:35.736
was the tagline
for the third installment

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.404
-of <i>The Purge: Election Year.</i>
-Oh, my God.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:41.542
(laughter, applause
and cheering)

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:45.879
But at least he has a consistent
vision for this country.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.782
-So comedians...
-(laughter and groaning)

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.085
...since that motto might need
to change, what's another

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:55.255
movie-inspired slogan
for Trump's 2020 campaign?

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.026
-Bryan. -You want the truth?
<i>I</i> can't handle the truth.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.861
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: All right. Very good.

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:01.895
-(applause)
-Points.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.630
Very good.

00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:05.699
Erin Gibson.

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.001
I'm just a girl
standing in front of a boy,

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.704
asking him to please not
get us into a war with China.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.140
-(laughter, applause, cheering)
-All right, points. Points.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.877
-Judah Friedlander.
-Uh,

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.712
Toto, we're not in Kansas.

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:18.812
Uh, we're in Canada.
