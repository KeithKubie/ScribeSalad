1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,173
Okay.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:02,781
Hey,

3
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:07,130
what's going on is bill burr is time for
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,990
December 25th,

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,580
2017 oh it's Christmas

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,530
and merry Christmas to you.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,560
Merry Christmas to you and
happy birthday to Jesus.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:29,890
A merry Christmas or
happy birthday to you.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,010
Ooh.

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,480
Oh the lovely Nia.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,690
My lovely daughter both wearing
Christmas pajamas is my first question.

12
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:43,560
What in God's name are you doing?
Listening to a podcast on Christmas.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,690
My wife is already mad enough
at me for doing one. Hey,

14
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:51,480
gorgeous. How are you doing? This
is how I woke up in the morning.

15
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:55,620
I was laying in bed and I felt high.
I felt these little hands,

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,670
it's a little hand squeezing my fingers.
So I thought she was just sleeping,

17
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:02,550
just sorta like squeezing
my hand or whatever.

18
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,330
So I took the pillow off my giant head
and I looked over and she was sitting up

19
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:11,130
and I looked at her and she just
waved at me. I love the way she waves.

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,110
We were joking. My daughter waves
at you from like six inches away.

21
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:19,050
She waves like she's on a
luxury liner like cruise boat.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,500
And you'll hear a hundred
yards away in the dark.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,010
It's this giant wave like,
hey man,

24
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,410
I'm right here.
You got blueberry all over your face.

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,320
Um, anyways, merry
Christmas to everybody. Uh,

26
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,310
you know, I was going to tease everybody,
but what are you doing? You know,

27
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:44,610
it's funny, this is a tough time
of year to be alone, GI bill.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,830
You really went in deep into your brain
to figure that one out, not only alone.

29
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,130
Then they got all these,
damn,

30
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,330
they got all these damn songs that just
make you feel worse about yourself.

31
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,010
You know, if your life stinks and
you're sitting there going, Oh God,

32
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:02,370
what have I dealt with my life? I
pushed everybody away. I'm all alone.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,370
And as you're thinking that,
oh,

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,550
you hear in the background as you walk
in through the liquor stores, just,

35
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,900
it's the most wonderful time of the year.

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,620
They got to update that, right?
Unless you're divorced Ed,

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,530
you can't see your kids because
your wife is a cod ex wife. Sorry.

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,880
It's a boast.
Wonderful full time.

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,380
Um, I do actually, you know, I am
envious. This is when, you know,

40
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:37,220
if you don't even care that you're
alone today, you are a true loner.

41
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,540
You are a first ballot hall
of fame or what do all the,
all the cliches, you know,

42
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,270
Mount Rushmore.
I met one time,

43
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,960
I f I spent a Thanksgiving alone and uh,

44
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,930
this is how, this is how deep and dark
my life was. I thought it was hilarious.

45
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,520
I was mad. I wasn't sad for any moment
during the day. Thought it was hilarious.

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,990
I didn't have any Turkey, any, any
of the fixings, any of that stuff.

47
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,690
And I actually,
uh,

48
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,730
I called up this other comic,
I think it was Ryan Dalton,

49
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,260
one of my friends from Cleveland

50
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,050
and I believe he just came over to my
drab New York apartment and we just sat

51
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:21,070
there getting shit faced.

52
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,760
You know, I just, I was
in a point in my life,

53
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:34,500
I was just so excited that I wasn't in
a relationship. So there was no like,

54
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,750
cause at that point I didn't
even know how to be in one.

55
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,350
So the fact that I wasn't in one
and he obviously wasn't either.

56
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:44,680
We both would have had somewhere to go.
I just remembered,

57
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,950
I think that's why I was so happy because
so many years I was in a relationship

58
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,850
that I just, I dunno, I just
wasn't ready to be in one.

59
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:56,410
And then I was sitting there going,
Oh God,

60
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,460
I'm meeting their family
and let them Idela.

61
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,660
I gotta get out of the thing rather than
just relaxing and enjoying the moment.

62
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:08,620
So I was actually in my comfort
zone being all alone. Aw.

63
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,040
What happened? Bill? I'll
put, gives a shit. Um,

64
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,150
so Billy Beantown is
back in Boston and um,

65
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,520
you haven't seen any beans up here,
by the way.

66
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,280
So funny how that nickname just stuck.

67
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,510
I guess at some point they used to
fucking make bake beans, you know,

68
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,750
kind of how they used to go wailing
and, you know, I don't know what else.

69
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,110
Uh,
I don't know what else,

70
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:36,640
what else should you make buckles for hats
for the pilgrims, but for some reason,

71
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,070
uh, making beans has stuck here.
Now. I don't know if you've,

72
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,310
if you've never been to Boston,
I just, I don't, spoiler alert.

73
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,720
You're not gonna find a lot of beans here.
All right.

74
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:50,890
I went to the big apple. New York City.
Never saw really any more apples there.

75
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:55,630
Why did they call it the, this a different
reason for that isn't there? New York,

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,820
why do they call it that,
right? It is right there.

77
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,140
Yeah.

78
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,240
Why do they call it the big apple?

79
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,370
All these fucking chicks with the
big assets down there. Apple bottoms.

80
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:12,204
Is that what it is?

81
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:17,420
My big apple is a nickname for New York
City was first popularized in the 1920s

82
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:21,230
by Jay Fitzgerald.
What?

83
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,000
John Jay Fitzgerald. Okay. A sports
writer for New York when it's popular.

84
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,340
Since what the fuck? Why? Why
is it called the Big Apple?

85
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,760
I don't give a fuck
about John Jay Fitzgerald

86
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,390
origin of the name. Oh, somebody's
calling me. I'm not answering that.

87
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,170
Okay. Although the history of the
big apple was once thought a mystery,

88
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,790
a clearer picture of the term history
has emerged due to the work of amateur

89
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,560
etymologist Barry puppet.

90
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,200
Yeah.

91
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,460
And Gerald Cohen, who gives a fuck
about them? A number of false theories.

92
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,240
I don't care about
those. Oh, include, okay,

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,320
well actually I like this one.

94
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,980
Yeah.

95
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,860
A theory,
uh,

96
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,840
previously existed including a claim
that the term derived from a woman named

97
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,670
Eve who ran a brothel in the city.

98
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,180
This was subsequently exposed as a hoax.

99
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,210
I love how they figure out that it's
a hoax. How do you figure that out?

100
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,500
Like where would you start?
You know,

101
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,530
especially as they've been calling it
that or that was the lie for all these

102
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:25,060
years.
How do you go back and fact check it?

103
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,640
New evidence suggests the earliest
known usage of the big apple in a book.

104
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,780
In the book though the
wayfarer in New York,

105
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,460
I mean know to wayfarers sounds like
a fat person that eats crackers.

106
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,820
Well, it's wafers. Those
are cookies. What is,

107
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,730
it is a literally a
whole fucking page here

108
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,870
in which added another Dah,
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

109
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,460
William safely considered in this coinage.
But where is the answer?

110
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:08,640
Kansas is apt to see in New York City,

111
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:09,690
a greedy city.

112
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,020
It's inclined to think that the big apple
gets a disproportionate share of the

113
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:19,950
national SAP. Oh, so
that line from the book,

114
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,950
Kansas is apt to see in
New York City and in,

115
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:28,550
in New York are greedy city.

116
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,910
Is it inclines to think that the big
apple gets a disproportionate share of the

117
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,190
National Sapp? I, I, you know,

118
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:41,971
I,
you know,

119
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,820
I don't feel like I'm any closer to
understanding why it's called that.

120
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,510
What the fuck does that mean?
So the way that's worded,

121
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:52,770
it seems like they were already
calling it the big apple or you know,

122
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,740
cause if you read like Tom Sawyer and
everything that like, hey, you know,

123
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,770
if you're, if you're whitewashed
my fence, I'll give you an apple.

124
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:03,390
And they're like, boy, oh boy. You know,
cause they didn't have any snickers bars.

125
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:08,430
So an apple was like a tree.
It was a treat back then.

126
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,570
So maybe that was their big dessert.
I get the fuck out of people making pies.

127
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,730
That's all women did back then.
They weren't allowed to vote. Right.

128
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,470
They know if they just
sat around making pies

129
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,800
bitching that they weren't out in the
fields behind a fucking team. Oxen,

130
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,510
why do you get to go out there
and smell that auction? Hey Lady,

131
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:38,670
you want to do this?
It's all yours

132
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,940
fucking sitting here and kneading dough.

133
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:44,400
I'd rather do that to be outside
in the elements, but you know,

134
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:48,300
if that's what you want to
do, by all means. All right.

135
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,700
Speaking of apples, you
guys, friend, you guys, uh,

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,620
are you guys fans I should say
of the, uh, the band primus?

137
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,570
Well, their drummer, uh, Tim Alexander
has a cider called Herb Sida.

138
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,370
If you'd like to get boozed up,
go to ww dot Herb's cider.com

139
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,420
and check that stuff out.
I actually had a little girl,

140
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,030
I can't actually have a glassy pool of it.
He sent me some,

141
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:20,060
but I can't have a glass.
He pull of it until I come off the wagon,

142
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,290
which is probably going to be
happen on the day of the Rose Bowl.

143
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,750
It's my 10th rose bowl in a row.
Me and Bart Nick are going to be there.

144
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:32,510
Maybe we'll have a little bit of
herb cider or whatever. Check it out.

145
00:09:32,511 --> 00:09:36,260
If you're into cider, if you'd like to
get hammered and also be like, yeah,

146
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:40,550
but dark. I'm also have an apples
herb site or is this thing for you?

147
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:44,370
I'm going to check out his
website here. Go to the page. Yes.

148
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:46,590
That's what I want to do.
Please. For the love of God,

149
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,940
for the love of God,
slowly opening,

150
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,600
I should have hotel internet.
I always pay for the extra amount.

151
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,180
Oh, it's got a great label.
I'll tell you right now,

152
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:01,710
if it's as good as that God damn label,

153
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,540
I'm going to be drinking
some of this stuff.

154
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,833
Yeah,

155
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,730
I love all these musicians now can like
branch out and actually have like other

156
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:12,740
businesses and stuff
before it's like they had,

157
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,740
they hit songs and then some greedy
bastard would steal from them and now they

158
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,970
got like clothing label,
clothing lines and all of this shit.

159
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,030
This guy's making cider,
you know?

160
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,790
Do you know the smothers
brothers have their own vineyard?

161
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,030
That was like unheard of back in the day.

162
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,410
Maybe John Elway would have a couple of
car dealerships have something like that.

163
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:37,490
But usually the performers, when we
were done performing, we were screwed.

164
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,670
You know, if we weren't out there
tap dance and we will fuck book.

165
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:41,600
Can I come up with,

166
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:49,090
what should I make bill burrs big book
of content in like all the different ways

167
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:53,200
to say it and I'll go around
the world, you know, find out.

168
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,390
I'll find out the origins of it.
Back to j f Scott Fitzgerald.

169
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,110
Yeah.

170
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,120
You know,
people in a Tupelo,

171
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:05,570
Mississippi think that the big
con gets more of its share.

172
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,310
Yeah.

173
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,970
Of Deceptive. I'm sorry. Um,

174
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,950
um, anyways, I don't
know what to talk about.

175
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,260
I didn't know why the
fuck I'm doing this today.

176
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,490
You shouldn't even be listened to.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

177
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,100
You much shit.
My wife's going to give me,

178
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,940
she was saying he doing the podcast today.
Well I do the podcast.

179
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:30,910
I go cause it's fucking hilarious.
Then I'm podcasting on Christmas morning.

180
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,670
Is there something funny about that?
Right. We already had Christmas breakfast.

181
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,390
We're going to go to my parents house for
Christmas dinner. I got a window here.

182
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,710
Snowing outside all the way.
The route side is frightful,

183
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,190
but your smile is so delightful.

184
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,640
That's really something that serial killer
would be singing right as you're tied

185
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,430
up in his cabin.
Oh,

186
00:11:52,431 --> 00:11:54,400
the weather outside is frightful,

187
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:57,190
but your smile is so the ledge
you sit in there all gag on it.

188
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,110
Sorry, I don't know what it
is about Christmas music,

189
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:04,570
but I always just think creepy shit.
There's something about it.

190
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,880
I think when I was growing up,

191
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:11,290
just watching it past a certain certain
age and you start to figure out adults a

192
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,810
little more and you just like, you
know what? Nobody's really that happy.

193
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,260
This is all bullshit. This
is all part of the lie, Huh?

194
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,260
Full Christopher. Cringle how
about those patriots? Huh?

195
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,770
How bout those patriots?
How about those buffalo bills?

196
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,310
That's one of the best teams
I've seen them have both games,

197
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,750
even though we kind of kicked her ass
the first time. But I mean, they're, uh,

198
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,380
when they're eight and
six when they came in,

199
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,840
they're looking at their ninth when
they might be 907 this year. You know,

200
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:44,260
when I say I say good for them,
good for them.

201
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,160
I don't know who the
hell if safety was it.

202
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,300
That quarterback who jumped that route
timed it perfectly and got a very rare

203
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:55,120
interception.
Pick six off a Tom Brady,

204
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,440
but you knew we were going to win.
Anytime Tom Brady throws a pick six weeks,

205
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,440
that's when he's, he gets pissed.
All you did was piss him off.

206
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:04,570
He's going to come back and
just blow the game wide open.

207
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,990
Nobody knows that better than people
down in Atlanta. Merry Christmas.

208
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,140
Atlanta Falcon fence.
I love you guys so much.

209
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:18,850
I brought up the biggest choke
in Superbowl history. Once
again, I apologize. Okay.

210
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:22,390
And Happy Hanukkah too. If you're
a Jewish fan, happy Kwanzaa.

211
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,300
If you're an African American fan and,
uh,

212
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,700
I don't know what the transgendered
people celebrate these days,

213
00:13:27,701 --> 00:13:29,020
but whatever that thing
is, I'm, I'm gonna,

214
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm gonna make sure I know what that is
so I don't cause a big dust up on social

215
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:38,470
media. Um, I'll watch the Bruins when,

216
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,790
and I went to the Celtics and
they want against the bulls.

217
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,900
We've got a great young team and a buddy
of mine has tickets right behind. Ah,

218
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,390
my Gorman and Tommy Heinsohn.

219
00:13:49,391 --> 00:13:53,920
So for one quarter I got
to sit down there and uh,

220
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,830
you know, heights, it's like six,
seven see sitting behind him,

221
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,150
he can barely see the damn game.

222
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,240
Lisa transition game when
they're bringing it up the court.

223
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,900
But I have to tell you, it was,
um, back in the day I always,

224
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,650
I kind of wanted to be a sports
broadcaster. So actually watching them,

225
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,200
they both had a guy on
either side. Like, you know,

226
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:13,300
when they sit there and be like,
he's got 16 points. It's like,

227
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:17,290
how the hell do they know that?
It's like as they were scoring points,

228
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,590
whoever's scores,
their whole line of stats,

229
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:24,580
the player would light up and the
points is all the way to the right.

230
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:26,590
I believed and I'm,

231
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:30,070
I was just kinda watching how
they were able to do that.

232
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,270
I mean just there's so much stuff you
got to know what's going on and then

233
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:36,670
understand like the
importance of what's going on.

234
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,750
Like when you watch a game at home,
you know what's going on,

235
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,530
you're into the flow of the game and then
you talking about the next day at work

236
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:47,950
and so much of that is because of
what the announcers are telling you.

237
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,390
This is a big play here.

238
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:52,190
They got to convert this third
down and then they don't owe.

239
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:52,940
That was devastating.

240
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,760
You got to work like,
no, it was a pretty poor.

241
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,780
The cable you do need you to convert
that Toronto, you don't even know.

242
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,010
I realize you just, you just saying
what the fuck they already said. What's,

243
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:05,260
when you go to the game by
yourself, you know, there's so much,

244
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,000
there's just so much crap going on.
Good Lord.

245
00:15:09,001 --> 00:15:13,200
Every time there's a stoppage of play.
They had this, this, this group of kids,

246
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:17,970
little funk. They always have these
kids dancing. Okay, that's fine.

247
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,910
I hate it. I hate killing kids
in show business that young.

248
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,280
It's like you should be up building a
goddamn snowman going out doing this whole

249
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,890
dance routine.
How long did you work on that?

250
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,740
Just picture some mean fucking teacher.

251
00:15:32,741 --> 00:15:37,560
We're not leaving till we get
it right from the top five, six,

252
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,950
seven, eight. Right. They have that.

253
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,260
They got fucking Santa Claus coming out,

254
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:49,261
break dance and it on his head and it
really kills like feeling like you're at

255
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:51,664
the game.

256
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,290
Like I was heckling the bull's coach
guy name was Fred something or other,

257
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,650
you know we were sitting down in loans
so he kept standing up and those damn

258
00:15:59,651 --> 00:16:04,080
coaches, they like block your
view. So I'm going on a Friday,

259
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,040
grabbed some fire,
drag some pine that Fredrik?

260
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,790
Yeah.

261
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,580
Hey Freddy. You know you could coach
sitting down. All right. What do,

262
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,020
what does hands on your hip beads?
No Defense

263
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,960
Fred just doing that shit and everybody
was like looking around, you know,

264
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:26,500
my father in law was getting
embarrassed. I'm like, Mike, dude,

265
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:29,650
this is what people used to do.
This is what you say.

266
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:32,290
This was let's say there
was also people laughing.

267
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,000
That's what used to happen when
there was a stoppage of play.

268
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,990
Fans would yell out what they thought
should have been going on. Yeah.

269
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,920
Know, hey day, once you let him
get to the fucking elbow again,

270
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,920
how many times you've got to hit that
shot on you. And everybody would laugh.

271
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,650
Now the second that damn thinks up,

272
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,900
are you ready?

273
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,330
Gay, Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay,
gay, gay and all these fucking
kids run out on the court.

274
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,960
It's like I'm trying to get drunk
and yell at people that I don't know.

275
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,950
Why are you bringing kids into this?
Um,

276
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,510
but I was stone sober.
Um, anyway, so we want,

277
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:17,510
but either way the game was great and um,

278
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,170
just seeing the Celtics live,
how young they are.

279
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,450
Even our bench is great.

280
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:25,770
Yeah.

281
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,520
I keep forgetting the name. What's
the name of our, our sort of center,

282
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:29,370
the big white guy.

283
00:17:29,371 --> 00:17:33,750
He looks like a yoga instructor
that moonlights as a lumberjack.

284
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,810
You know, he's got the man
bun going. See, you know,

285
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:40,710
we spiritually is progressive and then
he's got the giant beard so he can't tell.

286
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,980
Is this guy like a hipster?
Is He from the Pacific northwest?

287
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,900
And he in his grandfather used to get
on either end of an accident. Oh Wow.

288
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,170
Oh Wow. Ready to take a fucking tree down.
Whatever the hell they did out there.

289
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,100
Um,
what's his face?

290
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,190
Rosier had this much to fucking dunk
towards the end of the game. Explosive.

291
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:00,870
Something you never used
to see on the Celtics.

292
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,430
We used to be a bunch of slow white guys.

293
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,940
Even our black guys was slow just
hanging out with the white guys.

294
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,040
They didn't have to try,
try as hard in practice.

295
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,230
And then they sort of became like a,
you know, almost not black anymore.

296
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,140
They were like mixed.
They had a little bit too much white them.

297
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,980
Next thing you know, they had developed
an outside shot. This is all true.

298
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,010
This is why we had a tough time
keeping up with the showtime Lakers.

299
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,590
Too many whites. All right.
I'm just making up shit.

300
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:30,110
I don't have any reads this
week. You know, I dunno.

301
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,640
I guess when you, when you
piss off Sherry's berries,
then the dominoes just fall.

302
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,370
Now I think people just like
no one's going to be listening,

303
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,050
nor is anybody can be podcasting on
fucking Christmas. You know what?

304
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,440
Everybody thought that and here you
are listening. You know else knew it.

305
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,640
Tim Alexander from Primus,
so that's my only read it this week.

306
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:53,780
Why don't you sit down, ignore your family
and drink at nice jug of herb cider.

307
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,490
If you'd like to drink some,
go to

308
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,760
www.herbcider.comherbscider.com.
Um, all right,

309
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,490
my wife's going to kill me in a pod.
There's going to be a shorter podcast.

310
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,650
Unusual. All right, let's
give me an a bridge. First,

311
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,320
kids want to open their gifts here.
All right, let's get to the reeds here.

312
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,350
Comedy bubble.
Hey Billy.

313
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,530
Hey Billy burrata toes.
I liked that one.

314
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,040
I'm speaking of Berata and went to
the north end and I have lovely,

315
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:29,390
lovely Italian meal and a
little Berata and the appetizer.

316
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,710
That was unbelievable. Then I went down
to a cigar bar, the bunch of relatives,

317
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,550
we smoked a couple.
This is fucking asshole.

318
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,250
I always go to that cigar
bar in the north end.

319
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,010
Okay.

320
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:44,980
And I always forget the name of
it. It's an, it's an Italian name.

321
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,730
Fuck is the name of it's cigars
is the last thing. Let's see.

322
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,800
Cigar Bar North and Boston.

323
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,250
What does it stands at?
Delsa Gary.

324
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,310
Yeah.

325
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,260
Oh, DC Gari. Um,

326
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,660
where they were having a great frigging
time and for some reason they have this

327
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:13,340
bell,
they're like,

328
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:17,600
you'd ring between rounds and
this fucking jerk off Boston guy.

329
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,810
He's got this hammer and he keeps hitting
the bell and I'm watching this dude in

330
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:25,010
this bowl in short, coming over, you know,

331
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:30,440
with the Boston angry face with
his eyebrows up going, hey buddy,

332
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,210
knock it off. Stop ringing the bell.
Right. And the kid keeps ringing the bell.

333
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:37,220
I'm like, fuck, what the
fuck is with this kid?

334
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:40,070
And then I peeked over and I saw you had
like the earring in his ear. I'm like,

335
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,980
oh, that guy. Oh, that guy,

336
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,110
he's going to be that guy.

337
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:50,020
And the guy just would not stop ringing
the belt by appreciated the fact that

338
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:52,660
the fucking, the one dude was
trying to get them to stop.

339
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,650
But then the other dude there with
the man bun in the fucking beard kept

340
00:20:56,651 --> 00:21:00,990
laughing. They get it was funny. And I was
like, right there. There you go. That's,

341
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,980
there's the generation gap right there.
The millennial kid thinks it's funny.

342
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,400
The other dude who was also kind of
young but probably at an angry dad,

343
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:13,150
did not think it was funny. So I
was rooting for him. But either way,

344
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,740
I had a great time and
I want to thank them.

345
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:19,330
They always treat me great when I go in
there. Um, cigars wasn't were amazing. Um,

346
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,380
that's sort of a tradition.
I always end up there at least one night,

347
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,550
if not seven. All right. Comedy
bubble. Hey Billy burrata toes,

348
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,500
huge fan from Pakistan.

349
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,610
Saw you at the Atlanta punchline of
few months ago and it was amazing.

350
00:21:33,611 --> 00:21:34,331
Thank you very much.

351
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:39,331
Recently I've noticed some established
comedians on social media shitting on

352
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:43,780
open makers in newer comedians
for trying their luck at comedy.

353
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,040
Yeah,
that's not nobody funny is doing that.

354
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,230
I get that there are a lot of comedians
around now in comedy in general is very

355
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:57,220
trendy, especially with Netflix.
Releasing is special every week this year.

356
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,970
But is it fair to say there
is a comedy bubble now?

357
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:06,510
Is it even worth it for an aspiring or
up and coming comic to try their hand at

358
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:09,480
it? Wanted to get your
take on this uh, love you.

359
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:13,720
Stand up the podcast and episode family.
Thanks and go love yourself.

360
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,880
Um, and that for the holidays.
Great. Great. Great question.

361
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,280
All right.
Um,

362
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,100
standup comedy is always
going through some sort of a

363
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,590
opera down as, as any business. You
know what I mean? Look at the NBA.

364
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:36,640
The NBA was through the roof,
popular, right through the Jordan era.

365
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,220
Then it made a dip and now
it's starting to come back.

366
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,030
And then Lebron and all those guys, it
brings it back up and down, up and down.

367
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:46,600
NFL is on a little dip here. Tom
Brady, towards the end of his career,

368
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,630
Peyton Manning's gone. Andrew
lugs heard Aaron. Roger gets hurt,

369
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,230
parity and all that. They got to figure
it out. There's always ups and downs,

370
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:55,120
but that doesn't mean you
shouldn't go after your dream.

371
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,630
I started comedy March 2nd,

372
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,260
1992 after the big eighties bubble
bursts. And there was a bunch of, uh,

373
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,670
not a bunch, but there was a
number of older comics. Um,

374
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,600
when I started out that
tried to discourage me from
starting none of the funny

375
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:15,010
ones. And they go, look at this. So this
Kras, this places like half full. Yeah.

376
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,330
Two years ago there'd be a line
around the block, you know,

377
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,020
and they used to get me all
depressed in that type of stuff. Um,

378
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,710
any established comedian that shits on
an open miker and tries to discourage

379
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:33,400
them is not even worth your
time. Like, how pathetic is that?

380
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,320
What else are you going to do?

381
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:37,600
You're going to make fun of a
toddler learning how to walk.

382
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,890
She just give her a bath. Oh. Um,

383
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,201
all right.

384
00:23:44,201 --> 00:23:48,110
I need to get off because she's getting
more annoyed by the second that I'm out

385
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:52,460
here. What? It was my Christmas
too. I enjoy podcasting. Um, yeah,

386
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,200
those people are not even worth your time.

387
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,370
And is there a comedy bubble
right now? Uh, yeah, absolutely.

388
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,890
You put out 50 to one network,
put out 52 hour long specials in a year.

389
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,690
You do. You can't do that. It stops
being special. It becomes like a, like a,

390
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,720
like a fucking log jam and you know,

391
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,270
you need to have space. It has
to breathe. It's like a song.

392
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,810
You can't have everybody doing
a tap on solo at the same time.

393
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:27,070
It just becomes noise. Um, but you know,

394
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,750
this is the, uh, I think it's gone
up twice since I've been doing it.

395
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:36,660
You know, it, it dip, dip, dip,
dip, dip, bit, bit, bit, bit,
bit baby, boom, boom, boom, boom,

396
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:39,280
boom. All in the beginning of my
first eight years of my career.

397
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:44,230
And then after nine 11, it went up,
it went up, it went up, it went up,

398
00:24:44,231 --> 00:24:48,940
and then it started to come
back down again. And then, uh,

399
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,950
the ability for Comedians to shoot
their own specials and sell them,

400
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,750
made it go up, up, up, up, up, up, up,
up, up. And I would think that the,

401
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,930
the peak of this, it's like a
housing bubble with standup specials.

402
00:25:02,931 --> 00:25:05,180
That one network has 52 of them.

403
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:08,330
But the thing about Netflix
is it's also global.

404
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:09,980
Yeah.

405
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,690
So it's not like,

406
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:13,750
mmm,

407
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,240
they're just doing it for
the United States, you know,

408
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,390
which would be insane if you
just did that for one country.

409
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:23,770
It's for everybody around the world.
So maybe that levels it out. I mean,

410
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:24,970
from what I've heard from Netflix,

411
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:30,060
they're gonna try to have
more of an international
flavor next year when they do

412
00:25:30,281 --> 00:25:35,120
it. I have no idea. I have no
idea. But I don't see that's,

413
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,640
it's beyond my control.
I'm not the one who decides,

414
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:45,180
nor should I be how much so many
specials get put out there or whatever.

415
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:48,790
But it's not going to discourage me
from trying to write my best hour. Yeah.

416
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,613
MMM.

417
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:57,070
But it's definitely making me think about
how to release and when to release my

418
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:57,914
next one.

419
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,473
MMM.

420
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,290
Yeah. I hope I answered your question,
but do it. If you want to do stand up,

421
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,320
but you got to do it. It's the greatest
fucking job ever. If you're good at it.

422
00:26:08,321 --> 00:26:11,590
If not, it's uh, you know, I'll tell
you it's a rough one. Okay. But yeah,

423
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:14,110
don't ever listen to any fucking ass.
Don't listen. Anybody in general,

424
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:17,170
whatever business you're in,
somebody's discourages you.

425
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,830
What kind of an asshole does that?
Hey, I want to do this. Ah, yeah.

426
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,900
I don't know why you want to do that bad.
I mean,

427
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,880
unless you're talking about trying
heroin, you know, other than that,

428
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:31,530
I think I want to start my own business
book. Probably going to go under.

429
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,980
It's actually,
I will tell you,

430
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:38,020
it's actually good that
somebody is doing that to you,

431
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:42,430
that you're getting that this early in
this business because the key to success

432
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:43,980
is tuning people out,

433
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,020
okay?

434
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,291
And,

435
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:51,291
and being around positive people that say
things that make you feel better about

436
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:52,950
what you're going after.
Now,

437
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,330
I'm not saying that at some point
you won't have an idea that is,

438
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,410
you know, you need to think about
again. You know what I mean?

439
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:04,050
So somebody would be like, hey man, you
might want to watch out because of blah,

440
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:08,160
blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not
saying that a negative response,

441
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,170
it's not even negative
constructive criticism.

442
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,810
There's always gotta be a place for that.

443
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:16,890
But you can't have people who are just
being negative just because you're going

444
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:19,830
out and doing something and you'll be
able to tell the difference. All right,

445
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,520
knee, I'm almost done.
No response. All right,

446
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:29,720
rush, reaction, video a, the
ability, five, four, time.

447
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:34,040
Love. You Love Nia. Love your freaking
podcast. And I thought you'd love this.

448
00:27:34,041 --> 00:27:38,600
These guys review albums that apparently
listeners ask them to do a video on

449
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:41,900
Russia's y z.
They do a lot of rap albums,

450
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:44,030
but I've reviewed metal bands.

451
00:27:44,031 --> 00:27:47,960
Like I can't say that's Sepultura.

452
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,700
It's really fun listening to them react
to the drumming and the guitar changes.

453
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:55,820
Merry Christmas. You beautiful
bastard. I actually, uh,

454
00:27:55,821 --> 00:28:00,590
I didn't get to see this video until
you, uh, to right before I started this.

455
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,460
And as you can see, tensions are
building with my Christmas here. Um,

456
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,720
I watched a little bit of a, um, I'm
definitely gonna Watch the whole thing.

457
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,700
It was cool to see that they liked it.
I knew that they're going to be like,

458
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:13,640
what the fuck is this in the beginning,
as I mentioned before,

459
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:16,520
that's why y z is the,
uh,

460
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,870
the call letters for Toronto
International Airport and,

461
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,160
and y Y,
z is the Morse code.

462
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,640
Uh,
uh,

463
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,580
that at that, that, that,
that, that, that, that they're
playing the Morse code of y,

464
00:28:32,581 --> 00:28:34,700
Y, z. It's one of their, one of them.

465
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:38,270
And the band was flying a plane and they
heard it and they thought it sounded

466
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:43,040
cool. So they put it to music. Um,
there you go. That's what that is.

467
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,310
Anyways, so it's funny, I was watching
him listen to this shit going. Yeah.

468
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:47,810
They haven't dropped into the groove yet,

469
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,440
which basically means it's not in four
yet. Essentially for a lot of people,

470
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,900
if that's all you listen to. All
right, original six nonsense. Hi,

471
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:04,130
Bill. I want to know what your
thoughts are on the original six.

472
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,150
I call it the original.
Who gives a fuck? Oh,

473
00:29:07,151 --> 00:29:09,740
this sounds like somebody who
doesn't have an original six team.

474
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,560
No other sports hold clubs
up on a pedestal above the
rest of the teams in the

475
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,394
league.

476
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,600
It's like all the other clubs in the NHL
are less than because they weren't from

477
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:24,770
the beginning as a ducks fan. Now, Jesus,

478
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,270
you're not a ducks fan.
You're a mighty ducks. We,

479
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,580
you're named after a Disney movie.
I get it.

480
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,310
When you can't win enough cups to try and
get some sort of fucking manly vibe on

481
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:41,980
your team. Um, as a ducks fan, I know
you hate them. I don't hate, I don't,

482
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:43,640
uh,
I,

483
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I went out and supported them with
those gay uniforms and gay name.

484
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,920
It was always humiliating playing
the wings or Boston in those

485
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,730
eggplant fucked up green colors with
the cartoon duck on their jersey.

486
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,840
Well it made sense. It was
named after a kids movie. Uh,

487
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:07,580
I think we've earned some respect
for going through the shit you did.

488
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,290
You did your daddy teemu
Salani and had all those guys.

489
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,800
Then angry bastard from uh,
was,

490
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:17,670
was it from a Vancouver you have
down there the hell's his name,

491
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:21,150
Ryan or some shit. Um,
cartoon duck on the Jersey.

492
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:25,020
I think we've earned some respect for
going through that shit. I was like,

493
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,310
it was like wearing a dress
to a biker bar. Every game.

494
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:32,550
I can't stand every time we
play the leafs or Montreal.

495
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:35,610
They always mentioned the
original six bullshit. Anyways,

496
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:39,570
I wanted to know what your take
is on the original six. Um,

497
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,330
well I love sports history,
so I like it.

498
00:30:42,331 --> 00:30:44,850
And even if I didn't have a team
that was in the original six,

499
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:48,580
I like the expansion six.
Uh,

500
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,020
let's see if I can still name them.

501
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:55,030
That's the fly is the penguins.

502
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:56,920
Yeah.

503
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,180
Oh boy. The California Golden
Seals to St Louis Blues.

504
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,230
Yeah.

505
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,640
Nice to be able to rattle this off.

506
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,330
Every team has the Minnesota North Stars
and the Los Angeles kings oof by the

507
00:31:10,821 --> 00:31:15,230
skin of my teeth. I did that. And
then for those, um, who don't know,

508
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:17,860
the California Golden
Seals moved to Cleveland,

509
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,890
became the Cleveland barons and that
went under and I believe merged or

510
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:28,710
something with Minnesota. I can't
remember. I don't remember any.

511
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:32,470
I used to know all that shit. Um, I
like the original six. I wish that, uh,

512
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,700
more leagues would talk
about that type of stuff.

513
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,253
MMM.

514
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,020
You know, like the NFL and that
type of stuff. I just think,

515
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:43,510
I think it's interesting,
personally,

516
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,540
I wish the NFL actually acknowledged
NFL titles the way baseball,

517
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:53,080
basketball and hockey all count.

518
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,820
They all count titles to the
beginning of their league. I mean,

519
00:31:59,650 --> 00:31:59,981
the Montreal Canadians,
they like,

520
00:31:59,981 --> 00:32:04,930
they won Stanley cups against the Montreal
maroons in the Stanley Cup was like

521
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:09,040
the size of a shot glass.
I mean, it is the history.

522
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,950
It probably played the final
game on a fucking pond.

523
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,920
But I mean that is the
history of the league.

524
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:19,330
What I don't understand what the NFL
is,

525
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:23,380
how the Green Bay packers are
not the Yankees or the NFL.

526
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,340
There was talking about the
Pittsburgh Steelers because they've,

527
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,330
they've won six Superbowls
but the Pittsburgh Steelers
were around back in the

528
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,200
early days of the NFL and
had an opportunity every
year to win an NFL title and

529
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:39,800
they didn't. And Green Bay did and
for some reason Green Bay's like, ah,

530
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:40,663
what are they going to green bay,

531
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:45,630
you've got four titles so that
what is four or five for? Um,

532
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,310
for some reason they just go,
oh they got for their,

533
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,460
the two behind the Steelers and they have
like 11 NFL titles plus four Superbowl

534
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,680
. So my world, they're up
around 14, 15, whatever it is.

535
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,920
And then you got the
fucking Lakers who count a,

536
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:08,270
they went some league, the Ba or something
like that and they want a title there.

537
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:12,910
They count that as an NBA title.
I mean that,

538
00:33:12,911 --> 00:33:15,850
that's one of the biggest
bullshit stats in fucking sports.

539
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,440
How the hell you win an NBA
title before there's an NBA.

540
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:26,180
The NFL, like look the NHL, like you know,

541
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:30,380
when the WHL went down or the Ahl,
they've absorbed teams.

542
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,370
Yeah.

543
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:36,350
As did the NBA. Right. But it was still
the NBA, right. When were they absorbed?

544
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:39,340
Like the Aba,
you know,

545
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,890
those Aba teams went into the NBA.

546
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,160
The difference with the Lakers
is the NBA didn't even exist.

547
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,360
There was no NBA, it was like
wrestling before it got unified.

548
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,100
There was a little bullshit league here,

549
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,070
a little bullshit league there
and another bullshit league.

550
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,200
And the Lakers were in one
of those bullshit leaks.

551
00:33:56,201 --> 00:34:00,730
And for some reason they get to count
that bullshit league title as an NBA title

552
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,980
because eventually all the leaks combined,

553
00:34:02,981 --> 00:34:05,860
the two leagues or something combined
and it became a stronger league.

554
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,620
And that was an NBA title, not
your Bullshit League one. You know,

555
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,910
that's like counting,
like when they had the AFL,

556
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,320
like the San Diego chargers
claiming that they,

557
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,060
they won like a fucking Superbowl
is some shit because they,

558
00:34:19,061 --> 00:34:23,830
they want to an AFL title one. Yeah.
Um, but whatever, that's what it is.

559
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,750
It's very la to pad your
fucking resume. So, um,

560
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:33,280
for some reason nobody calls him on it.
Um, so I love, I love the original six.

561
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,930
Um, I think it's cool.
And it's also, you know,

562
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,430
there were more teams then the depression
hit and then they went down to six

563
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,140
teams.
That was the deal.

564
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,250
According to Barton at the Pittsburgh
penguins were around some team from

565
00:34:48,251 --> 00:34:50,230
Pittsburgh and they had black and gold,

566
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,400
cause the Bruins always said the penguins
took their colors. Um, and he goes, no,

567
00:34:54,401 --> 00:34:58,120
we had that in the 20s, or the penguin
steady so knows a different team.

568
00:34:58,121 --> 00:34:58,900
It's like,
all right,

569
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:03,370
well then you went belly up and at which
point you forfeit the colors and then

570
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:05,740
the Bruins gone to back.
You don't get to come back and be like,

571
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,940
oh well we can forever.
You don't.

572
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:15,090
They were already taking your best. It's
a great organization though. All right.

573
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,530
My daughter's boyfriend is
a loop. Oh boy. Dear Billy,

574
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:23,880
the kid first I want to say that I
loved the first two episodes of f is for

575
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:26,700
family and I can't wait. Oh,
the first two seasons, sorry.

576
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:28,380
And I can't wait for season three.
Thank you.

577
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,330
I don't like my daughter's boyfriend.

578
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,930
I like how this guy gets right to it
and I want to make or break up with him.

579
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,560
Let me tell you about my girl.
She's 28 years old. She has a job.

580
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:39,180
She's living in an
apartment with this guy.

581
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,170
The problem is is that she pays for
everything because he's air quote between

582
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:47,640
jobs and also sometimes she calls me to
fix some stuff for her and when I get

583
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:51,300
there I find this asked just playing
video games or watching a movie.

584
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:52,950
Oh my God.

585
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,480
He doesn't even put on a show for when
is the father of his girlfriend shows up.

586
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:59,670
Yeah, this guy's a bum.
He doesn't do shit.

587
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,070
I really don't understand
why she's still with them.

588
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:05,130
My greatest fear is if she marries,
she marries that guy.

589
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,070
Can you please give me your opinion
as a father? Oh my God, dude,

590
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:11,940
I'm brand new to this. You're like
a grizzled vet with a 28 year old.

591
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,310
I got an 11 month old.
I'm going to give you advice.

592
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,450
Can you please give me your opinion as a
father on how to deal with this problem?

593
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,660
Should I tell her to break up with them
or should I just keep my mouth shut?

594
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,500
And I would also love to hear what the
lovely Nia has to say about that sits

595
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,190
about my situation. Thank you. And keep
up the good work. Well, unfortunately,

596
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:32,490
she's a little pissed at me right now.
So, uh, I only got one more question here.

597
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,193
Um,

598
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,920
I, I think I probably would have
given him shit when I went over there.

599
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,360
I would've just been like,
really?

600
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,420
You're just going to sit there playing
video games while the father of your

601
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:51,570
girlfriend comes over to this apartment?

602
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,030
What she's paying for everything
and you don't even have a job.

603
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,030
You just going to sit there and
play video games. Who raised you?

604
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,530
I probably, you know, Nah,

605
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:05,660
I'm not the smartest guy and I
also fly off the handle a lot. Uh,

606
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,680
I would have said something along those
lines and then if he mentioned it to

607
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:13,850
her, I just say, listen,

608
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:19,350
I probably shouldn't have said that. I
love you. I want the best for you and

609
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:25,210
you know, it, it just as
your dad at bothers me that
you're paying for everything.

610
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,190
And then I came over to the
fixed stuff in this guy.

611
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:30,450
Couldn't even stop playing video
games. Um, you know something.

612
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,330
Don't say anything because then you look
like the asshole. That was bad advice.

613
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:39,260
All right. Swing and a miss. Strike
one. I would say that to her.

614
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:41,990
Just say, listen, I'm going to just
going to say this and just say this.

615
00:37:41,991 --> 00:37:43,670
I'm just going to say this one time.

616
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,440
I have to get this off my chest as your
dad because I love you and I want the

617
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:50,210
best for you.
Okay?

618
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I understand that the person you're with
right now is between jobs and really

619
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,333
try to

620
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,420
fight the urge to do the giant air
quotes between jobs and just say,

621
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:06,720
listen, okay, I understand that you know,

622
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:08,610
people have ups and downs in life,
but

623
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,300
it was just kind of a red flag to me
that I went over to your apartment where

624
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:18,290
you're paying everything, where
there's a man there. All right?

625
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:23,380
And he sees the father of the woman
that he's dating come walking in to fix

626
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,690
something that he's not fixing.
He didn't even help me.

627
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:31,370
He continued to play video games. I'm
just saying, I'm a little concerned

628
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,120
about the overall drive
of the man in your life.

629
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:42,280
And as men, we can't give
you children. All right.

630
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,840
What we do is provide. Okay. So,

631
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,573
uh,

632
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:55,040
he just looked like a giant 12 year
old to me. Don't say that last part,

633
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:59,870
but just say, I'm just a little concerned.
Are you, do you share those concerns?

634
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:05,090
And if she says no, just say fair
enough. Maybe I caught him on a bad day,

635
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,450
but just as you father,
I felt like I had to say something.

636
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:13,220
If you're okay with them, then I'm okay
with them. And then you, then you go,

637
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:15,890
cause now you put it out there.
All right.

638
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,300
But if you come at her and you just
say, listen, you need to dump this guy,

639
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:24,770
this guy's a Bombay guys, eyes judge Joe,
then she's going to get a backup and br,

640
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,580
you know, and it'll become actually more
romantic to her that she's, you know,

641
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:32,840
it's us against the world. Baby. Did you
hear what I said? The kids can be like,

642
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,370
wow, oh, sorry. Showing to
get to level seven. Uh, that's
the way I would handle it.

643
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,940
And then after that you just got to wash
your face. Oh God. That's difficult.

644
00:39:40,941 --> 00:39:43,790
You got to wash your hands of it.
Um,

645
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:50,130
I dunno if I could do that.
I,

646
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:53,260
I mean I would just start, uh, at
some point if she stayed with them,

647
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:54,820
I would just start openly teasing of

648
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,853
cool.

649
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,870
Hey, what do you say that
they're, they're couch face, huh?

650
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:03,900
Yeah,

651
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,370
whatever his name is.
Mike. Hey Mike. What's,

652
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,460
what's your favorite couch to sit on
when you're not looking for a job?

653
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,880
You know? Hey Mike, Watch. What's your
favorite? What's your favorite movie? No,

654
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:21,880
let me guess. Peter Pan, right
when you get to be 12 years old.

655
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:26,350
For the rest of your fucking life.
Um,

656
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:31,510
that's what I would just, I would
roast him. No, it rose some.

657
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:35,470
You're so progressive, you know. Hey
Mike, what do you want 41 for? Uh,

658
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,990
what do you want for Christmas? You
want an apron? Oh, that's right.

659
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:39,824
You don't even cook.

660
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,240
How about one of those inflatable donut
thinks that truckers where when they sit

661
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:48,710
on their ass all day getting
hemorrhoids, um, you want to stand up,

662
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:53,840
desk to play your video games on? I
would just, I, yeah, maybe do that.

663
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:58,520
I would just start roasting him.
Alright. Bulletproof glass. Dear Billy,

664
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:02,510
bullet head, uh, writing to you
from the great city of Philadelphia.

665
00:41:02,511 --> 00:41:05,390
A brief background. I am Korean. Oh Dude.

666
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,790
I was just watching a great
movie last night on Netflix.

667
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,310
I'm home of 52 standup specials this
year, including one from me, um,

668
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,930
called, uh, I think it was
called Big Bang. It was called.

669
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,680
It was by the guy just movie starts
in his wife's just like, yeah,

670
00:41:21,681 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm fucking out of here. He's a really
nice guy. And he never breaks the rules.

671
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,620
And you just sort of snaps,
uh,

672
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,670
was watching the beginning of it a
really good acting shot really well.

673
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:37,010
MMM. I'm going to start what
I'm trying to fuck with my, uh,

674
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,740
my main page here.
You know,

675
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:44,330
I'd like more shit on music and I
would like a wider variety of music of,

676
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:44,990
of uh,

677
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:49,990
movies rather than just the American
bullshit that I already know is out there.

678
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:54,790
And it probably already saw
what is killing me is, uh,

679
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,830
that Ryan Gosling movie and
the dude from fucking, um,

680
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:05,290
the gladiator and 20 odd foot
of grunt lead singer there.

681
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,320
What the fuck's his name? The guy threw
the phone at the person downstairs,

682
00:42:08,321 --> 00:42:10,780
which is one of my favorite stories ever.
He shouldn't have done it,

683
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:14,590
but I just can't imagine the satisfaction.
You're not helping me with the phone.

684
00:42:14,591 --> 00:42:16,780
I'm not going to bring the device.
You're not helping me with it.

685
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:20,320
I'm going to throw it at the person that
didn't help me. It's all wrong, but like,

686
00:42:20,321 --> 00:42:24,730
it's so right on so many
levels. Um, Russell Crowe,

687
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:30,310
the nice guys. It's one of my favorite
fucking comedies of the last few years.

688
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:35,650
A sort of a modern day, midnight run.
I love it, but it's not on Netflix.

689
00:42:35,651 --> 00:42:38,410
Some hoping it's going to get on
this soon. All right, dear Billy,

690
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,890
bullet head right to you from the
great city of Philadelphia. Philly,

691
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,940
a brief background. I am Korean and
my father owns two convenience stores,

692
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:51,660
both started by grandfather and
grandmother in the mid Seventies.

693
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,710
God am I that old?

694
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,270
It's your grandparents started businesses
in the 70s and I was alive then.

695
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,080
Wow. Already watching
football and collecting cards,

696
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,630
they worked their asses off to provide for
their family. That's right. Old School.

697
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:09,080
I love it. And make sure my dad
and brothers had a good life. Uh,

698
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,760
one of the stores is in a very bad part
of town and in the mid eighties while

699
00:43:12,761 --> 00:43:15,790
working, my grandfather was
shot at and rubbed. Oh No.

700
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,150
The Bolo went over his head
and missed his head by inches.

701
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,140
This wasn't the first time
he'd been robbed at gunpoint,

702
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:25,240
but the first time you've been shot at
this obviously scared the shit out of my

703
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:27,970
grandmother. And eventually they
installed a bulletproof window.

704
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,520
Since installing it,
they've had zero robberies.

705
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:32,320
And my grandmother's sleeps a bit better.

706
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,480
My grandfather's 78 looks 55 and still
works four days a week. I love this guy.

707
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,670
Uh, just this week a law passed saying
that bulletproof glass is illegal.

708
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,730
The reason a city council woman said
that it may customers feel uncomfortable

709
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:52,390
and pass legislation to make them illegal.

710
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,460
What is going on in this country

711
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:03,730
that has got to be the one fucking
neighborhood does this privileged asshole

712
00:44:03,831 --> 00:44:07,530
live in
for starters,

713
00:44:07,531 --> 00:44:12,531
it's insanity that they can dictate
something based on feelings and emotions

714
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,530
that will have physical
repercussions on the store owners.

715
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,820
Not to mention that if we are taking off,

716
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,050
we're talking about these barriers.

717
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,100
Not to mention that if we're talking
about how these barriers affect emotions,

718
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,040
they certainly keep my
family's emotions in check,

719
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:33,060
worrying about other working in the store.

720
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,330
The woman who passed the law
is a huge client. Agreed.

721
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:42,030
I'm not a social justice warrior at all,
but this woman's legislation is racist.

722
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,960
Yeah. This sounds just like I
live in a safe white neighborhood.

723
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,500
I don't like going in being reminded
that people who don't look like me are

724
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:54,090
being shot. I mean it just, you know,
I just had a long today, it's also,

725
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:56,850
it's only going to affect the pop,

726
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,420
the mom and Pop Asian and other eminent
grant owned stores and it won't have any

727
00:45:03,671 --> 00:45:07,960
effect on the corporate change who don't
have any family working the counter and

728
00:45:07,961 --> 00:45:12,700
won't feel the financial repercussions
of a robbery. None. The problem is, uh,

729
00:45:12,701 --> 00:45:16,690
she's black and no one has the
balls to call her racist. Oh,

730
00:45:16,691 --> 00:45:20,890
I assumed she was white, so I
guess I'm racist. She is though.

731
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,470
She is though.
My question is,

732
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:27,370
I don't know how she's racist to you
is should I stand outside city hall,

733
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,300
City Hall?

734
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:33,280
I said silly hall with the sign
stating she's a racist or just a Twat.

735
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,890
Um,
no,

736
00:45:35,891 --> 00:45:39,790
what I would do is I would try to contact
the local news people cause that's a

737
00:45:39,791 --> 00:45:42,640
great story. And if you still have
the bullet hole and all that stuff,

738
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,160
we get dead. Almost dead.
Grandfather almost got killed.

739
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:47,943
MMM.

740
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:55,040
Is this Oprah? I mean, who said
this? This is crazy. She a Huxtable.

741
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:02,000
Um, is that racist for me to assume
that just because she's black,

742
00:46:02,001 --> 00:46:05,780
that she had some point? Must have
lived in a tough neighborhood. Right.

743
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:11,230
Is that racist on my end or are there
not enough Huxtable black people rapping.

744
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,260
So my idea of, of what their neighborhoods
along. I mean who knows? I mean this,

745
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:19,550
this opens a giant candidate worms,
but at the end of the fucking day,

746
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,970
I think that uh,
you should be able to,

747
00:46:22,971 --> 00:46:26,150
I think that that should
be not the decision.

748
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:27,690
Yeah.

749
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,310
Of the government. That should be the
decision of the person who got shot at,

750
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,120
are you comfortable with rolling the
dice that the next one also won't hit you

751
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:36,954
in the head?

752
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,493
MMM.

753
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:44,510
This is what I would do. I would not
take it down. I wouldn't take it down.

754
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,020
Even if they force you to take
it down, I wouldn't, I, that's

755
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:53,120
I would make a giant stink about it
is what I would do. And I wouldn't,

756
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:57,750
don't say she's racist. Don't say
she's a twice, don't do any of that.

757
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:00,990
Just what you want to do is you want
to keep the story about how the,

758
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:05,100
the bullet missed your grandfather by
inches. And I'm much more comfortable,

759
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:09,000
your grandmother is now with the
bulletproof glass and just say,

760
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,200
and just you killed the, the, he
killed the other person with kindness.

761
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,500
I respect her opinion and blah,
blah, blah. But we work here.

762
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:20,340
She does not work in these stores. Um, you
know, I'm sure she does wonderful work.

763
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:24,090
He just keep doing that.
And um,

764
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:30,100
and then, uh, I would have
to think that someone in

765
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:35,240
this State Department or whatever they
are is going to be looking at this story

766
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,140
going,
okay,

767
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,570
now if we take down the bulletproof glass
and God forbid somebody in there and

768
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:45,830
get shot and killed,
what is the state's going to get sued?

769
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:48,693
MMM.

770
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:53,490
I, I would mention that. Just say, listen,
I'm not trying to cause a problem here,

771
00:47:53,491 --> 00:47:56,700
but like if something happens
to anybody working in my store,

772
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,180
because you know, the bulletproof glass
is taken down, then I am going to hold,

773
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:04,720
you know,
whatever the,

774
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:08,490
the state of Pennsylvania or the
city of Philadelphia and that woman's

775
00:48:08,491 --> 00:48:11,900
specifically,
I'm going to hold them responsible.

776
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,300
That has gotta be the dumbest
thing I've ever heard of.

777
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:20,350
Who installs bulletproof glass?
Who does that?

778
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,860
Places where people
get robbed at gunpoint.

779
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,790
Okay. And they still have the balls to
stand there the next day and try and,

780
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,540
you know, so I can walk into,
buy a paper and fucking Kit Kat.

781
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,900
Don't they have the right
to feel comfortable?

782
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:41,910
I mean, yeah, that's, that's,

783
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,070
that's fucked up.
I gotta tell you as a white person,

784
00:48:44,071 --> 00:48:46,620
I'm actually psyched that that was
finally not somebody white doing that.

785
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,400
Hey, finally it wasn't us. Um, so
that's the way I would go about that.

786
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:56,850
I'd kill him with kindness and a,
and then just sort of, you know,

787
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:01,120
vaguely put it out there. Maybe have a
lawyer down there just going like, I,

788
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:02,160
I can't see how this,

789
00:49:02,161 --> 00:49:06,000
the city of Philadelphia would not be
held accountable if something like this

790
00:49:06,001 --> 00:49:09,000
happens. I mean you, you need to
have some sort of stricter gun laws.

791
00:49:09,001 --> 00:49:13,470
We need to solve a whole bunch of other
problems before you have the hardworking,

792
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,340
honest citizens of this great city being
put into this level of peril because it

793
00:49:19,591 --> 00:49:24,510
upsets one person in their mood that
they're reminded that there are bad people

794
00:49:24,511 --> 00:49:27,960
in the world. Okay. Cause did you
have to remember everybody is either,

795
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,853
there's two things.

796
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:32,790
There's the way you wish the world is
in the way it really is and you have to

797
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:37,500
act accordingly. All right. And that's
it. Merry Christmas. Happy New Year.

798
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:41,130
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
And uh,

799
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:44,110
I hope you guys all have a great Christmas
hung out, but I don't know it was,

800
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,160
Hanukkah is still going right? How
many days are in Hanukkah? I Dunno.

801
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,860
I have no idea.
So now on the ninth day of Hanukkah,

802
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,420
my true love gave to me a Kwanzaa.
Whenever that is,

803
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,270
I don't pretend to know. I don't
pretend to be informed. Okay.

804
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:02,650
But I hope all of you enjoy
your day. All right. That's it.

805
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,070
Okay. If he got a gun, leave it at home.
Just go in and buy a fucking candy bar.

806
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:07,990
Your content. All right. I'll
see. I'll see you on Thursday.
