 Food is fun for many people, and this fits our nature because we need it to stay alive. 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.150
 But what happens to you and your body if you stop completely eating 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.280

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.860
 It is normal for the first six hours, as your body begins to break down glycogen, 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.189
 Stored in the form of (glucose), which is used by the cells of the body as fuel. You go about 25% off 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.070
 The energy of this process is to your brain alone, while the rest of the energy goes to the muscles 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.249
 Tissues and red blood cells. But after six hours production stops, 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.940
 And stores depletion (glycogen), which leads to nervous arousal or hunger and feeling 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.700
 With anger that everyone knows well. 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.590
 At this stage (6 to 72) hours, your body enters a condition called (hyper-ketone of the body), where fasting begins 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.890
 Or starvation, because of the presence of small amounts of (glucose) in your blood, and starts your body 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.570
 By disassembling stored fat for energy, these fats turn into fatty acids. However, 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.940
 Your brain will not be able to use long fatty acid chains. This is a problem, because there is no more (glucose) 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.760
 The fat is too large to cross the blood-brain barrier, and your brain starts to change your mood 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.960
 Ketone molecules are used to produce energy, a short chain of fatty acids. 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.110
 But it is a temporary solution, because 75% of the energy needed for the brain 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.560
 Come from (ketones), we still need glucose! Which means that your cognitive performance will become 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.980
 Poor. 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.740
 You should know that you do not necessarily have to be hungry to enter the stage (hypertonemia in the body) 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.110
 Most people enter this stage if they are following a low-calorie diet, or they are professional athletes 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 They use all their calories for long periods - such as marathon runners - for example 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.640
 Will also include them. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.710
 But after 72 hours, your mood and energy will not only be affected, 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.220
 Your brain will begin to break up the protein in your body, where the protein releases the amino acids 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.020
 Which contains (glucose). This is good for your brain, but bad for your body. 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.909
 In practice, your body will consume itself by destroying your muscle mass. 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.250
 This happens when women because of malnutrition and menstrual cycle, the body tries here 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.060
 That limits energy exchange. It also leads to osteoporosis, exposing both men and women to deficiency 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.140
 In sexual desire. 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.490
 Over several weeks, the immune system will weaken in the body without 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.179
 Ie vitamins or minerals, leading to some deaths due to diseases. On the other hand, it will continue 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.879
 Consuming all energy sources of fat, tissue and muscle mass until the glucose is fully depleted. 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.090
 One of the most common causes of death is heart arrhythmias or heart attacks, due to 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.999
 Deterioration of heart tissue, diaphragm and body. This is very common among sufferers 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:30.209
 Anorexia. Of course, the organs of the body are experiencing severe deterioration at all levels. 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.150
 Hunger can lead to death within a short period of three weeks to 70 days, as documented 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.549
 During the "hunger strike" events in Ireland in 1981. However, the period of survival is affected 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.519
 The extent of your body's moisture and the amount of fat stored in it, which 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.829
 Sometimes his ability to endure for a long time without food, do not believe .. 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.999
 To date, nearly 795 million people around the world should deal with this fact. 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:03:01.079
 There is good news that the richest seven countries in the world have pledged to save 500 million people 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.219
 Of malnutrition and hunger by 2030, but we must hold them accountable. We are working 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.739
 Within an organization called the "global citizen", an easy way 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.540
