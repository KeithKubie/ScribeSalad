00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.916
Only the first answer is correct. In Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, and

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:07.554
many other video games, you move through a 3D world and interact with it.

00:00:07.554 --> 00:00:12.048
Pixar's Toy Story was the first film made completely with computer graphics back

00:00:12.048 --> 00:00:16.260
in 1995. It and many other animated films, such as the Ice Age series, use 3D

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.115
rendering techniques. However, the final product is not interactive. It's a

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:23.840
linear film that you have no real control over. Each image in a computer

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.726
animated movie can take from seconds, to minutes, to hours to compute depending

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:31.341
on the complexity of the scene. That said, artists and technical directors

00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:34.733
working on these films depend on interactive rendering techniques to set up

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.990
lighting, design materials, and create animations. Computerized tomography or

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.464
other 3D image techniques gather slices of data. However, gathering the data by

00:00:43.464 --> 00:00:46.812
performing the scan is not the same as rendering this data. Pacman is

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:51.065
interactive and is rendered, but the scene described is entirely in 2D. Games

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:55.067
such as Angry Birds are also in this category where an illusion of 3D is

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:59.355
achieved by having 2D layers that move at different speeds. Mobile phones and

00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:02.853
tablet's can certainly perform 3D rendering, but these particular games don't

00:01:02.853 --> 00:01:04.063
need such capabilities.
