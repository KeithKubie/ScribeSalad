1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.010
I,
I live south of Glendale and there's a,

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.410
there's a banquet hall every two blocks.
I'm like there had some laundering.
Yeah.

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.750
Come on.
That's gotta be some Geek,
some easy laundering right there.
Quit Hall.

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.520
They're just trying to figure out a way to get rid of money.
Yeah.

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.210
Cause you got to move it around just to find the ring.
Say there isn't a,

6
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:19.050
a wedding,
a two weddings a day,
couple weddings.
Sure.

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.740
Well that you got to think that if you're a person in this day and age that you

8
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:26.820
selling drugs and you're trying to launder money,

9
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:29.910
you have to be super sophisticated about it.
That's the hardest part.

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.100
If you making millions of dollars selling drugs,
how do you,
you know,

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.330
you have to own like laundromats or something.

12
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.630
Like you can't be like a Pablo Escobar moving the money from the bottom of the

13
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:43.730
top to the rot.
Like fruit.
Like there's so many rats in there.
I was at a,
uh,

14
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.010
oh this is the best way to describe the soap.
Giving anybody up.

15
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.050
I was at a luxury automobile place.
Ah,
and uh,

16
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.060
this one gentleman came in who is in the rap game.
Sure.
And,
uh,
he,

17
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:01.950
they had a large bag of money.
They were looking at Lamborghini's.

18
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.790
I wasn't looking at Lamborghinis today.
You do she buy the Lamborghini?
No,

19
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.170
but they sell them at this place.
And uh,

20
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.450
this guy had a bay and they were bringing out the money counter.

21
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.190
I'm money counting machine.
Yeah.
So like,
yeah,
like Scarface.
Scarface.
Yeah.

22
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.840
Like this is how they were going to buy a car.
That's fantastic.

23
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.360
I guess if you're in the rap game,
that's how they like to buy a car.
Sure.

24
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.470
They'd like to just like throw a duffle bag full of cash and buy a car and then

25
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:31.340
you're done.
You're done.
It's like,
no,
I wait my wire to come through.
No,

26
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.990
here you go.
I,
uh,
my,
my,
uh,
my,

27
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.130
I used to work with a business manager who used to work with high end sports.
Uh,

28
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.250
it's high on the athletes and she's like,
oh yeah,
like I was just like,

29
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.800
can you eat,
set this up or some transfer?
She's like,
Nah,
listen,

30
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.130
you'll never make my job as hard as trying to get a Lamborghini dealer to open

31
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:52.980
at midnight in Las Vegas where the client wants to buy one.
Oh,
right.

32
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:55.430
Like somebody wins.
Yeah.
There's something going.
It's like,

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.390
I want to buy a lambo right now.

34
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.440
Coked out of their fucking mind how to get married.
I'm going to buy a limb.

35
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.000
Brightening.
Got Purple.
Who was that pictures his future.
He's the rappers to him.

36
00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:09.180
Hold on $1 million future.
His future is very,
very popular.

37
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.540
There is future and it looks like he's got some stray hundreds in that.

38
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:14.910
A ring finger slipping through his fingers.

39
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.590
Do you think he has like a fuck hole cut in the,
in the money,
right?
He's fucking,

40
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:24.510
that really was.
Pants are down very low and see known as it may.
Good,
good point.

41
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.890
Hey,
might be,
uh,
might have a fleshlight in paled into that stack of cash.

42
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.750
So he's got $1 million in cash.

43
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.570
How much have that Mike Tyson back in the height of his,

44
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.180
of his is heavyweight reign.

45
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.510
He used to carry like something like $20,000 on a middle times or something

46
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:43.650
insane.
That's normal,
isn't it?
Yeah.
Well it's for a rapper at 20 grand is,

47
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.440
that's not funny,

48
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.480
but I'm talking the eighties but I remember reading that article as a kid and

49
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.030
being like Christ and I went through two thoughts.

50
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.140
Isn't the afraid of getting around?
Of course not.
Of course.
Not Rob Mike Tyson,

51
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.530
like usually he's going to find you unless you kill him.
He's gonna.

52
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.740
He's gonna find he's going to sit on you and punch your head until it's jelly.

53
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.730
What is it says broke.
Yeah.
That was after 57 file for bankruptcy.
Right,

54
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:09.400
because like women were coming after him for child support.

55
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.020
So he said he was bankrupt,

56
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.730
but he also made hundreds of millions of dollars off of vitamin water.
Yeah.

57
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.890
He made a killing with that vitamin water deal.
Yeah.

58
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:21.820
He's got some weird bankruptcy thing.
It was,
it was child support.

59
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.250
Is that what got him in the end and vodka because no,

60
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.830
I don't think got him.
I,
he was avoiding it.
He never should have wrapped.

61
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:33.880
Have a baby by me,
baby,
be a millionaire.
I'll write the check for the baby comes.

62
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.250
Who the fuck cares?
I think he said that says,
I mean,

63
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.800
you're setting yourself up there.
I guess he cares.
Yeah.

64
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.500
Well the thing is after a while,

65
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:46.060
when you don't have a hit record out in like a decade,
right.
You're like,
hey,

66
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.190
this shit could dry up.
Yeah.

67
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.330
Like maybe I need to go bankrupt and stop paying these ladies.
He's,

68
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.590
well,
it's a cash only business.
He probably has it all hidden.

69
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.550
I don't know what he did.
Like he bought the vitamin water thing isn't cash only.

70
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:04.270
I don't know how,
I don't know how that guy is a dollar spend.
So you're bankrupt.

71
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.530
That's sticky.
Really is I think,

72
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.440
I think your theory is probably sound of him just being like,
yeah,
I don't,
ah.

73
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.600
I think it was literally because of that,

74
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:16.990
like someone was trying to hit him up either for alimony or child support.

75
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.130
He was like,
I've got an idea.
I'm just going to hire some financial wizards.

76
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.900
Sorcery.
Yeah.
Dig a hole,
bury it in the ground.

77
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.650
It is weird that people give people money.
Like,

78
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.550
like you break up and go,
okay,
well now you've got to give them money.

79
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.450
Like I get it if you have a child to support.
Totally makes sense.
Right.

80
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:41.620
But like if you dated someone for a couple of years and then you married him and

81
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:43.540
then while you're married,
you made $1 million,

82
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:45.970
they didn't make anything and be like,
Hey,
I want to have that money.

83
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.860
Like what is very straight and not together anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But uh,

84
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.360
I want money.
I want money from you.
Check story.

85
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.840
Are you going to do half my set on the road for now on?
No,
no,
no.

86
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.440
But I want you to support my lifestyle.
Oh,
I'm used to a certain lifestyle.

87
00:04:59.441 --> 00:05:02.980
That's another thing that gets me,
that's used to a certain lifestyle.
That guy,

88
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.660
the guy who,
uh,
Joan Collins,
I don't know,
16th husband or something.

89
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.600
I remember he,
that was his thing in court.
Like your honor,

90
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:13.780
my client has grown accustomed to a certain lifestyle and that was all over the

91
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:18.730
news and it was just like,
ah,
come on dude.
Custom,
like you can't change,

92
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.890
you cannot change.
Right.

93
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.470
There's no way you could live a middle class life anymore.

94
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.750
It's that those days are done.
Okay.
It's awkward.
It's only upward.
Well,

95
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.750
you probably can't,
you can't fly anything less than FirstClass now can't you?

96
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:35.890
Probably I float.
Yeah,
sometimes good for you.
Yeah.

97
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.320
It's just a fucking plane.
Yeah,
that's good.

98
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.990
But I know people that if they have to sit and like,
I remember when,
when,
uh,
uh,

99
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.860
during the whatever recession or something,

100
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.120
there's some video of puff daddy getting on a plane and he was like,
he's like,

101
00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:52.320
your boy isn't flying private.
We've got to fix these problems,
man.

102
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:55.600
I've got to fly in first class.
And you just like,
why would I give a shit?

103
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.930
You're boy isn't flying private.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
It was amazing.
Thank you.

104
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.460
Thank you for tweeting about this.

105
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.280
I was worried about the government shutdown and yelling at yelling at us,

106
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.920
and this was like 10 years ago,
but like yelling at the,
at the,

107
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.590
whoever's filming them on Tmz and,

108
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.230
and I think about the person that's in like group D for that plane where they

109
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:15.980
call you and it's just like you and like a stray dog that gets led on the plane.

110
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.250
Was he saying he wasn't flying private because the money wasn't flowing because

111
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:22.420
the economy was low?
Yeah,
that was his point.
Yeah.
Yeah.

112
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.140
And there's someone that's like,
oh,

113
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.940
I used my last check to get on this plane to see about a job offer and Tulsa.

114
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.280
Oh Jesus.
He's one of those guys.

115
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:36.050
Like he had some fucking billboard on sunset.
It was like,
can't stop.
Won't stop.

116
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.530
I thought you stopped.
I didn't know you didn't stop.

117
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.210
[inaudible] I thought I told you that.
We don't stop.
Can't stop.
Won't stop.

118
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.230
It's like,
yeah,
we told you that.
We don't stop.
We,

119
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.160
you told us we put them on stop.
Stop.
I haven't seen you in awhile.

120
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.400
You didn't stop.
Yeah.
While we've been doing,
while he wasn't around,

121
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.510
he didn't stop.
What does he do?
It was 2008 because the gas prices were too high,

122
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:59.510
so he stopped flying private.
That's what it was.
Thank you.
Gas prices.

123
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.070
It wasn't okay.
Economy.

124
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.490
Got To fix this problem for puff daddy or PTSD or whatever that is.
