00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.730
Do bed bugs sleep?

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:09.780
Because if they do I say it’s high time
we bite them back!

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.099
Hey there sleeping pill bugs, Julian here
for DNews.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.170
We’re still not exactly sure why we need
to sleep but almost every animal does it.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.780
Humans, cats, dogs, cats, birds, cats, even
fish and cats!

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.220
So just how deep does the rabbit hole go?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.230
Do insects, for instance, need a little shut
compound-eye?

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.300
It’s not an easy question to answer because
it’s not like bugs have eyelids they can

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.540
actually close and we still haven’t devised
tiny brain wave scanners that can detect a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.630
resting pattern.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.410
So scientists had to define what insect sleep
looks like, and in 2000 they did just that.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.130
Two separate groups from the Neuroscience
Institute of California and the University

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.400
of Pennsylvania studied fruit flies to see
if they behaved similarly to us.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.820
The researchers found that at night, they
were immobile and had a higher arousal threshold,

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.060
meaning it took more than usual to startle
them and get them moving5.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.680
The scientists also found that if they deprived
the flies of sleep at night by continually

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.660
tapping the container they were in, the flies
would rest during the day, exhibiting “sleep

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.660
rebound.”

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.420
If you’ve ever worked all night and then
slept like a log in a coma the whole day,

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.050
you can relate to the flies.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.100
And if you used caffeine to pull an all nighter,
the flies can relate to you: turns out the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.370
chemical that keeps us buzzing does the same
for fruit flies.4

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.060
Since the first observations of fruit fly
sleep in 2000 more insects have been caught

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.060
napping.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.660
The males of some species of bees that don’t
live in hives sleep by locking their jaws

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.620
onto a flower and relaxing the rest of their
body.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.620
They exhibit the same change in arousal threshold:
as you can see in this video, when this sleeping

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.620
bee is poked, it lazily waves a leg like it’s
asking for 5 more minutes.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.860
And if bees are kept awake, they show the
same negative side effects we do.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.830
Biologist Barrett Klein studies the sleep
of bees and invented a device called the Insominator,

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.950
which is officially the best name for anything
ever.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.720
Klein would tag some bees with steel and some
with copper.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.940
The Insominator would keep the steel-clad
bees awake by jarring them with magnets.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.300
Meanwhile, bees tagged with non-magnetic copper
would be unaffected.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.320
The next day when the steel-clad sleepy bees
had to communicate where flowers were by doing

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.810
the waggle dance -- yes that’s the official
name -- they weren’t as accurate as their

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.440
well rested brethren.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.070
Sleep deprivation makes bees a little muddled,
just like us.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.670
And if it goes on for too long, it can have
worse consequences.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.110
A study that kept fruit flies awake for an
extended period saw a third of them die.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.440
So extreme sleep deprivation can be fatal
for insects, just like us.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.420
Some researchers think if it doesn’t outright
kill them, it can shorten a bug’s life span.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.630
A University of South Florida study of fire
ants found that queens get much more rest

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.630
than the workers.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.700
The queens would regularly doze off 90 times
a day for 6 minutes at a time, which adds

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.420
up to 9 hours.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.980
Workers on the other hand took minute long
power naps at random, 250 times a day.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.170
That adds up to less than 5 hours.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.700
Incidentally, workers only live up to a year,
while queens can live for up to 6 years.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.930
The worker ants sleeping pattern means that
80% of the colony is awake at any given time

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.860
so they can continuously get stuff done.13
Other insects sleep when there’s not much

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.160
point in being awake: flowers close up at
night, so honeybees can catch some zzzzs.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.570
Humans aren’t on mattresses during the day
so bed bugs sleep then.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.430
The New Zealand weta lives at an altitude
where it freezes overnight so it might as

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.580
well go into cryosleep.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.770
And spiders…

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.480
Spiders aren’t insects, they never sleep.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.860
They’re always watching.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.080
Kidding… probably.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.160
If you’re a tired bee, maybe your mattress
is your own insominator.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.830

Hey remember how I mentioned fish sleep and
you were really curious as to how that’s

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.720
even possible?

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:55.379
Well Trace and Dr. Kiki Sanford tell you all
about it here.

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.460
Before we brought it up I bet you never wondered
if insects sleep, but these are the questions

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.460
that keep us up at night.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:08.790
