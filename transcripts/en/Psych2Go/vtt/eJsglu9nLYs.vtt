00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080
[Intro music]

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.960
People often go to school
with the mindset

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.040
that it's something
they're required to do.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.480
Ever since we first learned

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.020
how to read numbers and letters,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.400
it's been the social norm
to pursue a degree,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.480
get a job, get married,
have kids, and so on.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.880
Well, what does it
all mean in the end?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.520
We celebrate graduations
because they mark

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.700
an important milestone.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.780
But what does it mean
to be successful?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.260
And more importantly,
does your mental health agree

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.100
with that image of success?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.140
In truth, school isn't built upon

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.940
the foundation of promise.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.240
For some people
who are more scholarly inclined,

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.700
school is where
they thrive and belong.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.700
But what about those who feel reluctant

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160
to follow the same path?

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.120
1. You're a night owl.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.940
Teenagers who start school
before 8:30 am

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.000
have a higher risk
of developing anxiety and depression.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.900
Early school start times
seem to put more pressure

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.660
on the sleep process
and increase mental health symptoms,

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.360
while later school start times

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.580
appear to be
a strong protective factor.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.700
While early start times supposedly

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.880
help students develop
time management skills

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.480
and resilience to challenges,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.760
exam schedules take
such a large toll

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.880
on students' health.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.060
Because these issues haven't been resolved,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.020
suicide remains the 2nd leading cause

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.760
of college student deaths
since the 1950s.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.600
And as school enrollment increased,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.440
so did the number of suicides.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.960
2.The education system
can't keep up with

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.200
with the job market.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.580
Today, there are jobs
that weren't available

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.080
in our parents' generation.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.460
Now, technology,
creativity and entertainment

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.720
drives the economy.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.100
Thanks to social media,
there's a higher demand

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.940
for online marketers, writers,
graphic designers

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.620
and computer programmers.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.500
But the education system is failing

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.980
to catch up with these changes.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.800
While the skills being
taught right now

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.180
are basic and essential,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.520
they aren't enough for jobs

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.340
that are demand for newers' skills.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.640
3.College is hard to afford.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.600
It's hard to earn a college degree

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.160
with a middle-class wage.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.540
But it's often advertised that

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.760
you'll need a college degree

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.900
to earn at least
a middle-class wage.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.420
People from the lower class

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.180
want to go to school for a better life,

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.320
but are often unable to afford it.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.660
In addition to paying for college,
many people ended up in debt

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.160
from student loans.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.720
4.You have a big idea

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.020
and your school might not
be able to foster it.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.580
Here's a fun fact:

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.020
14 of the world's
most successful billionaires

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.620
didn't earn a college degree.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.860
They were passionate
about entrepreneurship

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.300
and decided school couldn't
turn their vision into a reality.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.960
Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook,

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.320
dropped out
during his sophomore year at Harvard

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.220
and founded Facebook in 2004.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.560
Hiroshi Yamauchi,
the third president of Nintendo

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.340
dropped out Waseda University,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.080
to take over
the family business.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.620
Although these people
are known for their achievements,

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.600
there's no doubt that
they faced tremendous struggles

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.640
and many failures

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.240
before making the headlines.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.460
You can have a plan
that doesn't involve school

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.860
and still be successful.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.560
5.Your dream doesn't
require a degree.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.080
63% of the degrees between now
and 2020

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.820
won't require a college degree.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.020
Some of which include:

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.160
Construction supervisors,
electricians and insurance sales agents.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.260
In addition, for individuals

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.500
who are hands-on learners,

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.580
and excel at
using sensory information.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.340
Some of these existing jobs
are a great fit for them.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.140
Because they don't involve
exploring the abstract ideas

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.560
or theories school often reinforce.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.840
6.College doesn't prepare you
for the real world.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.180
Starting at a young age,
we've been taught that

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.260
we must excel and
look good on paper

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.620
in order to succeed.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.280
But all that does is reinforce

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.720
perfectionistic tendencies,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.260
which is actually detrimental
to one's well being.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.460
We're given the illusion
that gold stars and straight As

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.660
will ensure that we're
doing everything right.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.680
and anything less is a failure.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.000
Reality doesn't work
that way though.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.120
Someone won't always
be there to recognize

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.720
and acknowledge
your hard work.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.400
And failure is actually
a large aspect of life.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.080
This is why
when college graduates

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.820
can't land
their dream job right away.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.840
It hits them
like a ton of bricks.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.240
7.The job market looks bleak.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.040
School is supposed
to help students develop

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.320
important skills,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.440
such as problem-solving
and time management

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.460
that will help them
take responsibilities

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.260
more readily.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.460
But they don't mean anything

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.360
until they're applied
in the real world.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.080
This is also why
companies are often reluctant

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.620
to hire recent graduates.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.580
And since jobs
are scarce now,

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.840
there's more competition
between recent graduates

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.540
and those who've
already been in the industry longer.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.380
8.Your degree
might become obsolete.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.600
The career you wish
to pursue in the future

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.960
may no longer exist
by the time graduation rolls around.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.260
Media and technology
have taken over

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.240
and replaced old jobs
with new ones.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.880
So it's important
to consider

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.720
that the career options
you desire may be dwindling.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.120
9.The "safe" route
isn't all that safe.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.740
Even jobs that are in demand,
don't guarantee its safety net.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.960
Medical and academic professionals
are facing more challenges

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.540
thanks to today's economy.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.680
Doctors and nurses
are getting paid less

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.040
because of the way government

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.020
is regulating
the health care system.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.040
And many teachers
are getting laid off

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.600
due to budges shortages.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.440
Everyone's
scrambling for stability,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.880
which has become a privilege

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.440
This is especially true
for Millennials, who make up

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.060
the most underpaid
and unemployed generation,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.760
which is why
so many move back in

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.820
with their parents.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.540
10.You are self-made.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.880
By not choosing school,
you get to decide

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.840
how to acquire
the skills you want.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.140
Going to school
and choosing one major

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.580
may limit what you learn.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.460
On the other hand,
not going to school

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.920
can open
different doors for you

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.140
because you can explore
different options:

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.660
You can volunteer work,
attend workshops,

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.440
or participating online programs

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.100
to build
the skills you need.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.300
And the best part is,
you can work and learn

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.420
at your own case.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.460
So, do you think
schools are for you?

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.180
If you chose not to go to school,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.660
what did you find beneficial
or hard to deal with?

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.060
