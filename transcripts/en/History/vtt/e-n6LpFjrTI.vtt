00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.460
- All right, bladesmiths.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.420
On your anvils is a cloth.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.170
Go ahead and lift that up.

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:10.635
That is a pristine
piece of 5160 steel.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:12.804
And I'm sure you're
thinking, man, I

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:16.391
can make a hell of a
signature blade out of that.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.811
However, that's not
what we're doing today.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:24.357
Instead, you'll be
forging friction folders.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.191
Really?

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.735
Why a folder?

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.445
It's a moving knife.

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:31.114
I mean, the more moving
parts in something, the more

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.367
parts that can go wrong.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:36.369
The blade parameters
are as follows.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.496
The length of the blade
not including the tang

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:41.499
must be between 8 and
10 inches in length.

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:44.669
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:46.838
Good luck, bladesmiths.

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.965
Your 10 minute design
window starts now.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:54.637
JACOB: 90% of the time, I
don't even draw a knife.

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.598
I'll just get a
dream or something

00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.308
and I'll just make it.

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.351
In this competition, I need
to draw this thing out to make

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:02.562
sure I don't make any mistakes.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.981
I decided my design's
gonna be a clip point.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.649
I don't know exactly
what abuse they're

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:07.817
going to put on that blade.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:10.445
And they don't usually snap.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.614
HOST: Bladesmiths, your
design period is over.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:15.992
Your three hour foraging
time starts now.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.748
MAN: These guys have got
to be focused on the specs.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.292
Otherwise, those friction
folders aren't going to hold.

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:25.710
BLADESMITH 1: You got
to plan ahead of time

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.753
what you're going to do.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.379
And I can't do it on the fly.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.673
The area of the ricasso is
so much more important now--

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:32.884
placement of your
pin for the pivot

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:35.595
and then your tail for that tank
that's going to lock everything

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:38.640
together when you hold it.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.601
JACOB: After I get my
tang stretched way out,

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.520
I'm trying to think, what's
going to set me apart from all

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.896
these other guys in here?

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.523
JUDGE 1: Jacob's put
a decorative twist.

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:48.566
JUDGE 2: How good
of a strategy is it

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.443
to put that decorative twist?

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:52.195
It's not bad if he
still grinds it flat.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.571
Yeah.
JUDGE 2: Uh-huh.

00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.032
So it still fits in
the slot in his handle.

00:01:56.032 --> 00:01:59.035
JUDGE 1: Long as it doesn't
create a nice spot to chew

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:00.495
the heck out of your palm.
- Yeah.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.875
JACOB: I'm drying
this knife out.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:07.585
And I'm like, wait a second.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.295
This thing long enough?

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.048
HOST: If I were him, I'd try
and draw another inch or so out

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:13.424
of that blade for a ricasso.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:16.177
JACOB: Now I realize
this blade is like right

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:17.762
on the dot of eight inches.

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.722
I can't work with that because
I don't have any freedom

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:21.224
to do anything with it, really.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.767
Like, I had to draw it
out a little bit more.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.644
Has to be within the parameters.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.354
And if it's not, I'm gone.

00:02:26.354 --> 00:02:27.689
Hoo!

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.482
HOST: Bladesmiths!

00:02:29.482 --> 00:02:33.027
You have just 60
minutes remaining.

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:34.404
JACOB: Yeah, that's good.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.739
Jacob didn't draw that
blade out some more.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.366
JUDGE 3: Without a ricasso.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.159
JUDGE 1: There's a little
bit of a ricasso there.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.703
JACOB: I'm trying to
figure out exactly where

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.413
I need to drill my hole at.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:45.290
I look next to me
at Fuad's blade.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.585
And his blade is like, wow.

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:50.879
Mine's looking pretty good.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.423
But I can't make any mistakes.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:59.846
[blade sound] nice and slow just
to make sure I get it right.

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:08.897
HOST: 10, 9, 8, 7,
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:03:08.897 --> 00:03:10.523
Bladesmiths, shut
down your machines.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.066
This round is over.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.235
JACOB: I'm feeling pretty
good about my blade.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:15.486
I got it finished.

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:17.030
I looked over all the guys.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.032
And now I'm second
guessing myself

00:03:19.032 --> 00:03:20.909
because mine's the
shortest blade.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.161
But it's within the parameters.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:25.997
They shouldn't have
any complaints.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.916
HOST: Bladesmiths, it's
time for the judges

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.834
to take a closer
look at your work.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.002
Greg, you're up first.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.632
I was a little bit
worried in the heat treat.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:37.175
This thing was glowing.

00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:39.677
And you even picked up
some of that dragon scaling

00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:42.805
where the skin kind of
burnt on this blade.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.515
Hopefully you've
nailed that heat

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:48.269
treat and you didn't quench
it too hot, making it brittle.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:48.895
HOST: All right, Kyle.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:52.815
JUDGE 1: The biggest
problem I see

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:53.942
is when you look down
the edge, there's

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.944
kind of a corkscrew to it.

00:03:55.944 --> 00:04:00.365
And that's-- that's a
difficult warp to fix.

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:02.784
HOST: All right, Jacob.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:04.869
JUDGE 4: Extra points for
putting the twist because it's

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.204
going to make it look good.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.872
But remember, the
tang is the area where

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:09.666
you're going to hold onto it.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.251
So be careful in how this
will feel in the hand

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:13.920
if you move forward.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.257
I like the fact that you've
got it very, very straight.

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:21.260
But you're only going to have
a quarter inch of material

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.808
in front of that pin, making
an incredibly weak spot.

00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.184
HOST: Well, bladesmiths.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.269
The judges have made
their final decision.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:33.398
It's time for one of
you to leave the forge.

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:38.319
The bladesmith leaving
the forge is Kyle.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.488
Kyle, I loved the
profile of that blade,

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.281
having that sweep coming up.

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.993
But if you look down the
length of that blade right now,

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:47.578
you'll see that blade goes
down three different directions

00:04:47.578 --> 00:04:49.247
looking on the spine side.

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.416
If you turn it over
and look at the edge,

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:54.293
you've got a severe twist
going off to one side.

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:56.629
It's going to be almost
impossible to fix that twist.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.506
So that's why we're
letting you go.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.507
Thank you.
