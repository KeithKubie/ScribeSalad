and other people are there which is the
 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.920
and other people are there which is the
case 50 to 60 percent of the time

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930
case 50 to 60 percent of the time
 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.469

within the lock zone but it will save
 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.690
within the lock zone but it will save
lives and so that's one thing one way we

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700
lives and so that's one thing one way we
 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.910
lives and so that's one thing one way we
can turn the tide on this the other way

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920
can turn the tide on this the other way
 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.270
can turn the tide on this the other way
that I think we can turn the tide on

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280
that I think we can turn the tide on
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.640
that I think we can turn the tide on
the addiction is we really need to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650
the addiction is we really need to
 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.900
the addiction is we really need to
provide greater access to drugs like

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910
provide greater access to drugs like
 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.140
provide greater access to drugs like
methadone and suboxone which is also

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150
methadone and suboxone which is also
 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.190
methadone and suboxone which is also
called buprenorphine in order those two

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200
called buprenorphine in order those two
 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.220

potentially for life are the only things
 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.590
potentially for life are the only things
that cut the death rate by 50% and if we

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600
that cut the death rate by 50% and if we
 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.479
that cut the death rate by 50% and if we
really want to solve this problem we

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489
really want to solve this problem we
 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.340
really want to solve this problem we
could get rid of half of it if we could

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350
could get rid of half of it if we could
 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.210
could get rid of half of it if we could
enroll many more people in these

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
enroll many more people in these
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.890
enroll many more people in these
maintenance programs now there's a lot

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900
maintenance programs now there's a lot
 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.750
maintenance programs now there's a lot
of barriers to that one is that we only

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760
of barriers to that one is that we only
 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.449
of barriers to that one is that we only
allow doctors prescribing buprenorphine

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459
allow doctors prescribing buprenorphine
 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.050

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060
to see a hundred patients now they've
 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.530
to see a hundred patients now they've
just raised it to 200 this is ridiculous

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540

patients this is really silly we also
 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.120
patients this is really silly we also
have this idea that you can't provide

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130
have this idea that you can't provide
 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.130
have this idea that you can't provide
these medications without also providing

doesn't actually help anyway so what we

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
doesn't actually help anyway so what we
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.699
doesn't actually help anyway so what we
should do is we should have different

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709
should do is we should have different
 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.940
should do is we should have different
thresholds for treatments so with

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950
thresholds for treatments so with
 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.800
thresholds for treatments so with
buprenorphine some people may just want

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810
buprenorphine some people may just want
 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.370
buprenorphine some people may just want
to show up and get a dose and that's it

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380
to show up and get a dose and that's it
 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.050
to show up and get a dose and that's it
and that will work as sheer harm

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060
and that will work as sheer harm
 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.810
and that will work as sheer harm
reduction that should be available in

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820
reduction that should be available in
 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.960
reduction that should be available in
emergency rooms you need to register

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970
emergency rooms you need to register
 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.000
emergency rooms you need to register
people so that you don't end up people

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010
people so that you don't end up people
 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.300
people so that you don't end up people
getting multiple doses and you need to

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310
getting multiple doses and you need to
 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.610
getting multiple doses and you need to
be a little more careful with methadone

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620
be a little more careful with methadone
 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.800
be a little more careful with methadone
than with buprenorphine because there is

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810
than with buprenorphine because there is
 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.650
than with buprenorphine because there is
a big overdose risk for patients who are

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660
a big overdose risk for patients who are
 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.449
a big overdose risk for patients who are
naive to methadone and it's a difficult

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459
naive to methadone and it's a difficult
 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.250
naive to methadone and it's a difficult
drug to prescribe so that needs to be a

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260
drug to prescribe so that needs to be a
 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.870
drug to prescribe so that needs to be a
little more controlled but we have it

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880
little more controlled but we have it
 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.130
little more controlled but we have it
way too controlled

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140
way too controlled
