00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.046
The real topic is how to solve
inhomogeneous systems,

00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:14.469
but the subtext is what I wrote
on the board.

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.515
I think you will see that
really thinking in terms of

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:23.184
matrices makes certain things a
lot easier than they would be

00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:26.374
otherwise.
And I hope to give you a couple

00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:30.965
of examples of that today in
connection with solving systems

00:00:30.965 --> 00:00:36.722
of inhomogeneous equations.
Now, there is a little problem.

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:41.817
We have to have a little bit of
theory ahead of time before

00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:47.000
that, which I thought rather
than interrupt the presentation

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.918
as I try to talk about the
inhomogeneous systems it would

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:56.222
be better to put a little theory
in the beginning.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:01:00.000
I think you will find it
harmless.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.198
And about half of it you know
already.

00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:07.002
The theory I am talking about
is, in general,

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:11.757
the theory of the systems x
prime equal a x.

00:01:11.757 --> 00:01:15.475
I will just state it when n is
equal to two.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.971
A two-by-two system likely you
have had up until now.

00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:24.726
It is also true for end-by-end.
It is just a little more

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:30.000
tedious to write out and to give
the definitions.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.400
Here is a little two-by-two
system.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.099
It is homogeneous.
There are no zeros.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:42.300
And it is not necessary to
assume this, but since the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.400
matrix is going to be constant
until the end of the term let's

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.300
assume it in and not go for a
spurious generality.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.000
So constant matrices like you
will have on your homework.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.356
Now, there are two theorems,
or maybe three that I want you

00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:10.897
to know, that you need to know
in order to understand what is

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.021
going on.
The first one,

00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:16.992
fortunately,
is already in your bloodstream,

00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:19.854
I hope.
Let's call it theorem A.

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:25.580
It is simply the one that says
that the general solution to the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.306
system, that system I wrote on
the board, the two-by-two system

00:02:31.306 --> 00:02:36.928
is what you know it to be.
Namely, from all the examples

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:40.651
that you have calculated.
It is a linear combination with

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:44.441
arbitrary constants for the
coefficients of two solutions.

00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:46.236
In other words,
to solve it,

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:49.960
to find the general solution
you put all your energy into

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.154
finding two independent
solutions.

00:02:52.154 --> 00:02:56.210
And then, as soon as you found
them, the general one is gotten

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.000
by combining those with
arbitrary constants.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.492
The only thing to specify is
what the x1 and the x2 are.

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:08.414
"Where," I guess,
would be the right word to use.

00:03:08.414 --> 00:03:12.907
Where x1 and x2 are two
solutions, but neither must be a

00:03:12.907 --> 00:03:17.808
constant multiple of the other.
That is the only thing I want

00:03:17.808 --> 00:03:20.912
to stress, they have to be
independent.

00:03:20.912 --> 00:03:24.833
Or, as it is better to say,
linearly independent.

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:29.000
Are two linearly independent
solutions.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.818
And department of fuller
explanation, i.e.,

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:42.000
neither is a constant multiple
of the other.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.933
That is what it means to be
linearly independent.

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:55.438
Now, this theorem I am not
going to prove.

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:59.227
I am just going to say that the
proof is a lot like the one for

00:03:59.227 --> 00:04:03.086
second order equations.
It has an easy part and a hard

00:04:03.086 --> 00:04:05.450
part.
The easy part is to show that

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.580
all of these guys are solutions.
And, in fact,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.335
that is almost self-evident by
looking at the equation.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.074
For example,
if x1 and x2,

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:17.551
each of those solve that
equation so does their sum

00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:21.515
because, when you plug it in,
you differentiate the sum by

00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:24.019
differentiating each term and
adding.

00:04:24.019 --> 00:04:28.261
And here A times x1 plus x2 is
Ax1 plus Ax2.

00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:31.409
In other words,

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.953
you are using the linearity and
the superposition principle.

00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:42.308
It is easy to show that all of
these, well, maybe I should

00:04:42.308 --> 00:04:47.288
actually write something down
instead of just talking.

00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:50.389
Easy that all these are
solutions.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.275
Every one of those guys,
regardless of what c1 and c2

00:04:55.275 --> 00:04:59.327
is, is a solution.
That is linearity,

00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:02.721
if I use that buzz word,
plus the superposition

00:05:02.721 --> 00:05:07.000
principle, that the sum of two
solutions is a solution.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.778
The hard thing is not to show
that these are solutions but to

00:05:16.778 --> 00:05:21.159
show that these are all the
solutions, that there are no

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.902
other solutions.
No matter how you do that it is

00:05:24.902 --> 00:05:27.530
hard.
The hard thing is that there

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.108
are no other solutions.
These are all.

00:05:31.108 --> 00:05:35.303
Now, you could sort of say,
well, it has two arbitrary

00:05:35.303 --> 00:05:38.707
constants in it.
That is sort of a rough and

00:05:38.707 --> 00:05:41.635
ready reason,
but it is not considered

00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:44.802
adequate by mathematicians.
And, in fact,

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:48.918
I could go into a song and
dance as to just why it is

00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:52.242
inadequate.
But we have other things to do,

00:05:52.242 --> 00:05:54.696
bigger fish to fry,
as they say.

00:05:54.696 --> 00:05:58.179
Let's fry a fish.
No, we have another theorem

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:04.517
first.
This one it is mostly the words

00:06:04.517 --> 00:06:11.949
that I am interested in.
Once again, we have our old

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:18.944
friend the Wronskian back.
The Wronskian of what?

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:25.211
Of two solutions.
It is the Wronskian of the

00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:30.872
solution x1 and x2.
They don't, by the way,

00:06:30.872 --> 00:06:34.779
have to be independent.
Just two solutions to the

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.569
system.
And what is it?

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.744
Hey, didn't we already have a
Wronskian?

00:06:39.744 --> 00:06:42.511
Yeah.
Forget about that one for the

00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:45.116
moment.
Postpone it for a minute.

00:06:45.116 --> 00:06:50.000
This is a determinant,
just like the old one way.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.488
This is going to be a great
lecture.

00:07:03.488 --> 00:07:06.080
(x1, x2).
Now what is this?

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.871
x1 is a column vector,
right?

00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:12.758
x2 is a column vector.
Two things in it.

00:07:12.758 --> 00:07:17.144
Two things in it.
Together they make a square

00:07:17.144 --> 00:07:19.836
matrix.
And this means it is

00:07:19.836 --> 00:07:24.022
determinant.
It is the determinant of this.

00:07:24.022 --> 00:07:27.511
It is a determinant,
in other words,

00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:32.778
of a square matrix.
And that is what it is.

00:07:32.778 --> 00:07:37.341
I will change this equality.
To indicate it is a definition,

00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:41.130
I will put the colon there,
which is what you add,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.765
to indicate this is only equal
because I say so.

00:07:44.765 --> 00:07:47.394
It is a definition,
in other words.

00:07:47.394 --> 00:07:51.570
Now, there is a connection
between this and the earlier

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.045
Wronskian which I,
unfortunately,

00:07:54.045 --> 00:07:58.608
cannot explain to you because
you are going to explain it to

00:07:58.608 --> 00:08:02.193
me.
I gave it to you as part one of

00:08:02.193 --> 00:08:05.165
your homework problem.
Make sure you do it.

00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:08.915
And, if you cannot remember
what the old Wronskian is,

00:08:08.915 --> 00:08:12.665
please look it up in the book.
Don't look it up in the

00:08:12.665 --> 00:08:16.415
solution to the problem.
If you do that you will learn

00:08:16.415 --> 00:08:18.679
something.
Then you will see how,

00:08:18.679 --> 00:08:21.580
in a certain sense,
this is a more general

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.915
definition than I gave you
before.

00:08:23.915 --> 00:08:27.311
The one I gave you before is,
in a certain sense,

00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:31.725
a special case of it.
Now that is just the

00:08:31.725 --> 00:08:34.313
definition.
There is a theorem.

00:08:34.313 --> 00:08:39.143
And the theorem is going to
look just like the one we had

00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:43.974
for second order equations,
if you can remember back that

00:08:43.974 --> 00:08:46.734
far.
The theorem is that if these

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:51.651
are two solutions there are only
two possibilities for the

00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:53.635
Wronskian.
So either or.

00:08:53.635 --> 00:08:58.921
Either the Wronskian is --
Now, the Wronskian,

00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:03.575
these are functions,
the column vectors are the

00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:08.734
solutions, so those are
functions of the variable t,

00:09:08.734 --> 00:09:12.982
so are these.
The Wronskian as a whole is a

00:09:12.982 --> 00:09:18.242
function of the independent
variable t after you have

00:09:18.242 --> 00:09:24.615
calculated out that determinant.
I will write it now this way to

00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:28.054
indicate that it s a function of
t.

00:09:28.054 --> 00:09:35.559
Either the Wronskian is --
One possibility is identically

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:39.711
zero.
That is zero for all values of

00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:45.288
t, in other words.
And this happens if x1 and x2

00:09:45.288 --> 00:09:51.457
are not linearly independent.
Usually people just say

00:09:51.457 --> 00:09:57.271
dependent and hope they are
interpreted correctly.

00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:03.085
Are dependent.
But since I did not explain

00:10:03.085 --> 00:10:07.085
what dependent means,
I will say it.

00:10:07.085 --> 00:10:12.685
Not linearly independent.
I know that is horrible,

00:10:12.685 --> 00:10:18.171
but nobody has figured out
another way to say it.

00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:23.885
That is one possibility,
or the opposite of this is

00:10:23.885 --> 00:10:29.812
never zero for any t value.
I mean a normal function is

00:10:29.812 --> 00:10:33.033
zero here and there,
and the rest of the time not

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:35.046
zero.
Well, not this Wronskian.

00:10:35.046 --> 00:10:38.805
You only have two choices.
Either it is zero all the time

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:42.026
or it is never zero.
It is like the function e to

00:10:42.026 --> 00:10:43.973
the t.
In other words,

00:10:43.973 --> 00:10:48.000
an exponential which is never
zero, always positive and never

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.147
zero.
Or, it could be a constant.

00:10:50.147 --> 00:10:53.570
Anyway, it has to be a function
which is never zero.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.000
And this happens in the other
case, so this is --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.801
There is no place to write it.
This is the case if x1 and x2

00:11:05.801 --> 00:11:11.090
are independent,
by which I mean linearly

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:16.512
independent.
It is just I didn't have room

00:11:16.512 --> 00:11:22.066
to write it.
That is pretty much the end of

00:11:22.066 --> 00:11:27.487
the theory.
And now, let's start in on the

00:11:27.487 --> 00:11:31.854
matrices.
The basic new matrix we are

00:11:31.854 --> 00:11:35.908
going to be talking about this
period and next one on Monday

00:11:35.908 --> 00:11:40.167
also is the way that most people
who work with systems actually

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:43.946
look at the solutions to
systems, so it is important you

00:11:43.946 --> 00:11:47.038
learn this word and this way of
looking at it.

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:50.610
What they do is look not at
each solution separately,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.946
as we have been doing up until
now.

00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:57.000
They put them all together in a
single matrix.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.139
And it is the properties of
that matrix that they study and

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:04.974
try to do the calculations
using.

00:12:04.974 --> 00:12:09.848
And that matrix is called the
fundamental matrix for the

00:12:09.848 --> 00:12:11.000
system.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.395
Sometimes people don't bother
writing in the whole system.

00:12:20.395 --> 00:12:23.076
They just say it is a
fundamental matrix for A

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:25.817
because, after all,
A is the only thing that is

00:12:25.817 --> 00:12:27.604
varying there.
Once you know A,

00:12:27.604 --> 00:12:31.000
you know what the system is.
So what is this guy?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.351
Well, it is a two-by-two
matrix.

00:12:33.351 --> 00:12:35.855
And it is the most harmless
thing.

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:38.586
It is the precursor of the
Wronskian.

00:12:38.586 --> 00:12:42.682
It is what the Wronskian was
before the determinant was

00:12:42.682 --> 00:12:44.275
taken.
In other words,

00:12:44.275 --> 00:12:48.675
it is the matrix whose two
columns are those two solutions.

00:12:48.675 --> 00:12:52.468
The other question is what we
are going to call it.

00:12:52.468 --> 00:12:56.944
I kept trying everything and
settled on calling it capital X

00:12:56.944 --> 00:13:00.965
because I think that is the one
that guides you in the

00:13:00.965 --> 00:13:06.250
calculations the best.
This is definition two,

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:10.945
so colon equality.
Notice I am not using vertical

00:13:10.945 --> 00:13:15.543
lines now because that would
mean a determinant.

00:13:15.543 --> 00:13:22.000
It is the matrix whose columns
are two independent solutions.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.398
Is that all?
Yeah.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:38.278
You just put them side-by-side.
Why?

00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:41.734
That will come out.
Why should one do this?

00:13:41.734 --> 00:13:45.683
Well, first of all,
in order not to interrupt the

00:13:45.683 --> 00:13:50.373
basic calculation that I want to
make with this during the

00:13:50.373 --> 00:13:54.898
period, it has two basic
properties that we are going to

00:13:54.898 --> 00:14:00.000
need during this period.
These are the properties.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.893
Just two.
And one is obvious and the

00:14:02.893 --> 00:14:06.613
other you will think,
I hope, is a little less

00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:09.754
familiar.
I think you will see there is

00:14:09.754 --> 00:14:13.226
nothing to it.
It is just a way of talking,

00:14:13.226 --> 00:14:16.120
really.
The first is the one that is

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.245
already embedded in the theorem,
namely that the determinant of

00:14:21.245 --> 00:14:24.882
the fundamental matrix is not
zero for any t.

00:14:24.882 --> 00:14:27.197
Why?
Well, I just told you it

00:14:27.197 --> 00:14:31.000
wasn't.
This is the Wronskian.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.613
The Wronskian is never zero?
Why is it never zero?

00:14:35.613 --> 00:14:40.792
Well, because I said these
columns had to be independent

00:14:40.792 --> 00:14:44.464
solutions.
So this is not just not zero,

00:14:44.464 --> 00:14:48.983
it is never zero.
It is not zero for any value of

00:14:48.983 --> 00:14:50.396
t.
That is good.

00:14:50.396 --> 00:14:54.256
As you will see,
we are going to need that

00:14:54.256 --> 00:14:57.834
property.
But the other one is a little

00:14:57.834 --> 00:15:02.448
stranger.
The only thing I can say is,

00:15:02.448 --> 00:15:06.384
get used to it.
Namely that X prime equals AX.

00:15:06.384 --> 00:15:11.106
Now, why is that strange?
That is not the same as this.

00:15:11.106 --> 00:15:15.566
This is a column vector.
That is a square matrix and

00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:20.114
this is a column vector.
This is not a column vector.

00:15:20.114 --> 00:15:26.118
This is a square matrix.
This is what is called a matrix

00:15:26.118 --> 00:15:32.355
differential equation where the
variable is not a single x or a

00:15:32.355 --> 00:15:37.384
column vector of a set of x's
like the x and the y.

00:15:37.384 --> 00:15:40.000
It is a whole matrix.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.906
Well, first of all,
I should say what is it saying?

00:15:53.906 --> 00:15:58.281
This is a two-by-two matrix.
When I multiply them I get a

00:15:58.281 --> 00:16:00.921
two-by-two matrix.
What is this?

00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:04.964
This is a two-by-two matrix,
every entry of which has been

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:08.014
differentiated.
That is what it means to put

00:16:08.014 --> 00:16:11.418
that prime there.
To differentiate a matrix means

00:16:11.418 --> 00:16:14.326
nothing fancy.
It just means differentiate

00:16:14.326 --> 00:16:16.453
every entry.
It is just like to

00:16:16.453 --> 00:16:20.354
differentiate a vector (x,
y), to make a velocity vector

00:16:20.354 --> 00:16:22.695
you differentiate the x and the
y.

00:16:22.695 --> 00:16:26.170
Well, a column vector is a
special kind of matrix.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.000
The definition applies to any
matrix.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.496
Well, why is that so?
I state it as a property,

00:16:33.496 --> 00:16:37.220
but I will continue it by
giving you, so to speak,

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:40.565
the proof of it.
In fact, there is nothing in

00:16:40.565 --> 00:16:42.845
this.
It is nothing more than a

00:16:42.845 --> 00:16:46.798
little matrix calculation of the
most primitive kind.

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:50.674
Namely, what does this mean?
Let's try to undo that.

00:16:50.674 --> 00:16:53.714
What does the left-hand side
really mean?

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:58.123
Well, if that is what x means,
the left-hand side must mean

00:16:58.123 --> 00:17:02.000
the derivative of the first
column.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.263
That is its first column.
And the derivative of the

00:17:05.263 --> 00:17:07.743
second column.
That is what it means to

00:17:07.743 --> 00:17:11.398
differentiate the matrix X.
You differentiate each column

00:17:11.398 --> 00:17:14.139
separately.
And to differentiate the column

00:17:14.139 --> 00:17:17.142
you need to differentiate every
function in it.

00:17:17.142 --> 00:17:19.752
Well, what does the right-hand
side mean?

00:17:19.752 --> 00:17:23.277
Well, I am supposed to take A
and multiply that 

00:17:23.277 --> 00:17:26.410
by [x1,x2].
Now, I don't know how to prove

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.000
this, except ask you to think
about it.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.006
Or, I could write it all out
here.

00:17:34.006 --> 00:17:39.469
But think of this as a bing,
bing, bing, bing.

00:17:39.469 --> 00:17:42.383
And this is a bing,
bing.

00:17:42.383 --> 00:17:45.297
And this is a bong,
bong.

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:50.881
How do I do the multiplication?
In other words,

00:17:50.881 --> 00:17:55.859
what is in the first column of
the matrix?

00:17:55.859 --> 00:18:01.079
Well, it is dah,
dah, and the lower thing is

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:03.993
dah, dah.
In other words,

00:18:03.993 --> 00:18:08.000
it is A times x1.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.336
Shut your eyes and visualize
it.

00:18:17.336 --> 00:18:19.824
Got it?
Dah, dah is the top entry,

00:18:19.824 --> 00:18:22.236
and dah, dah is the bottom
entry.

00:18:22.236 --> 00:18:25.854
It is what you get by
multiplying A by the column

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:28.869
vector x1.
And the same way the other guy

00:18:28.869 --> 00:18:33.070
is --
-- what you get by multiplying

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.677
A by the column vector x2.
This is just matrix

00:18:37.677 --> 00:18:41.771
multiplication.
That is the law of matrix

00:18:41.771 --> 00:18:45.763
multiplication.
That is how you multiply

00:18:45.763 --> 00:18:49.858
matrices.
Well, good, but where does this

00:18:49.858 --> 00:18:53.748
get us?
What does it mean for those two

00:18:53.748 --> 00:18:57.944
guys to be equal?
That is going to happen,

00:18:57.944 --> 00:19:02.039
if and only if x1 prime is
equal to A x1.

00:19:02.039 --> 00:19:09.000
This guy equals that guy.
And similarly for the x2's.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.128
The end result is that this
matrix, saying that the

00:19:18.128 --> 00:19:22.422
fundamental matrix satisfies
this matrix differential

00:19:22.422 --> 00:19:26.302
equation is only a way of
saying, in one breath,

00:19:26.302 --> 00:19:30.761
that its two columns are both
solutions to the original

00:19:30.761 --> 00:19:33.746
system.
It is, so to speak,

00:19:33.746 --> 00:19:38.618
an efficient way of turning
these two equations into a

00:19:38.618 --> 00:19:41.743
single equation by making a
matrix.

00:19:41.743 --> 00:19:46.155
I guess it is time,
finally, to come to the topic

00:19:46.155 --> 00:19:50.200
of the lecture.
I said the thing the matrices

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.532
were going to be used for is
solving inhomogeneous systems,

00:19:55.532 --> 00:20:00.955
so let's take a look at those.
I thought I would give you an

00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:05.000
example.
Inhomogeneous systems.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.709
Well, what is one going to look
like?

00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:17.075
So far what we have done is,
up until now has been solving,

00:20:17.075 --> 00:20:21.139
we spent essentially two weeks
solving and plotting the

00:20:21.139 --> 00:20:23.548
solutions to homogeneous
systems.

00:20:23.548 --> 00:20:27.537
There was nothing over there.
And homogeneous systems,

00:20:27.537 --> 00:20:31.000
in fact, with constant
coefficients.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.555
Stuff that looked like that
that we abbreviated with

00:20:34.555 --> 00:20:36.786
matrices.
Now, to make the system

00:20:36.786 --> 00:20:41.108
inhomogeneous what I do is add
the extra term on the right-hand

00:20:41.108 --> 00:20:43.408
side, which is some function of
t.

00:20:43.408 --> 00:20:47.591
Except, I will have to have two
functions of t because I have

00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:50.240
two equations.
Now it is inhomogeneous.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.492
And what makes it inhomogeneous
is the fact that these are not

00:20:54.492 --> 00:20:57.141
zero anymore.
There is something there.

00:20:57.141 --> 00:21:02.137
Functions of t are there.
These are given functions of t

00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:04.275
like exponentials,
polynomials,

00:21:04.275 --> 00:21:08.052
the usual stuff you have on the
right-hand side of the

00:21:08.052 --> 00:21:11.757
differential equation.
What is confusing here is that

00:21:11.757 --> 00:21:15.961
when we studied second order
equations it was homogeneous if

00:21:15.961 --> 00:21:20.237
the right-hand side was zero,
and if there was something else

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:23.159
there it was inhomogeneous.
Unfortunately,

00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:27.292
I have stuck this stuff on the
right-hand side so it is not

00:21:27.292 --> 00:21:32.032
quite so clear anymore.
It has got to look like that,

00:21:32.032 --> 00:21:34.485
in other words.
How would the matrix

00:21:34.485 --> 00:21:37.780
abbreviation look?
Well, the left-hand side is x

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.023
prime.
The homogenous part is ax,

00:21:40.023 --> 00:21:43.878
just as it has always been.
The only extra part is those

00:21:43.878 --> 00:21:46.682
functions r.
And this is a column vector,

00:21:46.682 --> 00:21:50.046
after the multiplication this
is a column vector,

00:21:50.046 --> 00:21:53.761
what is left is column vector.
Now, explicitly it is a

00:21:53.761 --> 00:21:56.845
function of t,
given by explicit functions of

00:21:56.845 --> 00:22:02.211
t, again, like exponentials.
Or, they could be fancy

00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:06.153
functions.
That is the thing we are trying

00:22:06.153 --> 00:22:10.000
to solve.
Why don't I put it up in green?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.653
Our new and better and improved
system.

00:22:13.653 --> 00:22:18.846
Think back to what we did when
we studied inhomogeneous

00:22:18.846 --> 00:22:22.115
equations.
We are not talking about

00:22:22.115 --> 00:22:25.384
systems but just a single
equation.

00:22:25.384 --> 00:22:30.000
What we did was the main
theorem --

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.500
I guess there are going to be
three theorems today,

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.490
not just two.
Theorem C.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:42.609
Is that right?
Yes, A, B.

00:22:42.609 --> 00:22:48.589
We are up to C.
Theorem C says that the general

00:22:48.589 --> 00:22:54.440
solution, that is,
the general solution to the

00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:00.420
system, is equal to the
complimentary function,

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:06.920
which is the general solution
to x prime equals Ax,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.578
--
-- the homogeneous equation,

00:23:11.578 --> 00:23:15.631
in other words,
plus, what am I going to call

00:23:15.631 --> 00:23:17.750
it?
(x)p, right you are,

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.447
a particular solution.
But the principle is the same

00:23:22.447 --> 00:23:25.578
and is proved exactly the same
way.

00:23:25.578 --> 00:23:30.000
It is just linearity and
superposition.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.071
The linearity of the original
system and the superposition

00:23:40.071 --> 00:23:43.451
principle.
The essence is that to solve

00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:48.256
this inhomogeneous system,
what we have to do is find a

00:23:48.256 --> 00:23:52.793
particular solution.
This part I already know how to

00:23:52.793 --> 00:23:55.818
do.
We have been doing that for two

00:23:55.818 --> 00:24:00.000
weeks.
The new thing is to find this.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.419
Now, if you remember back
before spring break,

00:24:08.419 --> 00:24:12.902
most of the work in solving the
second order equation was in

00:24:12.902 --> 00:24:15.334
finding that particular
solution.

00:24:15.334 --> 00:24:19.437
You quickly enough learned how
to solve the homogeneous

00:24:19.437 --> 00:24:24.224
equation, but there was no real
general method for finding this.

00:24:24.224 --> 00:24:28.632
We had an exponential input
theorem with some modifications

00:24:28.632 --> 00:24:32.307
to it.
We took a week's detour in

00:24:32.307 --> 00:24:37.544
Fourier series to see how to do
it for periodic functions or

00:24:37.544 --> 00:24:40.828
functions defined on finite
intervals.

00:24:40.828 --> 00:24:45.798
There were other techniques
which I did not get around to

00:24:45.798 --> 00:24:50.502
showing you, techniques
involving the so-called method

00:24:50.502 --> 00:24:55.828
of undetermined coefficients.
Although, some of you peaked in

00:24:55.828 --> 00:25:00.000
your book and learned it from
there.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.120
But the work is in finding
(x)p.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.246
The miracle that occurs here,
by contrast,

00:25:07.246 --> 00:25:11.675
is that it turns out to be easy
to find (x)p.

00:25:11.675 --> 00:25:17.714
And easy in this further sense
that I do not have to restrict

00:25:17.714 --> 00:25:21.639
the kind of function I use.
For example,

00:25:21.639 --> 00:25:26.068
the second homework problem I
have given you,

00:25:26.068 --> 00:25:31.000
the second part two homework
problem.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.575
You will see how to use
systems.

00:25:38.575 --> 00:25:42.065
For example,
to solve this simple equation,

00:25:42.065 --> 00:25:46.302
I will write it out for you,
consider that equation,

00:25:46.302 --> 00:25:50.456
tangent t.
What technique will you apply

00:25:50.456 --> 00:25:52.866
to solve that?
In other words,

00:25:52.866 --> 00:25:57.519
suppose you wanted to find a
particular solution to that.

00:25:57.519 --> 00:26:00.925
The right-hand side is not an
exponential.

00:26:00.925 --> 00:26:06.496
It is not a polynomial.
It is not like sine or cosine

00:26:06.496 --> 00:26:10.973
of bt.
I could use the Laplace

00:26:10.973 --> 00:26:14.417
transform.
No, because you don't know how

00:26:14.417 --> 00:26:19.238
to take the Laplace transform of
tangent t.

00:26:19.238 --> 00:26:21.821
Neither, for that matter,
do I.

00:26:21.821 --> 00:26:25.092
Fourier series.
Not a good choice for a

00:26:25.092 --> 00:26:30.000
function that goes to infinity
at pi over two.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.902
So you cannot do this until you
do your homework.

00:26:39.902 --> 00:26:44.497
Now you will be able to do it.
In other words,

00:26:44.497 --> 00:26:50.421
one of the big things is not
only will I give you a formula

00:26:50.421 --> 00:26:56.140
for the Xp but that formula will
work even for tangent t,

00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.946
any function at all.
Well, I thought I would try to

00:27:00.946 --> 00:27:04.904
put a little meat on the bones
of the inhomogeneous systems by

00:27:04.904 --> 00:27:08.862
actually giving you a physical
problem so we would actually be

00:27:08.862 --> 00:27:12.820
able to solve a physical problem
instead of just demonstrate a

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.000
solution method.
Here is a mixing problem.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.899
Just to illustrate what makes a
system of equations

00:27:27.899 --> 00:27:31.524
inhomogeneous,
here at two ugly tanks.

00:27:31.524 --> 00:27:37.207
I am not going to draw these
carefully, but they are both 1

00:27:37.207 --> 00:27:40.244
liter.
And they are connected by

00:27:40.244 --> 00:27:43.380
pipes.
And I won't bother opening

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.397
holes in them.
There is a pipe with fluids

00:27:47.397 --> 00:27:52.786
flowing back there and this
direction it is flowing this

00:27:52.786 --> 00:28:00.466
way, but that is not the end.
The end is there is stuff

00:28:00.466 --> 00:28:08.369
coming in to both of them.
And I think I will just make it

00:28:08.369 --> 00:28:15.579
coming out of this one.
There is something realistic.

00:28:15.579 --> 00:28:18.214
The numbers 2,
3, 2.

00:28:18.214 --> 00:28:25.424
Let's start there and see what
the others have to be.

00:28:25.424 --> 00:28:31.975
So these are flow rates.
One liter tanks.

00:28:31.975 --> 00:28:38.024
The flow rates are in,
let's say, liters per hour.

00:28:38.024 --> 00:28:42.716
And I have some dissolved
substance in,

00:28:42.716 --> 00:28:50.000
so here is going to be x salt
in there and the same chemical

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.049
in there, whatever it is.
x is the amount of salt,

00:28:56.049 --> 00:29:02.786
let's say, in tank one.
And y, the same thing in tank

00:29:02.786 --> 00:29:06.054
two.
Now, if you have stuff flowing

00:29:06.054 --> 00:29:09.993
unequally this way,
you must have balance.

00:29:09.993 --> 00:29:15.471
You have to make sure that
neither tank is getting emptied

00:29:15.471 --> 00:29:19.795
or bursting and exploding.
What is flowing in?

00:29:19.795 --> 00:29:22.582
What is x?
Three is going out,

00:29:22.582 --> 00:29:27.099
two is coming in,
so this has to be one in order

00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:32.000
that tank x stay full and not
explode.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.478
And how about y?
How much is going out?

00:29:35.478 --> 00:29:39.232
Two there and two here.
Four is going out,

00:29:39.232 --> 00:29:43.169
three is coming in.
This also has to be one.

00:29:43.169 --> 00:29:48.570
Those are just the flow rates
of water or the liquid that is

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.232
coming in.
Now, the only thing I am going

00:29:52.232 --> 00:29:58.000
to specify is the concentration
of what is coming in.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.885
Here the concentration is 5 e
to the minus t.

00:30:02.885 --> 00:30:07.000
And that is what makes the
problem inhomogeneous.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.599
Here the concentration is going
to be zero.

00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:14.371
In other words,
pure water is flowing in here

00:30:14.371 --> 00:30:18.914
to create the liquid balance.
Here, on the other hand,

00:30:18.914 --> 00:30:23.714
salt solution is flowing in but
with a steadily declining

00:30:23.714 --> 00:30:28.000
concentration.
So, what is the system?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.492
Well, you have set it up
exactly the way you did when you

00:30:34.492 --> 00:30:41.101
studied first order equations.
It is inflow minus outflow.

00:30:41.101 --> 00:30:46.434
What is the outflow?
The outflow is all in this

00:30:46.434 --> 00:30:50.376
pipe.
The flow rates are liters per

00:30:50.376 --> 00:30:54.318
hour.
Three liters per hour flowing

00:30:54.318 --> 00:30:57.449
out.
How much salt does that

00:30:57.449 --> 00:31:02.662
represent?
It is negative three times the

00:31:02.662 --> 00:31:06.568
concentration of salt.
But the concentration,

00:31:06.568 --> 00:31:10.207
notice, equals x divided 
by one.

00:31:10.207 --> 00:31:13.402
In other words,
x represents both the

00:31:13.402 --> 00:31:18.727
concentration and the amount.
So I don't have to distinguish.

00:31:18.727 --> 00:31:23.698
If I had made it two liter
tanks then I would have had to

00:31:23.698 --> 00:31:26.627
divide this by two.
I am cheating,

00:31:26.627 --> 00:31:32.195
but it is enough already.
x prime equals minus 3x.

00:31:32.195 --> 00:31:36.219
That is what is going out.
What is coming in?

00:31:36.219 --> 00:31:39.969
Well, 2y is coming in.
Concentration here.

00:31:39.969 --> 00:31:43.079
What is coming in?
Is it y 2 liter?

00:31:43.079 --> 00:31:46.646
Plus what is coming in from the
outside.

00:31:46.646 --> 00:31:51.310
We have to add that in,
and that will be plus 5 e to

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.969
the negative t.
How about y?

00:31:54.969 --> 00:32:00.000
y prime is changing.
What comes in from x?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.968
That is 3x.
What goes out?

00:32:01.968 --> 00:32:05.826
Well, two is leaving here and
two is leaving here.

00:32:05.826 --> 00:32:10.314
It doesn't matter that they are
going out through separate

00:32:10.314 --> 00:32:12.677
pipes.
They are both going out.

00:32:12.677 --> 00:32:14.409
It is minus 4,
2 and 2.

00:32:14.409 --> 00:32:16.929
How about the inhomogeneous
term?

00:32:16.929 --> 00:32:20.866
There is one coming in,
but there is no salt in it.

00:32:20.866 --> 00:32:23.307
Therefore, that is not
changing.

00:32:23.307 --> 00:32:27.952
What is coming through that
pipe is necessary for the liquid

00:32:27.952 --> 00:32:31.833
balance.
But it has no effect

00:32:31.833 --> 00:32:35.318
whatsoever.
I will put a zero here but,

00:32:35.318 --> 00:32:38.985
of course, you don't have to
put that in.

00:32:38.985 --> 00:32:42.194
This is now an inhomogeneous
system.

00:32:42.194 --> 00:32:46.137
In other words,
the system is x prime equals

00:32:46.137 --> 00:32:50.630
this matrix, negative 3,
the same sort of stuff we

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:55.306
always had, plus the
inhomogeneous term which is the

00:32:55.306 --> 00:33:00.166
column vector 5 e to the minus t
and zero.

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:04.242
It is the presence of this term

00:33:04.242 --> 00:33:06.847
that makes this system
inhomogeneous.

00:33:06.847 --> 00:33:11.333
And what that corresponds to is
this little closed system being

00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:15.529
attacked from the outside by
these external pipes which are

00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:17.772
bringing salt in.
Without those,

00:33:17.772 --> 00:33:20.666
of course the balance would be
all wrong.

00:33:20.666 --> 00:33:24.501
I would have to change this to
three and cut that out,

00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:27.105
I guess.
But then, it would be just a

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:32.318
simple homogenous system.
It is these pipes that make it

00:33:32.318 --> 00:33:35.564
inhomogeneous.
Now, I should start to solve

00:33:35.564 --> 00:33:38.192
that.
I did this just to illustrate

00:33:38.192 --> 00:33:42.133
where a system might come from.
Before I solve that,

00:33:42.133 --> 00:33:45.688
what I want to do is,
of course, is solve it in

00:33:45.688 --> 00:33:47.466
general.
In other words,

00:33:47.466 --> 00:33:49.939
how do you solve this in
general?

00:33:49.939 --> 00:33:54.730
Because I promised you that you
would be able to do in general,

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:58.981
regardless of what sort of
functions were in the r of t,

00:33:58.981 --> 00:34:03.000
that column vector.
So let's do it.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.562
First of all,
you have to learn the name of

00:34:15.562 --> 00:34:20.728
the method.
This method is for solving x

00:34:20.728 --> 00:34:26.556
prime equals Ax.
It is a method for finding a

00:34:26.556 --> 00:34:30.000
particular solution.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.965
Of course, to actually solve it
then you have to add the

00:34:39.965 --> 00:34:43.858
complimentary function.
We are looking for a particular

00:34:43.858 --> 00:34:47.680
solution for this system.
Now, the whole cleverness of

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:51.717
the method, which I think was
discovered a couple hundred

00:34:51.717 --> 00:34:53.952
years ago by,
I think, Lagrange,

00:34:53.952 --> 00:34:57.125
I am not sure.
The method is called variation

00:34:57.125 --> 00:35:00.911
of parameters.
I am giving you that so that

00:35:00.911 --> 00:35:05.213
when you forget you will be able
to look it up and be indexes to

00:35:05.213 --> 00:35:08.969
some advanced engineering
mathematics book or something,

00:35:08.969 --> 00:35:11.768
whatever is on your shelf.
But, if course,

00:35:11.768 --> 00:35:15.797
you won't remember the name
either so maybe this won't work.

00:35:15.797 --> 00:35:19.552
Variation of parameters,
I will explain to you why it is

00:35:19.552 --> 00:35:22.284
called that.
All the cleverness is in the

00:35:22.284 --> 00:35:25.425
very first line.
If you could remember the very

00:35:25.425 --> 00:35:30.000
first line then I trust you to
do the rest yourself.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.925
I don't know any motivation for
this first step,

00:35:34.925 --> 00:35:40.270
but mathematics is supposed to
be mysterious anyway.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:45.196
It keeps me eating.
It says, look for a solution

00:35:45.196 --> 00:35:49.703
and there will be one of the
following form.

00:35:49.703 --> 00:35:54.000
Now, it will look exactly like
--

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.720
Look carefully because it is
going to be gone in a moment.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.530
It will look exactly like this.
But, of course,

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:13.500
it cannot be this because this
solves the homogeneous system.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.634
If I plug this in with these as
constants it cannot possibly be

00:36:18.634 --> 00:36:23.521
a particular solution to this
because it will stop there and

00:36:23.521 --> 00:36:29.198
satisfy that with r equals zero.
The whole trick is you think of

00:36:29.198 --> 00:36:32.248
these are parameters which are
now variable.

00:36:32.248 --> 00:36:35.865
Constants that are varying.
That is why it is called

00:36:35.865 --> 00:36:38.914
variation of parameters.
You think of these,

00:36:38.914 --> 00:36:41.255
in other words,
as functions of t.

00:36:41.255 --> 00:36:45.085
We are going to look for a
solution which has the form,

00:36:45.085 --> 00:36:49.198
since they are functions of t,
I don't want to call them c1

00:36:49.198 --> 00:36:52.460
and c2 anymore.
I will call them v because that

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:57.000
is what most people call them,
v or u, sometimes.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.097
The method says look for a
solution of that form.

00:37:06.097 --> 00:37:10.707
The variation parameters,
these are the parameters that

00:37:10.707 --> 00:37:14.292
are now varying instead of being
constants.

00:37:14.292 --> 00:37:18.646
Now, if you take it in that
form and start trying to

00:37:18.646 --> 00:37:23.426
substitute into the equation you
are going to get a mess.

00:37:23.426 --> 00:37:28.719
I think I was wrong in saying I
could trust you from this point

00:37:28.719 --> 00:37:32.933
on.
I will take the first step from

00:37:32.933 --> 00:37:38.801
you, and then I could trust you
to do the rest after that first

00:37:38.801 --> 00:37:42.208
step.
The first step is to change the

00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:46.561
way this looks by using the
fundamental matrix.

00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:50.347
Remember what the fundamental
matrix was?

00:37:50.347 --> 00:37:54.605
Its entries were the two
columns of solutions.

00:37:54.605 --> 00:38:00.000
These are solutions to the
homogeneous system.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.210
And I am going to write it
using the fundamental matrix as,

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:09.343
now thinks about it.
The fundamental matrix has

00:38:09.343 --> 00:38:13.476
columns x1 and x2.
Your instinct might be using

00:38:13.476 --> 00:38:18.058
matrix multiplication to put the
v1 and the v2 here,

00:38:18.058 --> 00:38:23.000
but that won't work.
You have to put them here.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.093
This says the same thing as
that.

00:38:33.093 --> 00:38:37.056
Let's just take a second out to
calculate.

00:38:37.056 --> 00:38:40.536
The x is going to look like
(x1, y1).

00:38:40.536 --> 00:38:44.886
That is my first solution.
My second solution,

00:38:44.886 --> 00:38:49.043
here is the fundamental matrix,
is (x2, y2).

00:38:49.043 --> 00:38:53.393
And I am multiplying this on
the right by (v1,

00:38:53.393 --> 00:38:56.003
v2).
Does it come out right?

00:38:56.003 --> 00:38:59.000
Look.
What is it?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.713
The top is x1 v1 plus x2 v2.

00:39:02.713 --> 00:39:06.253
The top, x1 v1 plus x2 v2.

00:39:06.253 --> 00:39:10.225
It is in the wrong order,
but multiplication is

00:39:10.225 --> 00:39:14.715
commutative, fortunately.
And the same way the bottom

00:39:14.715 --> 00:39:18.688
thing will be v1 y1 plus v2 y2.

00:39:18.688 --> 00:39:22.573
If I had written it on the
other side instead,

00:39:22.573 --> 00:39:27.409
which is tempting because the
v's occur on the left here,

00:39:27.409 --> 00:39:31.375
that won't work.
What will I get?

00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:35.071
I will get v1 x1 plus v2 y1,

00:39:35.071 --> 00:39:37.736
which is not at all what I
want.

00:39:37.736 --> 00:39:42.636
You must put it on the right.
But this is a very important

00:39:42.636 --> 00:39:45.644
thing.
This is going to plague us on

00:39:45.644 --> 00:39:49.340
Monday, too.
It must be written on the right

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.607
and not on the left as a column
vector.

00:39:52.607 --> 00:39:55.873
The rest of the program is very
simple.

00:39:55.873 --> 00:40:00.000
I will write it out as a
program.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.221
Substitute into the system,
into that, in other words,

00:40:04.221 --> 00:40:08.362
and see what v has to be.
That is what we are looking

00:40:08.362 --> 00:40:11.150
for.
We know what the x1 and x2 are.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.893
It is a question of what those
coefficients are.

00:40:14.893 --> 00:40:18.000
And see what v is.
Let's do it.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.048
Let's substitute.
Let's see.

00:40:35.048 --> 00:40:41.145
The system is x prime equals Ax
plus r.

00:40:41.145 --> 00:40:46.338
I want to put in (x)p,
this proposed particular

00:40:46.338 --> 00:40:50.854
solution.
And it is a fundamental matrix,

00:40:50.854 --> 00:40:56.161
and the v is unknown.
How do I differentiate the

00:40:56.161 --> 00:41:02.742
product of two matrices?
You differentiate the product

00:41:02.742 --> 00:41:07.848
of two matrices using the
product rule that you learned

00:41:07.848 --> 00:41:10.873
the first day of 18.01.
Trust me.

00:41:10.873 --> 00:41:14.656
Let's do it.
I am going to substitute in.

00:41:14.656 --> 00:41:17.587
In other words,
here is my (x)p,

00:41:17.587 --> 00:41:21.842
(x)p, and I am going to write
in what that is.

00:41:21.842 --> 00:41:25.530
The left-hand side is the
derivative of,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.879
X prime times v,
plus X times the derivative of

00:41:29.879 --> 00:41:34.550
v.
Notice that one of these is a

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.009
column vector and the other is a
square matrix.

00:41:37.009 --> 00:41:39.843
That is perfectly Okay.
Any two matrices which are the

00:41:39.843 --> 00:41:42.196
rate shape so you can multiply
them together,

00:41:42.196 --> 00:41:44.441
if you want to differentiate
their product,

00:41:44.441 --> 00:41:46.900
in other words,
if the entries are functions of

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.734
t it is the product rule.
The derivative of this times

00:41:49.734 --> 00:41:52.033
time plus that times the
derivative of this.

00:41:52.033 --> 00:41:54.172
You have to keep them in the
right order.

00:41:54.172 --> 00:41:57.005
You are not allowed to shuffle
them around carelessly.

00:41:57.005 --> 00:42:00.000
So that is that.
What is it equal to?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:08.305
Well, the right-hand side is A.
And now I substitute just (x)p

00:42:08.305 --> 00:42:14.976
in, so that is X times v plus r.
Is this progress?

00:42:14.976 --> 00:42:20.422
What is v?
It looks like a mess but it is

00:42:20.422 --> 00:42:22.056
not.
Why not?

00:42:22.056 --> 00:42:29.000
It is because this is not any
old matrix X.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.377
This is a matrix whose columns
are solutions to the system.

00:42:34.377 --> 00:42:39.013
And what does that do?
That means X prime satisfies

00:42:39.013 --> 00:42:42.072
that matrix differential
equation.

00:42:42.072 --> 00:42:45.503
X prime is the same as Ax.

00:42:45.503 --> 00:42:50.602
And, by a little miracle,
the v is tagging along in both

00:42:50.602 --> 00:42:54.033
cases.
This cancels that and now there

00:42:54.033 --> 00:42:58.346
is very little left.
The conclusion,

00:42:58.346 --> 00:43:02.474
therefore, is that Xv is equal
to r.

00:43:02.474 --> 00:43:05.794
What is v?
It is v that we are looking

00:43:05.794 --> 00:43:09.115
for, right?
You have to solve a matrix

00:43:09.115 --> 00:43:13.064
equation, now.
This is a square matrix so you

00:43:13.064 --> 00:43:16.384
have to do it by inverting the
matrix.

00:43:16.384 --> 00:43:21.769
You don't just sloppily divide.
You multiply on which side by

00:43:21.769 --> 00:43:25.000
what matrix?
Choice of left or right.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.935
You multiply by the inverse
matrix on the left or on the

00:43:29.935 --> 00:43:35.317
right?
It has to be on the left.

00:43:35.317 --> 00:43:42.483
Multiply both sides of the
equation by X inverse on the

00:43:42.483 --> 00:43:50.180
left, and then you will get v is
equal to X inverse r.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:55.222
How do I know the X inverse

00:43:55.222 --> 00:44:00.000
exists?
Does X inverse exist?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.863
For a matrix inverse to exist,
the matrix's determinant must

00:44:05.863 --> 00:44:10.037
be not zero.
Why is the determinant of this

00:44:10.037 --> 00:44:13.217
not zero?
Because its columns are

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:16.000
independent solutions.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Of course this is not right.
I forgot the prime here.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.970
I am not failing this course
after all.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:38.000
v prime equals that.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.802
This is done by differentiating
each entry in the column vector.

00:44:47.802 --> 00:44:50.699
And, therefore,
we should integrate it.

00:44:50.699 --> 00:44:53.825
It will be the integral,
just the ordinary

00:44:53.825 --> 00:44:57.560
anti-derivative of x inverse
times r.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.254
This is a column vector.
The entries are functions of t.

00:45:02.254 --> 00:45:06.036
You simply integrate each of
those functions in turn.

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:08.000
So integrate each entry.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.562
There is my v.
Sorry, you cannot tell the v's

00:45:19.562 --> 00:45:25.406
from the r's here.
And so, finally,

00:45:25.406 --> 00:45:34.000
the particular solution is (x)p
is equal to --

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.367
It is really not bad at all.
It is equal to X times v.

00:45:37.367 --> 00:45:40.861
It's equal to X times the
integral of X inverse r dt.

00:45:40.861 --> 00:45:43.529
Now, actually,

00:45:43.529 --> 00:45:45.816
there is not much work to doing
that.

00:45:45.816 --> 00:45:49.183
Once you have solved the
homogeneous system and gotten

00:45:49.183 --> 00:45:52.105
the fundamental matrix,
taking the inverse of a

00:45:52.105 --> 00:45:54.329
two-by-two matrix is almost
trivial.

00:45:54.329 --> 00:45:57.823
You flip those two and you
change the signs of these two

00:45:57.823 --> 00:46:01.000
and you divide by the
determinant.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.559
You multiply it by r.
And the hard part is if you can

00:46:04.559 --> 00:46:07.640
do the integration.
If not, you just leave the

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.542
integral sign the way you have
learned to do in this silly

00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:14.007
course and you still have the
answer.

00:46:14.007 --> 00:46:17.293
What about the arbitrary
constant of integration?

00:46:17.293 --> 00:46:20.100
The answer is you don't need to
put it in.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.359
Just find one particular
solution.

00:46:22.359 --> 00:46:25.508
It is good enough.
You don't have to put in the

00:46:25.508 --> 00:46:29.000
arbitrary constants of
integration.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.016
Because they are already in the
complimentary function here.

00:46:33.016 --> 00:46:35.534
Therefore, you don't have to
add them.

00:46:35.534 --> 00:46:39.278
I am sorry I didn't get a
chance to actually solve that.

00:46:39.278 --> 00:46:42.954
I will have to let it go.
The recitations will do it on

00:46:42.954 --> 00:46:45.881
Tuesday, will solve that
particular problem,

00:46:45.881 --> 00:46:47.947
which means you will,
in effect.
