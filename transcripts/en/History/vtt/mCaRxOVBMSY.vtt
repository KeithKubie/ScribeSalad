00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.127
[music playing]

00:00:02.127 --> 00:00:04.379
No one has seen her.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:07.674
If she's still alive,
she has vanished.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.385
MAN 1: Here is the
treaty giving you

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:12.679
all the lands that constitute
the ancient kingdom

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.055
of East Anglia.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.350
These lands I grant you
in perpetuity, to settle

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.227
and to farm as you see fit.

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.603
MAN 2: Look, Bjorn.

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:22.480
Look at this treasure.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.567
That is not the end
of our business today.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.111
Guards, arrest the traitors.

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:29.988
[shouting]

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:30.905
[grunting]

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.782
No, no, I'm innocent.

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:34.617
MAN 1: He saved my life.

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:39.748
He was implicated.
You have--

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:41.332
I've already decided
to forgive him.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:49.132
If you won't talk
to him, please give

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.676
me your permission to do so.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:58.475
I need to know why, so
perhaps I can forgive him.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.642
MAN 3: Is this a god?

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.519
No God.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.938
That is the Buddha.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.483
Who is the Buddha?

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.401
[laughter]

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.738
MAN 4: It seems to me that
you are conflicted, Peter.

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:13.990
There's no
contradiction because it's

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.701
possible that everything
is part of the one.

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.620
You know, I've often
wondered whether you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.623
weren't a little crazy.

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:23.500
I'm crazy?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.044
Just like Margrethe.

00:01:26.044 --> 00:01:28.213
You know what happened to her.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:30.632
MAGGIE: What was that?

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:32.300
WOMAN 1: Maggie.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.553
MAN 5: Why did you travel
all this way in such weather?

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:38.807
Everyone is dying.

00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:41.559
There is so little food
and everyone is sick.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:43.478
I know we don't deserve
to be saved, but please,

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.940
Floki, go and save my family.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.025
My father has learned a lesson.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:50.610
He has changed.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.156
They killed your son and
they killed your daughter.

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:58.034
I'm going to leave the
decision to you, Kjetill.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:03.456
If Helgi says his father has
changed, then I believe him.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.583
MAN 6: Why do you
want to see me?

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:12.048
Lord Cyneheard
confessed everything.

00:02:12.048 --> 00:02:13.758
It's true.

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.594
They wanted to stage a coup
just before we left for battle.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.304
They wanted me to
give the signal.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.264
I refused.

00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:21.432
Then you are involved.

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:24.853
I will never, ever
betray him again.

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.271
Stand aside!

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.689
Out of the way!

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.066
[horse whinnying]

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:33.236
My lady, it's the king.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.071
WOMAN 2: Go and
fetch the physicians.

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:36.364
MAN 7: What is wrong with him?

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.616
No one really knows.

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:39.868
Then he is weak.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:41.077
We need to know the truth.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.746
We cannot afford a sick king.

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:46.207
Alfred has suffered
these attacks before

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:49.752
and has always survived.

00:02:49.752 --> 00:02:51.546
You must have faith.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.673
Aethelred is very popular.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.592
Yes.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.302
What is it you say to these men?

00:02:57.302 --> 00:03:02.015
I say to them what
I have a mind to say.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.017
Don't interfere, mother.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.978
I don't belong here.

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:08.938
I want to take Kattegat
back from Ivar.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:10.481
You have no army.

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.942
MAN 8: But King Harald has.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.069
Brother.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.531
We shall attack
Kattegat altogether.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.952
I have just received
some very interesting news.

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:26.539
It seems King Harald
was defeated in Wessex

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.541
by the new King Alfred.

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.251
It seems to me
that now it is time

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:32.462
for us to return to England.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.255
Harald has learned his lesson.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.007
He cannot win without me.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:41.137
I don't believe you have ever
accepted your brother as king.

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.431
I don't think you ever would.

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.475
What have you done?

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:48.394
WOMAN 3: You would always
be a danger to him.

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:50.772
So you've poisoned me?

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.775
What kind of mother are you?

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:54.651
[grunts]

00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.904
