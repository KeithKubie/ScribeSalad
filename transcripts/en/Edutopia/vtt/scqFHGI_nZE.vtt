00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:06.436
&gt;&gt;Daniel Goleman: One of the
ways that children can learn

00:00:06.436 --> 00:00:09.706
to focus better and strengthen
their attention skills,

00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:11.406
particularly for concentration

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:13.866
in school is something
I saw demonstrated

00:00:14.406 --> 00:00:17.886
in a second grade classroom
in a public school

00:00:17.886 --> 00:00:21.786
in Manhattan Spanish Harlem,
which is a very impoverished area

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:22.586
of New York City.

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.286
Kids there live in
the housing projects

00:00:25.286 --> 00:00:26.966
and they have very tough lives.

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:31.916
I was astonished because the
classroom atmosphere was very calm,

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.406
very focused.

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:35.906
Kids were very alert, very
attentive to the teacher.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:37.596
What's the secret here, I wondered.

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:39.316
Then I realized why it was.

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:42.936
The teacher said every day we do an
exercise called "Breathing Buddies."

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:45.376
One by one the children
go to their cubby

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:47.676
and get their favorite
little stuffed animal.

00:00:47.936 --> 00:00:51.456
Then they find a place on the floor
to lie down, they put that animal

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:55.726
on their tummy and watch their breath
go up, counting one, two, three,

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:58.926
and watch it go down, one,
two, three, up one, two,

00:00:58.986 --> 00:01:00.576
three, down, one, two, three.

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:04.276
That is training of the
attentional circuitry.

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:08.756
This is the kind of training which
helps children not just focus

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:10.386
on what the teacher is saying,

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:14.096
but it turns out that same
circuitry helps them manage their

00:01:14.096 --> 00:01:15.346
distressing emotions.

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:18.186
So they're getting a "two-for"
they're getting attention training

00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:21.586
and self management training,
inner self management training.

00:01:21.586 --> 00:01:24.096
Something as simple as
just watching your breath

00:01:25.016 --> 00:01:28.856
and bringing your mind back when
it wanders is that basic repetition

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:30.906
of the muscle for focusing.
