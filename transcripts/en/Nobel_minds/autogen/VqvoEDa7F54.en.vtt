red and green as we saw here and they

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620
red and green as we saw here and they
 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.070
red and green as we saw here and they
have not only the advantage of it but

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080
have not only the advantage of it but
 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.410
have not only the advantage of it but
much better using the electrical energy

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420
much better using the electrical energy
 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.440
much better using the electrical energy
they also give a very much longer life

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450
they also give a very much longer life
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.930
they also give a very much longer life
time maybe a hundred times longer than
