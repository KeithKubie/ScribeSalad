00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:04.632
- [Voiceover] Let's solve
240 divided by three.

00:00:05.782 --> 00:00:10.012
To solve this, we could take
this large three-digit number

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:12.605
and divide it by a one-digit number,

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:15.678
or we could take what we know about 10s,

00:00:15.678 --> 00:00:19.590
about zeroes and 10s, and try
to break this up into numbers

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.926
that might be easier for us to work with.

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:26.176
So 240, because of the zero on the end,

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.459
I know is the same as 24 10s,

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:31.292
or 24

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:33.989
times 10.

00:00:35.587 --> 00:00:39.669
24 times 10, any time we multiply by 10,

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:43.243
will have the original
number, 24 in this case,

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.576
with a zero on the end, 240.

00:00:47.195 --> 00:00:49.612
So 240 is the same as 24 10s,

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:52.624
or 10 times 24.

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:57.729
So we can come back over here
and write this number 240

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:58.979
as 24 times 10,

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.156
and then still have the
divided by three at the end.

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:11.546
So what we changed was we
changed 240, or 24 10s,

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:13.889
to be 24 times 10.

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:19.113
What we did not change is the solution.

00:01:19.113 --> 00:01:21.340
These expressions are still equal,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.384
they equal the same number,

00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:28.190
so we can solve either one
to get the same solution.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.595
And down here, we have a
little bit simpler of numbers

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:34.641
to work with, so I'll work
with this one down here.

00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:36.309
The next thing I'm
gonna do is look at this

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:39.744
multiplication problem, 24 times 10,

00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:42.066
and I know that in
multiplication, I can multiply

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.149
in any order.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:47.463
For example, if I have something like

00:01:47.463 --> 00:01:50.175
two times three, which is six,

00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:54.336
that's the same as three
times two, which is also six.

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:56.624
Two threes or three twos is six,

00:01:56.624 --> 00:02:00.345
we can change the order
without changing the answer.

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:03.330
So over here, let's do that.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.247
10 times 24

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.767
divided by three.

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:12.132
So we've changed the expression,

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.504
we've changed what's written
here, but we have not changed

00:02:14.504 --> 00:02:18.011
what it equals, we have
not changed the solution.

00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:20.585
And now I can see a division
problem that, for me,

00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:23.829
is far simpler than this big
three-digit division problem

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.340
up here.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.757
24 divided into groups of three is eight,

00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:34.253
that's eight, and then we'll
bring down our times 10,

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:38.176
bringing down this 10 and the times sign,

00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:40.144
and then we can use the
pattern we already know

00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:42.438
that we talked about up here.

00:02:42.438 --> 00:02:45.112
When we multiply by 10,
we take our whole number,

00:02:45.112 --> 00:02:46.949
in this case eight,

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:49.949
and we add a zero to the end, or 80.

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.103
So our solution, we came up with 80,

00:02:56.103 --> 00:02:58.594
which means our solution
to the original expression

00:02:58.594 --> 00:02:59.511
is also 80.

00:03:01.727 --> 00:03:03.394
240 divided by three

00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:07.350
is eight 10s, or 80.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.861
One other way we could've
thought about this

00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:14.993
is 240, as we've already said,

00:03:14.993 --> 00:03:15.826
is 24 10s.

00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:21.604
If we divide 24 10s by three,

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:24.967
we end up with eight 10s,

00:03:27.114 --> 00:03:29.531
and eight 10s is equal to 80.

00:03:31.316 --> 00:03:34.613
If we have eight 10s, that equals 80.

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:37.468
So this is one other way that
we could've thought about it,

00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:41.650
both ways using the zero
or our knowledge of 10s

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.877
to break this division problem down

00:03:43.877 --> 00:03:47.138
so we didn't have to deal with
a large three-digit number

00:03:47.138 --> 00:03:50.888
but could deal with
simpler, smaller numbers.

00:03:52.178 --> 00:03:54.451
Let's try another one, this
time let's do thousands,

00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:55.607
let's make this one trickier.

00:03:55.607 --> 00:03:58.364
What about something like

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:00.114
42 hundred, or 4,200,

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:07.868
divided by, and let's
see, how about seven,

00:04:09.021 --> 00:04:10.438
divided by seven.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.610
So here, again we can
break this number down.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.527
42 hundred, this number 42 hundred,

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:20.509
or 4,200,

00:04:21.775 --> 00:04:23.442
can be written as 42

00:04:25.696 --> 00:04:28.946
times 100, because our pattern tells us

00:04:30.516 --> 00:04:34.111
when we have a number, like
a whole number like 42,

00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:38.938
and we multiply by 100, we
keep our whole number of 42

00:04:38.938 --> 00:04:41.105
and we add two zeroes now.

00:04:42.932 --> 00:04:45.972
So 42 times 100, and then
we still need to have

00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:49.292
our divided by seven at the end.

00:04:49.292 --> 00:04:52.510
Reverse these numbers so
that 42 and seven can be next

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.677
to each other,

00:04:54.778 --> 00:04:58.316
42 divided by seven, because
that's a division problem,

00:04:58.316 --> 00:05:00.926
a division factor we might already know.

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:04.176
42 divided into groups of seven is six,

00:05:05.603 --> 00:05:08.021
and bring down the 100 and the times sign,

00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:09.104
100 times six

00:05:10.058 --> 00:05:10.891
is 600.

00:05:13.906 --> 00:05:16.063
So our solution, going back up here

00:05:16.063 --> 00:05:18.230
to 4,200 divided by seven,

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.982
is 600.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.826
Or we could've thought about it again,

00:05:23.826 --> 00:05:26.359
still thinking about place
value but using words here

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:29.692
instead of digits, 4,200 is 42 hundreds,

00:05:32.382 --> 00:05:35.549
42, I can write that out, 42 hundreds,

00:05:38.207 --> 00:05:41.887
and if you divide 42
hundreds into groups of seven

00:05:41.887 --> 00:05:46.587
or into seven groups, each
group will have six hundreds,

00:05:46.587 --> 00:05:47.670
or 600 in it.

00:05:50.536 --> 00:05:54.619
So either way, 42 hundred,
4,200 divided by seven

00:05:56.153 --> 00:05:56.986
is 600.

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.754
So here again, we were able
to solve a tricky problem,

00:06:01.754 --> 00:06:04.039
one that had a four-digit number,

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.248
without using any long division,

00:06:06.248 --> 00:06:08.982
but instead using what
we know about place value

00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:10.899
or hundreds and zeroes.
