Hey astronomers, Phil Plait here. In our last
episode, I talked about galaxies: vast collections

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.629
of gas, dust, and upwards of hundreds of billions
of stars. We live in one, the Milky Way, a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:21.520
gigantic disk galaxy with sprawling spiral arms.
Other galaxies are elliptical, or irregular, or peculiar.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.120
But those are classifications based on shape.
We also classify galaxies on their behavior,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.029
and sometimes even on their location and mass!
To understand why, we have to take a step

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.109
back, and look at the environments in which
galaxies sometimes find themselves.

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.889
And if you thought galaxies were big and powerful,
well…I’m about to crush your brain again.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.980
In the 1960s, a peculiar object was found.
Called 3C273, through optical telescopes it

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.140
looked like an unassuming blue star, but through
a radio telescope it was seen to be ablaze

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.480
with light, a luminous powerhouse. Stars didn’t blast
out that much radio radiation, so this was baffling.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.320
The mystery deepened when spectra of 3C273
were taken. It wasn’t a star, it was an

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.220
entire galaxy, and not just any galaxy, but
one very, very far away: Well over 2 billion

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.000
light years. Far from being some dim thing,
3C273 revealed itself to be the most luminous

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.280
object in the Universe ever seen at that time. It blasts
out over 4 trillion times the energy the Sun does.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.080
And yet it appears star-like, a mere dot in
the sky. Because of this, it was dubbed a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.850
“quasi-stellar radio source”, which is
pretty underwhelming for the most powerful

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.360
energy source in the entire cosmos! Happily,
the name was shortened to quasar, which, you’ll

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.310
admit, is way cooler.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.200
Once 3C273 became known, lots more such objects
were found. With the advent of X-ray observatories

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.600
launched into space even more energetic point
sources were found, which is amazing. X-rays

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.979
are a very high-energy flavor of light, and
it takes a lot of power to make them. Eventually,

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.360
galaxies like these were even found to be blasting out
gamma rays, the very highest energy kind of light.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.440
Clearly, these were no regular galaxies. Astronomers
gave them the generic name “active galaxies,”

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.760
and classified them into various subcategories
depending on how they emitted their light,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.260
and what kind of spectra they had.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.010
But what could power these immensely energetic
galaxies? It turns out, to create that kind

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.730
of energy, you need to have an object with
a lot of gravity. And what kind of object

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.520
has a lot of gravity?

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.650
[evil chuckle]

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.060
In the 1980s, astronomers were getting suspicious
that all large galaxies had very massive black

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.080
holes in their cores. In fact, one of the
reasons the Hubble Space Telescope was built

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.810
and launched was to explore this idea, and
characterize – that is, find out as much

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.069
as it could about - these black holes.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.790
Over time, we’ve found this idea is absolutely
correct. Every big galaxy we see appears to

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.480
have a huge black hole in its heart. Even
the smallest is a monster, with millions of

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.980
times the Sun’s mass, and some tip the cosmic
scale at billions of solar masses.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.940
We now think that these supermassive black
holes form at the same time galaxies do. As

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.160
the material coalesces to create a galaxy,
some falls to the center and feeds the black

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.970
hole there; it grows as its host galaxy does.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.440
But I can hear you thinking, “Hey, Phil,
don’t black holes suck down everything,

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.090
even light itself? How could they power active
galaxies, the brightest objects in the Universe?”

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.760
Ah, you can’t escape from a black hole once
you fall all the way in. Just outside the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.560
black hole’s event horizon things can still
get out.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.980
If a black hole is sitting all by its lonesome
out in space, it’s, well, black. But if

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.120
matter, like gas, dust, or even whole stars,
falls into the black hole, it can be shredded

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.319
by the fierce gravity. This material forms
a flat disk called an accretion disk, the

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.239
matter swirling madly at ferocious speeds
before falling in like water down a bathtub

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:03.540
drain.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.769
Stuff closer to the black hole orbits faster
than stuff farther out. This means material

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.120
in the disk rubs together, and heats up, just
like rubbing your hands on a cold day warms

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.759
them up via friction. But around a black hole
the orbital speeds are near the speed of light.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.619
Try rubbing your hands together at a couple
of hundred thousand kilometers per second

00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:23.279
and see how much heat you make.

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:28.559
So friction and other forces heat the material
falling in to millions of degrees, so hot

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:33.199
that it blasts out light across the electromagnetic
spectrum. And that’s what powers active

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.479
galaxies! The black hole is the energy source,
but the matter falling into it is the actual

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:44.619
light bulb. Active galaxies are so bright
they can be seen clear across the Universe.

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:49.569
Not only that, but some active galaxies have
jets: Magnetic fields coupled with the incredible

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:54.029
rotation of the accretion disks can launch
twin beams of matter and energy directly away

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:59.589
from the black hole, along the poles of the
disk. These beams pack a huge wallop, travelling

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:03.979
for hundreds of thousands of light years.
Eventually they slow down as they ram through

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.860
the thin material between galaxies, but when
they do they puff up, looking like huge cotton

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.339
swabs which glow in radio waves.

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.860
Active galaxies can look pretty different
from each other, and we now think that’s

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.499
due to our viewing angle on their accretion
disk. When we see it edge-on the thick dust

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:24.599
in the disk blocks the intense highest-energy
light, but we do see lots of infrared as the

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.099
radiation from the disk heats up clouds of
dust around it. If the accretion disk is tipped

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.110
a bit to out line of sight we see more optical
and high energy light from it. And if the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.710
poles are aimed right at us, all that ridiculously
energetic X- and gamma ray light can be seen.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.520
The Milky Way has a supermassive black hole
in its heart too, with a mass of over 4 million

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.939
times the Sun’s. That might sound huge,
but remember the galaxy has hundreds of billions

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.800
of stars in it. The black hole is only a teeny
tiny fraction of the total mass of the Milky

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.240
Way.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.179
Our black hole is quiescent, that is, not
actively feeding, so we’re not an active

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:03.219
galaxy. Every now and again we’ll see a
flare from it as it swallows down a gas cloud

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:07.770
or something like that, but nowhere near what’s
needed to switch it fully on. Happily, we

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.300
appear to be safe from any tantrums it might
throw.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.949
But that may not always be the case. One way
to flip such a black hole from milquetoast

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:19.830
to monster is through galactic collisions.
When two galaxies collide, a lot of gas can

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.909
be dumped into their centers where it can
be gobbled down and heated up. We do see a

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.289
lot of evidence that active galaxies are disturbed,
as if they recently collided.

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.199
So, could that happen to us?

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:36.389
Yes. Yes, it can. In fact, it will. But not
for a few billion more years.

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:42.199
To understand that, we have to take a small
step back. Well, actually a huge step back:

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:45.939
A few million light years, and take a look
at where galaxies live.

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:51.119
Our Milky Way isn’t alone. It’s part of
a small knot of galaxies we call — in long,

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:55.830
boring astronomical nomenclature tradition
— the Local Group. It consists of a few

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.569
dozen galaxies, most of which are small and
dim; so faint that we’re still discovering

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:06.270
them! Two galaxies completely overpower the
group: the Milky Way, and the Andromeda Galaxy.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.270
The Local Group is elongated, almost dumbbell
shaped, with the Milky Way on one side and

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.659
Andromeda on the other.

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:17.289
In the past, the Local Group probably had
lots more galaxies, but over the eons the

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:23.529
two big galaxies ate them all, growing huge.
Andromeda is bigger than we are, and has more

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:26.719
stars, but honestly we’re both pretty big
as galaxies go.

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:28.629
And, someday, we’ll be bigger.

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:33.469
The Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million
light years away — close enough that it

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:38.300
can be seen by the naked eye on dark nights,
the most distant object easily seen without

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:43.539
aid. Spectra taken of Andromeda reveal an
interesting fact: It’s headed right for

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:43.830
us.

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.909
Its spectrum is blue shifted, meaning it’s
approaching us, and it’s doing so at quite

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:55.050
a clip: about 100 km/sec. That’s fast, but
2.5 million light years is a long way. The

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.659
collision is inevitable, but it won’t happen
for several billion years.

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:03.709
When it does, but galaxies will stretch out
due to galactic tides, forming long curving

00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:07.689
streamers of stars. They may pass by each
other during the first pass, but over the

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:12.360
next few hundred million years they’ll slow,
fall back toward each other, and merge. They’ll

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.289
then form one, much larger galaxy, probably
an elliptical, which astronomers have called

00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:17.919
“Milkomeda.”

00:08:17.919 --> 00:08:23.050
I know, that’s awful. But if you can come
up with a better name, let us know.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:27.719
Anyway, although this won’t happen for billions
of years, that’s still long before the Sun

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:32.260
dies. The Earth may still be around when the
galaxies collide! It’s not clear what will

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.860
happen to us; the Sun may continue to lazily
orbit the core of the new galaxy, or it may

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.539
move farther in toward the center or farther
out in the galactic suburbs.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:45.540
And here’s another fun fact: Andromeda has
a gigantic black hole in its core, too, which

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:51.190
has 40 million solar masses, ten times the
mass of ours. When the galaxies merge, the

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:56.269
two monsters will probably go into orbit around
one another. Not only that, but any gas and

00:08:56.269 --> 00:09:00.889
dust left over from star formation during
the collision may fall toward the center of

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:04.930
Milkomeda, where the two black holes will
gobble them down, and may turn the galaxy

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.600
into an active one! Hopefully, any death rays
launched from that will miss Earth.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.680
But that won’t happen for like four billion
years anyway. I’m not too concerned over

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.350
the fate of the Earth at that point.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:20.529
I feel that right now is a good time to give
you a heads-up: we’re about to take a very,

00:09:20.529 --> 00:09:25.680
very big step. Up to this point in the series
we’ve talked about some pretty big distances:

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.160
millions or billions of kilometers to the
planets, trillions of kilometers to the stars,

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:35.230
and then jumping to thousands of light years
– quadrillions or quintillion of kilometers!

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.149
- when talking about the galaxy itself.

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:42.440
But those distances are as nothing when you
start talking about intergalactic trips. We’re

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.690
about to venture out into the greater Universe,
and things are about to get very large.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.690
When we step outside our Milky Way, we find
that a few galaxies have clumped together

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:56.310
to form The Local Group. But as we look farther
out into the Universe we see that galaxies

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:01.050
tend to clump together on larger scales as
well. Many are in small groups like ours,

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.939
but sometimes they aggregate into much larger
galaxy clusters.

00:10:04.939 --> 00:10:09.910
A typical galaxy cluster is a few tens of
millions light years across, and can contain

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.389
thousand of galaxies. The nearest one to us
is the Virgo cluster, located about 50 million

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:19.220
light years away in the direction of the constellation
Virgo. It has well over a thousand galaxies

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:24.089
in it, maybe twice that much. It may have
as many as a quadrillion stars in it!

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:29.040
Like star clusters, galaxies in galaxy clusters
are bound to the cluster by their own mutual

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.350
gravity, and move through the cluster on long
orbits that can take billions of years to

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.399
complete.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:39.079
Thousands of clusters are known, and they
contain every kind of galaxy imaginable. Spirals,

00:10:39.079 --> 00:10:44.160
ellipticals, irregulars, peculiars, active
galaxies… in many clusters, a huge elliptical

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.399
galaxy sits right at the very center. This
is probably the result of collisions between

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:52.149
smaller galaxies; when they smack into each
other their velocities through the cluster

00:10:52.149 --> 00:10:56.189
tend to cancel out (like two cars hitting
head-on and stopping), so they fall to the

00:10:56.189 --> 00:11:00.529
center. As more mass falls to the center,
the galaxy there grows huge.

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:05.160
As mind-boggling as all this is, we’re not
done. Surveys of the sky have revealed that

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.310
not only do galaxies clump together in clusters,
but clusters themselves fall into even bigger

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:15.389
groups called superclusters! A supercluster
usually has several dozen clusters making

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:19.240
it up, and are hundreds of millions of light
years across.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:24.220
Our Local Group is near the Virgo Cluster,
and both are part of the Virgo Supercluster.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.949
Recent observations indicate the Virgo Supercluster
is actually only an appendage of the even

00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:35.670
larger Laniakea Supercluster, which may have
100,000 galaxies in it stretching across 500

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.300
million light years. This new result is a
bit controversial — I mean, it’s hard

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.750
to know exactly how big such a structure is,
especially when we’re inside it — but

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:49.290
it gives you an idea of the vast sizes and
distances we’re talking about here.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.720
Superclusters themselves aren’t just randomly
distributed through the Universe either; they

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:58.160
appear to fall along tremendously long interconnected
and intersecting filaments, making the Universe

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.519
appear almost foamy on the biggest scales,
like a sponge. In between the filaments are

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:06.350
vast regions relatively empty of galaxies,
called voids.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:11.350
This cosmic large scale structure — its
size, shape, distribution of matter, and more

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:17.019
— holds clues to some of the biggest questions
we can ask: What is the Universe made of?

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:20.319
How did it start? What is its eventual fate?

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:25.209
These are questions we’ll get to in future
episodes very soon, and I promise you they’ll

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:28.149
stretch your mind like nothing you’ve ever
encountered before.

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:31.689
But before we wrap up, there’s one more
thing I want you to see.

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:36.279
When you look at all these pictures of galaxies,
of clusters, of superclusters, a question

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:39.889
pops up: How many galaxies are there? Can
we count them all?

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:45.079
To help answer that question, back in the
1990s astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:49.139
They pointed it toward the emptiest part of
the sky they could: a spot with little or

00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:54.389
no stars, nebulae, or galaxies in it. They
then let it stare, simply collecting light

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:59.040
from whatever it could see, letting light
accumulate until incredibly faint objects

00:12:59.040 --> 00:12:59.970
could be detected.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.149
And what did it find?

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:07.740
Wonder. Pure, simple, wonder. Oh, yeah, and
thousands of galaxies.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.389
This is the Hubble Deep Field. Mind you, the
area of sky you see here is roughly the same

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:17.319
as the apparent size of a grain of sand held
in your palm with your arm outstretched. And

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:22.230
yet in that tiny section of sky there are
thousands of galaxies. Essentially everything

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:27.569
you see in that image is a galaxy, a huge
collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars!

00:13:27.569 --> 00:13:32.230
The deep field was repeated in different parts
of the sky, and the result was always the

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:38.240
same. Crowds of galaxies, jostling for position,
crammed together even in a tiny slice of the

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.730
heavens.

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.089
You can count all the galaxies in these deep
fields, and then use them to extrapolate to

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:47.579
the entire sky, giving you the total number
of galaxies in the Universe.

00:13:47.579 --> 00:13:52.879
And what do you get? Well, give or take – a
hundred billion galaxies.

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:57.339
A hundred. Billion. And each with billions
of stars.

00:13:57.339 --> 00:14:03.100
The Universe is mind-crushingly huge. And
yet here we are, a part of it, learning more

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.600
about it all the time.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.230
It’s easy to think the Universe is too big
to comprehend, and makes us seem tiny and

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:15.870
insignificant in comparison. To me, the opposite
is true: It’s our curiosity about this enormous

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:21.740
cosmos that makes us significant. We yearn
to learn more, to seek out knowledge. That

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.910
doesn’t make us small. It makes us vast.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.600
Today you learned that active galaxies pour
out lots of energy, due to their central supermassive

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.829
black holes gobbling down matter. Galaxies
tend not to be loners, but instead exist in

00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:39.730
smaller groups and larger clusters. Our Milky
Way is part of the Local Group, and will one

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:45.589
day collide with the Andromeda galaxy. Clusters
of galaxies also clump together to form superclusters,

00:14:45.589 --> 00:14:50.410
the largest structures in the Universe. In
total, there are hundreds of billions of galaxies

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:51.370
in the Universe.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.819
