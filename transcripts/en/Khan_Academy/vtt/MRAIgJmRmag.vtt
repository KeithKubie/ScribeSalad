00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.225
Solve the system of linear
equations by graphing,

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:05.130
and they give us
two equations here.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.210
5x plus 3y is equal to 7, and
3x minus 2y is equal to 8.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.460
When they say, "Solve the
system of linear equations,"

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.380
they're really just
saying find an x

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.615
and a y that satisfies
both of these equations.

00:00:17.615 --> 00:00:19.600
And when they say to
do it by graphing,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.830
we're essentially going to
graph this first equation.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.010
Remember, the graph is
really just depicting

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.929
all of the x's and y's that
satisfy this first equation,

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:28.470
and then we graph
the second equation

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.700
that's depicting all of the x's
and y's that satisfy that one.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.200
So if we were looking for an
x and a y that satisfies both,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.740
that point needs to
be on both equations

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.760
or it has to be on both graphs.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.170
So it'll be the intersection
of the two graphs.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170
So let's try to see
if we can do that.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.360
So let's focus on
this first equation,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.400
and I want to graph it.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:57.086
So I have 5x plus
3y is equal to 7.

00:00:57.086 --> 00:00:58.960
There's a couple of ways
we could graph this.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.820
We could put this in
slope-intercept form,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.480
or we could just pick
some points here.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.920
You just really need two
points to graph a line.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.390
So let me just set
some points over here.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.710
Let's say x and y.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.210
When x is equal to 0, what
does y need to be equal to?

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.950
So when x is equal
to 0, we have--

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.990
let me do it over here-- we
have 5 times 0, plus 3 times y,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.130
is equal to 7.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.710
That's just 0 over there.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.800
So you have 3y is equal to 7.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.950
Divide both sides
by 3, you get y

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.310
is equal to 7/3, which is
the same thing as 2 and 1/3

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.500
if we want to write
it as a mixed number.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.100
Now let's set y equal to 0.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.270
So if we set y as equal to
0, we get 5x, plus 3 times 0,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.560
is equal to 7.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.950
Or in this part right over
here, it just becomes 0.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.410
So we have 5x is equal to 7.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.360
Divide both sides
by 5, and we get

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:13.280
x equals 7/5, which is the
same thing as 1 and 2/5.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.780
So let's graph both
of these points,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.600
and then we should be able to
graph this line, or at least

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.690
a pretty good
approximation of that line.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.520
So we have the
point, 0, 2 and 1/3.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.460
So that's that point
right over there.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.380
So I'll call it 0,
7/3 right over there,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.520
and then we have the point,
7/5, 0, or 1 and 2/5, 0.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.290
So 1 and 2/5.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.260
2/5 is a little
less than a half.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.420
So 1 and 2/5, 0.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.270
So our line is going to
look something like this.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.050
I just have to connect the dots.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.860
It's always hard to
draw the straight line.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.130
I'll draw it as a dotted line.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.850
So it would look
something like this.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.380
Normally, when you have to
solve a system of equations

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.720
by graphing, they normally
give you a little bit cleaner

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.690
numbers, but we'll
try our best and see

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.250
if we can see where these
two lines intersect.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.890
So now, let's worry about the
second one right over there.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.000
So we have 3x minus
2y is equal to 8.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.250
So I'll do the same thing.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.860
So 3x minus 2y is equal to 8.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.320
We'll just look at the
x- and the y-intercepts.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.440
So first, the y-intercept.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.250
When x is equal to 0, this whole
thing boils down to 3 times

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.520
0 minus 2y is equal to 8.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.690
That's just 0.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.580
So you have negative
2y is equal to 8.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.190
Divide both sides
by negative 2, we

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.900
get y is equal to negative 4.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.930
So the y-intercept
is 0, negative 4.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.520
Right over here, and we
mark it 0, negative 4.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.920
And then, let's
set y equal to 0.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.960
So when y is equal to 0,
this term right over here

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.770
just becomes 0.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.410
So we get 3x minus 2
times 0, so that's just 0.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.470
So 3x is equal to 8.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.575
Divide both sides by 3,
you get x is equal to 8/3.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.240
And 8/3 is the same
thing as 2 and 2/3.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.080
So it puts it right about there.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.410
That's the point, 0, 8/3.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.520
Now let me try my
best to graph it.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.580
Connect these two dots.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.656
So let me do my very best.

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:44.790
I drew a dotted line there.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.580
It goes something like that.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.650
And just eyeballing it, it looks
like these two lines intersect

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.910
right over there.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.300
I'm hoping that this will
give us a clean answer.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.790
And this is the
point 2, negative 1.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.460
So that is the
point, 2, negative 1.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.960
Right?

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.780
The x value here is 2.
y value is negative 1.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.070
Now, that's what we got
just by eyeballing it,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.340
and clearly these are
hand-drawn graphs.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.670
Not very precise.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.300
Let's verify or let's
see if 2, negative 1

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.380
does satisfy both
of these equations,

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.980
if it's an x and y value
that satisfies both and lies

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.570
on both the graphs.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.090
So if you put 2, negative
1 in this first equation,

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.090
you get 5 times 2, plus
3 times negative 1,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.810
and we're going to see
if that is equal to 7.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.460
So this is 10 plus negative 3.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.940
So that's the same
thing as 10 minus 3.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.290
Does that equal 7?

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.040
And yeah, it does.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.650
10 minus 3 is equal to 7.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.770
So 2, negative 1 is
definitely on that graph

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.220
or definitely satisfies
that equation.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.120
And then, let's do it
with the other one.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.080
So if we do 2, negative
1, you have 3 times

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.750
2, minus 2 times negative 1.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.610
And we're testing to see
if that is equal to 8.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.450
So 3 times 2.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.300
3 times 2 is 6.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.840
And then 2 times
negative 1 is negative 2.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.270
But then, we're subtracting
that, so it's 6 plus 2.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.830
6 plus 2 is equal to 8.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.600
And it definitely does equal 8.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.540
So we have the coordinate
or we have the point,

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.320
2, negative 1 satisfying
both equations.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.727
So we've solved the system of
linear equations by graphing.
