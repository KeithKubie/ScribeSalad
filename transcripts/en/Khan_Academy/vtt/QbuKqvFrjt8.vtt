00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:01.874
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna do in this video

00:00:01.874 --> 00:00:04.142
is discuss some of the foundational ideas

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:06.511
for the United States of America.

00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:08.960
And we could start at the
most foundational of ideas

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.293
and that's the notion of natural rights.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:17.120
John Locke, one of the
significant Enlightenment thinkers

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.037
describes rights like life, liberty

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:24.065
and you might expect me to
say pursuit of happiness,

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.074
which is what we see in

00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:26.224
the Declaration of Independence,

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:30.657
but John Locke refers to
life, liberty and property.

00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:33.777
But even though his version
is a little bit different

00:00:33.777 --> 00:00:35.698
than what ends up in the
Declaration of Independence,

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:38.019
most historians believe
that Thomas Jefferson

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.294
was heavily influenced
by John Locke's idea

00:00:41.294 --> 00:00:43.843
of natural rights when Jefferson wrote

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:46.227
the Declaration of Independence.

00:00:46.227 --> 00:00:48.209
And the idea here is that these are rights

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:50.501
that people should be born with,

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.087
that should never be taken away from them.

00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:54.993
And in the video on social contract,

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:56.944
we talk about the idea of why

00:00:56.944 --> 00:00:58.686
someone would form a government.

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:01.008
They would form a government,
they would give some rights

00:01:01.008 --> 00:01:04.572
to a government in order to
protect these basic rights,

00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.627
things like life, liberty, property,

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:08.050
the pursuit of happiness.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.887
And so you might have some other rights

00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:13.009
that one would say in a state
of nature people might have,

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.342
the right to do physical harm on others,

00:01:18.097 --> 00:01:20.514
the right to imprison others,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800
the right to tax others.

00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:27.845
But in a social contract,

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:30.736
we decide, hey, instead of everyone

00:01:30.736 --> 00:01:32.757
trying to figure out things on their own,

00:01:32.757 --> 00:01:36.007
let's give these rights to a government

00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:41.134
and in exchange, the
government should protect

00:01:44.702 --> 00:01:46.443
all of these rights for the individuals.

00:01:46.443 --> 00:01:47.465
And, once again,

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:49.390
this is review from the
social contract video.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.684
This is a notion of a social contract.

00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:56.184
Now the next question is, all right,

00:01:56.184 --> 00:01:58.074
so if we are willing to engage

00:01:58.074 --> 00:02:00.289
in the social contract with a government,

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.579
what type of a government should it be?

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.293
And throughout most of human history,

00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:08.700
governments have been
things like monarchies,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.313
where you have a single individual,

00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:12.320
maybe a king or queen, an emperor

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.851
some type of a conqueror,
who is the sovereign,

00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:16.934
who rules over the state.

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:20.696
But you could have, you
could instead of having one,

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:24.707
you could have a small group,
which would be an oligarchy,

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:28.144
or you could go to the other extreme,

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:30.977
where the people are sovereign.

00:02:30.977 --> 00:02:32.307
And the word for that,

00:02:32.307 --> 00:02:34.979
and this is a key idea
for the United States,

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.646
is popular, popular sovereignty,

00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:41.480
the people are sovereign.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.153
The government is
accountable to the people.

00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:49.236
Sometimes this could be
referred to as democracy.

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:53.630
Now the Founding Fathers
of the United States

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.928
were a little bit
suspicious of pure democracy

00:02:57.928 --> 00:03:00.215
or direct popular sovereignty.

00:03:00.215 --> 00:03:02.652
They were afraid that if
you start having factions

00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:04.859
and a majority faction
were to come to power,

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.191
if you have a straight
democracy, then they might use

00:03:08.191 --> 00:03:11.465
that power to strip some
of the natural rights

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:13.288
of say their political enemies

00:03:13.288 --> 00:03:16.109
or people that they just don't agree with.

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.987
And so you have this other
idea of limited government.

00:03:18.987 --> 00:03:20.570
Limited government.

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:26.523
And some of the key things
that limit the government,

00:03:26.523 --> 00:03:28.613
you could just say
generally the rule of law,

00:03:28.613 --> 00:03:31.354
things like the Constitution, including

00:03:31.354 --> 00:03:33.191
how the government is structured,

00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.644
the checks and balances in it.

00:03:34.644 --> 00:03:39.238
The Bill of Rights, clearly
is a check on government.

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:41.420
And you don't just have limited government

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.562
when you have a democracy,

00:03:42.562 --> 00:03:44.488
you could have a limited
government even in a monarchy.

00:03:44.488 --> 00:03:45.940
The United Kingdom is officially

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.306
a constitutional monarchy,

00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:49.737
where you have a monarch who's sovereign,

00:03:49.737 --> 00:03:53.509
has very limited powers
because of things like

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.365
the rule of law.

00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:56.946
Now the last idea,

00:03:56.946 --> 00:03:58.534
that we're gonna talk about in this video,

00:03:58.534 --> 00:04:02.701
is the notion of a republic,
or the idea of republicanism.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:08.008
Because the Founding
Fathers didn't actually like

00:04:08.008 --> 00:04:09.925
calling the United States a democracy.

00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:13.015
Instead, they favored
calling it a republic.

00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:16.242
And the word republic
can mean different things

00:04:16.242 --> 00:04:17.682
to different people today,

00:04:17.682 --> 00:04:19.351
depending on what context you use.

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:21.931
To some folks, today, it
means any form of government

00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:23.786
that's not a monarchy.

00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:27.398
To other folks it means,
okay, you have a democracy,

00:04:27.398 --> 00:04:28.953
you have popular sovereignty,

00:04:28.953 --> 00:04:30.742
but you have limited government.

00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:33.769
You still have rights
that protect minorities,

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:36.824
rights that make sure that
even if people are not

00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:39.543
in the majority, they are protected.

00:04:39.543 --> 00:04:41.157
To the Founding Fathers,

00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:44.438
they had a version of
this notion of republic.

00:04:44.438 --> 00:04:46.881
They did view a republic as something

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:50.279
that would prevent the
passions of an unfettered

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:51.787
pure democracy.

00:04:51.787 --> 00:04:54.182
But they thought it came mainly by having

00:04:54.182 --> 00:04:57.237
a representative democracy,

00:04:57.237 --> 00:04:59.500
that if you had a smaller group
of elected representatives,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.494
as opposed to everyone getting
involved in every issue,

00:05:02.494 --> 00:05:05.335
that they could calm the
passions of the crowds,

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:06.688
so to speak.

00:05:06.688 --> 00:05:08.263
They also thought it was
logistically more practical.

00:05:08.263 --> 00:05:10.445
Sure, ancient Athens could
have something closer

00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:13.304
to a pure democracy, but that
was just a small city state.

00:05:13.304 --> 00:05:16.230
Well, here, even the 13
colonies were significantly

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.387
more vast, and obviously the United States

00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:22.036
would become even more vast than that.

00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:24.242
And to appreciate this notion of republic,

00:05:24.242 --> 00:05:27.992
right over here is a
quote from James Madison

00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:32.968
in The Federalist Papers, Number 10.

00:05:32.968 --> 00:05:35.051
And just for some context on the what

00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:36.281
The Federalist Papers even were,

00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:37.779
as we mentioned,

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.880
shortly after the
Declaration of Independence,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.885
the Founding Fathers start drafting the

00:05:42.885 --> 00:05:43.897
Articles of Confederation.

00:05:43.897 --> 00:05:46.696
They go into effect in 1781.

00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:50.165
But this is really a loose
confederation of states

00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:52.442
that each, individually,
think of themselves

00:05:52.442 --> 00:05:53.859
as sovereign states.

00:05:53.859 --> 00:05:55.884
And it's really a pact that they'll engage

00:05:55.884 --> 00:05:59.209
in war together, diplomacy
together, free trade.

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:01.799
But you have Shays's Rebellion,

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:03.494
and it's very clear, and
we'll talk about this

00:06:03.494 --> 00:06:05.465
in other videos, that the
Articles of Confederation

00:06:05.465 --> 00:06:07.720
are not powerful enough.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.403
And so you have a
constitutional convention

00:06:09.403 --> 00:06:13.130
in mid 1787, in which James
Madison is a central figure.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:14.628
Some people discuss him

00:06:14.628 --> 00:06:17.321
as the Father of the US Constitution.

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:19.957
They draft what is today the Constitution,

00:06:19.957 --> 00:06:22.279
but then they have to
sell it to the states

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:24.041
in order for it to be ratified.

00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:26.491
Alexander Hamilton has the idea of,

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:29.268
"Hey, why don't we publish
a series of papers?'

00:06:29.268 --> 00:06:31.636
And they eventually publish 85 papers,

00:06:31.636 --> 00:06:34.025
which will collectively be
known as The Federalist Papers.

00:06:34.025 --> 00:06:36.185
And Hamilton writes most of them,

00:06:36.185 --> 00:06:39.643
but he also recruits James
Madison and John Jay.

00:06:39.643 --> 00:06:41.748
And Federalist Papers, Number 10,

00:06:41.748 --> 00:06:43.338
which is perhaps the most famous,

00:06:43.338 --> 00:06:46.655
is James Madison's discussion
of how do you avoid

00:06:46.655 --> 00:06:49.070
factions taking over the government

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.430
and doing things that are not
in the interest of the people.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.299
And I encourage you to read

00:06:54.299 --> 00:06:56.527
all of Federalist Papers, Number 10.

00:06:56.527 --> 00:06:58.058
But I have a very small quote here.

00:06:58.058 --> 00:07:00.856
And this is James Madisons' notion

00:07:00.856 --> 00:07:02.054
of what a republic was,

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:04.516
and he thought the United
States should be republic.

00:07:04.516 --> 00:07:06.536
"The two great points of difference

00:07:06.536 --> 00:07:09.529
"between a democracy and a republic are:

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:13.696
"First, the delegation of
government in the latter,"

00:07:14.535 --> 00:07:15.880
so he's talking about a republic,

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.527
"to a small number of
citizens elected by the rest."

00:07:19.527 --> 00:07:22.198
So he's really talking about
representative democracy.

00:07:22.198 --> 00:07:24.856
But he thought this was a key
component of being a republic.

00:07:24.856 --> 00:07:28.718
"Secondly, the greater number of citizens

00:07:28.718 --> 00:07:30.476
"and greater sphere of country

00:07:30.476 --> 00:07:33.191
"over which the latter may be extended."

00:07:33.191 --> 00:07:35.189
That only through a
representative government

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:37.267
could you actually
govern over 13 colonies,

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:39.357
or even beyond 13 colonies.

00:07:39.357 --> 00:07:41.857
And that's why, today,
obviously you might've had

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:43.119
something closer to a pure democracy

00:07:43.119 --> 00:07:46.224
in ancient Athens, which was a city state.

00:07:46.224 --> 00:07:48.256
But, today, almost any democracy

00:07:48.256 --> 00:07:51.391
is some form of representative democracy,

00:07:51.391 --> 00:07:55.582
which James Madison would
consider to be a republic.

00:07:55.582 --> 00:07:58.192
But if you wanted to classify
the United States today,

00:07:58.192 --> 00:08:02.275
a fair term might be it
is a democratic republic.

00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:04.334
You definitely have popular sovereignty,

00:08:04.334 --> 00:08:06.112
the people are considered sovereign,

00:08:06.112 --> 00:08:07.517
but they don't rule directly,

00:08:07.517 --> 00:08:10.570
they rule through representatives,

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.179
which by Madison's definition
would make it a republic.

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:17.311
So now that you're armed with
some of these basic ideas,

00:08:17.311 --> 00:08:19.887
I encourage you to engage even more

00:08:19.887 --> 00:08:22.400
with some of the founding
documents for the United States.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.781
And on top of the
Declaration of Independence

00:08:24.781 --> 00:08:27.231
and the US Constitution,
I encourage you to read

00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:29.247
as many of the Federalist
Papers as possible,

00:08:29.247 --> 00:08:32.223
because it's really an
explanation of the ideas

00:08:32.223 --> 00:08:34.159
behind the US Constitution.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.517
And you should start with
Federalist Papers, Number 10.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:40.834
As you'll see, James
Madison is quite insightful.

00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:43.031
He predicts how factions might form,

00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:45.526
how parties might form,
and not always do things

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:46.956
in the interest of its people.

00:08:46.956 --> 00:08:49.472
But I'll leave you decide
whether he was right,

00:08:49.472 --> 00:08:52.546
whether forming a republic helps

00:08:52.546 --> 00:08:54.223
this notion of factionalism.

00:08:54.223 --> 00:08:56.543
And look at the world that we are in today

00:08:56.543 --> 00:08:59.026
and think about whether
James Madison would be happy,

00:08:59.026 --> 00:09:01.468
or maybe he would be
a little bit uncertain

00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:02.902
about how things turned out.
