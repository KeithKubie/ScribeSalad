00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.250
Albinism is a rare genetic condition where
a person’s body isn’t able to make skin

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.250
color.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.600
But what exactly is albinism and how common
is it?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.170
Hey Guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.610
Albinism is a genetic condition, where a person’s
body isn’t able to make pigments, so people

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.500
with this condition have white skin and hair,
with light blue or pink eyes.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.990
Albinism is a complex disorder.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.920
You get your skin, eye and hair color from
melanin, which is distributed through a number

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.960
of genes but if one of these genes carry a
certain mutation the amount of melanin that

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.250
is distributed throughout your body changes.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.360
Or sometimes this mutation will keep your
body from producing any melanin at all.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.770
Melanin is produced by cells called melanocytes
which are mostly found in your skin and eyes

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.960
but also in your hair.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.190
People with darker skin have a higher concentration
of melanin in their skin as opposed to fair

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.600
skinned people.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.160
Albinism is the absence of melanin completely.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.690
And it’s not just people, any animal with
pigment can be albino.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.719
Albinism is passed down genetically.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.780
In most cases, there is someone in the family
tree who also has the condition.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.420
But not all cases are the same.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.799
There are actually many types of albinism
that all affect a different gene mutation.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.029
Oculocutaneous albinism, which is when it
affects your eyes, skin and hair, ranges from

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:14.630
type 1 to type 4 with varying degrees of melanin
impact and affects 1 in every 20,000 people.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.380
The most severe version of albinism is oculocutaneous
albinism type 1 or OCA 1.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.359
OCA 1 is caused by a mutation in 1 of 4 genes.

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.849
It’s characterized by having pink or white
skin, eyes and hair.

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:30.179
Some babies born with OCA type 1 do develop
slight pigmentation during their early childhood

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.850
but many born with this type of albinism never
do.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.279
OCA type 2 is less severe than type 1, skin
and eye color will be pale but hair color

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:39.729
is more likely to be red, yellow or auburn.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.340
OCA type 3 mostly affects people who are darker
skinned and will create a reddish light tan

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.799
tone along with auburn eyes.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.560
OCA type 4 is very related to type 2, it’s
hard to diagnose which type of albinism is

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.169
at work and is best left to genetic testing.

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:58.659
Another type of albinism is ocular albinism
type 1 (OA1), also called Nettleship-Falls

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:59.659
syndrome.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.640
Much like its name suggests only the eyes
are affected by the genetic mutation, while

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.749
hair and skin will remain the same.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.899
This happens only when the genetic mutation
of an x chromosome is inherited so it occurs

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:09.899
mostly in males.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.290
The eyes will appear blueish pink, the iris
is super translucent and the most important

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.099
part of the eye - the fovea, which is responsible
for a sharp image - does not develop properly.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.830
However any degree of albinism comes with
vision problems which include being cross

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.700
eyed, being sensitive to light, rapid eye
movement and functional blindness.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.780
An estimated 1 in 20,000 people worldwide
are born with it and affects about 20,000

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.680
people in the U.S. every year.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.810
OCA type 2 happens more frequently in African
Americans, Native Americans and in Sub-Saharan

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.810
Africa.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.099
Nigeria has one of the highest prevalence
of Albinism in the world with over two million

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.380
people affected.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.989
There are many myths that surround albinism
and why it happens.

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.020
While it is true that people with albinism
can’t tan and many can get very serious

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.569
sunburns, the chances of getting skin cancer
is just as high with anyone else who spends

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.090
a lot of time in the sun.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.640
Other myths include the belief that albinos
posses magic traits or bring bad luck.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.790
Some tribal communities in Africa persecute
them, forcing them to leave their native communities

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.790
or be killed.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.620
Places like Tanzania are having an especially
hard time controlling this myth, where sacrifices

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.630
and the belief that albino body parts bring
good luck causes a spike in albino hunting.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.430
So do you have albinism?

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.510
Know someone who has it?
