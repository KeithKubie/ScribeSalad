00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.180
Beta testing allows you to
assure the equality of your app,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.600
by having real users actually use it.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.320
As a startup without a quality assurance
team, it's great to build a community of

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.510
beta testers that can give you
the feedback you're looking for.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.770
Let's hear from Amir Shavat about
what a beta testing community is,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.550
and how to create them.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.360
Amir's had a chance to start some
developer communities on behalf of

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.630
Google and is also the instructor
of Udacity's product course.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.230
Beta Testing communities give you
insights you may miss about bugs in your

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.270
app or ways to improve your app
that you haven't thought of.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.980
Now choosing your beta testing community
members or audience is really important.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.890
There are a few things
you need to consider.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.950
They must be representative
of the actual users that'll

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.980
be using your app when it launches.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.680
For aBARKment, we should actually
find people who are dog owners, and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.100
who are willing to let their
dogs go stay with a sitter.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.080
They also have to be unbiased.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.070
They can't have predetermined notions
about how they feel about the app

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.540
before experiencing it.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.870
And of course, they must be willing to
give feedback and share their thoughts.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.830
It'll be of no help to you if the beta
testers don't actually talk about

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.970
their experience.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.550
The members of this community
should want to be a part of

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.900
the experience early on, and really
want to be a part of the creation and

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.550
improvement of your app.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.480
Through beta testing,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.880
you're going to have the opportunity
to learn a lot of things.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.710
Such as,
does your app even do what should do?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.780
Does your app crash or
does it have bugs?

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.110
Is your app too slow?

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.460
What do users think about your app?

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.590
How does your app look or
work on different types of devices?

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.940
And so much more.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.660
So you'll need to think about how you
want to interact with your beta testing

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.830
community, because it
isn't only important for

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.920
them to be unbiased about the product,
you also need to be unbiased.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.910
So how should you gather
this information from your

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.200
beta testing community.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.320
Let's talk to Amir about that.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.500
&gt;&gt; So first of all I don't think
you need to ask questions.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.700
You need to observe behavior.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.430
One of the key with beta testing is
that you get a lot of the data, and

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.130
rather than asking the questions,
you see how people behave with the app.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.180
And that's super important.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.110
Second, if you must ask questions,
you need to be very,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.820
very sure that these are unbiased.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.555
Like, asking things like,
is this a great app?

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:10.750
Will probably yield,
yes this is a great app.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.360
Although it might not be a great app,
right?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.190
Or, are you using it every day for
sure, will probably be a bad question.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.910
So try to not prime the right answer,
your right answer.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.930
So ask a question in
a very unbiased way.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.680
&gt;&gt; So here are a few things you should
remember when interacting with your beta

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.960
testing community.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.880
Observe behavior first.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.850
You don't always need to ask questions.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.400
You can just observe the behavior.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.100
But when you do, be unbiased.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.918
Don't ask leading questions to allow the
users to give room for honest response.

00:02:42.918 --> 00:02:46.204
For more information on developing
questions for beta testing or

00:02:46.204 --> 00:02:50.430
surveys in general, check out
the article in the instructor notes.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.150
Another option is to create open beta
rather than a user testing community.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.360
Google has a tool called Open beta.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.590
You don't need to create a community
with this option to run your test.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.460
You'll use Open beta when you want
any user with a link to your app

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.450
to be able to join your beta
test with just one click.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.820
One of the major
advantages with open beta,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.390
it allows you to scale
a large number of testers.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.260
However, you can still limit
the maximum number of users you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.840
want to join your beta test.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.565
And finally, don't forget,
you need a collect data somehow.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:23.510
As Amir said, beta testing without
collecting data is pointless.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.091
You can set up a free Google Analytics
account to attach to your app.

00:03:27.091 --> 00:03:31.325
It'll be able to track user behavior,
and provide you with reports on data

00:03:31.325 --> 00:03:34.345
you're collecting, so
that you can make data driven decisions.

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:36.820
We'll dive deeper into
Google Analytics later on.
