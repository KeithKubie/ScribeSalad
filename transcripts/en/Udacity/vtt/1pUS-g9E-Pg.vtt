00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.240
So far,
I've used only simple media queries,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.790
testing only one characteristic, but in
some cases, I need more complex tests.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.910
This media query,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.040
only applies styles when the screen
width, is greater than 500 pixels.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.410
And the screen width,
has to also be less than 600 pixels.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.030
If we look at this altogether,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.810
our media query is only applied
between 500 and 600 pixels.
