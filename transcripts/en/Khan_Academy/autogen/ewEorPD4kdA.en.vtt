00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
 OK 

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.820
 Choose some tasks according to the distributive principle. 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.750
 And the distributive power reminds us simply that 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.620
 if we have, say, a b times plus c, then we 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.570
 we have to multiply a-in with this, we need to multiply or times 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.870
 both of these numbers. 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.300
 So this will be equal to a times b plus a times c. 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.500
 There will be simple a b and plus times c. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.690
 And that's completely logical. 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.490
 Take an example. 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.450
 I would say 5 times 3 plus 7, so if we used it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.380
 for this sequence of operations, you would say it is 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.252
 5 times 10. 

00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:42.840
 So you would say that this is 5 times 10 that is equal to 50. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.470
 And we know that this is the correct answer. 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.870
 Now let's use the distributive property that tells us 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.590
 this will be equal to 5 times, which is 15 plus 5 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.680
 times 7, that is 35. 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.370
 And 15 plus 35 is still 50. 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.950
 If we had only multiplied by 5 with 3, we would win 15, 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.370
 and then adding 7, the answer would be wrong. 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.320
 We multiply the five times that we have, should 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.410
 we multiply that two data. 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.610
 Because you actually multiply the sum of these two. 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.370
 However. 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.260
 Use this to solve these tasks. 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.040
 Let's do A. 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.050
 So we have 1/2 times x minus y minus 4. 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.270
 Then we will multiply 1/2 with the other two. 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.480
 So it will be 1 / 2x minus 1 / 2y minus 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.240
 4, and we finished it. 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.540
 Let's do it and C. 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.330
 We have 6 plus x minus 5 plus 7. 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.850
 So, actually, we have nothing here 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.940
 distribution that we can use. 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.800
 We can simply remove the brackets. 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.010
 6 plus this thing here, is the same as 6 plus x plus 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.610
 minus 5 plus 7. 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.610
 Or we can see it as a 6 plus - Share 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.360
 this here is 2, right? 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.190
 Minus 5 plus 7 is 2, 2 plus 6 is 8, so 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.730
 becomes 8 plus x. 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.450
 OK. 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.010
 That's not all that bad. 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.760
 This was C. 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.970
 Let's do it and E-in. 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:21.140
 We have 4 times m plus 7 minus 6 times 4 minus m. 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.360
 Use the distributive property. 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.200
 4 times m is 4m plus 4 times 7 is 28. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.330
 And we can do this in two ways. 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.850
 Let's do this first. We may have minus 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.580
 6 times 4 is 24. 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.030
 6 times minus m is minus 6m. 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.930
 And note that I could say just minus 6 and 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.550
 to have here plus, but I do this in two steps. 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.350
 I do it first 6 and then I'll do minus 1. 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.520
 And so we will have 4m plus 28 and then you 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.760
 distribute the negative sign. 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.600
 All this can be seen as minus one of this. 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.630
 Less than 1 time 24 is minus 24. 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.620
 Less than 1 time minus 6m is plus 6m. 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.920
 Now we go and m-in. 4m plus 6m is 10m. 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.200
 And then the ascertainment. 28 minus 24, that is 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.580
 equal to plus 4. 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.200
 Let's go further. 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.610
 Use distributive law to simplify 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.730
 the following fractions. 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.400
 We will do the second. 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.520
 So the first is 8x plus 12 broken for 4. 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.870
 So the cause that is said to be the personality 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.150
 it is, in fact, to divide these 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.980
 all with 4. 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.590
 And to divide this all by 4, you would not want to divide each one 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:45.440
 one by one with 4. 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.790
 Or you can even see that, what we have is like that 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.440
 multiply 1/4 times 8x plus 12. 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.620
 These two things are equal. 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.680
 And you divide each with 4, here 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.340
 multiply each with 4. 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.060
 If you do this, this is the same as 8x broken for 4 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.810
 plus 12 broken for 4. 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.130
 In one way, make the collection of fractions from the back. 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.680
 And then 8 is divided by 4 and we will have, 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.360
 we have 2x plus 3. 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.600
 This is a way of solving it. 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.580
 Or we can even choose this. 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.810
 1/4 times 8x is 2x, plus 1/4 times 12 is 3. 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.960
 However, we have the same answer. 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.050
 C. 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.300
 We have 11x plus 12 broken for 2. 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.050
 Like here. 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.895
 We can say that this is like 11. We can write 

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:40.480
 that's 11 broken for 2x, if you want. 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.950
 Or 11x broken for 2, too. 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.620
 Plus 12 breaks for 2 plus 6. 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.360
 And let's do the last one. 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.140
 E. 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.810
 This looks interesting. 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.570
 We have a negative sign before and then we have 6z 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.650
 minus 2 broken for 3. 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.140
 One of the ways to solve it is similar to 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:09.190
 this is equal to minus 1/3 times 6z minus 2. 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.070
 These are both equal. 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.340
 Correct? 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.550
 This is a minus 1/3. 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.650
 You can imagine putting a 1 in here. 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.830
 Correct? 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.610
 Less than 1/3 times 6z minus 2. 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.210
 And then you will use the distributive feature. 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.280
 Less than 1/3 times 6z will be minus 2z. 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.090
 And minus 1/3 times minus 2, as the minuses cancel each other 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.530
 we will flip plus 2/3. 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.180
 And that's over. 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.400
 .
