ANJALI KUMAR: It's Lunch Time
at Google with Anjali Kumar.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.660
Today our guest is Chef
Jacques Pepin.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.460
JACQUES PEPIN: Hello.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.970
Happy cooking.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.820
ANJALI KUMAR: Well, thank
you so much for

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:08.700
coming by my office.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.390
I know you're busy.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.710
And I know you had your big
event this morning.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.070
But I brought you a sandwich,
because I know

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.030
we're pressed for time.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.950
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes, it's good.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.670
ANJALI KUMAR: Do you
like cabbage?

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.060
JACQUES PEPIN: I like.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.070
I love anything.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.450
ANJALI KUMAR: Oh, great.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.530
JACQUES PEPIN: Especially
anything free.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.890
ANJALI KUMAR: Anything
for free.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.550
I'm the same way.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.700
JACQUES PEPIN: This is to imbibe
the Beaujolais that I

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.820
drank this morning.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.145
ANJALI KUMAR: It's not
even noon, Jacques.

00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:29.360
JACQUES PEPIN: I had a bottle
at 10 o'clock this morning

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.570
because I became a member of
the Association of the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.970
Beaujolais Nouveau in France.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.540
ANJALI KUMAR: So you're
drunk right now?

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.880
JACQUES PEPIN: Some type of way
of making you drink wine

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.340
early in the morning
for breakfast.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.260
ANJALI KUMAR: Are you a little
tipsy right now, or are you--

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.130
JACQUES PEPIN: No, no.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.247
I mean, I'll be tipsy looking
at you, but not from the

00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:45.714
Beaujolais.

00:00:45.714 --> 00:00:47.270
ANJALI KUMAR: I like him.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.250
What is your favorite
thing to eat?

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.070
JACQUES PEPIN: Free food.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.790
ANJALI KUMAR: What is your
least favorite food?

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.230
JACQUES PEPIN: Expensive food.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.200
ANJALI KUMAR: Which of these
typical American

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.940
meals is your favorite?

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.195
Sloppy joe--

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:00.800
JACQUES PEPIN: I--

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.070
ANJALI KUMAR: Oh, no.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.315
I'm going to give you a list.

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:02.630
JACQUES PEPIN: Oh, great.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.959
ANJALI KUMAR: Sloppy
joes, "American"

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.922
cheese, or pizza rolls?

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:10.235
JACQUES PEPIN: I go
for sloppy joe.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:11.720
ANJALI KUMAR: Really?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.540
You heard it here.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.340
JACQUES PEPIN: I like
gooey stuff.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.700
ANJALI KUMAR: You had a
much-loved TV series with

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.290
Julia Child.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.016
JACQUES PEPIN: Oh, yes.

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:17.482
Thank you.

00:01:17.482 --> 00:01:18.785
ANJALI KUMAR: "Julia
and Jacques."

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:19.190
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.420
ANJALI KUMAR: And I have a
couple of behind-the-scenes

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.590
questions for you.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.396
Who spoke better French?

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:26.680
JACQUES PEPIN: Who spoke
better French?

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.530
Her, of course.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.920
No, she was-- her
French was good.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.670
Actually, I met her
in 1960, 6-0.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.750
And the first time I met her at
the friend of mine in New

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.630
York, she was unknown
at that point.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.940
But the friend, Helen McCully,
the food editor for "McCall"

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.145
and "House Beautiful," and
she said, oh, yeah, that

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:44.040
manuscript, I received it.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.460
You want to take a look?

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.760
So I took a look, and
[? jeez, ?] it's very good.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.020
And she says, well, the woman
is coming from California.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.080
She's a woman from California
coming next week.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.450
Let's cook for her.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.630
She's a big woman with
a terrible voice.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.195
So [INAUDIBLE], and that's
how I met Julia.

00:01:57.195 --> 00:02:00.590
And that first time we spoke
French, because she just came

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.210
from France.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.580
And I hadn't been
here that long.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.685
And my English was not as
good as her French.

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:07.305
ANJALI KUMAR: Can you do an
impression of her for us?

00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:09.639
JACQUES PEPIN: (FALSETTO) Yes,
of course, I can do an

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:10.106
impression of--

00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:12.571
You know who did that
was my daughter.

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:15.985
My daughter was born, I already
knew Julia Child.

00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:18.060
So Claudine always made
her impression.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.260
And she was at Boston
Universitaire, as well.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.230
So she used to call.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.540
And one night, I was eating
dinner with my wife.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.470
The telephone rang.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.060
Gloria pick it up.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.450
She say, OK, OK, Claudine.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.990
What do you want?

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.510
We're eating now.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.880
And she said, oh, no, no.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.770
I'm sorry, Julia.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.112
I'll call him.

00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:33.976
She thought it was Claudine
doing her impression,

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:35.080
[? yelling ?] at Julia.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.610
'Cause Julia, every time she
called, she would say,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.130
(FALSETTO) Hi, this
is Julia Child.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.354
Like you wouldn't
know who she is.

00:02:41.354 --> 00:02:42.570
ANJALI KUMAR: Well, you
have a new book.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.170
JACQUES PEPIN: Good.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.370
Yes.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.280
ANJALI KUMAR: It's
just come out.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.300
Can you tell us about it?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.545
JACQUES PEPIN: This
is the technique.

00:02:47.545 --> 00:02:50.140
And by "technique," you mean
something which has to do with

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.390
[? manutention, ?]

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.350
with repeat, with repeat.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.920
And that way, it
doesn't change.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.810
The way you beat an egg
white, or do an

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.155
omelette, or peel an asparagus.

00:02:58.155 --> 00:03:01.510
You do the same thing now that
it was 50 years ago.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.680
Although I don't cook now the
way I cooked 50 years ago, but

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.675
the technique remain.

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:07.270
And that's why that
book is here.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.900
ANJALI KUMAR: What would you say
is the one technique that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.725
everybody should know
but doesn't?

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:16.070
JACQUES PEPIN: Certainly
sharpening a knife.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.100
And each time I go, they say,
oh, we had the knife sharpened

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.340
because we know you
are coming.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.530
I take the knife and I say,
which side did you sharpen?

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.430
Sharp knife is good.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.240
But you have a good knife,
a good bowl, a good pot.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.200
You don't need that many.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.620
And now you start doing soup--

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.280
think simple, good.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.800
I mean at home, we do what my
wife called Fridge Soup.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.665
Anything in the fridge left
over, I put it in a pot, I

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:42.040
make the soup.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.985
ANJALI KUMAR: That's
a good recipe.

00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:43.820
JACQUES PEPIN: Yes.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.030
ANJALI KUMAR: Mine
would be largely

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.670
mustard, sriracha, vinegar.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.620
JACQUES PEPIN: I didn't
know Google was

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.810
that good at sandwich.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:52.480
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.816
We're good at many things,
search and sandwiches.

00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:56.900
JACQUES PEPIN: That's good.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.340
ANJALI KUMAR: Yeah.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.650
JACQUES PEPIN: I will remember
Google for sandwich.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.961
ANJALI KUMAR: (LAUGHING) You've
had a couple of drinks

00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:03.211
today, haven't you, Jacques?

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.530
Are you going to finish
that other half?
