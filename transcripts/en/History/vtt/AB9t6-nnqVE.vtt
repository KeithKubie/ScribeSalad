00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:02.752
[music playing]

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:06.506
NARRATOR: Astrakhan Oblast,
Russia, 500 miles south

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:11.678
of Moscow, June 19th, 1948.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.764
11 months after the
Roswell Incident,

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:17.851
at the Soviet military rocketry
research and development

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.187
base, Kapustin
Yar, erratic blips

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.605
appear on the radar screens.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.154
At the same time a
MiG jet fighter pilot

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:32.282
sees an unidentifiable,
cigar-shaped object

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.451
flying in front of him.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:36.286
What we have now
come to understand

00:00:36.286 --> 00:00:40.206
is that there was an engagement
of the Soviet military

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:43.960
with an unknown object
that came into the airspace

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.962
at or near Kapustin Yar.

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:52.051
And the Soviet MiG fighter
was scrambled to intercept.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.512
The aircraft engages
in a three-minute

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:57.724
dogfight with the UFO.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.477
The jet was able to
fire off a missile.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:03.062
And the missile
apparently hit the craft

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:06.399
just as the craft hit
the MiG with some kind

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.028
of blinding flash of light that
caused the MiG, with the UFO,

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:12.489
to crash.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.157
[explosion]

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.619
When people talk
about UFO crashes,

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.287
they talk about
Roswell as if it's

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:20.622
the only time it ever happened.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:23.291
But it's happened repeatedly.

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.628
Kapustin Yar is
another great example

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:29.798
of a genuine, Roswell-type
crash, this time in the Soviet

00:01:29.798 --> 00:01:32.967
Union, and totally
classified under the umbrella

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:34.677
of national security.

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:38.890
There are special teams designed
to create a cover story,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.477
and the wreckage goes
off to warehouses

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:46.397
in which that technology
is analyzed and understood.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:54.531
NARRATOR: Rumors have circulated
for years that nearly a quarter

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.951
mile beneath the surface
of the Kapustin Yar base

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:00.245
are hallways and
chambers containing

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:05.124
downed extraterrestrial craft
and rooms where alien autopsies

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.209
have been performed.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.343
RICHARD DOLAN: This is really
the Soviet Union's Area 51.

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:17.470
It was very, very remote.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.431
The Soviets did all of their
major rocket testing, a lot

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.851
of their advanced
back-engineering of Nazi

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.269
technology from World War II.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.690
This is a very, very
sophisticated place.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.568
Some people came
up with the idea

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:34.320
that this was the main
storage of the crashed UFOs

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.990
in the Soviet Union,
and the secret tests

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.699
are being done there.

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:44.122
NARRATOR: Curiously, at
this secret facility,

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:46.749
the Soviets developed
better nuclear weapons

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.711
and delivery systems
in 18 months than they

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.297
had anticipated
creating in five years.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:02.682
In 1959, the United States
Central Intelligence Agency

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.685
began to monitor the
covert base and collect

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:10.982
aerial photographs from a
U2 reconnaissance mission.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.568
WILLIAM HENRY: When the United
States sent recon missions

00:03:13.568 --> 00:03:15.820
over there during the
Cold War they looked down

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.866
and they saw these incredible
carved images on the ground

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.369
around Kapustin Yar.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.622
DAVID WILCOCK: When we
actually look at the depictions

00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:30.335
of these geoglyphs, they
look similar to what we see

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:33.546
in crop circles and in
certain ancient land

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.381
forms visible on Earth.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.343
So there clearly appears to have
been an attempt to communicate

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.678
with the extraterrestrials,
perhaps saying,

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:43.973
x marks the spot,
come here, guys.

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:46.601
Kapustin Yar was one of
the former Soviet Union's

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:48.519
most secretive airbases.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.313
The rumor is is they
were researching

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.065
UFO technology there.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:54.567
And one wonders if it's
possible that those symbols were

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:57.487
in fact used to attract UFOs.
