00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.503
Mike is sealing up
the Oval Office

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.938
because there's a contagion
out there.

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:09.709
Fortunately, we're safe and
no one else is getting in.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:11.477
DONALD JR. (nearby):
Is that you, dad?

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.913
What the... ?

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:16.282
-Don, Jr.?
-Oh.

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.184
Oh, no.

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.086
(electronic voice):
Outbreak not contained.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.822
Outbreak not contained.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:24.524
-Outbreak not contained.
-(siren wails)

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.192
Dad, there's an outbreak
that's not contained.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.795
-Outbreak not contained.
-Turn that off! Turn it off!

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.564
-What the hell is wrong with
you? -Outbreak not contained.

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:34.934
You know that picture
where JFK, Jr., uh,

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:37.603
crawled out of the desk?

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:41.741
Everyone loved that.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:45.978
So now they'll all love
little Don-Don.

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.881
You're hiding from
Robert Mueller, aren't you?

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.716
Busted.

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.952
Well, at least he's
being honest, sir.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.888
That's my boy,
totally transparent.

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:59.826
Now sit down on the couch
and don't touch anything.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.796
Now watch daddy tell everyone
what to do.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.933
It's time for executive orders.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.902
(cheering and applause)

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.375
First up, a huge iceberg
broke off of Antarctica

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:19.912
the same week that that psycho
Joe Scarborough broke away

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:21.814
from the Republican Party.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:24.951
So executive order,

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:29.188
Joe Scarborough and the iceberg
have to trade places.

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:31.924
Scarborough has to live
in the South Pole,

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:33.926
and the iceberg has to sit next

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.562
to that bloody-faced,
low-IQ Mika.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.564
(Donald, Jr. laughs)

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:41.934
Boy, you really hate women, Dad.

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.770
It's like if they won't have sex
with you you're all pissed,

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:46.839
and then if they do
have sex with you,

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:50.076
you'll lose respect for them
because they had sex with you.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:51.944
It is a trip.

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:53.846
TRUMP:
Okay, all right, okay.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.216
How about a little less
transparency, Don, okay?

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.584
Oh, yeah, yeah, no.
I'm chill.

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:01.621
Mike, why are you sitting
all the way down there?

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:04.223
You're not distancing yourself
from me and my family, are you?

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:07.894
Oh, no, no, sir,
of course not, no.

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.664
I'm happy to-- there we go.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:14.167
Then why are you hosting
private meetings

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.702
with big Republican donors
at your residence?

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:20.173
This better not be what it
looks like, you albino worm.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:23.209
What? No, sir, no, no.
I know what you're getting at,

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:25.278
but it has been
the honor of my life

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.180
to serve as your vice president,

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.514
sitting at your right hand

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:30.616
the way that Saint Peter
will sit next to...

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.385
Nice try, Mike, okay?

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:36.389
Executive order: no guys named
Mike from Indiana

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.258
who have never done cocaine
can be president.

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.760
PENCE:
Well, sir...

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.229
No, that's-that's not fair, sir.

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:44.931
Who says I'm talking about you?

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:47.366
I can pretend to be weird.

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.402
That's hilarious, Dad.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.770
Because, at first,

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:53.239
Mike had no political future
without you.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:56.843
And now he<i> only</i> has
a political future without you.

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:02.281
-Time is funny.
-Jesus!

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:04.517
This is why
we're in so much trouble.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:05.751
Do you ever shut up?

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:07.420
Yeah. When you divorced Mom,
I shut up

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.455
and not talk to you
for a whole year.

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:11.991
Best year of my life.

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.292
Moving on.

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.596
This morning, Republican
senators released their new plan

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.832
for repealing
and replacing Obamacare.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:22.068
And it still might not pass.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.771
This thing is dying
a slow, gruesome death.

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:28.308
So, executive order:

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.112
we need to pass
a health care bill

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:35.715
for the health care bill.

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:38.985
Sure, it has
a preexisting condition.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.620
Yeah, it sucks.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:41.821
You suck!

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:43.589
Yeah, yeah, I suck.

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:46.659
But that's no reason
to deny it coverage.

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:48.027
We'll call it

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.998
the AHCAHCA,

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.801
or "a-cha-cha-cha-cha!"

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:02.174
It's so funny, 'cause it's not
even about health care.

00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:03.876
Repealing Obamacare is all about

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.012
tax cuts for rich people
like us.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:08.581
If we really cared about
lowering health care costs

00:04:08.614 --> 00:04:10.449
we'd move
to a single payer system,

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:12.752
so we could negotiate
prices with providers.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:16.122
Goddamn it, get back
under the desk right now!

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:18.891
Plus, the whole thing with
Obamacare was that a black guy

00:04:18.924 --> 00:04:21.794
told us it do it
and we did not like that.

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:23.929
And then... and then you said

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:26.065
he was born in Kenya,
but you knew.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:27.800
TRUMP:
No, no. No, no.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.402
You knew
he wasn't born in Kenya.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.870
No, I did not, I did not.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:32.938
-I didn't know that.
-And you only ran for president

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:35.775
'cause you wanted to renegotiate
<i> The Apprentice.</i>

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.443
Zip it! Zip it!

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:40.046
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, totally!

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.580
Remember when
you got all dressed up

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:43.482
to go to Chelsea Clinton's
wedding because you thought

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:46.752
you were invited, but you were
actually not invited at all?

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:48.821
Mike, will you stop him?!

00:04:48.854 --> 00:04:52.091
Oh, no, you're upsetting
the president, please "stop."

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:53.826
DONALD JR.:
Oh, yeah, no, no, I-I will.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:55.728
Remember when you came
downstairs naked that time

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:58.164
and your fupa got stuck
in the banister

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:01.133
and then we realized your pubes
look like Captain Crunch?

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:02.635
Enough!

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:04.270
You're a low-quality person.

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:05.938
You're a low-quality
person.

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:08.808
Well...
cat's in the cradle, Dad.

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.743
-PENCE: Ooh.
-No more transparency.

00:05:10.776 --> 00:05:11.842
Executive order:
