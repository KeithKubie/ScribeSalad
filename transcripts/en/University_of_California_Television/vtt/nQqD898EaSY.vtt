00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.617
(whoosh, click, beep)

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.133
- So before we get
started, I'm gonna tell you

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.950
just a little bit about me
just to kinda let you know

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.740
the perspective and
the mindset that I have

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.870
and where I come from,
why I have that mindset.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.390
And I'll start with
kind of a personal note.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.947
My wife is here with me, Frasian, and...

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:33.200
(audience applauds)

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.410
We've been married for over 30 years,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.080
but we have three children,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.710
and our youngest is special needs.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.270
He is diagnosed with both intellectual

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.270
and some physical disabilities,
and he's 22 years old.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.900
And from a parental perspective, you know,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.160
I've been in law enforcement,
this is my 30th year

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.160
in law enforcement, and
from a parental perspective,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.467
I know probably many of you who either

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:02.100
have somebody in your family,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.980
you have one of your loved
ones that you're close to,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.559
or many of you who have
special needs in the audience,

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:09.410
me, being in this line of work,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.637
one of the things that I think about often

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:16.637
is what would happen
if my son, if our son,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.985
came in contact with law enforcement,

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:22.210
and how would he react
if we're not around,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.940
or his brothers and
sisters, some other person,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.010
is not around to guide him
through that encounter.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.890
And I do, and my wife as well,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.693
think about that quite often.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.623
On the other side, from a
professional perspective,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.330
it always crosses my mind about

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.410
what can we do to get better?

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.243
What can I do?

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.540
Now, particularly, now
that I'm in this position,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.970
what can I personally do

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.970
to make the situation better for others.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.274
And I think there's a
lot of work to be done

00:01:50.274 --> 00:01:53.940
in this regard, and I'm really happy

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.380
and pleased that the San
Francisco Police Department

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.760
is taking steps in that direction

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.580
to really make our
interactions and our encounters

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.580
with people and persons with
intellectual disabilities

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.650
and physical disabilities, to
make those encounters better.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.720
So that's gonna be the focus
of my presentation today,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.450
and it's a PowerPoint, but
I will kind of interject.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.350
There's some videos that are here,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.350
and some of them are
pretty, pretty intense,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.500
to say the least, but the reason I want

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.400
to show those videos to
you is because the issues

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.770
that we're discussing
are issues that really

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.880
can amount to life and death situations

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.363
if we, law enforcement, police officers,

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:39.393
don't handle them properly.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.890
So, as I said, there is a
personal component to this for me.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.960
I'm personally vested in this,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.990
and the bottom line on the vision

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.533
that you'll hear about shortly is,

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:55.580
you know, we wanna get better,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.350
we wanna be, we, the San
Francisco Police Department,

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.540
I think law enforcement in general,

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.880
we want to do this right in terms of

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.580
being able to deliver
services to everybody

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.990
that we come in contact, disabled or not.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.123
So that will be the focus
of this presentation.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.240
So, disclosure, there's nothing
for me to disclose really.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.010
I'm not being paid for this presentation.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.590
There's no fees attached to this.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.750
I'm doing it strictly because

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.193
I want us to make a difference.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.340
So here's our overview.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.890
In the past few years,
spotlight has been basically

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.580
on negative police encounters,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.837
particularly with persons in mental crisis

00:03:44.837 --> 00:03:47.885
and debilitating, often
time, long-term illnesses,

00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:51.057
and that includes
persons with intellectual

00:03:51.057 --> 00:03:53.283
and developmental disabilities.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.600
And there are similarities
between mental health crisis

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.710
and sometimes those with intellectual

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.090
and developmental disabilities,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.453
particularly when those
interactions go sour.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.041
Oftentimes, the
disabilities are manifested

00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:17.041
by triggers, and we end up
with a crisis situation.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.473
These differences require
different responses

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:25.473
from those used on persons in crisis.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.730
Now, there's a need to
implement policies, procedures,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.960
develop effective training,
and provide additional services

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.430
through partnerships to improve the lives

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.940
of vulnerable populations,
as well as their families.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.130
And when I get further
in the presentation,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.920
I'm gonna show you all some statistics

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.440
about just how vulnerable
this population is,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.840
and it's really eye-opening.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.470
So what do we wanna do today?

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.163
We wanna express our vision.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.880
We wanna learn from our past experiences.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.450
And we wanna realize change.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.830
So in doing so, we wanna
discuss and explain to you,

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.560
and I'm gonna, this is
from a San Francisco

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.197
Police Department perspective,

00:05:08.197 --> 00:05:11.070
and I know there's a
lot going on nationwide

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.530
in law enforcement,
but I'm gonna keep this

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.583
on more in a local perspective
when I talk about vision.

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:19.150
We really want to be more effective

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.506
in how we respond to calls
involving, and encounters,

00:05:21.506 --> 00:05:23.300
involving those with intellectual

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.170
and developmental disabilities.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.930
Some of the past
experiences that you'll see,

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.465
well, we have a few videos, as I stated,

00:05:30.465 --> 00:05:33.500
and they'll illustrate
why we need to change,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.960
and why we need to realize
change in this body of work.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.000
And we'll highlight what changes
law enforcement in general,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.793
and the San Francisco Police
Department, are making

00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:45.310
to ensure that we treat everyone

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.393
that we come in contact with
with dignity and respect.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.620
So in short, our vision
is we want to be of help

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.620
to those who rely upon
us in their time of need.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.320
And in doing so, we have to develop

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.380
a greater understanding
of the characteristics

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.800
and behaviors that
persons with intellectual

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.750
and developmental
disabilities may present,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.610
and the steps to minimize
potential safety risks

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.040
of this vulnerable population
during encounters with us.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.560
Now in order to realize that vision,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.120
we really have to have
a better understanding

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.020
of those with special needs,

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.740
and then train to it, train to incorporate

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.653
that understanding into
our service delivery.

00:06:31.408 --> 00:06:35.460
Here's a snippet of a San
Francisco Police Department

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.983
training video designed
to better understand,

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.860
and before I even go foreword,

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.330
I wanna point out in the audience,

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.320
I have Captain Melinda Moore,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.790
and if you will raise your hand, Melinda.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.693
I just wanna give her,
(audience applauds)

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.950
just wanna give her some kudos,

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.490
because she has poured her heart and soul

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.340
into really improving us as a department,

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.780
and what, the videos
that you're about to see,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.070
and I'm gonna show you several snippets,

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.040
but this is the first of several,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.020
would not have happened
without Melinda's energy

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.580
and her commitment to this issue.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.730
So thank you, Melinda.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.130
John, please play the video.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.130
- I like shiny objects.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.870
I like the reflection of people's glasses,

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.273
but I'm not trying to
invade their safety zone.

00:07:29.674 --> 00:07:30.672
- Do you wanna do one more?

00:07:30.672 --> 00:07:33.130
Is there anything else
that applies to you?

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.270
- Number 12: sometimes
people on the spectrum

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.120
laugh at unusual times.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.470
They just do it.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.620
I don't know why.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.743
They're not mocking anyone.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:49.874
- Okay, well, it says,
hi, are you ready now?

00:07:49.874 --> 00:07:51.300
- [Man Off Camera] Yes, I am.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.750
- Okay, it says, hi, I'm Andrew,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.960
and I'm on the spectrum.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.890
You might notice my voice is kind of loud.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.640
That's just the way I am.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.640
I'm not being belligerent,
belligerent, right.

00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:08.498
- [Woman Off Camera] Do you
wanna try it one more time?

00:08:08.498 --> 00:08:09.700
- Uh, but I've already done it.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.810
- Hi, I'm Jim Allray.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.987
I have a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome.

00:08:13.987 --> 00:08:18.987
People who are such are called
Aspsy and are often weird,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.760
and so by the transitive
property, I'm a certified weirdo.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.860
What it is is I have no facial expression.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.810
- My name is Paco Lorenzo Melgar.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.830
Then also I am very sensitive to touch.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.830
It can be very painful,
so I might pull away.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.923
I'm not fighting or resisting.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.380
- Some people on the spectrum might seem

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.870
a little uncoordinated.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.320
That doesn't mean that
they're drunk or on drugs.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.060
- Autistics are usually
honest and literal.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.363
They're not trying to
be rude or sarcastic.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.990
- I was meditating,
actually, in a building,

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.580
a public building, an empty building,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.730
on UCFS campus, and I was approached

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.860
by a security officer there from behind.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.760
I had my ear plugs in at the time,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.450
because I have sensory issues,

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.630
and I did not hear the
police officer talking to me,

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.030
and he thought I was giving him attitude.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.867
When he finally came
around in front of me,

00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:23.500
and I saw what was going on.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.410
So, that was an unintentional
miscommunication

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.041
because of a sensory issue

00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:32.517
that I was dealing with using earplugs.

00:09:32.517 --> 00:09:35.400
I want to say something
general, though, also,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.400
which is that I feel that
many people on the spectrum,

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.720
some of them have positive experiences

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.200
and some negative experiences
interacting with the police,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.640
but overall, I think we're all aware

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.140
of how important the police are

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.840
in keeping our society safe for us,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.880
and this applies especially
to people on the spectrum,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.230
that we are very aware
of what an important role

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.800
you are playing in keeping
the streets generally safe,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.210
much safer than they would be without you.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.310
So thank you for that.

00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:06.934
That's it.

00:10:06.934 --> 00:10:09.934
(audience applauds)

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.220
- So as you can see, what
we're trying to do here

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.590
is gain understanding
and give our officers

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:19.423
a better understanding.

00:10:19.423 --> 00:10:23.070
Now, people like me, I like
to think that I get it,

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:26.060
having 22 years of experience as a parent

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.550
with a child with special needs,

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:31.410
but we know that there
are a lot of officers

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:36.100
that are out in the field that
don't have that experience.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.750
And so this type of training,
these types of videos,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.440
as simple as it might sound,
can make a world of difference

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.762
in how we deal with an encounter
when we come in contact

00:10:44.762 --> 00:10:47.070
with an individual with intellectual

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.483
or developmental disabilities.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.220
Most of our actions as police officers

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.993
are a reflection of our
training and our experiences.

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:01.180
It's really essential that
we study past incidents

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.750
to better understand the importance

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.462
of differentiating between
those in a mental or physical

00:11:06.462 --> 00:11:10.300
health crisis and those with
an intellectual disability.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.410
And it's really a discernible difference

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:14.843
that we have to be better at.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.350
Unfortunately, some of the
outcomes of law enforcement

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.340
experience with special needs
populations have not been good

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.250
and they have been met with
really disastrous results.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.060
I'm gonna show you a video,

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.370
some of you may have seen this,

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.240
of a gentleman by the
name of Ethan Saylor,

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.451
and just to set the background.

00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:39.170
This happened in January of 2013.

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.240
Ethan was a 26 year old
young man, and he died,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.510
actually, after an encounter
with police officers.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.620
Ethan had been diagnosed
with Down syndrome,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.940
and basically, that particular evening,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.850
he went to the movies and saw the movie

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.010
that he wanted to see,
and decided that he wanted

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.493
to see it again, so he attempted
to re-enter the theater.

00:12:01.493 --> 00:12:03.210
The manager of the
theater called the police,

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.900
and three off-duty Frederick County

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.623
sheriff's deputies responded.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.193
And now, John, let's roll the video.

00:12:14.098 --> 00:12:16.440
(somber music)

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.180
- [Announcer] Too many times,
people with disabilities

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.890
come into contact with the
criminal justice system,

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.163
and the outcome is anything but just.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:28.130
Misunderstandings and miscommunications

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:30.440
lead to cracks in the system.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.693
Pathways to justice become
impossible to navigate.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.960
Ethan, a young man with Down syndrome,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.630
was excited to see a movie.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.360
When the movie ended, he
tried to re-enter the theater,

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.730
because he hoped to see a second showing.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.700
Ethan's first contact with
the criminal justice system

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.343
came as a suspect when this
was reported as a crime.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.960
Three off-duty police officers responded

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.730
to the theater manager's complaint,

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:00.140
and despite requests from
Ethan's support staff to wait,

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.850
things got physical.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.630
The exact sequence of
events is in dispute,

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.710
but before the evening
ended, Ethan was dead,

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:11.130
due to asphyxiation
when in prone restraint.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:12.920
Ethan fell through the cracks,

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.290
and as a result, lost his life.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.240
Things could've turned out differently.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:24.270
- Now, as I said, some
of these videos are hard

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.653
to grapple with, but just a few
more facts about this video.

00:13:28.869 --> 00:13:31.990
As an aside, an aide was with Ethan,

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.950
and told officers that
Ethan's mother was on her way.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.100
The aide further advised the officers

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.503
that if touched, Ethan
would basically freak out.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.470
The officers, in response, told the aide

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.570
to leave the theater and not to interfere.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.070
Then the officers grabbed Ethan,

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.850
which resulted in him cursing at them,

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.820
Ethan cursing at the officers,

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.070
and the struggle ensued from there.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.560
Ethan fell to the ground
with a deputy on top of him,

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.363
and that's when he stopped breathing.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.630
We have to learn from these outcomes.

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.290
We have to learn from these tragedies

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.120
to get a better response and to prevent

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.533
subsequent catastrophic
failures as this one was.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.833
So how do we get better?

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.060
Better discernment, as we call it

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.320
in law enforcement, situational awareness.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.710
Knowing what you have in front of you.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:28.210
That only comes with training.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.120
So to get better in discernment,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.220
one of the avenues where the San Francisco

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.150
Police Department is really focusing on

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.070
is identifying and being
able to distinguish

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.593
a person in a mental health crisis

00:14:43.593 --> 00:14:47.930
versus a person with a disability

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.183
that's causing this type of response.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.890
Unlike incidents involving a person

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.104
in a mental or physical crisis,

00:14:56.104 --> 00:14:58.770
there's really not been
a concentrated focus on

00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.220
specifically addressing
persons with an intellectual,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:04.540
developmental disability
in law enforcement.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.730
And although the current
training to respond

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.079
to persons in crisis is fairly effective,

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:12.300
we need to recognize
that although similar,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.300
there is a big difference,
a marked difference,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.720
between persons considered
in a mental health

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.170
or health crisis and
those with an intellectual

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.710
or developmental disability,
and that these differences

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.556
may require a different response.

00:15:25.556 --> 00:15:29.030
And going back to Ethan's situation,

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.360
I don't know what training
those officers had,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.320
and it's not fair for me
to judge them on that,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.480
but what I do know is in those situations,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.980
the better training you have,

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.690
the better understanding you have,

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.350
the better off you are
in terms of dealing with

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.550
and effectively handling those encounters.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:51.140
As a result of Ethan's
incident, the Maryland governor

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.730
created a commission and developed

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.440
a statewide training
standard for law enforcement

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.141
in Maryland and first
responders to interact

00:15:58.141 --> 00:16:00.483
with people with disabilities.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.450
So, how do we distinguish
persons in crisis

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.303
versus developmental disabilities?

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.970
First, let me start with
what the definition of those.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.849
A situation in which a person experiences

00:16:17.849 --> 00:16:21.830
an intensive behavioral, emotional,

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:26.620
or psychiatric response triggered
by a precipitating event.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.740
I'm sorry, can't even say the word.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.017
That's a health crisis.

00:16:31.017 --> 00:16:33.670
You know, the person
may be at risk of harm

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.650
to self or others, disoriented,

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.070
or out of touch with reality,
functionally compromised,

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:42.110
and otherwise agitated,
unable to be calmed down.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.960
If the crisis is left untreated,

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.430
it can result in a
mental health emergency.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.300
Now, we come in contact,
particularly in the city

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.480
and county of San Francisco,
we come in contact

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.533
with this situation quite a bit.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.020
You know, these incidents
can lead to suicide

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.320
due to depression, a lot of times.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.266
They're really aggravated
by substance abuse,

00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:10.250
by untreated psychiatric
disorders, PTSD, et cetera.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.020
There's a large spectrum of
issues that we come across.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.160
But there's really a
need to understand that

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:22.860
as opposed to a person
who's intellectually

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.540
or developmentally disabled,
and that disability

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.940
is what's driving the behavior,

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.790
as opposed to a crisis caused
by psychosis from drugs

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.730
or some other mental health breakdown.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.210
It's really important to discern,

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.420
because our response
can be the difference,

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.486
as we saw in the last video,
between life and death.

00:17:41.486 --> 00:17:44.263
It's that serious for us.

00:17:45.847 --> 00:17:50.070
The definition of intellectual disability:

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.090
these disorders are
characterized by limited

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:56.852
mental capacity and difficulty
with adaptive behaviors,

00:17:56.852 --> 00:17:58.950
behaviors such as
managing money, schedules,

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.030
routines, social interactions.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:03.050
They generally appear
before the age of 18,

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:06.460
and may result from physical
causes such as autism,

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:10.140
cerebral palsy, or from
non-physical causes such as

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.300
a lack of stimulation
and adult responsiveness.

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.130
Developmental disabilities,
severe long-term disabilities

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.270
that can affect cognitive abilities,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.550
physical functioning, or both.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.300
Now generally they appear
before the age of 22

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.853
and are likely to be lifelong.

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.270
Here is a tip, and I wanna
go back to this video

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.349
that we saw a second ago
with Ethan, with the aide.

00:18:33.349 --> 00:18:35.270
The aide that was there to help,

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:37.450
the aide that was there
to give information that,

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:40.450
had it been listened
to, may have prevented

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.030
that situation from escalating,

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.640
one of the things that
it's sometimes difficult

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.040
for police officers to do,
particularly in the heat

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.990
of the moment, is slow down.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.000
Slow down and listen.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.800
And oftentimes we get in the situation

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.770
where we believe
somebody's life is at risk,

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.040
or safety is at risk, and it's all about

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.850
stabilizing the situation,
but we've learned over time,

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.320
particularly those of us
that've been around for a while,

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:09.580
that we have to step back,

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.920
and we really do have to slow things down.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.590
And we're gonna talk a little bit more

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.253
in future slides about
how we are doing that.

00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:19.390
Getting back to some of the signs

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:21.440
of developmental disability.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.120
Some people may be solely physical,

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.633
such as blindness from birth.

00:19:25.477 --> 00:19:29.610
Others may involve physical
and intellectual disabilities

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:32.200
stemming from a genetic or other causes

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.039
such as Down syndrome or
fetal alcohol syndrome.

00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:41.039
There's a characteristic that I learned,

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:45.350
particularly from my personal
experience with our son.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.490
When he was younger, there
were no outward signs

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.323
that he was disabled.

00:19:49.323 --> 00:19:50.750
He looked like a normal child.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.808
And as soon as you interacted with him,

00:19:53.808 --> 00:19:56.960
you could quickly figure out
that that wasn't the case,

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.960
but there is a population
out there of many people

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.870
that are intellectually and
developmentally disabled

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:11.870
where on first appearance,
you can't tell the difference.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.950
That's a much harder population for,

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:16.800
particularly for law enforcement officers,

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.160
because you really have to know

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.350
what you're looking for, number one.

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:23.120
You really have to know
the cues, number two.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.550
Number three, you really
have to be trained.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:27.152
If you don't have a personal
experience like I do,

00:20:27.152 --> 00:20:29.910
you really have to
understand and know that

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.318
just because a person looks
like a typical individual,

00:20:32.318 --> 00:20:34.490
they may not be.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.610
And that processing has
to happen pretty quickly

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:39.630
in a volatile situation.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.060
This is why we have to train.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:44.440
This is why it's so
important to have videos

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.110
like what Captain Moore put together,

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.853
so our officers have an
awareness of what to look for.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:55.830
I'm gonna segue into use of force,

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:58.920
because oftentimes, when we
don't know what to look for,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.420
those encounters turn
into what we don't want,

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.590
and that's physical
force having to be used

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.910
by police officers on a
person with a developmental

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.720
or intellectual disability.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.480
And we know that when,
many times when police

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.290
are called to incidents involving a person

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:19.490
with an intellectual or
developmental disability,

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.333
because of a perceived threat or concern,

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.380
due to the oftentimes,
the disability itself,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.240
is really difficult to distinguish.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.870
Like I said, some people,
there's no outwardly signs

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.550
of any type of disability.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.554
And those are much more
difficult to deal with

00:21:37.554 --> 00:21:40.188
from a policing perspective.

00:21:40.188 --> 00:21:43.700
And whether this call for
service is self-initiated,

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.870
or whether officers are
responding to a dispatch call

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:50.380
for service, our training needs to focus

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.200
on slowing things down.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.150
There's a saying that I
learned early on in policing

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.260
in my career: time is on your side.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.900
If you can slow things down,
you're gonna be better off.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.100
And that's a learned skill,

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.450
because when you're in
the heat of the moment,

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.360
and you roll up on a call, and it's chaos,

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.550
oftentimes, you react based
on what your training is,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.810
what your experience is,
but sometimes you have to

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.693
kind of collect yourself, and
you have to slow things down.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:19.656
That is the mode of training that is

00:22:19.656 --> 00:22:21.470
on the forefront of law enforcement.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.740
As simple as it sounds, and
as basic as this sounds,

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.843
easier said than done.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.093
Slowing things down,
create time and distance.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:33.720
Understanding the
possibility that a disability

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.580
may be a contributing factor is key,

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:39.530
and responding accordingly
to the overall situation,

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:43.593
not the initial perception, is also key.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.480
A little bit, statistically speaking,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.760
about police use of force.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.720
Now, the chart that
you see in front of you

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:58.100
kind of breaks down, research
shows that approximately 25%,

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.140
some say as high as 50%,
of persons killed by police

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.270
may have a mental disorder,
or that person was

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.510
in a mental health crisis,
including under the influence

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:10.880
of a controlled substance
during this encounter.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.590
Now, what I believe, as a professional,

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.520
as a chief of police sitting
here in front of you,

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.100
that hidden in those
numbers are a lot of people

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.680
with developmental disabilities.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.500
And with over 18,000 police departments

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.451
across the country, and really
no national standardization

00:23:27.451 --> 00:23:31.040
of what has to be tracked
and needs to be tracked,

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.900
we don't really know what that number is,

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.570
to be quite frank with you.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.856
And it is my hope that before
I leave this profession

00:23:37.856 --> 00:23:42.630
that we do a better job,
because with anything,

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:44.570
when you have data and research,

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:45.910
then you can start figuring out

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:47.770
what you need to do to make things better.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:50.143
We just don't have the
data on this subject.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.270
Incidents involving
individuals with disabilities

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:57.065
and developmental or intellectual,

00:23:57.065 --> 00:23:59.520
they go under the radar,
to be quite frank with you,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.863
because we're not really capturing it.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.400
Sorry about that.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.323
I skipped ahead too
far, give me one...okay.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.763
Here are more statistics,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.940
and basically, what this graph shows

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.980
is as the number of calls
for service involving

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.160
persons in crisis increase,
law enforcement reexamine

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.070
the basic training philosophies

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.390
and standard operating procedures
to adjust our response,

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:40.317
the officers' response to incidents

00:24:40.317 --> 00:24:42.423
involving a person in crisis.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.870
And the whole spirit behind that was

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.030
we wanna minimize getting to a situation

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.360
where we have to use force,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.170
oftentimes when force can be prevented

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.253
if we know what the situation
is that we're facing.

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.490
The San Francisco Police
Department in 2015,

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.760
we really kind of stepped
up our game and expanded

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.533
our effort, including our
crisis intervention training,

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.270
to better understand how to
deal with persons in crisis.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.950
Now this doesn't specifically
speak with the intellectual

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.193
and developmental disabilities training,

00:25:26.049 --> 00:25:28.800
but just better training on how to deal

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.800
with a person in crisis was a good step

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.870
in the right direction for us,

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:37.500
because in that, now we are
specifically focusing more

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.060
on the other side of it, you know,

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.070
how much of this is due to developmental

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.110
or intellectual disabilities?

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.500
You know, the changes that were included.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.010
Slowing things down, you're gonna hear me

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.270
say that over and over again.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:52.350
Creating time and distance.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.870
If you have to use force,
use a proportional amount

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.603
of force, an amount of
force that's reasonable.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.920
Increasing our training techniques

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.706
to reinforce de-escalation.

00:26:04.706 --> 00:26:09.360
And basically limiting
force against people

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.723
that are only a danger to themselves.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:17.660
Also, tools of the trade, we
have new tools of the trade,

00:26:18.206 --> 00:26:21.740
extended range impact weapons

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.730
where we don't have to
necessarily use lethal force

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.900
when we do get beyond a situation

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.050
that can be handled through

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.330
de-escalation or verbal techniques.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.360
What can we do short of lethal force?

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.810
So all these things I think have helped us

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.403
really reduce our use of force,

00:26:38.383 --> 00:26:40.720
and since 2015, our use
of force in San Francisco

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.033
is down about 27% overall.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.910
But again, we have to do
better in really calling out

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.824
the developmental disability issues,

00:26:51.824 --> 00:26:52.657
because we really don't know what

00:26:52.657 --> 00:26:54.630
that number is, to be
quite frank with you.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.600
So when an incident involves a person

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.100
with an intellectual or
developmental disability

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.240
that at times may present characteristics

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.050
that are considered aggressive, violent,

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:13.450
such as with certain types of conditions

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:16.407
like Asperger's, and you
know, the mere presence

00:27:16.407 --> 00:27:18.275
of a a police officer in uniform

00:27:18.275 --> 00:27:21.853
may trigger an unwanted response.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.390
the next video that I'm gonna show you

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.893
is an incident, and it's one
that's pretty intense as well.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.960
Charles Kinsey, and just to set this up,

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.960
some of you have seen this.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.960
This was July 18, 2016, and
this was in Miami, Florida.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.940
Mr. Kinsey was a social worker,

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.560
and during this incident,
he was actually shot

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.453
by police in north Miami, Florida.

00:27:47.629 --> 00:27:50.431
Mr. Kinsey was actually dealing with

00:27:50.431 --> 00:27:54.921
and trying to help a
23-year-old autistic man,

00:27:54.921 --> 00:27:59.626
and Kinsey had gone to the care facility

00:27:59.626 --> 00:28:02.920
to locate this man, who
had been reported missing.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.920
A summary of the event shows that officers

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.360
were dispatched to a report
of a person with a gun

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.170
threatening to shoot himself.

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:13.000
Upon arrival, officers
attempted to gain compliance,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.660
yet the person with the object

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.460
that was believed to be
a gun refused to obey.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.510
John, if you would please play the video.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.580
That's Mr. Kinsey laying on the ground,

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:06.580
and the other individual, sitting,

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:08.910
is the person with the developmental

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.310
and intellectual disability.

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:26.092
- [Charles Kinsey] Arnaldo, please,

00:29:26.092 --> 00:29:28.044
please be still, Arnaldo.

00:29:28.044 --> 00:29:29.760
Get down, Arnaldo, lay
on your stomach, Arnaldo.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.843
- [Man Off Camera] He's
like, please don't shoot me.

00:29:34.264 --> 00:29:35.180
- [Woman Off Camera] But
why they shot the black boy

00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.290
and not the fat boy?

00:29:38.311 --> 00:29:40.197
- [Man Off Camera] Because
he was black, you know?

00:29:45.551 --> 00:29:48.010
- [Woman Off Camera] I
don't know who's guilty.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:53.010
- So, the therapist was on
the ground with his hands up.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.973
Again, the therapist is there to help.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:03.910
Now, I will say this,
I don't wanna get into

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.590
right or wrong or what
happened on that shooting,

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.570
but what I do know about this is

00:30:10.413 --> 00:30:13.490
slowing things down, listening.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.680
You know, the therapist, I
think you saw in the video,

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.990
he was pointing out that
what was in the man's hand

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:21.000
was a toy truck, actually.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.320
And the officers never
processed that information,

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:28.350
apparently, and they felt that a life

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.160
was being threatened, and
it resulted in tragedy.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.570
Now, Mr. Kinsey was the one
that was ultimately shot

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.610
by the police, and he
survived his injuries,

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.380
but again, understanding, you know,

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.530
I don't know that the officers really knew

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:45.803
what they had in front of them.

00:30:45.803 --> 00:30:48.460
And this is why understanding
is vitally important

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.823
for us to not have this happen.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.350
It's a tragedy, and we have to get better.

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.060
We have to learn from
these types of incidents

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.240
to get better, to be better at what we do.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.120
So how do we do that?

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.370
How do we realize changes?

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:07.150
Now, as I talked about, you know,

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.948
when I put on my father hat,

00:31:09.948 --> 00:31:12.670
and having a child with a developmental

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.190
and intellectual disability,
I think about this.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.490
I think about it often.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:21.260
I, what's gonna happen, I
can't be there all the time.

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:23.060
My wife can't be there all the time.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.860
But we can make a difference,

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.290
we in law enforcement, people
like me and Captain Moore

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.860
and others, many others,
we can make a difference,

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.700
to make sure we have
the best understanding

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.810
that if we encounter, that
we do the best job we can

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:39.163
to try not to have a tragedy occur.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.593
And those encounters happen daily.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.368
They happen in many ways, casual,

00:31:49.368 --> 00:31:51.473
people asking for directions,

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.340
public event or just
walking down the street,

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.226
people being a victim
or witness of a crime,

00:31:58.226 --> 00:32:01.940
people being suspects, person of interest.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.180
And it's not to say that people

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:05.770
with developmental
disabilities don't get involved

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.891
in criminal activity, because
sometimes that does happen,

00:32:08.891 --> 00:32:11.350
and that's another side of this story

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:12.900
that we have to be better at,

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.050
really understanding
how to deal with that.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.860
And a person being the
subject of an encounter,

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.500
when that call is
dispatched by a bystander

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.040
that is seeing something that they believe

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:30.380
is criminal activity
or suspicious activity,

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.120
and we get dispatched
to calls all the time,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.820
and we're gonna talk a little bit about

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.220
some of the issues concerning that,

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.420
particularly when it
comes to implicit bias.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.880
This is a vulnerable
population, as I said before,

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.080
and you can see on the chart before you,

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.840
the information gathered, this came from

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.020
the United States Bureau of Justice.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:33:00.830
It indicates that between 2011 and 2015,

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:02.300
the rate of violent victimization

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.270
against persons with disability
was two and one half times

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:11.253
higher than it was for
persons without disabilities.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.480
Persons between age of 12
and 15 had the highest rate

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.853
of victimization than any other age group.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.593
It's a vulnerable population,

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.600
which is why we have to be on top of this,

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.080
we who come in contact with
the victims and the witnesses,

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.713
we have to be on top of this.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.560
In terms of encounters
with law enforcement,

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.600
we also know that persons
with intellectual,

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.600
intellectual disabilities
may be more easily targeted

00:33:43.773 --> 00:33:46.650
for victimization because
they are vulnerable.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.630
People can be manipulated,

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.538
and they are less likely or
able to report victimization,

00:33:52.538 --> 00:33:54.810
because the perpetrator is a friend.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.353
Now that is a big problem.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.040
A lot of people, because
they do feel isolated,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.050
or feel like they don't have friends,

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.710
are really over-reaching to find a friend.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:11.630
And sometimes that's taken advantage of.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.150
As a parent, I worry
about that all the time.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:17.270
People just wanna be,
feel like anybody else,

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.270
want a friend, want somebody
that I can talk to and rely on,

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.070
and there are people out
there that prey on that,

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.626
and it's a problem for us,

00:34:24.626 --> 00:34:26.400
and it's a problem for
us in law enforcement,

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.220
and it's a problem for us as parents,

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:32.790
because it's something that
sometimes you just can't,

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.110
as much as you talk to your child,

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.400
or as law enforcement,
as much as we train,

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.317
we can't control people
who wanna prey upon

00:34:40.317 --> 00:34:43.230
a vulnerable population,
so it's something that

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.980
we have to deal with in law
enforcement and as parents.

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:54.230
So we're gonna go into a
little bit about subjects

00:34:56.500 --> 00:35:00.300
or people that are determined
to be persons of interest.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.730
Now, this next slide, it'll
be probably a little bit

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:06.450
surprising to some of you, and some of you

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.210
probably already know this.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:10.760
Incarceration of Americans
with disabilities,

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.760
now this also came from the
Bureau of Justice statistics,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.150
and if you look at the slides,

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.800
very, very high percentages of people

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.323
who are incarcerated have disabilities.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.823
That is very alarming for many reasons.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:34.460
But it illustrates why it's so important

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.680
for us police officers
to train, to understand,

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.540
and maybe to turn these numbers
in a different direction.

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.533
But that is a very alarming statistic.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:49.340
Studies show that people
with developmental

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.390
and intellectual disabilities
are overrepresented

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:52.840
in the criminal justice system.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.840
They represent two to three percent

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.190
of the general population,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:00.003
and four to 10 percent of
incarcerated persons overall.

00:36:00.876 --> 00:36:03.680
What that means to us is
during a normal shift,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.120
we're likely to come across somebody

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.710
with an intellectual or a
developmental disability.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.620
Sometimes we can ferret that
out based on our training,

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.653
sometimes we can't.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.570
So when we're taking or
encountering a person

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:26.120
with disabilities,
intellectual or developmental,

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.350
into custody, we have
to give particular care

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:31.260
to the manner in which
the person is placed

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.133
in physical custody if those
disabilities are physical,

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.900
because if we don't, it
can elicit a response

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.780
that can be unpredictable
and, quite frankly, unwanted.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.893
The issue here is that
sometimes the person

00:36:48.893 --> 00:36:53.410
cannot articulate what
those disabilities are.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:57.223
And when I talk about slowing
down and taking extra time,

00:36:57.223 --> 00:37:00.630
it's really important
for us, when we really,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.960
at the time we determine
that we're dealing

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.500
with somebody with an intellectual

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.550
or a developmental
disability, you really do have

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.000
to spend extra time.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:09.863
You really do.

00:37:11.122 --> 00:37:16.122
My son has some
developmental malformities,

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.290
not so sure that he would
be able to articulate that

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.090
if an officer were to
place him in handcuffs,

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:23.016
to be quite frank with you.

00:37:23.016 --> 00:37:26.200
And if he doesn't, it
could be harmful to him.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.740
So we know that's an issue.

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.810
And it goes back to understanding,

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:32.160
and you're gonna see another
training video in a second,

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.860
in a few minutes,
rather, about recognition

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.850
and understanding, because
we have to spend extra time

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.510
to get the information that
we need in order for us

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.110
to do the right job and a good job.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.630
So that takes communication,
it takes patience,

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.130
and it really takes understanding

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.630
and being able to recognize
what we're looking at.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:00.210
Now, here's another snippet, as I said,

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.450
of a training video
that'll help us get better

00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:03.950
at our encounters with individuals

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.710
with intellectual or
developmental disabilities.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.360
John, if you could play this one.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.700
- You could be helping them,

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.736
they could've been missing for days,

00:38:13.736 --> 00:38:17.300
they could've just come out of
a really dangerous situation,

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.410
and they're unaware that
you're trying to help them.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:24.890
Try not to look like
you're corralling them,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.500
but do that in a stealth-like way

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.310
so you can cut off the running route.

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:33.000
'Cause they wanna get
back to their comfort zone

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.820
for the moment, and it's, momentarily,

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.520
that's all they're thinking about.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.419
Be very careful as first responders,

00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:44.631
we know that the person affected by autism

00:38:44.631 --> 00:38:49.171
is either in a combative
state, a highly anxious mode,

00:38:49.171 --> 00:38:53.150
motivated by seeking their comfort zone.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.500
So they are doing everything they can

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.763
to get away from us and the stimulus.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.960
Kill the lights in the
car, kill the siren,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.810
maybe lower the radios, and
maybe find the calmest person

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:09.343
within your responding
group to do the talking.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:14.150
Loud noises, loud voices, commanding talk

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.490
is something they're gonna shy away from.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:19.693
You'll get better results
with a calmer voice.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:24.000
- Now, as you saw, Officer Padilla has a,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.875
he's the father of a child with autism.

00:39:26.875 --> 00:39:31.030
Like me, many of us who live this,

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:33.460
have a better understanding,
so one thing about

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.949
this profession, the police profession,

00:39:35.949 --> 00:39:40.180
there's no better trainer, if
you wanna illustrate a point,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.610
than another police officer,

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:43.150
'cause cops tend to listen to other cops.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:46.446
So to have people, ah, it's true.

00:39:46.446 --> 00:39:47.950
(audience laughs)

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.760
But to have, you know,
an officer like Padilla,

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.050
or even some of the other
people in our department,

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.850
officers in our department,
sworn and civilian,

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:00.700
who can really take their life experiences

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.680
and translate that in a
relatable way to training

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.740
is really, really important.

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:09.880
This video was really well
received by our force,

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.360
and these are the type things that we have

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.070
to continue to do to get better.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.132
'Cause it's all about understanding.

00:40:16.132 --> 00:40:17.660
You know, I talked about caregivers.

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:21.450
I perfectly understand
that, if I'm dealing with

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.810
a person with disabilities,
sometimes I might not need

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:25.950
to be talking to that person.

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:28.440
I might need to be talking to the person,

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:30.483
the caregiver, or the person, the aide

00:40:30.483 --> 00:40:31.960
who can better articulate,

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.296
who has a better understanding of

00:40:34.296 --> 00:40:37.681
what the disabilities are
and can articulate to me

00:40:37.681 --> 00:40:39.840
what I need to know to do my job.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.050
So having officers like
Padilla on the police force

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.220
really are helpful.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.550
Having people like Captain Moore

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:48.950
really are helpful to get that message

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:50.640
across to the other
officers who don't have

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.840
those personal experiences,

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.560
so it's a really, really important
piece of training for us.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:57.713
And I'm really proud that we're
taking the steps to do this.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.100
Interviews with suspects
or persons of interest,

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:10.100
now, I was, in my prior years,

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.460
a homicide detective for a few years.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.954
Also, I spent a couple years investigating

00:41:14.954 --> 00:41:19.030
gang-related, mainly violent crime.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.977
One of the things that I saw, often,

00:41:22.977 --> 00:41:27.560
was a lot of the people
that I came in contact with

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.380
in my mind, and I'm not a psychologist,

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:34.130
but I truly believe that there
were disabilities present

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.590
that had never been diagnosed.

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:40.380
And the reason that's so important,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.950
in terms of from both a legal perspective

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.690
and as an investigator, you
really have to get a sense

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:46.523
of what you're dealing with,

00:41:46.523 --> 00:41:51.523
because if you don't, it
can lead to some places

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:53.110
that you don't wanna go,

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.350
false confessions, fake confessions.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.550
People wanna please.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.070
A lot of times the
individuals with disabilities,

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.960
intellectual and developmental,
they wanna please,

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.447
and if you don't recognize that,

00:42:06.447 --> 00:42:08.890
you can get a false confession.

00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:10.930
So it's really, really
important, it's really,

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.979
really important that that
recognition takes place.

00:42:13.979 --> 00:42:16.670
Feeling overwhelmed by police presence,

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.230
knowing how far to push,

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.050
not understanding
instructions or commands,

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:22.760
saying things that they
believe police wanna hear,

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.270
all these things can be mitigated

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.570
with proper training and
better understanding.

00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:37.121
Now, when those encounters
are self-initiated

00:42:37.121 --> 00:42:41.494
by the police officer,
oftentimes, it's because of

00:42:41.494 --> 00:42:46.130
what we call either a reasonable suspicion

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.640
or sometimes probable cause

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.800
that some crime has been committed.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.180
And, oftentimes, though,
the calls are relayed

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.130
from people in the public, the dispatch.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.530
Now, we've all seen calls,
particularly lately,

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.360
with people that called
in on an individual

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.530
thinking one thing, and
some of them have been

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.415
a little bit over the top in terms of

00:43:07.415 --> 00:43:12.415
what I think to be implicit biases.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:16.060
And when we respond to these calls,

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:21.060
we really have to be able
to make our own assessment.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.680
It is important what the
caller is seeing and saying

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.492
and all that, but we have to be prepared

00:43:27.492 --> 00:43:30.655
and have our officers
have the skills needed

00:43:30.655 --> 00:43:34.900
to both respond safely
and to really ferret out

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.980
fact from fiction, bias from reality,

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:43.080
and in terms of the
special needs population,

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.830
I think that's even more important,

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.640
because there are a lot of implicit biases

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:51.063
when it comes to special
needs individuals.

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.360
Bias by proxy is what I'm talking about.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.100
So I call the police,
and I see an individual

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.134
that I think is doing something
suspicious or whatever,

00:44:04.134 --> 00:44:06.123
what's shaping my perception?

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:09.080
How much have I been trained on this?

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.850
If I see somebody that has Down syndrome

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:13.630
and they're wobbling, and
I think they're either

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:17.328
under the influence or
mentally impaired or whatever,

00:44:17.328 --> 00:44:20.900
am I taking the extra
time to really understand

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:22.750
what it is that I'm seeing

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.960
before I call dispatch to have an officer.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.900
Oftentimes, I will tell you, people don't.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.670
They call, and we get there.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:33.570
So it's really incumbent
upon us to be able

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.600
to filter through all that.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.570
And according to the Vera Institute,

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.530
bias by proxy poses a major challenge

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.720
to officers responding to calls.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:47.310
And this was a 2008
opinion, so it's a little

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.590
over 10 years old, but Dale Larson,

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:53.175
who was a professor at
the UCLA School of Law,

00:44:53.175 --> 00:44:58.175
he made it his mission
to support expanding

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.823
federal protections for individuals

00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:02.830
with developmental disabilities.

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.650
He felt that implicit bias
with people with disabilities

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.762
is one of the strongest
types of implicit bias

00:45:07.762 --> 00:45:11.550
in our society, he felt
that strongly about it.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:16.020
And it does play a role in how we respond.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.730
We respond to what is on
the screen in front of us,

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:23.650
and oftentimes, if that
body of information

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:24.850
that's on the screen in front of us

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:27.170
is driven by implicit bias, it may impact

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:28.310
the way that we respond to things.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:30.954
So we have to be able to discern.

00:45:30.954 --> 00:45:33.240
I'll go back to what I said earlier.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.130
We, as police officers,
have to be able to discern.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:42.500
And, gonna show you this training video

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:43.890
that our training staff put together.

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:46.250
Again, this is another
piece of our training

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:47.680
of how we're dealing with this issue.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.780
John, if you would play the video, please.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:56.990
John, if you'll play...

00:46:02.617 --> 00:46:05.034
(car engine)

00:46:10.336 --> 00:46:13.580
(door opening)

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.790
- [Police Officer] Hi, ma'am,
are you the one that called?

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:15.623
- Yes, I am.

00:46:15.623 --> 00:46:16.680
- What's happened?

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:19.440
- Oh, I don't know, that
guy over there just came

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.400
into my store and was
walking around, really odd,

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.730
and picking things up
and putting 'em down,

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.100
and I didn't know what he was doing.

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.030
Then I went over to kinda check

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.522
and he just turned around
and hit me really hard.

00:46:32.522 --> 00:46:34.520
I guess he bumped into me,

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.510
but he didn't say, he didn't
even seem to be aware of it,

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:40.540
he didn't say, excuse me,
he's sorry, or anything.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.480
He just took the chips he had in his hand

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:44.185
and he walked out of the store.

00:46:44.185 --> 00:46:45.279
- Are you hurt at all?

00:46:45.279 --> 00:46:46.284
- [Woman] No.

00:46:46.284 --> 00:46:47.283
- [Police Officer] Do
you need an ambulance?

00:46:47.283 --> 00:46:48.283
- [Woman] No.

00:46:48.283 --> 00:46:49.180
- Okay, where is he now?

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.013
- He's down there.

00:46:50.013 --> 00:46:51.296
He's standing down there.

00:46:51.296 --> 00:46:54.348
That guy with the green,
whatever it is, that bag.

00:46:54.348 --> 00:46:55.854
- Okay, ma'am, right here, we'll come back

00:46:55.854 --> 00:46:58.187
and talk to you.
- All right.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.373
- [Police Officer] Hi sir, can you get

00:47:00.373 --> 00:47:02.314
your hands outta your pockets?

00:47:02.314 --> 00:47:03.210
- Yeah.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:06.744
- This woman over here is
claiming that you hit her.

00:47:06.744 --> 00:47:08.180
- No.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.080
- [Police Officer] She also said you took

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.140
something from the store.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:15.453
- I couldn't even pass.

00:47:15.453 --> 00:47:17.769
- All right, how old are you?

00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:20.213
- 20.

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:23.459
- What's your name?

00:47:23.459 --> 00:47:25.126
- Hero.
- Hero, okay.

00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:27.330
And what's your last name.

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:28.163
- Medina.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.980
- Do you live around here?

00:47:34.574 --> 00:47:38.363
- Not really, somewhere else in the city.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.410
- [Police Officer] Well,
Hero, we're just concerned,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:48.410
because she feels like you
bumped into her on purpose.

00:47:48.971 --> 00:47:53.408
And then you're saying
you didn't bump into her

00:47:53.408 --> 00:47:54.241
on purpose, I guess.

00:47:54.241 --> 00:47:55.740
But we're just trying to find out

00:47:56.594 --> 00:47:59.500
why she might feel like that.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.963
Now, she's thinking you took
the bag of chips on purpose.

00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:08.753
- I can give it back.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:13.630
- Hero, are you diagnosed with anything?

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:15.720
Are you taking any medications?

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:17.013
- I have autism.

00:48:19.072 --> 00:48:20.717
- That explains it.

00:48:20.717 --> 00:48:23.134
- All right, three Adam 13...

00:48:24.857 --> 00:48:26.320
- The role of the police officer

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.980
is one of the most complicated in society.

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:30.720
You're asked to respond to numerous calls

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:32.970
on a daily basis and make effective

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:36.370
and ethical decisions using
your training and experience.

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:38.780
Consider the scene we just witnessed.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:41.470
How many calls for service
have you responded to

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.310
which begin almost exactly like this?

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:47.350
How much do you really know walking in?

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:49.215
Sometimes the most important
piece of information

00:48:49.215 --> 00:48:51.860
is the one you don't have access to.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:54.690
Autism spectrum disorder
is extremely common,

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.310
but it might not always be clear

00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:58.120
when you're encountering it.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:00.373
You police a large and diverse community.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.010
As police officers, you
have a duty to treat

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:06.620
all members of the community with respect,

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.120
provide trust, be neutral
in your encounters,

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.770
and provide every person a voice.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:15.086
In the next few minutes
we will discuss autism,

00:49:15.086 --> 00:49:18.140
how this condition manifests itself,

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.420
and the ways that police
officers can safely

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.513
and effectively serve these
members of our community.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.430
- So again, this is just
a portion of the video

00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:29.610
that we give our officers so they have

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:34.333
a better understanding of how
to respond, how to encounter.

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:41.400
I'm gonna do a public safety
announcement plug here,

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.385
so for those of you that,
and many people in this room

00:49:45.385 --> 00:49:50.050
probably are more educated
than the average individual

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.550
on really understanding what you're seeing

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:54.750
in terms of dealing with a person

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:57.410
with an intellectual or
developmental disability.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:00.410
What I would ask, from a
public service perspective,

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:05.050
is as much as you have
conversations with your friends,

00:50:05.050 --> 00:50:08.530
neighbors, loved ones, is
to have those conversations.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:12.080
Help educate, because bias
by proxy is a problem for us.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.290
I can tell you that.

00:50:13.290 --> 00:50:15.767
People call on what they
believe is happening,

00:50:15.767 --> 00:50:17.690
and we have to respond to it.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:22.690
And as much as we train and
try to provide the tools

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:24.620
for our officers to recognize what it is

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.330
that they're dealing with,
we still get the calls.

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:30.230
There is a need for
educating the general public

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.253
to take the time and try
to determine what you got

00:50:33.253 --> 00:50:34.920
before you make the call.

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:38.950
So what I ask of the audience
is have those conversations.

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:40.700
Please continue to have
those conversations.

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:44.245
Many of you are educators,
many of you work in this world,

00:50:44.245 --> 00:50:49.245
it's a message that needs to be spread

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:53.670
in terms of implicit bias,

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:56.520
taking the time to recognize
what you're looking at,

00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:00.810
so you don't make a bad situation
worse by your own biases.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:02.700
And that's something that I think,

00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:04.550
as a society, we gotta get better at.

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:16.260
What all this is about
for us is we wanna prepare

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:19.820
our officers to prevent
the need to use force,

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.830
not to react to these types
of situations by using force.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:26.777
That training video that Officer Padilla

00:51:26.777 --> 00:51:31.340
and Officer Bannity, with
the gentleman with autism,

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.350
those situations often go sideways

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:35.130
just because there's no awareness

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:37.130
of what is in front of you.

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:40.563
There's no awareness that
the person has autism

00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:44.900
or whatever the issue is,

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:49.900
and without awareness,
you have more probability

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:52.470
of things going sideways.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:56.020
So the training is definitely
needed and necessary,

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:56.853
and that's why we do it.

00:51:56.853 --> 00:51:59.610
We wanna prevent these
situations form escalating

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:04.210
to a point where they get to a situation

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:07.623
where force has to be used
to get it back under control.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:13.570
According to a report
by the Police Executive

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:16.325
Research Forum, better known as PERF,

00:52:16.325 --> 00:52:19.300
nearly all the use of force incidents

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:20.940
that have proven to be controversial,

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.830
and this study was over a number of years,

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:26.313
the officers' actions
reflected their training.

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:33.600
And that's a true axiom in policing.

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.270
How you train is how you're gonna react.

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.860
So the better we train, the
better understanding we have,

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.223
the better reaction you should
expect and demand from us.

00:52:48.850 --> 00:52:51.330
The mindset of policing
in general has changed

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:55.490
over the last few years
from this warrior mentality

00:52:55.490 --> 00:53:00.490
of going in and being
the triumphant warrior

00:53:01.905 --> 00:53:04.380
to one of a guardian, one that is

00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:05.900
a caretaker of the community.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:08.240
At the San Francisco Police Department,

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.960
we've spent a lot of
time over the last year

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.870
developing a strategy statement,

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:16.440
and what we came up with,
and this was many members

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.090
of the department that participated is

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:22.816
we wanna stand for safety
with respect for all, for all,

00:53:22.816 --> 00:53:27.780
disabled or not, typical for all.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:31.030
And this our guiding strategy.

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:32.890
We wanna stand for safety with respect,

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:34.310
and in order to do that, we have to train,

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:35.890
we have to understand.

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:39.840
So part of that strategy includes engaging

00:53:40.755 --> 00:53:43.260
in just, transparent, unbiased,
and responsive policing,

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:46.460
and again, bias is a big
part of this population.

00:53:46.460 --> 00:53:49.900
There are a lot of biases
in terms of how people view

00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:53.810
people with intellectual and
developmental disabilities.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:55.950
We wanna do so in the spirit of dignity

00:53:55.950 --> 00:53:57.510
and collaboration with the community.

00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:59.270
And that's a really important piece.

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:01.080
That video would not have been produced,

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:05.050
I know I gave Captain
Moore thanks for this,

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:06.370
but there are a lot of other people,

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:08.590
community partners, that made this happen.

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:11.830
And that had a lot more
to bring to the table

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:13.910
than we did in terms of expertise.

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:17.440
So collaboration and partnership is key

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:22.023
in terms of really
policing getting better.

00:54:22.023 --> 00:54:24.123
And then we wanna maintain and build trust

00:54:25.690 --> 00:54:27.330
and respect as the guardians

00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:29.160
of constitutional human rights.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.950
And I think that's just very basic,

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:33.650
but it's really as simple as that for us.

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:35.450
So how are we gonna accomplish that?

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.150
Training, and what you
see in front of you,

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:43.610
and I'll go through this part quickly,

00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:47.060
is the San Francisco Police Department's

00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:50.430
level of training compared
to national statistics,

00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:53.130
and I'm proud to say
that our training levels

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.350
are in the orange graphs.

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:59.850
So we do a lot more than
what's required of us,

00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:03.220
but we do that because we
wanna be better at what we do,

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.172
particularly when it comes to this issue.

00:55:05.172 --> 00:55:07.730
It comes at a cost, though.

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:09.350
When officers are sitting in training,

00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:12.179
they're not in the field,
and that's this tension

00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:15.470
that everybody wants to deal with now.

00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:17.750
I get calls every day about I wanna see

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.450
more officers in my community.

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.333
What they don't know
is if we don't sit down

00:55:21.333 --> 00:55:23.860
in the academy and do
this type of training,

00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:26.040
the service that you
get is gonna be diluted

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:27.180
and we could be better.

00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.960
So we wanna be responsive,

00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.680
but we also wanna be professional,

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.520
and we wanna be the best that we can be

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.650
in terms of handling the calls

00:55:34.650 --> 00:55:37.290
and the community needs
that we need to handle.

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:40.420
So training is a very, very
important part of that,

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.250
and as you see, I think we really

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:43.610
put our money where our mouths are

00:55:43.610 --> 00:55:45.010
when it comes to that issue.

00:55:48.010 --> 00:55:50.310
Some of our specialized
training, autism training,

00:55:50.310 --> 00:55:52.397
crisis intervention, procedural justice,

00:55:52.397 --> 00:55:55.650
principled policing and implicit bias,

00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:57.240
managing implicit bias.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:58.500
I just signed a memo last night.

00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.850
We're about to re-institute another round

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:01.913
of implicit bias training.

00:56:01.913 --> 00:56:05.280
Creating an inclusive environment,

00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.902
just signed that memo last night as well.

00:56:06.902 --> 00:56:09.897
Use of force, and critical thinking.

00:56:09.897 --> 00:56:11.920
Critical thinking is really important,

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.490
because, like I said, a lot of times,

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.940
we get thrust into a
very volatile situation,

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:20.930
and naturally, you react.

00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:23.470
Some of it is instinctive,
particularly when you feel

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:27.030
that somebody's life is in
danger, particularly your own.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:30.906
You react, and how we
react in that situation

00:56:30.906 --> 00:56:32.570
has to be coordinated.

00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:35.210
So we just instituted
another block of training

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:37.880
for our troops on critical mindset,

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.240
making sure that we're coordinated,

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.550
and making sure that
we're thinking critically,

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:44.720
making sure that somebody is
there to slow things down.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.330
And that is really important,

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:47.980
particularly when it comes to this issue,

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.503
'cause slowing things down
usually yields better results.

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.197
Our crisis intervention training,

00:56:55.197 --> 00:56:57.110
and I won't go into too
much detail on that,

00:56:57.110 --> 00:57:01.340
but we spend, we have a 40
hour block and a 10 hour block.

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:04.112
Our goal is to train the
entire police department

00:57:04.112 --> 00:57:05.800
over the next couple years.

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.130
And some of the key issues there:

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:12.170
de-escalation versus
escalation, voice neutrality,

00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:15.920
listening, tonal
communication atmospheres,

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.180
all of those things when
it comes to, particularly,

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:21.760
autism and Asperger's,
those things matter.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.760
They matter greatly, so
the better we are at it,

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.560
the better our response is gonna be.

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:33.240
Promoting procedural justice.

00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.410
For a short definition, procedural justice

00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:38.090
really gets to fairness.

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:39.220
How are we treating people?

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.876
Based on the situation,
is what we're doing

00:57:41.876 --> 00:57:43.640
perceived as fair?

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.070
And there's a whole block of training

00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:48.010
that goes into that, so our
officers really understand

00:57:48.010 --> 00:57:50.930
the core principles and
tenets of procedural justice,

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:53.030
creating a fair environment for everybody.

00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.920
Re-thinking, re-engineering, re-training.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.620
It has to be a systematic approach

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:06.130
to reducing the frequency of what we saw

00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:07.690
in these videos from happening.

00:58:07.690 --> 00:58:09.030
It has to be systematic.

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:12.010
It has to be ingrained in
the culture and the DNA

00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:14.370
of our department, and that's
what we're trying to do.

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:16.230
That's the reason that these videos

00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:17.990
and all this training that
I'm talking about exist

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:22.350
is because how we train
becomes our behavior.

00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:24.960
And we want our behaviors to be consistent

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.220
with our values, and that goes back

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.820
to treating people with respect.

00:58:33.781 --> 00:58:35.030
- [Woman Off Camera] I
realize it's difficult

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:37.033
to cut off an armed man.

00:58:37.942 --> 00:58:39.834
(audience laughs)

00:58:39.834 --> 00:58:41.270
I want you to keep on talking,

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:43.916
but we've got another speaker,

00:58:43.916 --> 00:58:45.749
and thank you so much.

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:51.993
- Okay, so I will skip to...
(audience laughs)

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:57.950
That one.
(audience laughs and applauds)
