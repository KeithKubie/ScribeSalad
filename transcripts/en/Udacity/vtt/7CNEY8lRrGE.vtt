00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Narrator] The next question I wouldn't need to dwell on in the class,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but I think it's important.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When it comes to scaling in the number of dimensions of the state space,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the amount of storage we have to assign.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I give you 2 answers.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It could be quadratic or exponential.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, we have quadratic exponential--quadratic exponential--and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I understand I didn't really discuss this,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but go back in your memory to how grids are represented

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and how Gaussian's are represented,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and I promise you 1 of those answers is correct for either of the 2 filters here.
