00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:01.457
- [Instructor] Let's
see if we can figure out

00:00:01.457 --> 00:00:05.457
what 2/3 divided by five is equal to.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.731
Pause this video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:14.776
Well, there is a couple of
ways that we can approach it.

00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:16.889
We can first do it in a conceptual way,

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:17.966
think about it visually.

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.578
To do that, let me represent 2/3,

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:23.483
so let's say that what I'm drawing

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:25.251
right over here is a whole.

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:29.071
This is a square, and
it represents a whole.

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:31.305
Now, I can divide into
three equal sections.

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:33.012
I'm gonna try to hand-draw that.

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:36.262
So, this is, that looks pretty good,

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:38.626
three equal sections here.

00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:42.054
Each is 1/3, and we have 2/3,

00:00:42.054 --> 00:00:45.027
so we are really representing

00:00:45.027 --> 00:00:47.893
all of this stuff right over here.

00:00:47.893 --> 00:00:49.976
That is two of my thirds.

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:55.727
Now, I wanna divide those 2/3 by five.

00:00:55.727 --> 00:00:57.271
Well, the way I could do this is

00:00:57.271 --> 00:00:59.831
I could divide it into
five equal sections.

00:00:59.831 --> 00:01:01.029
But, if I'm doing it, I might as well

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:02.928
just divide everything, all the thirds,

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:05.743
into five equal sections,
so let me do that.

00:01:05.743 --> 00:01:09.910
So, one, two, three, and then
four, and five equal sections.

00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:19.487
So, what is one of those
five equal sections

00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:22.311
of my original 2/3?

00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:23.704
Well, this right over here

00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:28.560
is one of those five equal
sections of my original 2/3.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.452
Notice I could draw that, I
could draw another one here,

00:01:31.452 --> 00:01:34.763
another one here, another one
there, and another one there,

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:39.247
and I would have five equal
sections that make up those 2/3.

00:01:39.247 --> 00:01:41.909
But, what does just one of them represent?

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.017
And if we figure out what
this represents of the whole,

00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:49.090
then we know what 2/3 divided by five is.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.742
Well, when I took my
thirds and I divided them

00:01:51.742 --> 00:01:55.847
into five equal sections, I
essentially constructed 15ths.

00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:57.074
How do I know that?

00:01:57.074 --> 00:02:00.142
Well, I had one, two, three thirds,

00:02:00.142 --> 00:02:02.308
and then I divided it into

00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:05.628
one, two, three, four, five sections,

00:02:05.628 --> 00:02:09.631
so each of these squares
right over here is a 15th.

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.469
You have three times five,

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.206
and you could count 'em if you like.

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:17.647
And, what we have circled off
in red is two of these 15ths.

00:02:17.647 --> 00:02:20.379
We have 1/15 right over here,

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.444
and then 2/15 right over there.

00:02:23.444 --> 00:02:27.887
So, this is going to be equal to 2/15.

00:02:27.887 --> 00:02:30.232
Now, another way that
you could think about,

00:02:30.232 --> 00:02:32.276
and over time this is the
way you will approach it,

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:34.814
but it's nice to think
about it conceptually,

00:02:34.814 --> 00:02:37.071
when you divide by any number,

00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:40.307
it's the same thing as
multiplying by the reciprocal.

00:02:40.307 --> 00:02:44.474
So, five is the same thing
as five wholes, or 5/1.

00:02:47.624 --> 00:02:50.582
And so, 2/3 divided by
five is the same thing

00:02:50.582 --> 00:02:55.121
as 2/3 times the reciprocal of five,

00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:58.383
or the reciprocal of 5/1,
which is you just swap

00:02:58.383 --> 00:03:02.679
the numerator and the
denominator, which is 1/5.

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:05.054
And so, another way of
thinking about this is

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:08.368
this is 1/5 of 2/3, which
it once again will be

00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:11.610
this section right over here.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.063
The way you could compute this,

00:03:13.063 --> 00:03:15.390
conceptually, you see that this is 2/15,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.563
but you could also say well,
I could just multiply it.

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.068
When I multiply fractions

00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:20.409
I can just multiply the numerators.

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.664
Two times one is two.

00:03:22.664 --> 00:03:24.635
We do that same red color.

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:27.032
Two times one is two,

00:03:27.032 --> 00:03:28.820
and then I could multiply
the denominators.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.543
Three times five is 15.

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:33.635
And, hopefully, what we just drew out

00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:37.635
may help make sense of
why dividing by something

00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:41.478
is the same thing as
multiplying by the reciprocal.

00:03:41.478 --> 00:03:43.435
Then, when you multiply fractions,

00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:46.119
it's the same thing as
multiplying the numerators

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.244
to get our new numerator,
and then multiplying

00:03:48.244 --> 00:03:51.911
the denominators to get
our new denominator.
