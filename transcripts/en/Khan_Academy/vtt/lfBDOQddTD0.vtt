00:00:00.648 --> 00:00:02.732
- [Instructor] We're
asked to plot the image

00:00:02.732 --> 00:00:04.936
of quadrilateral ABCD

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:07.300
so that's this blue quadrilateral here.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.115
Under a reflection across the X axis.

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:11.503
So that's the X axis.

00:00:11.503 --> 00:00:13.489
And we have our little
tool here on Khan Academy

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:15.427
where we can construct a quadrilateral.

00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:18.376
And we need to construct a reflection

00:00:18.376 --> 00:00:19.421
of triangle A,

00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:20.465
B, C,

00:00:20.465 --> 00:00:21.467
D.

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:22.827
And so what we can do
is, let me scroll down

00:00:22.827 --> 00:00:23.913
a little bit.

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.067
So we can see the entire coordinate axis.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:28.717
We want to find the
reflection across the X axis.

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:30.554
So I'm gonna reflect point by point.

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:32.627
And actually, let me just
move this whole thing

00:00:32.627 --> 00:00:34.611
down here so that we can

00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:36.983
so that we can see what is going on

00:00:36.983 --> 00:00:38.319
a little bit clearer.

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:41.424
So let's just first reflect point

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:44.090
let me move this a little
bit out of the way.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.940
So let's first reflect Point A.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.367
So we're gonna reflect across the X axis.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.174
A is four units above the X axis.

00:00:52.174 --> 00:00:54.109
One, two, three, four.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.119
So, its image, A prime we could say,

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.471
would be four units below the X axis.

00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:00.992
So, one, two,

00:01:00.992 --> 00:01:02.355
three, four.

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:04.547
So let's make this right over here

00:01:04.547 --> 00:01:05.464
A, A prime.

00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:09.391
I'm having trouble putting the

00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:10.593
let's see if I move these other

00:01:10.593 --> 00:01:11.611
characters around.

00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:12.610
Okay, there you go.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.830
So this is gonna be my A prime.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.939
Now let me try B.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.112
B is two units above the X axis.

00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:21.157
So B prime is gonna have
the same X coordinate

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:23.988
but it's gonna be two
units below the X axis.

00:01:23.988 --> 00:01:25.391
So let's make this our B.

00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:27.139
So this is our B right over here.

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:29.315
Now let's make this our C.

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:30.482
C, right here,

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:33.654
has the X coordinate of negative five.

00:01:33.654 --> 00:01:36.237
A d a Y coordinate of negative four.

00:01:36.237 --> 00:01:39.215
Now C prime would have
the same X coordinate

00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:41.585
but instead of being four
units below the X axis,

00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:43.652
it will be four units above the X axis.

00:01:43.652 --> 00:01:45.702
So it would have the
coordinates negative five

00:01:45.702 --> 00:01:47.086
comma positive four.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:48.884
So this is going to be our C here.

00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:51.038
So this goes to negative five,

00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:54.419
one, two, three, positive four.

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:56.737
And then last but not least, D.

00:01:56.737 --> 00:01:58.706
And so let's see, D right now

00:01:58.706 --> 00:02:00.739
is at negative two comma negative one.

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:03.004
If we reflect across the X axis

00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:05.030
instead of being one
unit below the X axis,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.336
we'll be one unit above the X axis.

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:09.502
And we'll keep our X
coordinate of negative two.

00:02:09.502 --> 00:02:11.470
And so, there you have it.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.585
We have constructed the reflection

00:02:13.585 --> 00:02:16.447
of ABCD across the X axis.

00:02:16.447 --> 00:02:18.413
And what's interesting about this example

00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:20.375
is that, the original quadrilateral

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:22.506
is on top of the X axis.

00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:24.877
So you an kind of see this top part

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.770
of the quadrilateral
gets reflected below it.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.634
And this bottom part of the quadrilateral

00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:29.907
gets reflected above it.

00:02:29.907 --> 00:02:31.283
And then you can see that indeed

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:34.171
do they indeed do look like reflections

00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:36.254
flipped over the X axis.
