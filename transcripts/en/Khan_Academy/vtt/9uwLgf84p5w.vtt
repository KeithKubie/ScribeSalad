00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.650
When people use the
word "perimeter"

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.830
in everyday language,
they're talking

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.690
about the boundary of some area.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.732
And when we talk about
perimeter in math,

00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:11.190
we're talking about
a related idea.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.273
But now we're not just
talking about the boundary.

00:00:13.273 --> 00:00:15.900
We're actually talking about
the length of the boundary.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.520
How far do you have to
go around the boundary

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.440
to essentially go completely
around the figure,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.100
completely go around the area?

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.600
So let's look at this first
triangle right over here.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.630
It has three sides.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.000
That's why it's a triangle.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.360
So what's its perimeter?

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.150
Well, here, all the
sides are the same,

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.930
so the perimeter
for this triangle

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.790
is going to be 4 plus 4 plus
4, and whatever units this is.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.300
If this is 4 feet,
4 feet and 4 feet,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.660
then it would be 4 feet
plus 4 feet plus 4 feet

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.670
is equal to 12 feet.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.280
Now, I encourage you
to now pause the video

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.720
and figure out the parameters
of these three figures.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.240
Well, it's the exact same idea.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.190
We would just add the
lengths of the sides.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.780
So let's say that
these distances, let's

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.020
say they're in meters.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.740
So let's say this is 3 meters,
and this is also 3 meters.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.670
This is a rectangle here,
so this is 5 meters.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.300
This is also 5 meters.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.870
So what is the perimeter of
this rectangle going to be?

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.420
What is the distance
around the rectangle

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.520
that bounds this area?

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.430
Well, it's going to
be 3 plus 5 plus 3

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.910
plus 5, which is
equal to-- let's see,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.230
that's 3 plus 3 is 6,
plus 5 plus 5 is 10.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.280
So that is equal to 16.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.540
And if we're saying
these are all in meters,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.370
these are all in meters, then
it's going to be 16 meters.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.130
Now, what about this pentagon?

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.450
Let's say that each
of these sides are 2--

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.840
and I'll make up a unit here.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.100
Let's say they're 2 gnus.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.320
That's a new unit of
distance that I've just

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.140
invented-- 2 gnus.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.860
So what is the perimeter
of this pentagon in gnus?

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.640
Well, it's 2 plus 2 plus
2 plus 2 plus 2 gnus.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.620
Or we're essentially
taking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 sides.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.170
Each have a length of 2 gnus.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.270
So the perimeter here, we could
add 2 repeatedly five times.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.620
Or you could just say this
is 5 times 2 gnus, which

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.860
is equal to 10 gnus,
where gnu is a completely

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.950
made-up unit of length
that I just made up.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.530
Here we have a more irregular
polygon, but same exact idea.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.420
How would you figure
out its perimeter?

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.444
Well, you just add up
the lengths of its sides.

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:46.860
And here I'll just
do it unitless.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.450
I'll just assume that this
is some generic units.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.330
And here the perimeter
will be 1 plus 4

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.610
plus 2 plus 2-- let me
scroll over to the right

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.900
a little bit-- plus 4 plus 6.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.590
So what is this
going to be equal to?

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.490
1 plus 4 is 5, plus 2 is 7,
plus 2 is 9, plus 4 is 13,

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.540
plus 6 is 19.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.050
So this figure has
a perimeter of 19

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.280
in whatever units these
distances are actually given.
