- Uh!

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:08.842 align:start size:94% position:6%
I sent this dick pic an
hour ago and nothing back!

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.677 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's not a weird
looking dick, right?

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.445 align:start size:84% position:16%
- He looks frightened
and underfed.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:13.279
- Huh!

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.682
Been feedin' him plenty, okay.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.785 align:start size:97% position:3%
Ask the chubby day shift
hostess at Buffalo Wild Wings.

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:19.753
Up top!

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.721
(high five clap)
(Elmer laughs)

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:24.324
- I don't get it but
I love high five-ing.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:26.726
- (Sighs) Let me try again.

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:27.894
- Richie, your nephew is,

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.396
(camera shutter clicks)

00:00:29.396 --> 00:00:30.597
- Ugh!

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.066 align:start size:88% position:13%
Looks like Stanley Tucci
covered in brisket.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:33.900
- Richie!

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.734
- Jesus!

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.403
What's goin' on?

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.905
- Your nephew is here
for his school report,

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.241
AKA stop being a
terrible person.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.208
- Ricky!

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.144
I wish you hadn't seen that.

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.645
- Seen what?

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:49.315 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh, I uh, uh, uh, was
taking a picture of my dick?

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:55.622 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Good save.

- Uncle Richie, who's your
favorite impressionist?

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.241
- Frank Caliendo.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:16.509
What's your report about?

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.977
- Odd jobs.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.813
Must be hard to work long
hours without daylight

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:21.247
and still protect all this art.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:24.651 align:start size:97% position:3%
- First off, you gotta
maintain a sense of authority.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.319
- Richie is that you?

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.988
You got me working on
Easter cock sucker!

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:31.858 align:start size:97% position:3%
That's the rebirth of our
lord and motherfuckin' savior!

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:34.027 align:start size:84% position:16%
He died for our
sins and forgave us!

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:38.631 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna fold you up like
origami and put you in my pussy!

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.733
- Move to the side, to the side!

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.136
- I can still see
you, motherfucker!

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:45.905 align:start size:84% position:16%
You better not be
Sanduskin' that child!

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:49.209
- Hey, I don't fuck kids okay!

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.543
That doesn't mean I don't
think you're handsome.

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:52.545
I think you're very handsome.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.280
(guitar strokes)

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.149
- Thanks for taking me
through here Mr. Lyle.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.183
What's this one mean?

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.818
- 9-11 inside job.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:01:59.786
- This one?

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.122
- CIA assassination of Ebert.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.223
- And this one?

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.057
- Just the horse.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.158
- Ooh, pretty!

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:06.526
What about this?

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:09.229 align:start position:0%
- The WNBA's a Jewish conspiracy
and mermaids are real.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.864
(funk guitar music)

00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:12.632 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Hey Richie, I
finished my report!

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.768 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well uh, well read
a little for us.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:19.405
- (clears throat) I can't
wait to be an art cop.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:22.442 align:start size:88% position:13%
You get to drink, sleep
and yell at people.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:24.611
Even if they didn't
do anything wrong.

00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:28.114
In closing, some day I'll
be able to curse and drink.

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:30.817 align:start position:0%
And uncle Richie says that
people who don't curse or drink

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:33.019
are either pussies or liars.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.489 align:start size:94% position:6%
And my mom said don't
lie, so I'm getting drunk.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.725
(Richie claps)

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:40.727 align:start size:81% position:19%
- You did good
kid, you did good.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:42.262
- Are you gonna
buy me ice cream?

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:43.730
- First, you're gonna
help me pick up some

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.567
single moms at Curves,
but then ice cream it is.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:49.802 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You're basically the
opposite of Atticus Finch.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:53.273 align:start size:84% position:16%
- More like
Abercrombie and Bitch.

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:54.774
Am I right?

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:56.643 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Have you ever read a book
without pictures in it?

00:02:56.643 --> 00:02:59.145
- More like Banana Repub-dick.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.781 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well now we're
just moving backward.
