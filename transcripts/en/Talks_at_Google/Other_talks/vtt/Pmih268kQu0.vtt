[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:09.830
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Well, let
me start by giving just a bit

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.894
of background on David for those
who don't know him personally

00:00:12.894 --> 00:00:14.810
and his story, and then
we'll just dive right.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.290
In and we'll chat a little bit
and have some conversation.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.300
But we're going to open
it up to live questions,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.280
and we also have
a Dory available.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.550
I know we have a lot of Googlers
on the live stream as well,

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.350
and so the Dory is go--

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.190
Robin?

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.220
ROBIN: go IRC dash Dory.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.720
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Yeah-- go
IRC dash Dory for the Googlers

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.074
on live stream who want
to ask a question as well.

00:00:35.074 --> 00:00:35.990
DAVID MILIBAND: Great.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.950
Good to be here.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.290
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Let me
give a little bit of background

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.700
on you for those who
don't know already.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.850
DAVID MILIBAND: This
will put them off.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.350
No,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.611
JACQUELLINE FULLER: I think
it adds many dimensions.

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.110
All right.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.370
So we know David is
president and CEO of the IRC,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.560
which for those who don't
know was founded in 1933

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.940
at the request of Albert
Einstein offering emergency aid

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.640
as well as long-term
assistance--

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.390
something that we were
just talking about,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.680
that important pivot--

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.930
to those who are displaced
by war, persecution,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.540
and natural disaster.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.380
So the IRC is now
operating in more than 40

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.331
war-affected countries
and also doing

00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:17.330
Refugee Resettlement, an
assistance program here

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.567
in the US in 28 cities.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:20.900
DAVID MILIBAND: We've had to
close three offices because

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.780
of the current administration,
so now 25 US cities.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.780
We'll come back to that.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.490
JACQUELLINE FULLER: We will
come back to that point.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.500
I think interestingly
though, for folks

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.430
who don't know David's story
before coming in and taking

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.510
the helm of the IRC--

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.770
so he's been a public servant
in the UK for many years holding

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.860
various posts from being
the 74th secretary of state

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.850
for foreign affairs, secretary
of state for the environment,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.040
and a member of parliament
for South Shields.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.730
Who knows if public service
is going to be in the future

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.850
as well?

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.070
So very, very glad to have
him here with me today.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.190
We have become not only friends
and colleagues, but our teams

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.210
and all across
Google-- we have been

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.024
deeply integrated into the
work of the IRC thinking

00:02:07.024 --> 00:02:08.440
about various ways
that Google can

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.490
be helpful because of the heroic
work that they are doing day in

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.780
and day out on the front line.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.101
So David, it might be helpful
to just begin with the why--

00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:21.915
why this issue is
important for you.

00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:24.040
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, I
think it's important really

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.980
for two reasons.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.480
First of all, thank you very
much, Jackie, for hosting this.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.050
And thanks to all
of you for coming,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.300
and thanks to people
online for the questions

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.470
they're going to ask.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.080
It's important to me
for two reasons, really.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.830
One is just the
simple personal reason

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.220
that both my parents
were refugees.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.040
My dad was a refugee from
Belgium in 1940 to the UK.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.260
My mom was a refugee
from Poland in 1946.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.340
She came as a very young
girl on her own to the UK.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.020
So there's a certain sense
in which the current refugee

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.060
crisis is kind of in my blood.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.100
It's part of who I am.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.560
I know that if the
UK had not admitted

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.380
refugees in the '40s and '50s,
then I wouldn't be here today.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.040
My parents would never have met.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.800
And so there's something
quite personal about it.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.360
But there's also the fact that
it's more and more striking

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.150
that we live in a world where
the number of wars between

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.090
states is at an all time
low, but the number of people

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.690
fleeing violence is
at an all time high--

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.030
at least all time since records
began after the Second World

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.530
War--

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.760
25 million refugees, 40 million
people internally displaced.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.270
Those 65 million
people are not moving

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.900
in the search of a better life.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.510
They are fleeing
for their lives.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.950
They are the baker born from
the home and bakery in Damascus.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.910
They are the girl chased from
her school in Northeast Nigeria

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.860
by Boko Haram.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.500
We have 1,000
staff inside Syria.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.870
They are the people
who are being bombed

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.600
by conventional weapons
and now by chemical weapons

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.270
in eastern Damascus.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.630
And these people who are
victims of war and persecution--

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.697
they pose some of the most
difficult public policy issues

00:04:11.697 --> 00:04:14.030
about how you can help them
survive and how you can help

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.180
them thrive--

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.839
how you can, above all, get
to the roots of the challenges

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.640
they face.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.500
But they also pose moral
questions about what

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.990
responsibilities the West--
which I see as a political

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.320
construct, not just a
geographic construct--

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.500
Western countries
that in some ways

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.410
defined a world order
after the Second World War

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.090
based on the
sovereignty of states

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.650
but also the rights
of individuals--

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.070
how that is defended.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.355
And it seems to me that
it's tragic but true

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:46.730
that in the second decade
of the 21st century

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.300
the fundamental issues of
whether or not victims of war

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.070
have rights is now at issue,
at stake, at risk in a way

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.460
that it hasn't
been for 70 years.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.240
And so it's really a
mixture of, if you like,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.010
the heart and the head that make
the issues around displacement,

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.980
war, conflict, persecution--

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.740
something that I've been
feel very privileged to spend

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.650
the last four years working on.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.870
JACQUELLINE FULLER: I mean,
you just touched on this.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.369
But as we were
walking over, we were

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:17.570
talking about why this
issue matters so much.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.600
And it matters because it
says so much about who we are

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.287
as humanity-- how we
treat those most--

00:05:25.287 --> 00:05:26.870
DAVID MILIBAND: I
mean, when I started

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.828
working for the International
Rescue Committee,

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.640
I had this naive
belief that we were

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.530
about rescuing other people.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.340
It turns out that that's
true, but we're also

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.860
in the business of rescuing
some of the deepest values

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.650
and principles and
commitments that

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.866
have made this country just
to take that as an example.

00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:47.240
When it's done
great things, it's

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.770
often done it on the basis of
some very important values,

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.860
principles, and precepts.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.050
And that work of rescue--

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.190
that work of keeping
people alive in Syria,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.030
giving people dignity in
Congo or in Bangladesh,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.420
ensuring that kids can get an
education-- half of the world's

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.180
refugees are children,
but less than 2%

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.600
of the global humanitarian
budget goes on education.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.290
Giving educational opportunity
to those young people--

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.260
that goes to the heart of what
we say we are as a society--

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.560
what the Western world
says it stands for.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.040
And the truth is that we do an
injustice to our own history,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.600
but we also hand an
easy baseball bat

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.930
to those who would challenge
the West as being full of

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.350
hypocrisy rather than full
of goodwill and good intent

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.800
when we fail to live
up to those standards.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.320
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
And it might be

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.694
helpful for those
in the audience

00:06:40.694 --> 00:06:42.930
who don't have as much
background on the issue--

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.990
I know several of you
are deeply knowledgeable

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.290
and experts on this-- but
also a plug for David's most

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.910
recent book as
well, which I think

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.370
is a great read,
a compelling read,

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.890
and also I think
a great synopsis

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.260
of where we are, how we got
here, and the path forward.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.590
But for folks who don't
have as much context,

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.620
I think, for example,
people are surprised.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.430
They hear refugee,
maybe refugee camp.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.750
They don't understand how long
people will tend to be there

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.969
and how important
integration is.

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:12.510
DAVID MILIBAND:
That's a great point.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.301
Thank you for what you
said about the book.

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:15.560
The other thing I would say--

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.730
it's short.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.230
It's not 140 characters.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.897
It's not 280 characters,
but it will take you an hour

00:07:22.897 --> 00:07:24.230
and a half to two hours to read.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:25.688
If you listen to
the audio version,

00:07:25.688 --> 00:07:27.630
it's two and 1/2
hours of my voice.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.040
It was rather chilling for
me when one of my colleagues

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.740
said to me that they
were enjoying waking up

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.482
with me every morning.

00:07:35.482 --> 00:07:37.100
I found that rather chilling.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.370
JACQUELLINE FULLER: We
don't say those things here.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.370
DAVID MILIBAND: But he meant
it in the nicest possible way.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.326
Let me give a bit of context
which involves some statistics.

00:07:51.326 --> 00:07:53.450
I've told you there are 65
million people displaced

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.830
from their homes by
conflict and disaster.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.680
But the idea I want you to hold
on to through the statistics

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.110
is that we've got a refugee
crisis not just because

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.080
of the number of people
involved but because

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.714
of the nature of
the crisis itself,

00:08:08.714 --> 00:08:10.130
and that nature
goes to the issues

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.970
of the length of displacement,
the location of displacement

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.020
as well.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.315
So just three things
really-- first of all,

00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:19.190
it's hard to measure.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.040
But we think-- the UN thinks--

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.610
that the average length of
displacement for a refugee

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.590
is 10 years.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.780
So you're out of your
own country for 10 years.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.650
But once you've been out of
your own country for five years,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.460
the average displacement
goes up to 21 years.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.320
So hold onto the idea that we're
in a wholly new world where

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.607
the job of public
policy of citizens

00:08:43.607 --> 00:08:45.065
is not just to keep
refugees alive.

00:08:45.065 --> 00:08:47.589
Remember, the Second World
War went on for six years.

00:08:47.589 --> 00:08:49.380
The job is not just to
keep people alive so

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.299
that they can then go home.

00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:53.590
The likelihood is is that
they're not going to go home.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.620
Because the Civil
War in Afghanistan

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.770
has effectively been
going on since 1979.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.870
The war in Somalia has
effectively been going on

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.370
since the early 1990s.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.590
The wars in the Congo have
been effectively going

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:08.600
on for 30 or 40 years.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.160
The outlier is the
Lebanese Civil War,

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.940
which lasted 15 years
but then ended in 1990.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:18.520
And frankly, Lebanon
is as good as it gets

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.580
for restoring fragile peace.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.960
But the more likely scenario
is that these fragile states

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.070
are marked by recurrent wars
rather than wars that end.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.470
So the first point is the
length of displacement changes

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:33.053
the challenge.

00:09:33.053 --> 00:09:36.240
Secondly, most refugees
are not in refugee camps.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.190
I get often asked, oh, you
must work in refugee camps,

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.150
and we do.

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.920
But 60% of the world's
refugees are in urban areas,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.990
not in camps.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.390
So again, it changes the game.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.520
The perils are different,
but the possibilities

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.610
are different if you're
living in an urban area rather

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.767
than a refugee camp.

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:55.600
There are four million
refugees more or less

00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:00.430
in camps, almost all of
them in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.670
The third thing, I think,
is really important--

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.190
is that you'd think
from the media coverage

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.530
that most refugees are in
rich countries like this one.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.220
But the US has 1% of
the world's refugees.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.290
Europe has 6% of the
world's refugees.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.110
88% of the world's refugees are
in poor or lower middle income

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.350
countries.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.310
So Lebanon has 1 and
1/2 million refugees.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.980
Jordan has probably
800,000 refugees.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.110
Kenya has a million refugees.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.640
Ethiopia has a million refugees.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.330
Iran has 800,000 Afghans who
have been there for 30 years.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.060
And so the phenomenon
of global responsibility

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.840
is in the mean exercised
by poor countries and lower

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.060
middle income countries,
not by rich countries.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.730
And it's countries like
Bangladesh, which is

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.130
fragile in all sorts of ways--

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.310
it's got massive population
that's growing fast.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.430
It's just had 900,000
Rohingya Muslims arrive

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:58.560
from Myanmar next door in
the space of six months.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.560
And the minute you start doing
the maths about what would it

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.190
mean for a country like this if
that kind of numbers of people

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.270
if it was proportioned up,
you'd see the kind of challenge

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.610
that it poses even for a
country like Bangladesh which

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.380
is doing the right
thing and opened

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.890
its doors to those refugees.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.720
Jordan, which is the
second closest ally

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.060
of the US in the Middle East--

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.200
its debt to GDP ratio
has gone from 50% to 90%.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.505
It's the resource stress
on its water supplies

00:11:28.505 --> 00:11:30.840
and other supports--
schools, its hospitals--

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.510
massively increased.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.620
And there isn't
yet a response that

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.442
gives Jordan or
countries like it

00:11:36.442 --> 00:11:37.650
the kind of support it needs.

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.830
And what I argue in the
book is that this crisis

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.100
is manageable but
only if we change

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.810
the way that we manage it.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.440
And that means shifting
our focus from the fiction

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.040
that there's a short-term
problem of survival

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.000
and recognize this is
a long-term challenge

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.070
of helping people thrive
rather than just survive.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.000
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
And thinking about how

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.010
others can support the IRC--

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.440
I just learned
recently that the IRC

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.960
is one of the most beloved
nonprofits by our employees,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.560
by Googlers.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.290
We have more than
5,000 Googlers who

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:15.900
are personal donors to the IRC.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.150
So I think there's increasing
the commitment and engagement

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.980
of just everyday folks,
Googlers or not, and donations.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.230
As a company, we've also
been thinking about--

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.020
so we've donated, I think,
about $6 million to the IRC

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.460
as Google.org.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.650
And we've also been
thinking about how can we

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.180
take the best of who we are?

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.270
How can we take
our tech expertise?

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.220
You all saw the
video about info hub.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.920
That's an example of how
we're thinking about that.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.510
But David, you're speaking
here to this audience.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.685
What do we need to know?

00:12:50.685 --> 00:12:53.364
What do we need to hear
about how we can best

00:12:53.364 --> 00:12:54.780
support the work
that you're doing

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.832
either as Google or as other
folks across the Bay Area?

00:12:57.832 --> 00:12:59.790
DAVID MILIBAND: The nice
thing about being here

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.220
is that I can in person say
thank you to those of you who

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.239
have stepped up to support us.

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:06.030
And the most important
thing I can say both

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.655
to those who are
supporting us or those

00:13:07.655 --> 00:13:10.550
who are thinking
about it is something

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.510
that I hope you
believe, which is

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.120
that you come to believe
through discussions like this

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.920
that actually you can
make a difference.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.790
Although this is
a global problem,

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:23.160
it is susceptible to
local individual response.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.570
And just to pick out a
couple of aspects to it--

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.510
one thing is genuinely
unique about the IRC.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.540
We are both an international
humanitarian aid organization

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.840
and a local resettlement agency.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.380
So a refugee who's given
permission to come to the US--

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.570
we meet them at the airport.

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:39.840
We get their kids into school.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.070
We help them on the
track to employment.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:42.990
You've been there?

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.630
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.370
DAVID MILIBAND:
You're a refugee?

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:44.940
AUDIENCE: Yes, I am.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.436
DAVID MILIBAND: Where
are you a refugee from?

00:13:46.436 --> 00:13:47.936
AUDIENCE: I worked
for IRC in Bosnia

00:13:47.936 --> 00:13:49.129
during the Bosnia conflict.

00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:51.420
DAVID MILIBAND: Can we hear
him, or does he need a mic?

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.880
AUDIENCE: Do you need me
to stand up over here?

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.630
DAVID MILIBAND: Well,
you are standing up.

00:13:56.647 --> 00:13:58.147
AUDIENCE: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:13:58.147 --> 00:14:01.957
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:03.540
DAVID MILIBAND: Do
you work at Google?

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.081
AUDIENCE: No.

00:14:04.081 --> 00:14:07.350
Actually, I arrived in San
Francisco as a refugee.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.630
I arrived at the SFO.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.180
As David said, there were
three IRC representatives

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.471
waiting for me 27 years ago.

00:14:16.471 --> 00:14:17.350
I came here.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.980
We settled, lived in [INAUDIBLE]
for about eight years.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.090
[INAUDIBLE] was the first spot.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.500
Got a job in a week with the
help of IRC and Silicon Valley,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.480
worked for PRI and
Intel for years.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.010
After learning the scopes of--

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.440
as you said, there's no
way to go back to Bosnia,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.600
because it was a mess
until almost the '90s.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.760
Make a permanent residency here,
between a US citizen in 2000,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.180
got married here.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.300
My kid is born here.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.250
We still go back to
Bosnia every other year.

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:53.820
We visit.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:54.570
My mom's there.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.320
My family's there.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.700
By me being here, I
provide support for them.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.173
And that was the original idea.

00:15:02.173 --> 00:15:04.410
When I left IRC--

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.395
Sarajevo and IRC
[INAUDIBLE] office in 1994.

00:15:08.395 --> 00:15:11.140
So the idea was
to come somewhere

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.300
where it's better to get
an opportunity to thrive.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.730
I was 22 years old when I came.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:24.243
So long story short, I'm still
here with a Oakland commute

00:15:24.243 --> 00:15:27.936
to cross the Bay Bridge
every day as most of you do.

00:15:27.936 --> 00:15:33.810
I'm trying to help and a big
advocate of IRC for years.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.900
I can generally
say if you really

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.770
want to get involved locally,
Oakland office is great.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.000
They really do
need help to teach

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.540
good English, to teach people
how to go to a grocery store.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.000
You can pick the car and
drive them around for one day.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.080
You can learn a
different culture.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.080
Believe me, you're going
to have some good food.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.290
I help as much as I can.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.030
I know Karen.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:02.500
I know Maggie.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.426
I know Samir.

00:16:04.426 --> 00:16:07.480
Samir and I used to
work together years ago.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.890
Mark Bartolini is a very
good friend of mine.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.789
So I do help locally as
much as their kindness.

00:16:14.789 --> 00:16:16.830
DAVID MILIBAND: I promise
you that is not staged.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.359
But really, thank you for that.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.180
What you have said far more
eloquently than I could

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:27.460
is that one of the great
things about the IRC

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:29.280
is it works across
the arc of crisis.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.250
It's got a bird's-eye view from
the war zone to the neighboring

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:35.220
state to the refugee transit
route to the lucky few getting

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.510
resettled here.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:42.630
But I can say to you in Oakland,
in Sacramento, in San Jose,

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.920
in Turlock, you can volunteer
to make a difference

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.977
to someone's life.

00:16:47.977 --> 00:16:50.060
And if you want to make
the world better, doing it

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.920
one life at a time is
a good place to start.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.717
So the first thing is to say
the refugee crisis doesn't

00:16:55.717 --> 00:16:56.550
have to be far away.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.230
It can be close by.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.460
The second thing that
I think is important--

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.619
today, five Googlers
are in Jordan

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:10.230
helping turn that refugee
info into a platform

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.804
that refugees in Jordan across
the Middle East can use.

00:17:12.804 --> 00:17:14.220
And they're there
for three weeks.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.990
They're working with our teams.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:20.970
So we bring the humanitarian
expertise or our teams

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:24.366
do, you bring the
technological expertise.

00:17:24.366 --> 00:17:25.740
We don't say
there's a technology

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.420
solution to every problem.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.122
But it is very, very striking
like you heard on the video

00:17:31.122 --> 00:17:32.580
that the first
thing a refugee will

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.436
do if they land in
Greece or anywhere else

00:17:34.436 --> 00:17:36.060
is they'll take their
mobile phone out.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.460
And they'll often
ask, where am I?

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:44.040
And so the work that's going
on that is really valuable.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.315
I had the number.

00:17:45.315 --> 00:17:47.730
It said on the screen
that it was 180,000.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:51.300
I thought it was 800,000 who
had used the refugee info.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.430
DAVID MILIBAND: Since the video,
hundreds of thousands of people

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.760
have used and
benefited from that.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.870
And this is going to sound
like a really hokey point

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.630
to technology--

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:10.230
so my first question when
I went onto this site

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.770
was, it's a bit dark.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:12.810
Why is it so dark?

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.500
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
It's not very pretty

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.300
DAVID MILIBAND: It's not pretty.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:14.800
It's dark.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.177
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
But boy, it loads fast.

00:18:17.177 --> 00:18:19.260
DAVID MILIBAND: The answer
was an interesting one,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.630
because it speaks to
the thoughtfulness that

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.560
went into it.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.060
Well, we don't want
it to be pretty,

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.476
and we don't want
it to be bright.

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:28.470
Because we want it to
use up much less battery.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:29.130
Sorry to say.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.860
It's kind of an obvious
point, but to me it

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.024
wasn't an obvious point.

00:18:33.024 --> 00:18:34.440
There's real
thoughtfulness that's

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.185
gone into making sure this
is the most valuable resource

00:18:38.185 --> 00:18:38.810
for the people.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.230
So that's the second thing.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:44.820
Thirdly, last fiscal year we
raised $1.8 million dollars

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.560
thanks to Google employees
committing and Google.org

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.110
matching.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.526
I think it was a one to one
match or possible a two to one

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:52.080
match.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.970
So that makes a
difference as well,

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.220
because we know that we can
vaccinate a child for $50.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.530
We know that we can run a
women's center for $2,500.

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.960
We know that we can
make a big difference

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.120
for small sums of money as long
as many people are part of it.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.510
And so the fact the Google
community has invested

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.110
like that I think is important.

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.170
The final thing that
I would just say

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:18.317
is a plea for you
to use your voice.

00:19:18.317 --> 00:19:19.650
Use your voice with your family.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.108
Use your voice with
your neighbors.

00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:23.700
Use your voice with your
congressman or woman,

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.130
because there is a
campaign of demonization

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:28.890
against these people
that is completely

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.390
the 180 degree opposite
of what the reality is.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.430
The reality is they're
fleeing from terror,

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.790
and the tragedy is they're
being branded as terrorists.

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.800
And it's harder to get
to the US as a refugee

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.660
than through any other route.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.700
It takes 18 to 24 months.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.520
I don't know if in the '90s, but
now there's biometric testing.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.830
Maybe even then there was.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:52.410
AUDIENCE: At the time, all of
the process was done overseas.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.620
So I had to go to an
interview with IRC.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.340
DAVID MILIBAND: Interviews--
it's a really tight system.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.820
I wouldn't have said this if
we'd be meeting last week,

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.320
but I think the following
point is really shocking, which

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.270
is that last year,
95,000 refugees

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.310
were allowed into the US.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:14.950
This year the president
determined that only 45,000

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:15.685
would be let in.

00:20:15.685 --> 00:20:17.800
In fact, his administration
is making sure

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.915
that only 21,000
are being let in.

00:20:19.915 --> 00:20:21.040
But those are just numbers.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.880
I want to say this to you.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.560
And I apologize for
saying it, but I

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.340
think it brings it
into stark perspective.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.840
More Syrians were
killed on Saturday night

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.090
in a chemical weapons attack
than had been let into the US

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.360
in the whole of
this fiscal year.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.130
44 Syrians have been
allowed into the US

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.400
since October the 1st, 2017.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.830
11 have been allowed
into California

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.660
compared to 680 that were let
in in the whole of last year

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.430
to California--

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.900
I think 1,800 across
the US for Syrians.

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.660
So there's a real
moment of crisis

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.530
where your voice is going
to decide whether or not

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.020
this bipartisan US
program-- remember,

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:05.960
it was Ronald Reagan who let in
more refugees than any other US

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.630
president-- whether this
bipartisan program goes away,

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.670
is slowly and silent strangled
or whether it has the chance

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.632
to carry on making a
difference to the country.

00:21:15.632 --> 00:21:17.632
JACQUELLINE FULLER: I
think part of the solution

00:21:17.632 --> 00:21:20.780
is making sure that people
understand how important

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.290
the contribution of refugees.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:26.770
And sir, your story of how
you came, and now you're

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.170
a prominent integrated
member of society giving

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.300
back, great community member--

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.240
I know our team went
to volunteer actually

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.604
at the IRC center in Oakland.

00:21:37.604 --> 00:21:39.020
And something I
learned personally

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:40.520
from that experience--
we were doing

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.600
a little bit of going
over resumes and practice

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.250
interviews.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.740
And one of the things I
learned is how cultural it is.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.400
In America, you know that
you brag in a job interview,

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.650
and you put your best
foot forward and what not.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.450
But in some cultures,
that's offense.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:02.780
And you want to be very humble
and underplay your skill

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.440
set as you go into an interview.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:06.680
So it was interesting
just as someone

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.720
who has been around the
issue for a long time,

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.790
but getting
personally involved, I

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.100
think, helps me get
more passionate about it

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.020
but also understand some things.

00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:17.580
So for our Googlers-- for
our employees-- anyone who

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.600
is interested in
volunteering with IRC,

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.600
make sure you go to
go volunteer profile.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.180
Let us know about your skills,
your passions, your interests,

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.880
and that way we can connect you
with IRC and our other partners

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.000
who are working on these kinds
of issues like the Jordan

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.646
Project or even in
Oakland or other places.

00:22:35.646 --> 00:22:38.270
So we're going to open it up to
questions in just a little bit.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:43.840
So if folks want to jump on the
Dory, it's go IRC dash Dory.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.070
We'll get updated
questions from there.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:53.030
But is there anything that
we-- so as the Bay Area,

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.890
you're at Google,
a tech company.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.850
Some of our other friends are
also stepping up from tech.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:01.490
Are there things
that we in particular

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.810
can do as you think about
all of the products that

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.980
are created here in the Bay
Area, in Silicon Valley--

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.170
the services that
we're creating.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:15.980
If you could wave a magic
wand and say, hey, Google

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.200
and other companies and other
folks with these skill sets,

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.110
this is what we need you
to do, what would that be?

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.020
DAVID MILIBAND:
So I think that's

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:32.490
the revolution that was
conceived in this community

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:38.570
and that has changed the world
in the last 10, 15, 20 years.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:43.190
That revolution hasn't really
hit the humanitarian sector

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.870
yet.

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:51.520
And I think we've got to be
honest and say and warn you not

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.994
to try and bring a technological
solution to every problem.

00:23:54.994 --> 00:23:56.660
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
As we're wont to do.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:58.899
DAVID MILIBAND: Well,
I didn't say that.

00:23:58.899 --> 00:23:59.690
You might say that.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.050
I couldn't possibly comment.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.660
But there is a danger
that we try and find

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.820
hard technology
solutions to things

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:10.940
that aren't amenable to that.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.280
But with that
provisor and warning,

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.230
there are things that
we really struggle

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:20.740
with because the revolution
hasn't yet hit our sector.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.410
One obvious point-- we
work in places where

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.960
connectivity isn't very good.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.910
And we are now in
a situation where

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:31.250
thanks to [INAUDIBLE]
leadership we've

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.880
got all of our
196 field sites up

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:40.230
to the standard of
connectivity of Nairobi,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.670
which is approximately 70
kilobytes for a download,

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.550
25 for an upload
whatever that means.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.860
But it's expensive for us.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.670
It's really expensive.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.630
So this business
of connectivity--

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:59.240
it's cost, how it can
be extended, how we can

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.420
help our teams work offline.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:05.960
That whole agenda is really
important to our financing

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.460
and our sustainability.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:13.640
Second thing is that data
inputting and ensuring

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.420
that our record keeping about
individuals, about products

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.606
is really top notch
would help us a lot.

00:25:19.606 --> 00:25:21.230
One of the first
things I was impressed

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.940
with about IRC when I joined--

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.670
we developed our own
QR reading system

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:27.440
for making sure that
when we were shipping

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.660
medical supplies into
Syria we were able to track

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.050
where they went to.

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:34.040
Because obviously, the
business of ensuring

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.030
that aid is not diverted
into the wrong hands

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:37.830
is important to us.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.169
So the record keeping
thing isn't just--

00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:41.960
the data storage thing,
the data management

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.600
isn't just about our personnel,
although that matters.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.980
if someone's sacked for sexual
harassment in one office,

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:50.070
we don't want to rehire
them in another office.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.910
So there's a personnel
aspect to it.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:55.530
But there's also
nutritional information

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:57.870
on some of our patients.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.350
We help 360,000 patients
in the southwest of Syria

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:02.110
at the moment.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.320
We want to make sure that
we're able to do that

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.700
in an effective way, so
there's a whole data management

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.519
aspect to it.

00:26:10.519 --> 00:26:12.810
The third thing that I think
we're not very good at yet

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.393
and where you might
be able to help us

00:26:14.393 --> 00:26:16.920
is on knowledge management.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.620
We run a really fantastic-- one
of the things I'm most proud of

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.540
is our outcomes and
evidence framework.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.950
We're very hard headed.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.610
We say every program has to fit
into our outcomes framework.

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:29.100
All our programs should become
evidence-based or evidence

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.640
generating.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:35.100
If you type in IRC outcomes and
evidence framework to Google--

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.020
I'm not just saying
that because I'm here--

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:40.440
but if you type it
in, you'll be guided

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.284
through what our
field managers can see

00:26:43.284 --> 00:26:45.200
and how they should be
addressing the problem.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.070
But how we manage the
knowledge behind that,

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.800
how we manage the
experience behind that

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.902
we don't do well
enough at the moment.

00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:54.360
And so those are
the kind of things

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.490
where I think you
could be helping us

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:59.580
with the distinctive
technological skills

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.080
you've got.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.413
One other thing which came
up when I went to the Oakland

00:27:02.413 --> 00:27:03.420
office yesterday--

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.270
we haven't done a good
job on our alumni.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.710
I'd love to do an
alumni project with you.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:12.060
We resettled last
year 15,000 people.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.130
We've been resettling
refugees in America

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.890
for the last 40 or 50 years.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:20.100
Andy Grove was a
resettled refugee

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.550
by the IRC, which is
pretty extraordinary.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.780
His name was András Gróf.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:30.610
He was a Hungarian refugee.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:34.050
We got him into the City
College of New York in 1957.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:35.640
We bought him his
first hearing aid,

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.880
because he'd had
rheumatic fever as a child

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.630
and had never been diagnosed.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.760
And the rest is history.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.490
But we've not got a good
alumni records, even locally.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.072
So there's all sorts
of ways I would

00:27:49.072 --> 00:27:51.030
guess in which the
combination of your interest

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.957
and your skills might
be able to help us.

00:27:52.957 --> 00:27:54.040
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Super.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:54.539
OK.

00:27:54.539 --> 00:27:57.180
Well, why don't we open up
to the room for questions?

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.020
And we can also take some from
the Dory for our live stream

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.322
folks.

00:28:02.322 --> 00:28:03.030
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:04.800
Thanks very much.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.032
Excellent talk.

00:28:06.032 --> 00:28:07.300
My name's Scott Campbell.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.690
I work with the UN
Human Rights Office,

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.200
usually based in central
Africa or in Geneva

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.377
at our headquarters.

00:28:13.377 --> 00:28:15.210
And first of all, thank
you for the comments

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.790
on immigrants' rights
and how they're

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.920
being demonized these days.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.020
It's something our
commissioner for human rights

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.064
feels very strongly about
and is very outspoken about.

00:28:24.064 --> 00:28:28.720
It's super important that IRC
also is taking that stand.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.640
My question-- I'm just visiting.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.350
I'm fascinated by the way that
IRC has captured technology

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.976
for promoting humanitarian work.

00:28:35.976 --> 00:28:37.660
The question I'm
looking at while I'm

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:40.870
visiting San Francisco is
how technology can be used

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:42.220
to promote human rights work--

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.380
how we can use it as
the Human Rights Office

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.980
in the United Nations to
better protect and promote

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:48.530
human rights.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:52.870
And I think your point,
David, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.250
There's not a
technology solution

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.240
for every problem is one we've
learned early on in the game.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:01.660
But that said, I think IRC
is far ahead of the UN Human

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.410
Rights Office in how
you have carefully

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.010
developed with Google some
tools that have worked well.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.870
Do you have any lessons
learned or thoughts

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.220
on how technology could be
used in a human rights context

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.790
rather than a humanitarian one?

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:17.889
Thank you.

00:29:17.889 --> 00:29:20.180
JACQUELLINE FULLER: I would
say number one very humbly,

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.760
I think one of the biggest
mistakes we in the tech

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.370
industry tend to do
is develop solutions

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:27.320
in our nice little
conference room

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.990
here with catered food and
whatnot that don't actually

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:32.570
work on the front line-- so I
think starting with partners

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.380
like yourself, like IRC who are
on the front lines who really

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.280
understand the needs.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.100
And then I think the other
thing that the teams did well

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:47.600
is we actually sent folks to the
crisis areas, especially UX--

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.840
user interface-- experts
to understand the needs

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.400
and to understand even if
technology is a solution.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.190
So if we're talking
about direct service,

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:02.600
I think having folks who
specialize in human-computer

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.350
interaction and understanding
what the actual real felt needs

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:10.050
are and whether or not
technology can be a solution--

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.880
so I would say that particularly
for the front lines work.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.720
I think as far as advocacy
though and other ways

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.600
to help those who are
leading on human rights--

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.360
Alphabet, our company, has
several different groups.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.240
Jigsaw, for example,
has been working, for,

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.120
example, with DDoS attack
protection for those

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.390
who are on the front lines of
journalism and human rights.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.380
So there are ways that we
can think as a tech community

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.610
about how we can ensure that
people's lifelines remain

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.040
intact when they do
their heroic work

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.657
as well on the advocacy front.

00:30:49.657 --> 00:30:51.740
DAVID MILIBAND: The UN
Commission of Human Rights,

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.560
by the way, Zeid al-Hussein,
has done an outstanding job

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.766
in the last four or
five years to speak up

00:30:56.766 --> 00:30:57.890
against human rights abuse.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.870
I would say that this is
an additional challenge

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:00.661
for this community.

00:31:00.661 --> 00:31:02.846
I think Jackie is
absolutely right.

00:31:02.846 --> 00:31:04.220
You've got to have
the principles

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.720
of human-centered
design if you're

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.340
going to make a difference.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.310
You've got to put yourself in
the position of that client.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.770
Now, here's something
where I think

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:15.920
is the biggest challenge
in respect of human rights

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:19.040
abuse, which is that
it's not safe for those

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.810
who are abused to report it.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:25.170
This is spoken as someone
who's obviously not

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.390
from a tech state.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.230
If there's a way for the girl
in Northeast Nigeria who's

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.870
being threatened by Boko
Haram, the woman in Congo who's

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.920
having domestic or
sexual violence,

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.280
the people in Douma
who are getting

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.630
attacked by chemical weapons--

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.370
if there's some way
of allowing them

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:47.390
to anonymously but credibly
post in a way that can't then

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:49.820
be tracked back either
by their government

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.040
or by their husband
et cetera, I think

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.149
that could be a
really important--

00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:57.440
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Witness
is doing something on that.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.320
DAVID MILIBAND: Because that is
where the impunity comes from.

00:32:02.506 --> 00:32:04.880
JACQUELLINE FULLER: You have
to be very smart, obviously,

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.200
about the reporting.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.830
I think some of us
when we just use

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.960
our cameras or whatnot
don't understand that there

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.650
could be watermarks or whatnot.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:18.611
So I think Witness is someone
who's doing good work.

00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:20.985
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask you
a question about the design

00:32:20.985 --> 00:32:23.987
challenge of resettlement.

00:32:23.987 --> 00:32:26.570
I read an article recently which
really troubled me suggesting

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.220
that the UK was doing a
much worse job than Germany,

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.130
for instance, in this
regard, because we give

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.849
a fixed budget per refugee.

00:32:33.849 --> 00:32:40.232
And therefore, many refugees
that settled in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:40.232 --> 00:32:42.687
It seems like a fundamental
design challenge in an area

00:32:42.687 --> 00:32:44.651
where maybe data
analytics and insights

00:32:44.651 --> 00:32:47.106
could be brought to
bear to do a better job.

00:32:47.106 --> 00:32:49.570
What are your best practices?

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:51.052
DAVID MILIBAND: Great question.

00:32:51.052 --> 00:32:53.390
Perfect, lovely question.

00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:59.020
The US also gives a
fixed amount-- $3,375

00:32:59.020 --> 00:32:59.800
to get resettled.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.600
And it's the same if
you're in Boise, Idaho

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:04.180
as if you're in Oakland.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.750
And in Oakland, the security
deposit on a apartment--

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:11.050
I probably don't need to tell
you-- cost $2,250 apparently.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.880
In Boise, it's $750.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.070
And surprise,
surprise, the issues

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.250
of debt for refugees
arriving in the Bay Area

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:25.060
are much greater than the
issues of debt arising in Boise.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:30.400
So one, standard
cookie cutter services

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.200
don't work well in any context.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.530
You've got to personalize them.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:34.970
Some people have got
mental health issues.

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:36.580
Some people have got
English language issues.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.496
You've got to try and
personalize the service.

00:33:38.496 --> 00:33:40.480
And one of our big
drivers that we

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.430
have around outcomes
and evidence

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:44.939
apply in our US programs as
well as in our global programs.

00:33:44.939 --> 00:33:46.480
If you click on--
well, actually, you

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.354
can't click on the
[INAUDIBLE] at the moment,

00:33:48.354 --> 00:33:50.050
but we can find a
way of getting you

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:51.020
the evidence of what we know.

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.970
So the first thing is
you're right you've

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.350
got to personalize it.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.380
Secondly, there's a
really important question.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.280
Which people should get
sent to the Bay Area,

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.230
and which people should
get sent to Boise, Idaho?

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:03.730
And at the moment, it's done
in a relatively rough and ready

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:03.910
way.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:05.920
But we're doing a project
with Stanford University

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.045
that I think you would be
interested in with Jeremy

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:10.159
Weinstein and his team there.

00:34:12.886 --> 00:34:14.469
If you actually
developed an algorithm

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:17.620
for where you deploy people,
you can get 20%, 30%,

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.602
or even 40% improvements in
their chances of success.

00:34:20.602 --> 00:34:22.810
And I think they've published
an article in a journal

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:23.601
somewhere about it.

00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:25.600
But the second thing
is, let's figure out

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.560
where to send people.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:28.659
Even before you start
spending the money, where

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:31.704
you send people can
make a big difference.

00:34:31.704 --> 00:34:33.120
What kind of skills
have they got?

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.120
What kind of skills are needed?

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:39.210
What kind of community is
there is really important.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:41.560
The third and most
important point

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.004
is that while the money may
run out after three months,

00:34:44.004 --> 00:34:45.920
the problems don't run
out after three months.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.639
And so you got to see
people through for longer.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:51.730
And often, the
biggest challenges--

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:53.800
they only emerge in
a post-trauma phase

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.320
not in the immediate
trauma of arrival.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.360
So there's a lot we've
got still to learn,

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:02.125
but I'm confident that
we're taking seriously

00:35:02.125 --> 00:35:03.340
the really tough things.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.180
So I was in Dallas visiting
our US office there,

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:07.957
and a guy came up to me.

00:35:07.957 --> 00:35:09.040
He's a local psychiatrist.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.980
He's volunteering with us.

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:13.330
It shows you that the
kind of personalisation

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:17.636
of services that you need
is really wide ranging.

00:35:17.636 --> 00:35:20.010
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Let me
take a question from the Dory.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.750
So this is from Joseph.

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:23.920
So how does the ROI--

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.920
Return On Investment--
for tech aid

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.480
compare with that
of traditional aid

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.774
of basic needs such as medicine,
food, shelter, et cetera.

00:35:31.774 --> 00:35:33.190
And what framework,
if any, do you

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:36.636
use to assess when to
deploy which type of aid?

00:35:36.636 --> 00:35:38.260
DAVID MILIBAND: Well
thank you, Joseph.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.220
It's a good question.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:43.010
I think the way to answer
it is to think as follows.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:47.830
First of all, your
category of non-tech aid

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.270
needs to be broken down a bit.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.890
So for example, you mentioned,
I think, food and tents.

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.820
The best thing to give
to people is cash.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.903
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Agree.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.810
DAVID MILIBAND: Which
immediately takes you back

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:05.560
into tech questions, but
cash is an empowering,

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:07.540
choice-based mechanism.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:13.060
It also has an advantage way
beyond even the most efficient

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.316
food system or tent giving
or fleece giving system.

00:36:15.316 --> 00:36:17.237
Do you know what it is?

00:36:17.237 --> 00:36:18.820
No, you were saying
yeah as if I was--

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.320
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
No, I'm agreeing

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.150
that unconditional
cash transfers

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:24.310
through mobile technology
are great innovation.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:27.220
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, the
unique advantage it has

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.020
is that it brings money back
into the local community

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.410
for the benefit of
the host community.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:39.700
The tents and the food is
usually sourced a long way out.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.140
We did a study in
Lebanon to show

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.780
that for $100 of cash
that is given to refugee,

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:46.850
$214 circulates in
the local economy.

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:51.170
So don't just think about
as tech versus survival,

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:53.050
I think he said.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.750
Secondly, we are running
value for money studies

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.010
across different products.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:59.770
How much does it cost to
set up latrines in Jordan?

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.650
How much does it cost to
set up latrines in Iraq

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:03.760
even within Iraq?

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.670
What's the cost of
a survivor's program

00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:10.990
for gender-based violence
versus a vaccination program?

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.650
Those can raise
difficult questions,

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:13.960
but they're worth asking.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.890
They don't fit into an easy
teach versus non-tech--

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.330
I think just to give you
a really profound example,

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:24.010
we found that
diagnosis of pneumonia

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.990
was really low in the areas
that we worked among kids--

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:29.710
20% more or less.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.920
And the way we got from a
20% diagnosis of pneumonia

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.659
by parents and carers
to a 65% diagnosis--

00:37:36.659 --> 00:37:38.950
they'd been issued with
stopwatches by the World Health

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.480
Organization, I think.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.340
But the carers and
the parents weren't

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.470
able to count up to
the 40 or 50 or 60

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:49.090
breaths that were meant to
be counted within the minute.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.180
So we issued a
necklace of beads,

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.990
and it requires the carer
or the parent simply

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.456
to flick a beat down
for every breath.

00:37:59.456 --> 00:38:01.830
And when the child's number--
and it's different necklace

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.360
for different aged kids.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.430
But when the number of breaths
reaches a dangerous level,

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.484
the color of the beads changes.

00:38:08.484 --> 00:38:10.150
And when the color
of the beads changes,

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.130
that then tells you
what medicine to apply,

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.820
and we got our detection
rate up to 65%.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.820
Now, it's not a
high-tech solution,

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:22.692
but it's a very high
value for money solution.

00:38:22.692 --> 00:38:23.650
JACQUELLINE FULLER: OK.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.024
I think we have
another question.

00:38:26.974 --> 00:38:28.390
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your time.

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:30.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.370
I'm not a Googler.

00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:33.800
I'm actually from TIAA-CREF,
which is a teacher's pension

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.480
fund here in the United States.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.325
I work very closely with
Karen in various fund raising

00:38:39.325 --> 00:38:40.530
activities.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:45.300
I noticed that the IRC has
done some pilot microlending

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.922
programs in California.

00:38:47.922 --> 00:38:49.800
I'm very excited
about this program.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.640
My question to you is, how
important is microlending

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.685
in your view as a CEO of IRC?

00:38:56.685 --> 00:38:58.102
Within your
organization, how much

00:38:58.102 --> 00:38:59.559
would you support
and promote that?

00:38:59.559 --> 00:39:01.989
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, three
of our offices around the US

00:39:01.989 --> 00:39:04.530
have got what we call centers
for economic opportunity, which

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.749
are doing business loans.

00:39:06.749 --> 00:39:08.040
I tell you the inspiring thing.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.050
We do car loans in
many of our offices--

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:12.390
I think 13 or 17 of our offices.

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:16.680
The repayment for car loans
among refugees is 98%.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:20.700
In case you didn't know--

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.220
you can Google this--
but the repayment rate

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:27.330
amongst the rest of
the population is 88%.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.460
So it's quite a good push
back against the idea

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.490
that refugees are feckless
and irresponsible people.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:36.360
They pay back their car loans
with extraordinary commitment.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.480
But we're excited about this
economic opportunity model.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.749
We want to spread it.

00:39:40.749 --> 00:39:43.290
We're trying to tap in some of
the financial institutions who

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.885
work on the community
reinvestment trust areas.

00:39:45.885 --> 00:39:48.810
It's not quite the
right wording of it.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.160
So I think it's a good model.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.280
We have quite a lot of
experience of small business

00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.860
loans for women entrepreneurs
around the world

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:59.400
which are also very, very
successful and really quite

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.910
positive.

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:03.510
There's a big debate,
it's worth saying, about

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:05.820
whether microlending
is the world's

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.770
on the sorts of the
problems of poverty,

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.200
because there's
quite a lot of data

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.110
now to show that it's not
as simple as it sounds.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.770
And there's now quite
a lot of dispute

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.990
about the long-term
income effects,

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.740
but that's for another day.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.740
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Unconditional cash transfers

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.080
are showing very
strong results--

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.900
and then on top of that,
probably specific loans

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.610
for specific purposes.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.514
Great.

00:40:31.514 --> 00:40:32.055
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:32.055 --> 00:40:33.290
My name's Rachel Taber.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.280
I work with 1959 Coffee Company.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.450
We help refugees find jobs
in the coffee industry,

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.107
and I'm former IRC Oakland.

00:40:40.107 --> 00:40:41.190
DAVID MILIBAND: Fantastic.

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.356
How have you got all these
amazing people into this?

00:40:43.356 --> 00:40:45.705
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
Yeah, you're the draw.

00:40:45.705 --> 00:40:48.070
AUDIENCE: But I was
curious about a comment

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:50.577
you had made originally about
how three offices had to close

00:40:50.577 --> 00:40:52.827
and that you would
touch upon that later.

00:40:52.827 --> 00:40:54.910
And I think for those of
us in the service sector,

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:57.671
we're so distanced
from what is going on

00:40:57.671 --> 00:40:59.820
in DC and with the
current administration.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.880
And I just didn't know
if you had any light

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.982
to shine on that info,
how you see it going now,

00:41:04.982 --> 00:41:06.440
how you see it
going in the future.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:10.270
You say a 45,000 person
ceiling and 21,000 coming in,

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.360
and we're all like--

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.060
you know.

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:15.120
So just anything you
can share on that--

00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.754
DAVID MILIBAND: Thanks
for giving me the chance.

00:41:17.754 --> 00:41:19.170
The numbers are
as I've described.

00:41:21.992 --> 00:41:24.200
There have been no congressional
hearings about this.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.330
It's the Department of Homeland
Security who run the interviews

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.170
around the world.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:30.880
Obviously, DHS didn't
exist in your time,

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.880
but the predecessor did.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:36.460
And we've got to
generate some pressure.

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.430
So it doesn't matter
if you're in a--

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:40.080
some people say, well, I've
got a Democratic congressman,

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:40.980
so it doesn't matter.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.160
No.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.576
Your congressman
could make a fuss

00:41:42.576 --> 00:41:45.930
about this issue to try and
get some congressional pressure

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:46.470
on it.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.360
I'm going to see the governor
of Washington state tomorrow up

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.420
in Washington state,
surprisingly enough,

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:55.500
from Seattle.

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.675
Although is it Olympia?

00:41:56.675 --> 00:42:00.130
Is that the capitol
of Washington state?

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:05.250
So we've got to
try and generate--

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:07.290
my way into this is to
say, this program is

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:10.680
going to be killed
unless people wake up,

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.110
because that's the
clear trajectory.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:17.160
And it's bureaucratic
strangulation

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.490
that's going on at the moment.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.324
The facts are plain.

00:42:21.324 --> 00:42:23.281
The numbers are actually
published by the State

00:42:23.281 --> 00:42:24.170
Department-- the PRM.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:25.692
The Population, Refugees
and Migration part

00:42:25.692 --> 00:42:26.730
of the State
Department publishes

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.262
the number of refugees coming
in, so it's not a secret.

00:42:29.262 --> 00:42:30.720
But there's so much
else going on--

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.220
I don't need to say-- that
it's quite hard to get

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.810
some hearing on this issue.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:37.800
But I do think this
point that the cry

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:41.340
about the fate of the people
in Syria is absolutely right.

00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.930
But there are small
things that can

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.182
be done for equal
numbers of people

00:42:45.182 --> 00:42:47.640
who managed to escape from
Syria that aren't yet being done

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.815
whether they're needing
employment support in Jordan

00:42:49.815 --> 00:42:52.074
or whether they're
needing resettlement here.

00:42:52.074 --> 00:42:54.615
JACQUELLINE FULLER: We have kind
of a follow on from the Dory

00:42:54.615 --> 00:43:00.420
on that from [INAUDIBLE]
who asks, so how

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:02.670
does the IRC approach refugee
resettlement in today's

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.920
environment where an increasing
number of politicians

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.510
and Western democracies
are adopting

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.790
anti-immigrant rhetoric
and policy stance?

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.498
You've kind of touched
on this, but we're

00:43:10.498 --> 00:43:13.350
seeing this across a number
of different countries

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:15.510
all at the same time
sort of surprisingly.

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:17.790
So what's been most
effective that you've

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.310
seen that you can do and
then general public can do?

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:21.390
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, the
only thing that is effective

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:22.500
is not me talking.

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.650
It's refugees talking.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.990
What people will remember
from the hour we've had

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.380
together is you
speaking, because it's

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.050
the real human story.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.460
And I think that
we have got to do--

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:37.510
we spend very little
on communications

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.940
and advocacy, because
we want to say, look.

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:43.120
90% of our money goes into
the field into our programs.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:48.070
But actually, storytelling
of the refugee,

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.880
the staff, the emergency--

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.880
that's really important.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.610
We were talking beforehand
about trying to do a better job

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.310
for Googlers so that if
you're one of the 5,000--

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.690
hopefully it will
become 10,000--

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:01.180
Googlers who are
supporting IRC, you'll

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:05.390
get to see more of the
difference that you're making.

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:10.790
But I think generally we've got
an amazing social media team,

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:12.880
but they're doing
it on a shoestring.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.460
The most powerful
thing is to get

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:18.040
people talking in
their own voices

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.620
with their own stories
and their own credibility,

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:22.990
because it's so much
harder to point the finger

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.760
and say, no, that's spin.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.920
It can't be spin if you
are the person who's

00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.961
actually been through it.

00:44:30.761 --> 00:44:31.260
Who's next?

00:44:33.289 --> 00:44:35.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here today,

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:38.970
for the work that you do,
and for sharing it with us.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.670
How do you change somebody's
mind or heart in one minute?

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:43.170
You mentioned that
whether it's a politician

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.753
or whether it's a
member of our family

00:44:44.753 --> 00:44:46.790
or a coworker that thinks
that a refugee might

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.670
be a terrorist or
a danger to them--

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.225
if all we have is one minute,
with anybody else in the world,

00:44:51.225 --> 00:44:53.600
you might be able to provide
one minute of how you change

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.050
somebody's heart or mind.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:56.342
DAVID MILIBAND: Well, we have
this business radio show.

00:44:56.342 --> 00:44:58.799
I don't know how many of you
know this radio show in the UK

00:44:58.799 --> 00:45:00.760
called "Just a
Minute" where you have

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.830
to speak without
hesitation, repetition,

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.590
or deviation for one
minute on any subject,

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:07.810
and then people press a
buzzer if you hesitate,

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:09.010
repeat, or deviate.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.580
So it's a brilliant program.

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.074
I'm not going to get into that.

00:45:12.074 --> 00:45:12.740
I tell you what.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.370
There's two approaches
to your minute.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:18.160
There are people like
me who are probably

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:22.310
a minority of the population who
like as many facts as possible.

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:23.970
So I'm like Mr. Facts.

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.710
That would be the
way to persuade me.

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:29.680
And so one in 3.64
billion chance

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.050
of being killed by a
refugee in America.

00:45:34.587 --> 00:45:36.670
88% of the world's refugees
are in poor countries,

00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:38.520
not in rich countries.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.260
America's only taking 90,000
in a population of 25 million

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.551
refugees, et cetera, et cetera.

00:45:42.551 --> 00:45:46.630
So there's a fact-based
approach, which probably is not

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:47.740
the majority taste.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.622
Or there's is a
story-based approach,

00:45:50.622 --> 00:45:53.080
which is essentially to take
the individual story-- to take

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:57.010
the story of a young man
born in Budapest in 1936.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.480
He has rheumatic fever.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.444
He escapes when the Soviet
Union crushes Hungary in 1956.

00:46:02.444 --> 00:46:03.360
He's helped to escape.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.550
He goes to a city
college in New York.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:05.440
He gets his PhD at Berkeley.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.170
He's "Time" man of
the year in 1997.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.941
And he's Andy Grover, and
he's the founder of Intel.

00:46:09.941 --> 00:46:11.690
The trouble with the
statistics approach--

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:12.340
JACQUELLINE FULLER:
And, by the way,

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.300
we could as Google
tell those stories

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.880
with some of our founders
and CEOs and leaders.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.930
Google would not be who we
are without folks who have

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.150
been given the opportunity.

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:25.733
DAVID MILIBAND:
Sergei did a big thing

00:46:25.733 --> 00:46:27.925
when he turned up
at the airport.

00:46:27.925 --> 00:46:30.220
He was there at San
Francisco airport.

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:34.480
That was a big statement.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.310
But the problem
with the statistics

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.149
is that people don't
like statistics.

00:46:38.149 --> 00:46:39.690
The problem with
the individual story

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.630
is that the people
can, say, oh, yeah.

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:41.505
But that's one story.

00:46:41.505 --> 00:46:43.310
That's not the typical.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:49.180
So the best form of elevator
pitch is to combine the two.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.632
But really, I think all
you can do in a minute

00:46:51.632 --> 00:46:52.590
is get people to think.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:54.184
You can't persuade
them in a minute.

00:46:54.184 --> 00:46:55.600
You can get them
to think, and you

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.050
go from thinking to
rethinking to persuading.

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.200
And one of the big challenges--

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.090
sorry, this doesn't
sound pretentious

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:05.950
or finger pointing--

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:08.890
but one of the dangers
of what you've all

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.530
managed to do over
the last 20 years

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:17.800
is that the space for thinking,
rethinking, and persuading

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.510
is being squeezed
rather than expanded.

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.080
And that's being
debated in Washington

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.950
with Mark Zuckerberg's
performance today.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:31.030
But it's an irony that the
world has become quantumly more

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.190
connected over
the last 20 years,

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.640
but the space for people
to persuade each other

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.180
has become quantumly
shrunk over the last 20

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.780
years in my perspective.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:44.512
People are talking to
people who agree with them.

00:47:44.512 --> 00:47:46.720
They're being targeted by
people who agree with them.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.335
Politics has become
about mobilization

00:47:48.335 --> 00:47:49.960
of people who are
already on your side,

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.197
not persuasion of people
who are not on your side.

00:47:52.197 --> 00:47:53.530
That's not only because of tech.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:55.990
I mean, in this country it's
because of campaign finances.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:57.240
It's because of redistricting.

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:04.240
It's because of a range of
undemocratic dysfunctions.

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:07.520
I don't want to sound
pompous about it,

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:13.300
but creating democratic space
for thinking, rethinking--

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:20.110
for hearing, thinking,
rethinking, persuading--

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:25.630
hearing, listening,
thinking, rethinking,

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:30.820
persuading is one of the
great challenges of the age.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:34.630
Because if we're
not able to exhibit

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.990
those virtues of hearing
and listening and thinking

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:41.230
and rethinking, then the central
promise of a free society

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:42.490
is lost.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:46.090
And it is a extraordinary
state of affairs

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:50.300
that 25 years after the
fall of the Berlin Wall,

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.810
the countries of autocracy
and of dictatorship

00:48:55.810 --> 00:49:00.730
think that they
are the future not

00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:04.840
the countries of liberal
democracy and free thought.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.930
And the most
extraordinary thing is

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:10.240
that many of the people who
live in liberal democracies

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.640
think it's the dictatorships
that are the future.

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.000
I'm going to get this
wrong, but something

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:23.740
like 60% of under 25's
in democratic societies

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:27.400
think China does a better job
of thinking through its policies

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.254
than the West.

00:49:29.254 --> 00:49:30.920
I haven't got the
statistic quite right,

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.400
but there's a book
by a man called

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.480
called Yascha Mounk which
is really interesting

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:36.610
book about the
fate of democracy.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.540
And the point is
that in some ways,

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.280
the Chinese are
doing a brilliant job

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.260
of being strategic.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.030
They're doing a
brilliant job at thinking

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:49.600
over a 10, 15, 20-year
span, and they're

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.330
doing a brilliant job of joining
up their different policies.

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:53.950
Without wishing
to get political,

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.575
there are plenty of
Western democracies

00:49:55.575 --> 00:49:58.480
that don't exhibit that
kind of strategic clarity

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.510
over two days, never
mind two or 20 years.

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:06.410
And so your question,
I think, leads

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:09.010
into a really important debate--
which is obviously something

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:11.890
for a different
occasion-- but does

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:14.010
speak to something
that Jackie said

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:17.560
that I think is really important
which is that the stand off

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.400
in respect of refugees
is a symptom of a deeper

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.250
set of a deeper malaise.

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:26.950
And the argument in my book
is that after the Second World

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:30.070
War, the better
treatment of refugees

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:32.170
was a harbinger of the
peace and prosperity that

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.128
would come from a different
international order

00:50:34.128 --> 00:50:35.260
after the Second World War.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:38.260
The danger now is that the
mistreatment of refugees

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.840
is a harbinger of a
worse international order

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.080
over the next generation, and
that's what together we've

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.001
got to sort out.

00:50:45.001 --> 00:50:46.000
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Wow.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.027
Well, join me in thanking
David for his talk today.

00:50:49.027 --> 00:50:49.527
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:49.527 --> 00:50:50.505
Thank you so much.

00:50:50.505 --> 00:50:52.005
DAVID MILIBAND:
Thank you very much.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:57.140
JACQUELLINE FULLER: Again,
