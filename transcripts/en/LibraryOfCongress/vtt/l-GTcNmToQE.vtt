&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.030
&gt;&gt; Denise Woltering-Vargas:
Good afternoon.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.070
I'd like to start, I know
we're running a little behind.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.360
My name is Denise
Woltering-Vargas.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.410
I am the Program Manager
at Tulane University Center

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.950
for Latin American Studies.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.260
Thank you.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.970
And I've been working with
the Americas Awards since 2011

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.440
with Julie Kline, the
founder's supervision guidance

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.760
and direction.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.730
She's been very helpful
in helping me

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.090
to program our program here
in D.C. I'd like to say thanks

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.950
to Pamela Jackson at the Center
for the Book and Georgette Dorn

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.850
from the Hispanic Division.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.970
Good afternoon and welcome
to the 2016 Americas Award.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.300
On behalf of the Consortium of
Latin American Studies Programs,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.540
myself at Tulane and Lisa
Finelli at Vanderbilt,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.990
we welcome you to
today's ceremony.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.600
The Americas Award was
founded in 1993 by Julie Kline

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.940
at the Center for Latin
America and Caribbean Studies

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.890
at the University of
Wisconsin in Milwaukee.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.070
This award is one of the most
important programs of CLASP.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.980
It is where we get the most
impact outreach out of teaching

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.730
and engaging about Latin
America within the community

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.780
and within classrooms.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.840
Awards are given up to two
books each year and are selected

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.970
for their distinctive
literary quality,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.320
cultural contextualization,
exceptional integration of text,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.100
illustration and design and
potential for classroom use.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.320
And that is an important
part to us.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.130
Its ability to be used in
classrooms and teaching.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280
The goal of the award
is to link the Americas

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.580
to reach beyond geographic
borders, focusing, instead,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.090
on cultural heritages
within the hemisphere.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.420
The committee, this year we
had an excellent committee.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.740
Some of the committee
members are here.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.120
The Americas Award review
committee was comprised this

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.160
year of teachers, community
activists and librarians

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.030
from Tennessee, North
Carolina, Wisconsin, New Mexico

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.320
and right here in
Washington D.C. In the fall,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.260
the books are submitted,
and beginning in Mach,

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.640
the committee gathers via
Skype and Google Hangout

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.110
and other alternative conference
calls in a series of meetings

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.580
to make very important
decisions.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.690
These conversations are
enlightening, insightful

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.780
and at times very spirited
and show the passion

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.080
that the committee members feel

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.810
about the diverse
cultures of Latin America.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.520
Lisa and I are extremely
grateful for the hard work

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.090
of the committee and
the care that they put

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.880
into choosing the
award each year.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.080
We would like to say
a special gracias

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.880
to Kyra Phillips Shnore
[phonetic] at the University

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.530
of New Mexico for her
extra help this year.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.250
Stepping in to help coordinate
committee conversations.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.700
A unique element of the
Americas Award, as I mentioned,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.770
is the ability to be
used in K12 classrooms.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.050
The award emphasizes the
potential for classroom use.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.520
So as you see the books cycling
behind me, you'll see snippets

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.940
of committee members' opinions,
thoughts, ideas and ways

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.890
that they see this award being
incorporated into the classroom,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.220
as well as recommended
grade levels.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.140
Educators have developed and
continued to develop pre-K

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.330
through 12 curricula to
be used with each book.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.450
If you're interested in
learning about these resources

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.870
and participating in other
opportunities that we have,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.770
please visit on our
website claspprograms.org.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.360
It's on the end of
this screen slideshow.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.230
And this year's program features
a special educator workshop

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.090
tonight, this evening, across
the street from Busboys

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.410
and Poets at Mulebone.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.050
We'll have a teacher workshop
highlighting this year's award

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.680
winner, Ashley Hope
Perez and Alma Flor Ada.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.340
So please join us.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.810
I'd like to hand it over to one

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.110
of our committee
members, Paula Mason.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.110
&gt;&gt; Paula Mason: Hello everyone.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.860
My name is Paula Mason, and
I'm a review committee member

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.390
for the Americas Award
and a public librarian

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.200
from the Milwaukee area.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.260
As a librarian, I find that one
of the most valuable aspects

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.750
of this award is the annotated
bibliography that we create

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.740
of commended and
honor book titles,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.380
along with our two
award winners.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.730
You'll find all these titles
listed in our program book

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.870
and showing on the screens.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.240
To highlight just a few of
these suburb commended titles,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.240
I'm going to just discuss just
a few of the themes that we saw.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.670
So, several of them touched on
important and relevant topics,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.110
such as breaking down
barriers in our community

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.090
and dispelling stereotypes.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.370
Books such as the young adult's
debut from Marie Marquardt,

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.450
Dream Things True and Cynthia
Lord's A Handful of Stars,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.330
do an excellent job of giving
characters, giving us characters

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.550
that bridge divisions
in their communities.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.810
Also, Margarita Engle gave us
two fantastic books this year,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.140
The Picture Book,
Dream Drum Girl:

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.390
How One Girl's Courage Changed
Music and her child memoir,

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.510
Enchanted Air: Two
Cultures, Two Wings.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.910
In Dream Drum Girl,
illustrated by Rafael Lopez,

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.200
we witness Cuban musician,
Millo Castro Zaldarriaga desired

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.520
to play the bongo drums,
traditionally an instrument

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.700
that only boys could play.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.230
We learn that in courageously
breaking this stereotype,

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.290
she went on to become a
celebrated world-famous musician

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.860
in her own right.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.160
In all of these books,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.760
we see characters confront
seemingly impossible challenges

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.820
and find creative solutions.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.540
And in this way, as
readers, we can begin

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.850
to soar alongside them too.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.840
We're also honored today
to be in the presence

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.520
of Alma Flor Ada, the
award-winning author

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.390
of many titles and a prevailing
authority on bilingual

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.630
and multicultural education.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.470
In her gem of a book, Island
Treasures: Growing up in Cuba,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.970
the reader can delight in
her many family stories

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.520
from her childhood, which
offer beautiful lessons.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.740
Filled with dozens of personal
photos and illustrations,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.640
this book feels like a
special and intimate journey

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.990
through precious family
heirlooms and stories,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:36.470
which is very fitting
considering the generous

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.970
and open nature of her family
as described in the book.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.970
We also saw similar themes
of inner generational wisdom

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.400
and the importance of passing
along family memories in books

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.330
such as My Tata's Remedies,
Los remedios de mi tata

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.260
by Roni Capin Rivera-Ashford,
illustrated by Antonio Castro L.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.930
and Monica Brown in her
picture book Maya's Blanket,

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.680
illustrated by David Diaz.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.130
These are just a few of
the many wonderful books

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.600
that are officially recognized
as our commended titles.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.920
I'm also very pleased to discuss

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.430
with you our two
honored books today.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.870
Our first title is
Growing up Pedro:

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.570
How the Martinez
Brothers Made it

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.900
from the Dominican Republic all
the Way to the Major Leagues

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.590
by author and illustrator
Matt Tavares.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.120
While there have been many
Dominican baseball players

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.170
in the major leagues, none have
kindled the deep enthusiasm

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.250
and allegiance and so many
fans as pitcher Pedro Martinez.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.810
In his nonfiction picture book
geared for elementary students,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.790
Tavares celebrates this
larger-than-life baseball hero

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.270
with incredibly realistic
paintings and simple text.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.970
We're transported to the
world of the Martinez brothers

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.270
as they made their way

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.820
from a poor Dominican
village all the way

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.920
to the US Major Leagues.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.670
The relationship between the
two brothers is the centerpiece

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.200
of the book, whether throwing
rocks at mangos as young boys

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.520
to practice their aim or
pitching against each other

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.290
in an historic game in 1996,

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.070
Pedro and Ramone maintain
their deep connection

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.890
and give each other the
strength they need to continue

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.020
through times of difficulties.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.050
Without his older brother,
Ramone, Tavares leads us

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.800
to believe there
would be no Pedro

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.380
on the same national stage.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.920
From a small boy watching
his big brother play

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.350
in their village
as a star pitcher,

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.860
oops, sorry, one second.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.320
Play in their village
to the star pitcher

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.620
that led the Red Sox to win
the World Series in 2004,

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.730
Tavares gives us a
beautiful portrait

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.880
of baseball's most prized
and beloved players.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.860
Growing up Pedro is also
available in Spanish,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.040
making it even more
accessible to our readers.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.560
Our second honor title is
another marvelous nonfiction

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.770
picture book, Funny
Bones: Posada and His Day

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.350
of the Dead Calaveras by author
and Illustrator Duncan Tonatiuh.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.140
His latest work presents
an extraordinary blend

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:02.890
of biography, art and
politics, focusing on the life

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.350
of Jose Guadalupe
Posada or Don Lupe,

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.690
as he was known at the time.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.600
Born in 1852, Posada
was most famous

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.840
for his socially conscious
depictions of calaveras,

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.290
the often comical skeletons that
are associated with Mexico's Day

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.280
of the Dead celebrations.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.720
With Tonatiuh's engaging
hand-drawn digitally collaged

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:27.060
artwork, we first see
Don Lupe as a child

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.190
with a natural talent
for drawing.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:30.670
And then as an adult,

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.590
continuously pursuing his
artistic passion while offering

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.290
social commentary on
the world around him.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.970
The full-page spreads inspired

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.070
by Don Lupe's work
actively probe the reader

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.410
to consider the deeper layers
of meaning behind his artwork,

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.830
such as critiques
about social class,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.470
rapidly changing technology

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.230
and violence during
the Mexican Revolution.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.050
This stunning work is
easily adapted to a variety

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.560
of classroom settings, spanning
subject areas such as art,

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.790
history and cultural studies.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.190
Additionally, Tonatiuh includes
a detailed author's note,

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.270
glossary of terms
and a bibliography

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.040
for readers interested in diving
further into Posada's work.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.560
Funny Bones is geared for
readers between grades three

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.330
to six, but older
students, including adults,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.630
are sure to learn
much from it as well.

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.670
We hope you enjoy this
title, along with all

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.620
of the other wonderful commended
and honor books on our list.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.700
And now, my fellow
committee member,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.800
Laura Kleinmann will
be presenting.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.100
Oh.

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:33.690
[ Inaudible ]

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.990
Sure. Yeah.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.510
&gt;&gt; Denise Woltering-Vargas:
We also wanted to, sorry,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.630
I was making sure
that we were on time.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.640
And I wanted to actually
introduce the Director

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.510
of the Hispanic Division,
Georgette Dorn.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:51.500
[ Applause ]

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.820
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: On behalf
of the Hispanic Division,

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.340
it's a great pleasure to welcome
our wonderful award winners.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.520
And also, Paula Covington
who came especially

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.310
from Vanderbilt to
be here with us.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.020
We began to host this
award since 1994,

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.680
after I met Julie Kline at
a conference in New Orleans

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.980
and she talked about CLASP.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.510
I thought it would be
wonderful to have it here

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.850
at the Library of Congress.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.440
So we've been doing
it since then,

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.020
and it's a really great
pleasure to have everybody here.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.870
And as you all know, I'm
sure the Hispanic collection

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.870
at the Library is the
largest in the world by far.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.400
So, it'd be very nice if all the
young children would eventually

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.760
become our users, as well as
the writers and the professors.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.870
It is my privilege to
introduce Pamela Jackson,

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.510
the head of the Center
for the Book.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:48.500
[ Applause ]

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.830
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson:
Hi, good afternoon.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:11:59.130
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.430
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.730
Welcome. Welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.790
I am Pam Jackson, Director
for Center for the Book,

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.760
and we are part of the National

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.290
and International Outreach
Unit here at the Library,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.590
a rather new one that's
specifically designed

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:14.060
and focused on sharing the
diverse and rich resources

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.800
of the Library collections

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.850
with people throughout
the world actually.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.610
So it's thrilling to be here
and to enjoy the conversation

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.450
that you've got planned today.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.630
One of the things I can
mention here is, you know,

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:28.860
it is the vision of
the Library of Congress

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.390
that we be the chief steward
of the record of knowledge

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.750
for America and the world.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.580
And in doing so, creating a
springboard to the future.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.640
And I'm looking at some of the
works and just very impressed

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.930
by what I see, both in terms
of the kind of compassion

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.220
and courage and industry and
excitement that's represented

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.630
in some of the titles
and the books

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.820
that are flashing
through the screen.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.450
And, you know, one of the things
that we're focused on here

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.440
in the Library as well, and
particularly, is our mission,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.820
which is to provide the American
people with a rich, diverse

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.620
and enduring source of knowledge
that can be relied upon

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.510
to inform, inspire and engage.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.240
And to support intellectual
and creative endeavors.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.450
And I just can't help to
be so moved by the beauty

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.980
and creativity that I see
in the books and the slides

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.270
that are being shown
here for us.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:25.540
They do indeed, and
in particular,

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.710
today's award winners, represent
a very diverse and rich source

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.960
of inspiration for us.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.170
Here at the Center for the Book,

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.470
which includes a Young
Reader Center and the Poetry

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.150
and Literature Center, we
promote books and libraries,

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.820
reading and literacy,
poetry and literature,

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.380
it is our mission
and it's our passion.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.350
And we do so because we
believe they're the best tools

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.950
against ignorance
and intolerance.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.460
And it's events like
these that gives a chance

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.440
to see diverse societies,
sometimes for some

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.060
of us it's going to be that
we're seeing ourselves.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.760
In other cases, we're
seeing folks

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.790
that are very different
from ourselves.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.600
And it's so important
for us to be seeing both

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.170
in the books we read, in
the books we talk about

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.080
and the people that are with
us talking about those books,

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.100
which makes today's event
all the more special.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.980
So, I'm grateful
here for this event.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.780
Our partnership with the
Hispanic Division and Tulane

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.390
and Vanderbilt Universities
as we enjoy this very special

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.550
and substantive 24th annual
Americas Awards for Children

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.850
and Adult Young Literature.

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.990
And I just have a couple
of housekeeping items

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.560
that I was tasked with
that I'll share now.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.560
So people should, if you haven't
already, just take a moment,

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.270
make sure your devices
are silenced

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.660
so that they're not
a distraction.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.720
And also, to make mention that
we are recording today's events.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.990
So if you do have to ask
a question you'll be part

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.290
of our webcast.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.210
Our webcasts are
available online,

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.470
by the way, so we're
at read.gov.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.750
Feel free to visit us there and
find a variety of author talks

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.050
and presentations such
as the one here today.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.430
And then, oops, I knew
that was going to happen.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:14.490
And then finally, we actually
are also delighted to share

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.780
with you that the authors'
books will be available for sale

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.980
after the presentation
outside this room.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.650
And with that, I think I'll
turn it back over to Denise

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.960
to continue along
with the program.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.510
Thank you so much
all for being here.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.500
[ Applause ]

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:38.950
&gt;&gt; Denise Woltering-Vargas:
Thank you so much.

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.660
We are very excited to
do this a second year,

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.800
to have a reader's theater
interpretation of an excerpt

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.570
of one of this year's winners.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.380
I'd like to introduce Laura
Kleinmann, a committee member

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.680
for the Americas Award.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.500
[ Applause ]

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.670
&gt;&gt; Laura Kleinmann: When I
started this, hello everyone,

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.010
I feel very proud
to have been part

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.880
of selecting these amazing books

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.900
and Echo immediately became
my seventh-grade son's

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.520
favorite book.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.490
And he is not a great reader,
but he loved that book.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.410
And that's why I had the idea

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.610
that seventh graders
would be the perfect age

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:34.310
to present a reader's theater
based on Echo by Pam Munoz Ryan

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:39.190
and we have right here
six seventh graders,

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:43.380
seven seventh graders from the
Oyster-Adams Bilingual School.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.650
It's a D.C. public school, the
oldest dual language schools

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.180
in the world actually.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.840
Our program started in the 70s.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.710
All of these young
people are bilingual.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:02.010
And their teacher is
Miss Anna Sebastian.

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.310
Don't think she's a student.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:05.130
She's actually their teacher.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.860
And I also want to acknowledge
my colleague, Steven Burch.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:12.960
I'm the primary librarian, and
he's our secondary librarian.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.650
So, these children
are actually his.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.710
Mine are littler.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:21.940
So I'm going to just
slide the mike this way

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:27.050
and get off the stage so
that they can come and share

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:31.800
with you the reader's
theater based on Echo.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.230
&gt;&gt; Reader's Theater, based
on Echo by Pam Munoz Ryan.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.080
Otto was lost in the forest.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.970
He had a book and a harmonica.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.800
He met three sisters in
an enchanted tree circle.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.340
They were doomed to
live in the forest

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:34.260
until they met a
secret messenger

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.740
with a musical instrument.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.630
They said, we are forever
joined by the silken [inaudible]

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:40.060
of destiny to you and to all

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.480
who will play this
harmonica in the future.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.690
As he left, he heard
these words.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.570
&gt;&gt; Your fate is not yet sealed.

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.630
Even in the darkest
night, a star will shine,

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.530
a bell will chime, and
path will be revealed.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.550
&gt;&gt; Otto was no longer afraid.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.280
Part one, Germany, 1933.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.340
Friedrich was a boy
who loved music.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.830
Friedrich had a large
birthmark on his birth

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.440
and a large imagination.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.110
He often imagined music
in his head and pretended

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.840
to conduct with his hands.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.210
Friedrich got bullied often.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.040
His father took him
out of school.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.330
Instead, he worked at the
Hohner Harmonica factory.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.950
&gt;&gt; Uncle, look at
this harmonica I found

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.610
in the old abandoned warehouse.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.090
&gt;&gt; This is beautiful.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:25.080
I have never heard a harmonic
with such a rich sound.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.100
It's like two people
play it at once.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.170
&gt;&gt; Look at the tiny [inaudible]
on the back of my paint.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.580
What is that?

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.760
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] this
look like a [inaudible].

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.690
It's not smart to
do such a thing.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.340
&gt;&gt; That night, as
Friedrich walked home,

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.320
he didn't worry about
being bullied.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.250
The music from the strange
harmonica hypnotized him

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.220
and made him forget
to be afraid.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.120
When he arrived at his
apartment, his sister

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.360
and his father got
into an argument.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.560
&gt;&gt; The harmonica, I'm
sorry to say, father,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.180
is not traditionally German
and is therefore offensive.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.400
People use it to play degenerate
music by Jews and Blacks.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.700
&gt;&gt; Degenerate?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.610
Music does not have a
race or disposition.

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:05.040
Every instrument has a
voice that contributes.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.650
Music is a universal language,
a universal religion of sorts.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.350
Certainly, it is my religion.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.030
Music surpasses all
distinctions between people.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.330
&gt;&gt; Some do not agree, father.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.350
And we should follow the
Nazi Party's guidelines.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.220
&gt;&gt; Don't be ridiculous.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.560
&gt;&gt; Friedrich began to worry.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.890
His father played
music with Jews.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.680
His father was a free thinker.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.600
Friedrich was informed
by his birthmark.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.570
People like him and his
father did not belong

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.320
in the new Germany.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.010
Soon after, the Nazis
came to arrest his father.

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.310
Friedrich was afraid.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.540
He ran to his uncle's apartment.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.980
&gt;&gt; So they have come already.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.200
&gt;&gt; Father said he would
be home in a few hours.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.500
&gt;&gt; No Friedrich.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.800
He will not be back
in a few hours.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:50.020
They have taken him to the
work camp where men freeze.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.590
&gt;&gt; This is all my fault.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:55.330
&gt;&gt; Nephew, none of us could
have known this would happen.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.630
This is not your fault.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.960
But right now, we don't
have time to debate.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.310
We must move quickly.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.870
We must get your
father out of there.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.010
We must contact your sister.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.750
&gt;&gt; Friedrich and his
uncle needed money.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.150
They wrote to Elisabeth.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.220
She sent a box of cookies
in the shape of swastikas.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.570
The box had a false bottom.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.720
It was filled with Reichsmarks.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.590
Friedrich would take
them as he bribed

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.490
to the commander at Dachau.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:19.990
It would be risky, but a
boy will be less suspicious

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:21.290
than a man.

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.180
Before he left, Friedrich
took out his harmonica

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.220
and played the Brahms
Lullaby one more time.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.620
He then packed it up and put
it in a box of harmonicas bound

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.900
for the United States
Marine Corps band.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.190
As he rode the train to Dachau,
his heart pounded with fear.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:37.590
Yet, as he stared out the
window, he heard these words

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.280
in the rhythm of the train.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.280
&gt;&gt; Your fate is not yet sealed.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.850
Even in darkest night,
a star will shine.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:45.150
A bell will chime.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.580
A path will be revealed.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.960
&gt;&gt; Friedrich was
no longer afraid.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.560
&gt;&gt; Part two, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania, 1935.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.820
Mike and Frankie Flannery
live at the Bishop's Home

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.270
for Friendless and
Destitute Children.

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.330
Mike was 11, and
Frankie was eight.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.940
Granny left them there because
she was too old to take care

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.120
of them and because it was the
only orphanage with a piano.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.060
She didn't know they
would be treated badly.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.380
She didn't know they
might be separated.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.680
She didn't know

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.520
that Headmistress Pennyweather
would confiscate the harmonicas.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.440
One night, Frankie climbed the
tree next to Mike's window.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.330
&gt;&gt; I just heard that tomorrow
some people are coming

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.630
to get boys.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:30.930
&gt;&gt; We're getting fostered out?

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.230
&gt;&gt; If they like us.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.970
What if Pennyweather tries
to separate us again?

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.830
&gt;&gt; I told you before,
we're not supposed

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.390
to get separated, remember.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.950
You and me, we stick together.

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:41.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you and me,
we stick together.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.030
&gt;&gt; Frankie left, and Mike
began to worry as usual.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.700
So many things could go wrong.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.060
Then he dared to dream.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.890
What if the people
wanted two boys?

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:50.820
What if he and Frankie
could feel loved again?

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.150
What if their new
home had a piano?

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.100
The next day, everything
changed.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.200
A lawyer named Mr.
Howard came to Bishop's

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.230
to find a music child.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.380
He represented Eunice
Dow Sturbridge.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.570
The woman was wealthy and alone
and wanted to adopt a child

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.190
who could play the piano.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.540
Pennyweather got the
piano tuned and had Mike

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.400
and Frankie play a duet
of America the Beautiful.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.540
Although Mr. Howard had come
for one child, he was so moved

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.130
by the music and the
boys and devotion

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.140
to each other, he
took them both.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.150
When they arrived at
the big, fancy house,

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.660
Frankie was excited, but Mike
couldn't help remembering his

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.240
grandmother's words.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.250
&gt;&gt; Granny always aid that
if something seemed too good

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.330
to be true, it was
probably a swindle.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.230
Who in the world would adopt two
boys without even meeting them.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.470
&gt;&gt; The introduction
didn't ease his mind.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.280
&gt;&gt; Michael, Franklin, this
is Eunice Dow Sturbridge.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.890
&gt;&gt; Mam, thank you
for adopting us.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.090
&gt;&gt; Are you going to
be our new mother?

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:43.610
You are much prettier
than we expected,

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.970
and you smell lots better
than Miss Pennyweather.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.110
&gt;&gt; Mrs. Sturbridge's eyes filled
with tears as she looked them

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.670
over and made a face as if
she'd just seen a dead animal

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:52.970
in the gutter.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:56.320
Then she turned and
hurried up the stairs.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.860
The next day, Mr.
Howard took them

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.880
to Central Philly
to buy new clothes.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.930
On the way home, they passed
a music store advertising

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:07.040
auditions for a band called
Hoxie's Harmonica Wizards.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.240
Mr. Howard went in and bought
the boys each a harmonica.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.620
Frankie's came from the display

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.780
by the register while Mike
picked up one from a box

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.360
in the back of the store.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.630
The last box on the
bottom caught his eye.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:20.840
Mike opened the box,
picked up the harmonica

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.120
and noticed a small red
M painted on the back.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.800
When he put it to his
lips, the sound was

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.930
so beautiful, he
almost felt happy.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.070
When he played America the
Beautiful for Mrs. Sturbridge

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.630
and Mr. Howard, it brought
tears to their eyes.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.930
Mike thought of a plan.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.110
&gt;&gt; Mrs. Sturbridge, I know
you only want one child.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:39.060
Will you adopt Frankie
if I'm out of the way?

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:44.390
I plan to try out for the famous
traveling harmonica band called

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.950
Hoxie's Harmonica Wizards.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.150
If I make it, I will live
will leave [inaudible].

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.030
&gt;&gt; Well, you are an
exceptional harmonica player.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.650
Are you sure this
is what you want?

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:55.550
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, it is what I want.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:58.120
&gt;&gt; Mike make the final audition,
and the family got invitations

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.140
to a special concert by
Hoxie's Harmonica Wizards.

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.440
That night, Mike realized

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.750
that he couldn't trust Mrs.
Sturbridge to keep Frankie.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.970
He woke his brother up, and
they crawled out of the window

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:09.110
to climb down the
tree and run away.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.060
Frankie made the climb, but
Mike lost his footing and fell.

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.660
The harmonica slid out of his
pocket, and he heard the strains

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.750
of the Brahms Lullaby
through the wind in the trees.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.040
As he lay on the ground,
staring at the sky,

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.550
he thought he heard some
strange yet beautiful words.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.270
&gt;&gt; Your fate is not yet sealed.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.490
Even in the darkest
night, a star will shine,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.620
a bell will chime, a
path will be revealed.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.940
&gt;&gt; Mike was not afraid.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:44.400
&gt;&gt; Part three, Southern
California, 1942.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.460
Ivy Maria had to
say goodbye again.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:48.290
She was leaving the
next morning.

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.920
She had to say goodbye to
her best friend Araceli.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.220
She had to say goodbye

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.080
to the other families
in the labor camp.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.030
She had to say goodbye
to her favorite teacher.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.030
And worst of all, she
had to say goodbye

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.220
to the playing the
harmonica solo on the radio

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.360
with her fifth-grade class.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.670
&gt;&gt; It's not fair.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.710
Can we at least wait one week?

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.630
Just until Christmas vacation.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.060
I hate moving, and I
thought we were finally going

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:12.350
to stay somewhere forever.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.950
&gt;&gt; Ivy, this move means
we'll have our own house.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.320
I will be in charge of 60 acres.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.350
And your mother will
have a washing machine.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.920
And you will go to a better
school with better teachers.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.280
Even the weather will be better.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.170
We cannot stay simply
because you want

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.080
to play the harmonica
on the radio.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:29.980
&gt;&gt; I don't want a new school.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.410
I love my teacher.

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.660
I love the weather.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.290
&gt;&gt; Ivy Maria knew that if it
were her brother Nando begging

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.760
to play one more basketball
game, her parents would say yes.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.080
They went to all of his games

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.380
yet called Ivy's
music frivolous.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.450
She also knew that her brother
was at war in the Pacific.

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:48.750
They hadn't heard
from him in a month.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.340
She could not use
him as an excuse

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.770
to argue with her parents.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.780
Before he left, Nando had asked
her to be a good little soldier

00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.920
and help mama and papa
while he was away.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.070
Her heart hurt as she went
outside to play her harmonica.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:03.200
Its beautiful sound
made her feel better.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.130
She remembered the day
her teacher had given

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.480
out the harmonicas to her class.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.720
&gt;&gt; These harmonicas were
donated to our school.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.250
They have been restored
like new.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.170
Each of you will get
one, and I will trust you

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.990
to take very good care of them.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.450
I will teach you to play.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:20.690
If we're good enough,
we'll play Auld Lang Syne

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:22.890
on the radio around
Christmastime.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.560
&gt;&gt; Ivy Maria's harmonica
was different than the rest.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.860
It shined brighter in the sun

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.190
and had a small red M
painted on the back.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.960
Ivy traced the M,
wondering what it meant.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.740
She played better and learned
faster than her classmates.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.680
Mrs. Delgado told
her she was gifted

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.830
and could probably learn how to
play any instrument she liked.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.130
Ivy beamed with pride.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.470
But now, she had to
leave it all behind.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.050
At least she could
take her harmonica.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.350
&gt;&gt; Look, here we are.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.550
This is our house, and if
you stand on tippy toe,

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.220
you can see the owner's house.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:52.640
&gt;&gt; Do they have any children?

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:55.460
&gt;&gt; Yes, a boy a little
older than Fernando who is

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.280
in the Marines and
two smaller girls.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.680
But they're not here right now.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.030
&gt;&gt; I hope they come home
soon, and I hope that they go

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.800
to the same school as I do.

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.760
Maybe they even like music.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.950
&gt;&gt; Papa looked at
mama over Ivy's head.

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:10.070
The family wouldn't
be coming home soon.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.130
They were Japanese-American
and had been sent

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:13.500
to an internment camp.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.190
Their house was boarded
up, and the plants

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.530
in their flowerbeds had
shriveled up and died.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.710
The vegetables were
rotting on the vine.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.240
Ivy Maria's papa told her

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.920
that the government had called
them enemies of the state.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.580
Only the oldest boy,
Kenny was not in the camp.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.950
He was in the Marines
fighting for his country.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.050
Ivy's family was there
to keep the farm running

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:34.960
so the owners wouldn't lose
everything they had worked for.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.230
As soon as Kenny had left, he
would come and visit the farm

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.500
and talk to Mr. Lopez
about the future.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.190
Ivy thought about
the two girls having

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:45.280
to leave their nice
house and felt sad.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.640
Soon, Ivy Maria forget
about her sadness

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.970
for the [inaudible] girls.

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.910
She had too much sadness and
shame to feel for herself

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:53.320
because her last name was Lopez,

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.520
and she had brown
skin and black hair.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.820
She was sent not to a good Main
school but to Lincoln Annex,

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.690
the Americanization school.

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.170
It looked like a barn
surrounded by dirt fields.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.600
She met a sixth grader
named Enacio [phonetic].

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:06.950
&gt;&gt; Why are we here?

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.020
&gt;&gt; To become an American and to
learn to speak better English.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.290
&gt;&gt; But I'm already American,
and I already speak English.

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.590
&gt;&gt; Enacio shrugged.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:15.890
Ivy was bored.

00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:17.960
Her teacher was nice but
wouldn't let her work ahead.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.240
All morning, Ivy finished her
work before the others and sat

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.750
with her hands folded
on the desk,

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.870
gazing out into the empty field.

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:27.340
The only good thing was that she
could still join the orchestra

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.260
after school at Lincoln Main.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.970
That night, papa was angry.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.580
&gt;&gt; My family has lived in
California for over 100 years.

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.630
My great-grandfather
worked on a ranch

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.280
when this very land
belonged to Mexico.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.830
It was not yet America.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:43.360
So it's fine if we join
them for music and sports.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.130
But only after school.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.290
It is fine if we
join them in a war.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.270
My own son is fighting
for a country.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.010
What nonsense is this?

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.290
&gt;&gt; At least in orchestra
rehearsal, Ivy felt equal

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:54.970
to Lincoln Main students.

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:56.860
After she had played
the harmonica in front

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.890
of the whole group,
the teacher explained.

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:00.190
&gt;&gt; Ivy, thank you.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.930
That was unquestionably
brilliant.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.230
You have promise, and I have
a feeling that you are going

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.190
to fall in love with the flute.

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.770
&gt;&gt; Before Kenny and
the Yamamotos arrived

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.390
to meet the Lopez, Ivy and
her mother entered the house

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.770
to make sure the property
wasn't damaged in any way.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:15.370
They discovered a
secret room filled

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:19.710
with the musical instruments
of many Japanese families

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.120
that had lost their homes.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.220
Ivy felt more connected
than ever to the Yamamotos.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:25.970
When Kenny arrived,
mama treated him

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.140
like she would her
own son Nando.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.170
As they walked over to
the Yamamotos' house,

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:36.120
Kenny and Ivy talked.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.420
&gt;&gt; I'm glad I [inaudible]
together, Ivy.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:40.820
I think we're more
alike than different.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.240
Your father told me you
signed up for orchestra.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.200
Did you know I was
in the orchestra,

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.400
and my sisters, they play flute?

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.970
I play violin.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:50.670
Mr. Danos [phonetic]
was our teacher.

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.970
Do you like him?

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:53.350
&gt;&gt; He's my favorite teacher.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.870
I love how he talks.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.630
He told us we have
to play majestically.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.540
&gt;&gt; Before Kenny left,
he asked Mr. Lopez

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.510
to send his sister's
flute so his family

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:03.060
in the interment camp.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.160
He knew that the music
would comfort them.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.580
Ivy knew Kenny wouldn't
take his violin

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.480
with him when he went to war.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.630
She took her beautiful
harmonica out of her pocket

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:15.620
with the red letter M painted
on the back and gave it to him.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:16.920
&gt;&gt; Are sure?

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.220
&gt;&gt; Ivy nodded.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.930
&gt;&gt; I promise I'll bring
it back to you some day.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:21.230
&gt;&gt; Kenny saluted Ivy.

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:22.590
She saluted back.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.040
&gt;&gt; Part four, New
York City, 1951.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.910
Finally, the silken thread of
destiny that linked all of those

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.710
who played Otto's harmonica
brought them together

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.410
for one magic night of
Concert of American Composers

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.750
at Carnegie Hall
in New York City.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:38.180
&gt;&gt; Friedrich Schmidt led
his father and his uncle

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.300
to their seats in Carnegie Hall.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.130
They were the first ones there
and marveled at the grandeur

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.540
of the red velvet
seats and golden walls.

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:46.840
&gt;&gt; I can't believe I'm going

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.590
to see my son conduct an
orchestra in Carnegie Hall.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.750
We have waited so many years
and traveled so many miles

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.050
for this momentous occasion.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.990
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is a dream come true.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:59.800
A high honor to conduct
musicians who have come from all

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.520
over the country to play
American music by Gershwin

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.200
and Rodgers and Hammerstein.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.980
And to have you with me,
I've never been happier.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:09.760
&gt;&gt; Back stage Mike Flannery said
one last goodbye to his brother,

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.340
Frankie, and Mr.
Howard and Aunt Eunie,

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.480
who had raised them
as their sons.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.480
&gt;&gt; My other brother playing the
piano solo at Carnegie Hall.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.820
I wish granny could
see you know.

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.780
&gt;&gt; She is with me every
time I sit down at a piano.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.430
She was with us the day that
Aunt Eunie decided to adopt us.

00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.160
If you listen carefully
and you will hear her

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.230
in the melodies of
Rhapsody in Blue.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.400
&gt;&gt; Kenny Yamamoto
sat in the first row

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.220
as the concert lights came up.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:37.050
Although Ivy Maria Lopez's
family couldn't make the long

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.770
journey from California,
the light in Kenny's eyes

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.680
as he gazed at her from the
audience gave her courage.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.230
She sat trembling with
excitement grasping her flute

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.600
as the orchestra tuned up in
the fabled Carnegie Hall waiting

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.220
for Friedrich Schmidt,
the famous conductor

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.930
and the accompanying Mike
Flannery, the famous pianist.

00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.370
Although they didn't
know it, Kenny carried

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:00.840
in his breast pocket the
strange beautiful harmonica

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.200
with the red M painted on the
back that linked them all.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.080
Just as the same harmonica had
given Friedrich the bravery

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.720
to save his brother
from the cow,

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.480
just as the same harmonica
had carved a path from Mike

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.240
to Aunt Eunie's heart, just

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.480
as the same harmonica had led
Ivy Maria to Mr. Daniels' life

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.780
as a musician, this very same
harmonica had stopped a bullet

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:23.930
from entering Kenny's chest
on the battlefield in Europe.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.840
And each of them in their
own way in their own time,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.880
as the enchanted
evening unfolded,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.330
would hear the distant
echo of the prophetic words

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.420
that had predicted
their destiny.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.820
&gt;&gt; Your fate is not yet sealed,
even in the darkest night,

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.980
a star will shine,
a bell will chime

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.510
and a path will be revealed.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:58.500
[ Applause ]

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:16.990
&gt;&gt; Denise Croker:
Good afternoon.

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:18.500
I'm Denise Croker.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.920
I teach English at the
Harpeth Hall School,

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.440
and all-girls independent
school in Nashville, Tennessee.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.410
And I'm pleased to
present the Americas Award

00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:29.410
to this year's recipients,

00:34:29.410 --> 00:34:33.100
Ashley Hope Perez
and Pam Munoz Ryan.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.410
At Harpeth Hall, one

00:34:34.410 --> 00:34:37.390
of the courses I teach
is world literature.

00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:40.520
One of my central goals is
to have my students travel

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:44.980
to other worlds vicariously,
to walk in another's shoes

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.240
and to develop empathy
with those who come

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.200
from different backgrounds.

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.930
I want them to look out a window

00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:54.660
as librarian Laurie Wilfong
[phonetic] describes it,

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:58.030
to view another culture
and to learn from it.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:02.730
Nigerian author Chinua Achebe
says, we lack imagination

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.600
when we cannot put ourselves
in the place of others.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.630
Literature has the
power to combat this.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.230
We can step into an imaginary
literary world and experience

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:16.440
so much beyond our own borders.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.570
Students, on the other hand,
or at least my students,

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.390
many of my students,
generally like to read books

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:25.180
that are more akin to
mirrors than windows.

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.610
They want to look into a book

00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:29.390
and see a character
very much like them.

00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:31.830
It's validating of
their experience.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.040
But truly, even when they
read about another teenager

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.860
who has the same
personality quirks, interests

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.310
or conflicts they have,

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.580
they also can take
a vicarious journey

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.740
of a person not unlike them,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.800
but who's undergoing very
different life experiences.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.100
The beauty of the two books

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:54.270
that have won our 2016
Americas Award is that they both

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:56.440
so definitely combine both.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.870
They are windows and mirrors.

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:02.560
They each present a real
lived-in world of the past

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.950
but inhabit it with
fictional characters

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:08.850
who present deeply felt
emotions as they respond

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:11.750
to the racial tensions and
discrimination on one hand

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.310
and the strong bonds
of friendship

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.880
and family on the other hand.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.550
Through these books, we can
learn about another country,

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:22.380
another culture,
another set of people.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.890
All eventually inhabiting
the Americas

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:26.990
and representing
the multifaceted

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:29.340
American experience.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.740
We ultimately return
to the great truth

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.730
that no matter the
place or the age,

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.300
human beings are
very much alike.

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.180
It is for us to determine

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.400
and embrace what links us more
closely, not what separates us.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.940
And in the words of a
Gloria Estefan song,

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.240
[foreign language spoken].

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.540
We see the same moon.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.440
We live on the same Earth.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:37:00.280
So let me tell you a
little bit about each

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.900
of the authors and books.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.750
Pam Munoz Ryan depicts
these links

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.920
in an ingenious way
in her book Echo.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.610
And as we just heard so
beautifully from the students,

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:17.850
it is an incredible work that
blends these three stories.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:21.240
Really an imaginative
tour de force.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:25.120
Echo begins with a legend,
a fable, that tells us

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.170
of how a boy meets three spirits
whose purpose is to save a soul

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.130
at the moment of death.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.250
This idea, along with
a special harmonica,

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.060
connects the three
stories in the book.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:41.920
The three young protagonists
experience the 20th century's

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.580
conflicts, in particular,
the wind up to the Holocaust

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.600
in Germany, the loss
of parents and a hope

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.860
to escape an orphan
home in Pennsylvania,

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:55.500
and the dual experience
of racism against Mexicans

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.770
and Japanese in California.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.510
Despite these apparent
differences in the stories

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:07.010
and hardships in each situation,
friendship, loyalty, kinship

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:12.110
and the power of music overcomes
suspicion and intolerance.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:16.100
A powerful final concert
unites the three characters

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:20.220
from these different worlds in
the poignant and uplifting end

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.940
to Munoz Ryan's novel.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:27.260
Because of the enduring
resonance of Echo,

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.510
we present the Americas
Award to Pam Munoz Ryan.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:50.670
[ Applause ]

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:53.680
&gt;&gt; Pam Munoz Ryan:
Oh, so lovely.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.550
First, I want to say thank
you to my publisher Scholastic

00:38:56.550 --> 00:39:00.170
for making it possible for me
to be here and for all of you

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:04.080
for coming out to
celebrate with me.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:08.160
And I'm very grateful
to the consortium

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.310
of Latin American Studies
Program for this lovely honor

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:17.010
and to be in the company of
Ashley Hope Perez and also to be

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:19.390
with Alma Flor Ada who
is speaking tonight

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.310
at the teacher's workshop.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:25.300
And also to see some
friends here, Lulu and Meg.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.130
So lovely to see you and so
special to celebrate with you.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:32.080
And to the committee members,
Denise Croker, Maria Sheldon,

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:35.390
Laura Kleinmann, Paul
Mason and Emily Chavez.

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:40.010
I'm thrilled that you
chose Echo, mil gracias.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.230
Sometimes the book I set
out to write isn't the book

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.740
that I ultimately write.

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:46.040
After I wrote The Dreamer,

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.150
I was researching what I
thought would be next book

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:52.720
about the nation's first
successful desegregation case,

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:54.650
Roberto Alvarez versus
the Trustees

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:57.560
of the Lemon Grove School
District when I happened

00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.550
on information that was
too tantalizing to ignore.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:04.050
Lemon Grove is a
community east of San Diego.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.990
And in 1931, the Chamber of
Commerce was actively trying

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:11.540
to recruit businesses and
families from the Midwest

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.610
to move to the community.

00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:17.340
They even had made beautiful,
large colored posters

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.400
that they were sending to
businesses in the Midwest

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.140
that proclaimed Lemon Grove,
the Pasadena of San Diego.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:31.180
In their fervor, the Chamber of
Commerce met in secret meetings

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.050
with the school board
members and decided

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:36.730
that when prospective companies
and residents came to visit,

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:40.350
it would be much more
desirable for the school

00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:43.150
to look less integrated.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:47.040
So they conspired to segregate
the elementary school.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.980
The day after the
two-week December break,

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:54.930
after the children had gone
home for the Christmas holidays,

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.910
the day they came back the
principal stood on the steps

00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:59.460
of Lemon Grove Elementary
School,

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:02.700
and as the children entered,
he separated the Mexican

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:07.270
and Mexican-looking children to
the side and had them escorted

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:10.620
to a makeshift school
down the road.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:14.100
The Mexican parents and children
were confused and appalled

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.960
by the pitiful conditions
of the alternative school.

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:22.300
They referred to
it as the barnyard.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.320
All but three Mexican
families refused

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.720
to send their children
to the school.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.750
They organized, and they went

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:30.880
to the District Attorney
in San Diego.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.360
They took the school
district to court and they won

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.510
in the lowest court in the land.

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:40.550
So precedent was never set.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.150
A few months later, everyone
went back to school together.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:48.100
It was a victory, however
small, and forgotten.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.690
Even so, the practice

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:54.450
of segregating Mexican-Americans
continued in California

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:58.610
and in districts in
California until the mid-40s.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:02.520
Those issues became
integrated and integral

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.160
to Ivy Maria's story in
Echo and ultimately woven

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.920
into the much larger social
justice themes in the novel.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.800
So there I was, researching
this court case

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.900
of the Lemon Grove
Historical Society,

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.020
a tiny little victorian
house and looking

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.030
through the 1931 school
yearbooks when I came

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:23.170
across a photograph
of an integrated group

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:27.210
of children sitting on the steps

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.490
of Lemon Grove Elementary
School,

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:33.770
each of them holding
a harmonica.

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:35.850
And when I asked the docent

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:39.140
about the photograph she
said, I said, what is this?

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.440
And she said, oh, you know,

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.730
that was before the whole
segregation issue happened.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:45.700
That was our elementary
school harmonica band.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:49.710
In the 20s and 30s almost every
school had one during, you know,

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:53.540
during the big harmonica band
movement in the United States.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.760
Really? There was a
harmonica band movement

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.100
in the United States?

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.440
For me to discover
a little-known part

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.970
of American history.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.120
That was rare and intriguing
and romantically linked

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.630
to the nostalgic harmonica
was like finding gold.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.510
I prayed it was true.

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.220
I went home and I
began to research

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.560
and I discovered
that indeed it was.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.860
At one time, there were

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.550
over 2,000 elementary
school harmonica bands

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:27.500
in the United States, including
the then famous Alfred Hoxie's

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.120
Philadelphia Harmonica
Band of Wizards.

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.480
The 60-member band
of boys who played

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.100
in Charles Lindbergh's
parade for three presidents,

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.430
including FDR's inauguration.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:43.550
How could I resist
taking this further?

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.180
I began to look in
Hoxie's band and discovered

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:52.050
that they use primarily one
harmonica, the same model

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:56.550
of harmonica in the picture
of the children on the steps

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:59.650
of the elementary school,
the Hohner Marine Band.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.500
My mind leaped.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.440
Two characters and their
stories began to take shape.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.370
Ivy Maria, a girl in a country
school harmonica band and Mike,

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:10.920
an orphan boy in
Philadelphia who wanted to be

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:16.640
in Hoxie's Band, which, by
the way, was full of orphans.

00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.540
How can a writer
resist such drama?

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:24.460
I began to wonder if by
some odd fate my characters

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:27.430
at different points in
time might have played the

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:28.930
same harmonica.

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:30.420
And if it was the
same harmonica,

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:34.530
where had it originated, and
who had owned it before them?

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:37.450
I began a correspondence with
the Hohner Harmonica Company

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:41.440
in Trossingen, Germany and then
went there to tour the campus

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.640
and museum of one of the oldest

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.330
and the largest harmonica
factory in the world.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:51.020
And during my tour I learned
about the six-pointed star

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.300
on the pre-World
War II harmonicas

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.260
and how Hitler insisted
it be removed

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.690
when he became Chancellor
of Germany.

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:01.340
And I discovered that
young boy apprentices used

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:03.610
to work in the factory.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:06.770
Friedrich's story began to
unfold, and it was there

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.960
in the factory museum
looking into the glass cases

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:13.370
of commemorative well-loved
and long-carried harmonicas

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:16.710
that I discovered the
evidence of a real-life miracle

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.870
that I could use in the
[inaudible] of my book.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:22.500
Now I had the premise
for three main stories.

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.380
And since the stories would
span 1933 through 1951,

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.220
I realized that my characters
would live during some

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.510
of the most dark and
challenging times in history.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:34.780
Friedrich in Hitler's Germany,

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.030
Mike and his little brother
Frankie during the Great

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:40.950
Depression, and Ivy Maria
during the years of segregation.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:42.480
How would my characters
carry on?

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.820
I wanted and needed to give my
characters a sliver of beauty

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.980
and light to which
they could cling.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.660
And given the harmonica,
that something,

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.300
that sliver, was music.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.910
But what powers did
the harmonica have,

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:59.260
and more importantly, how
had that power come about?

00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:00.560
Those questions led me

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.760
to imagine the harmonica's
backstory.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.230
I love the idea that the
harmonica might have a magical

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:11.610
history and maybe gave each
character confidence, strength

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:14.470
and a euphoric sense
of wellbeing.

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.810
So that is how my character's
stories became framed

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:20.460
in an original fairy tale
entwined in a witch's curse

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.440
and a midwife's prophecy.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.070
I hoe the reader will come
to understand the prophecy

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.000
and how it's woven
into the story and now

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.910
for the fourth time
you'll hear it,

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:32.580
your fate is not quite sealed,
even in the darkest night,

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.030
a star will shine,
a bell will chime,

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:38.120
and a path will be revealed.

00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.500
The writing of this
book was the same.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.610
I thought I was writing
one book, but instead,

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:45.350
I wandered down a path

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:49.580
and a much larger narrative
demanded to be written.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.380
Thank you.

00:46:51.380 --> 00:47:02.500
[ Applause ]

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.140
&gt;&gt; Denise Croker: And
now for our second book.

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:18.710
Ashley Hope Perez's Out
of Darkness is a book

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:20.560
that presents a somber chapter

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:25.180
of our nation's history while
also casting a glimmer of hope,

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:27.500
a way out of darkness.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:31.290
The novel begins with an
historical event in East Texas,

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:34.660
and I would say as a person
who lives outside of Texas,

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.470
a little known historical event

00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:38.920
that I was astonished
to learn about.

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.260
The explosion of the New
London School in 1937.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.540
Using this tragedy as
both climax and catalyst,

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:52.070
Perez weaves the fictional
stories of two teenagers, Naomi,

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:54.660
a Mexican-American
girl and Wash,

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:58.310
an African-American boy
brought together by a love

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.880
that is forbidden
by their society.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:03.910
This is not a story
with a fairytale ending.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:06.990
This is still the world
of East Texas which,

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:11.870
in Bob Dylan's words, was a
place where many martyrs fell.

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:16.680
But there are still moments
of great beauty and pure joy.

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:20.880
With strong imagery, poetic
style and bittersweet vignettes

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:24.580
that evoke this troubled time
and place, Out of Darkness,

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.200
strikes like lightning.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.240
Because it so beautifully
illuminates an obscure

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.510
but significant part of
the American experience,

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:37.510
we honor Ashley Hope Perez
with the Americas Award.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:46.500
[ Applause ]

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:57.190
&gt;&gt; Ashley Hope Perez: Thank you.

00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:59.720
So, always the thank
yous first, right.

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:02.730
I want to also express my
gratitude to the committee

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:08.580
and to CLASP and to Denise
Woltering and Lisa Finelli, too,

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.470
for their work organizing
such a beautiful celebration.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.640
And to all the hands that
are moving behind the scenes.

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.560
Here, your hands are important,
and we thank you for your work.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.340
Also, for the friends
and family and my editor

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.920
who supported this
book along the way.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:28.580
And especially a thank you to
my mom who came all the way

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:32.480
from Texas to finally
see we get an award.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:35.170
I am always asking
her to watch my kids,

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:36.780
so I can do this kind of thing.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.690
And this time, she insisted,
and I'm really glad she came.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:44.180
And my sons are with my husband,

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:47.500
who is always making
everything possible.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.930
So, I send a big thank you to
Liam Miguel and Ethan Andres

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.160
and Arnulfo, my husband.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.830
And thank you for
coming to celebrate.

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:01.250
So when readers tell me what Out
of Darkness has meant to them,

00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:03.880
or how they cried, which
is a lot of what I get

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:09.710
when they tell me about their
experience, I often share that,

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.250
that was taken as a command.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:13.280
Now it is time to cry.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.080
I often share that whole pieces

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.730
of my heart are still
buried inside that story.

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:24.360
If this book tasks readers with
traversing difficult territory,

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.290
it did that for me
as well as an author.

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.910
So I just want to
share a few thoughts

00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:32.780
from that journey
with you in pictures.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.340
Because, why not?

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.420
If you ever visit the Pleasant
Hill Cemetery in New London,

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:41.450
Texas, you will find
gravestone after gravestone

00:50:41.450 --> 00:50:47.380
with the same date of
death, March 18, 1937.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.180
This was the day that the New
London School explosion took the

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.820
lives of nearly 300 people,
most of them children.

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:57.640
Victims of the disaster are
buried in cemeteries all

00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.950
over East Texas where I grew up.

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:01.340
But there are more buried

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.370
at the Pleasant Hill
Cemetery than anywhere else.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:09.790
It takes just 30 minutes driving
on a hilly country road to get

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:12.510
from my childhood home
in Kilgore, Texas,

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:16.330
to the Pleasant Hill Cemetery,
which is just a few miles

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:19.630
where the original New
London School stood.

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:22.230
But I never once learned
about the New London explosion

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:25.480
in school or on a field
trip, despite the fact

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.020
that it is still considered
the worst school disaster

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:30.300
in US history.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:34.370
As a child, I had some awareness
of a tragedy in New London,

00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:36.620
probably from overhearing
whispered conversations

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:40.040
and pressing my parents
for more information.

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.740
But my understanding was
limited to a vague notion

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:45.340
that something had
happened a long time ago

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.150
and that children had died.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.340
Only much later would
I learn that hundreds

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:52.640
of children were killed

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.980
by a natural gas
explosion in the school.

00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.980
Only later would I learn that
fathers and neighbors rushed

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:04.730
to the site, hauling away tons
of rubble by hand to search

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:08.690
for survivor and
recover remains.

00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:09.990
Only later would I learn

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:15.600
that families identified their
children by clothing and scars.

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.200
That many churches held funerals
on the half hour for more

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:23.950
than a week, burying
the victims one-by-one.

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:27.280
Even without this information,
walking among the graves

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:31.820
at Pleasant Hill, I encountered
the enormity of the tragedy.

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:36.900
The immediacy of its impact and
the depth of the wound it left.

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:42.080
Seeing again and again
that date, March 18, 1937,

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.460
became both haunting
and terrible.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:47.370
How did I not know
what had happened?

00:52:47.370 --> 00:52:49.710
A disaster that killed
one out of three

00:52:49.710 --> 00:52:53.380
in a small oilfield town, excuse
me, one out of three children,

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.960
in a small oilfield
town in my community.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.970
A tragedy described by some
as the day a generation died.

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:04.520
What could explain the silence?

00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.110
We now know the importance
of stories and storytelling,

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:11.790
memorials, anniversaries and
other acts of remembrance.

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:14.590
They help us heal
and process pain.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:18.190
But this has not always
been understood or embraced.

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:22.330
And in 1937, the surviving
youth of New London went back

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:25.400
to school just ten days
after the explosion

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.900
that killed many of
their classmates.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:33.530
And when the senior class wanted
to organize a memorial service,

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:36.300
teachers and community
leaders discouraged them.

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.960
It was time to move
on, they were told.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:41.770
Time to put the disaster
behind them.

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:45.050
It was best not to
talk about it.

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:47.330
The silence that followed
stretched on for more

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:51.110
than half a century until
finally survivors began meeting

00:53:51.110 --> 00:53:54.170
and telling their stories,
first to each other,

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.270
then to the community.

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:59.850
Now, volunteer staff a small
museum about the explosion,

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:03.050
and children in New London
learn about the disaster.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:04.720
Still, the event remains unknown

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:08.050
to many Americans,
as Denise noted.

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:10.400
So when I first began
writing Out of Darkness,

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.900
or the book that became Out of
Darkness, as Pam pointed out.

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.930
We don't know where we're
going when we start.

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:19.350
And books have different
intentions for us sometimes.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:22.390
When I started, I
had this notion

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:26.780
that I would be contributing to
this broader effort to reckon

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:30.350
with the impact of that
explosion on the lives

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:32.270
of people in East Texas.

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:36.050
But once I began researching,
I found myself thinking most

00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:39.630
about the stories that
I did not find collected

00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:43.340
in the archival materials
on the disaster.

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:44.970
Because the New London
School was built

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:47.940
to serve white children,
historical accounts

00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:50.850
of the explosion have
focused on the tragedy

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:52.650
as the white community
experienced it.

00:54:52.650 --> 00:54:55.690
And I should have
shown you a picture.

00:54:55.690 --> 00:55:00.560
This was just as, this
was probably an hour

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.940
after the explosion
just as another part

00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.900
of the school is
beginning to collapse.

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:08.520
So in the archive, this is
really framed as a disaster

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.780
that affected the
white community.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.710
No one recorded how people of
color in the area responded

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.130
or how they viewed the tragedy.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:19.690
So I found myself
with many questions.

00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:23.690
I wondered, for example,
what the event meant

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:26.700
for African-Americans
who had been spared

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.280
from the explosion precisely

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.070
because they'd been
denied access

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:32.210
to the far better-funded school.

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:34.690
And this was a school that
because of oil revenues,

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:39.750
had chemistry laboratories,
suites of sewing machines,

00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:42.370
band instruments for
every child in the school,

00:55:42.370 --> 00:55:45.240
uniforms for sports,
all for the children

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:47.680
of mostly poor oil
field workers.

00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:50.490
But this was a space of
tremendous opportunity

00:55:50.490 --> 00:55:52.610
that African-Americans
did not have access to.

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:55.510
So I wanted to know,
well what was this like?

00:55:55.510 --> 00:56:00.230
If you were an African-American
parent, how strange the relief

00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:03.570
that was made possible
by that exclusion.

00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:07.200
And this question
was a persistent one.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.680
So I new from early on that
there would be an important

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.320
African-American
character in my novel.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:16.080
And yes, I imagined him as
the young Jackie Robinson.

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.450
This was always my
picture of my character.

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:22.510
This is Wash, yes, but Wash
has already had the face

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:25.390
of Jackie Robinson
in my imagination.

00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:29.170
So, I knew that he was
going to have been there

00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:30.470
when the explosion happens.

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:32.430
So this is how I
began imagining Wash.

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:35.710
I had to think about how
would my character end

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:38.050
up involved in this explosion.

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:40.800
And so he's working on
the grounds of the school.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:44.230
He can't go to school
there, but he can work there

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.030
when the explosion happens.

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:52.490
Then I got the gift of spark
for my other character, Naomi,

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:55.010
when I came across a name
that surprised me on a list

00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:58.610
of children who had
died in the explosion.

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:02.690
That name was Juanita Herron.

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:05.920
Or, was it Juanita Herron?

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:10.880
I found a photograph of Juanita,
and I began to imagine her

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.490
as a Mexican-American child
recently arrived in New London.

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:18.110
In my mind she came, like
so many children did,

00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:21.090
accompanying a parent who had
been drawn by the prospect

00:57:21.090 --> 00:57:23.500
of jobs in the oilfield
community.

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:26.990
And this was a rare pocket
of prosperity in the midst

00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:29.240
of the Great Depression.

00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.450
But could a Mexican-American
have attended the New London

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:36.030
School during the Jim Crow era?

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:38.610
This is the world of the time.

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:40.680
In some ways, the
lack of Latinos

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:42.700
in the are made it
more possible.

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:44.340
At the time, parts of Texas

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.030
with established Latino
communities tended to be subject

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:50.570
to a three-fold system of
segregation for schools.

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:52.300
White schools for
white children.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:54.730
So-called colored schools
for black children.

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:56.780
And so-called Mexican schools

00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.110
for Mexican-Americans
and other Latinos.

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:00.720
This is the reality that Naomi

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:05.320
and her siblings
experienced in San Antonio.

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.620
In New London, however,

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:09.590
there was only a white
school and a black school.

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:10.890
This made it more plausible

00:58:10.890 --> 00:58:13.570
that Mexican-American families
could have enrolled their

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:15.960
children in the New London
School in much the same way

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:20.100
that descendants of Cherokee
Indians in the area had.

00:58:20.100 --> 00:58:26.230
So this was a very careful
entry into the schooling space.

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:31.790
So, here's a little, an image
of, one of the, I have a range

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:34.380
of images that informed
my view of Naomi,

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:35.680
but this is one of them.

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:38.120
So I began thinking about
what it might have been

00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:41.050
like for a Mexican-American
teenager to come

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:44.730
from San Antonio and navigate a
community with color lines drawn

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:49.230
in black and white, and this was
the beginning of Naomi's story.

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:52.820
The drama, tragedy and hope
in Out of Darkness come less

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.960
from recorded history than from
my efforts to imagine the kinds

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.690
of stories that were never
recorded, at least not

00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:01.500
from the perspective of
black and Latino-Americans.

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.100
But its actual details
did influence how I shaped

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.570
fictional events.

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:07.740
For example, during
my research I learned

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.760
that an angry mob did converge

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.020
on the New London School's
superintendent's house

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:14.890
after the explosion,
looking for someone to blame

00:59:14.890 --> 00:59:17.340
for the deaths of
their children.

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:20.550
In real life, mounted
Texas rangers protected him

00:59:20.550 --> 00:59:24.180
from the potential
vigilante violence.

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:27.810
The crowd dissipated,
and no one was harmed.

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:30.910
But I started to wonder,
well what would have happened

00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:34.480
if that mob had turned its
energies toward a scape goat not

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:36.830
granted such protection.

00:59:36.830 --> 00:59:40.550
So this is one of the
ways that what the,

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.540
what is in the historical
record prompts questions

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.740
for me about what's not.

00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:49.260
So I see fiction as a space for
posing questions about the world

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:53.100
around us, questions
that relate to our past,

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.120
our present and future.

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:58.160
In Out of Darkness, these
are questions about privilege

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.880
and segregation,
about new beginnings

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:02.930
and what we make of them.

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:06.400
They are questions about
which families count and about

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.010
who we are allowed to love.

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:13.450
They are questions about human
weakness and human strength.

01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:18.080
Questions about the heroism
and horror we are capable

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.280
of when we've lost everything.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.390
When our world is
shattered beyond recognition.

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:27.100
When our hearts are broken.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.660
I started Out of
Darkness with questions

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:34.100
about the stories we hear and
the stories we don't hear.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.290
But by the end of my
journey with the characters,

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:39.070
I was left holding a
different question.

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:44.740
This one was about how tragedy
can beget terrible injustice.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:47.670
This is to give myself
courage, this is an image,

01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:50.200
one of many I have
of hollow trees.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.520
And there's a very
important tree in the story,

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.130
which is really the one
safe space for Naomi

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:57.310
and Wash to be together.

01:00:57.310 --> 01:01:01.450
I did not want pain
for Wash and Naomi.

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.630
I wanted a future
full of possibility,

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:07.410
a world where their love could
flourish beyond their secret

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:08.710
meeting place in the woods.

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:12.850
And yet, the trajectory of
the story pulled me away

01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:15.220
from my own desires and wishes.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:19.000
Pulled me toward loss and
heartbreak and suffering

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.640
of the characters, and
myself a little bit.

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.290
My husband could tell you.

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:28.660
Yeah, probably suffering for
him even more than for me.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:33.060
But that pull of the story
is something you simply,

01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:41.140
you cannot disregard, or you
disregard at great cost I think.

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:45.100
So when I was writing, I
did not know why I had to go

01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.200
into darkness with
my characters.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.380
I only knew that I had to

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.080
and that anything else would
be dishonest and unfaithful

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.050
to the story that had
been entrusted to me.

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.990
I'm beginning, little by little,

01:01:56.990 --> 01:02:00.850
to understand why this journey
is important, this journey into

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:03.800
and perhaps out of darkness.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.510
Why it matters for
me and for readers.

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:10.200
The injustices that Naomi and
Wash suffer should anger us.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.220
But they should also remind us
that the racialized violence

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.360
and deep inequities that still
trouble our nation today,

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.020
these have a long history.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:20.930
The depth of our
feelings for Naomi

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:25.110
and Wash may make our reading
painful, but they also,

01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:28.780
these feelings also highlight
the unique value of their lives.

01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:32.880
The promise we all lose when
anyone suffers discrimination

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.780
or loses a life to
racialized violence.

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:39.380
We must act for justice, not
only for ourselves, but for all,

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.030
especially those whose stories

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:44.280
of suffering have too
often been relegated

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.350
to the margins of history.

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.040
I hope that readers leave
the pages of Out of Darkness

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.770
with a commitment to
creating a world where we work

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.640
to honor black and brown
lives and embrace the right

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.360
of all loves to flourish.

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.280
So, for all my questions,
I think the one

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.380
that matters most is this.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:07.460
Can encountering darkness and
injustice in fiction teach us

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:12.180
to hunger for light in our lives
and in the lives of others?

01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.700
Thank you so much for this honor

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:16.510
and for taking the time
to celebrate with us.

&gt;&gt; Denise Woltering-Vargas:
Part of, one of our traditions

01:03:39.130 --> 01:03:43.160
for presenting the Americas
Award is to present something

01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.620
that commemorates the weaving

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:46.910
that you all do,
weaving stories.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:49.090
So each year we are
very excited to work

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:51.260
with our Kaqchikel
Maya Language Scholars

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.610
to bring back a special
weaving from Guatemala.

01:03:53.610 --> 01:03:57.890
So we'd like to present both
Ashley Hope and Pam Munoz Ryan

01:03:57.890 --> 01:04:02.510
with a weaving, representing
your weaving of stories.

congratulations again

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.120
to Pam Munoz Ryan
and Ashley Hope Perez

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:51.230
and all the authors recognized
by this year's awards.

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:54.750
I'm Lisa Finelli, and I am
one of the co-coordinators

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:56.100
of the Americas Award.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.080
And I wanted to thank you for
coming out this afternoon,

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.310
taking time out of your busy
day, traveling far and wide,

01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:04.140
to join us here for
the presentation

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:07.290
of the 2016 Americas Award.

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:09.550
I'd also like to extend
a special thank you

01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:11.860
to Georgette Dorn
and Catalina Gomez

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:16.250
from the Hispanic Division,
Pamela Jackson and Anne Bonny

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:19.800
from the Center for the Book,
and Jared McNeil from the Office

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.820
of Special Events for helping
to coordinate today's event.

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.990
Denise and I are extremely
grateful to the committee

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.640
for the care and
passion that they put

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.480
into selecting the winners,

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:33.570
honorable mention
and commended titles.

01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:36.690
I would like to recognize
Paula Mason, Denise Croker,

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:40.100
and Laura Kleinmann, who
are all here with us today,

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:43.630
as well as committee members
Maria Sheldon and Emily Chavez,

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:46.880
who could not join us at
the ceremony this afternoon.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.310
Without their hard work
and careful consideration,

01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:52.290
the Americas Award
would not be possible.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:54.760
The Americas Award is
sponsored by the consortium

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.880
of Latin American
Studies Programs,

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.280
and it would not be possible
without the generous support

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.140
of Vanderbilt University, Tulane
University, the University

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:06.630

These institutions
all have the privilege

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:18.860
of receiving Title Six funding
to be national resource centers

01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:22.070
on Latin America which enables
them to sponsor programs

01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:25.050
such as the Americas
Award through this grant.

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:28.270
As Denise mentioned, there
will be a special K12 teacher

workshop tonight
featuring Alma Flor Ada,

01:06:31.210 --> 01:06:34.410
where teachers will explore the
diverse city of Voices Available
