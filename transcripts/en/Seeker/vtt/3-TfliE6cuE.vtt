00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.170
Didn’t use a toilet seat cover in that public
restroom?

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.070
You may regret it

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.080
Hi guys, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.980
Are you afraid of contracting a terrible disease
from using a public restroom?

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.550
How dirty are those toilets really? and how
useful are those annoying paper covers that

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.960
always tear and then fall into the bowl after
you’ve set them down anyway?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.429
Well, according to modern science, those paper
covers, don’t actually do very much…

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.390
Concern over the possibility of contracting
disease from public restrooms has been around

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.280
for over 100 years.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.830
US patents for “sanitation covers for latrine
seats” date back as far as 1911 and I believe

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:38.830
it was the late great Louis Pasteur* one of
the founders of germ theory who said: “Women,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.830
it is best to hover when peeing” (*Louis
Pasteur definitely did NOT say this).

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.690
We know bathrooms and kitchens are a hotbed
of bacteria and other microorganisms due to

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.150
the abundance of moisture and nutrients.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.370
Toilet seats are known hang outs for disease
agents like E. coli, strep- and, staphylococcus

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.780
bacteria, and the common cold but studies
have shown that the toilet bowl isn’t the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.829
worst offender when it comes to germs -- I
will never eat off of anything touched by

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:00.829
a kitchen sponge again.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.869
Also, unless you have an open sore or other
breach in the protective body casing that

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.670
is your skin, the chance of disease transmission
through toilet seat use is slim.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.939
People have gotten their knickers in a bunch
over the safety of toilet seats when a few

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.340
cases of sexually transmitted diseases cropped
up in individuals who claimed that they could

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.590
not have contracted their infections through
the usual manner.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.119
Dirty toilet seats were blamed but scientists
have repeatedly refuted this conclusion on

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.139
the grounds that the infectious agents are
not viable for long outside a host body and

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:30.229
transmission requires direct contact with
mucosal membranes.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.950
Actually, according to a paper in the journal
of Applied and Environmental Microbiology

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.560
you are far more likely to get sick by breathing
the aerosolized bacteria in water droplets

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.709
from your flush than you are from copping
a squat.

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.139
There is a psychological factor at work here
though.

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:47.270
For some people, the act of using a disposable
seat cover just makes them feel safer and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.270
that’s hard to argue with.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.240
But if you’re looking for habits more conducive
to disease prevention than using a toilet

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.860
seat cover wash your hands with soap and water.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.860
Yep, that’s it.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.450
That’s the best way to avoid getting sick
from the use of a public restroom is to wash

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.499
your hands.

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:03.630
Also when possible, close the toilet seat
cover before you flush.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.889
(or at least don’t stand with your face
over the toilet when you do).

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:08.390
So what have we learned?

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.500
Toilets are not the worst offenders of disease
transmission and Nature has once again beat

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.750
out Man in efficient engineering of sanitary
barriers through the evolution of skin.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.040
So let us know what you think!

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.160
Are toilet seat covers a wasteful american
phenomenon or necessary precaution?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.610
