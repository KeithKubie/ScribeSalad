KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.490
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.980
Joining me in the
studio right now

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.700
is Andrew from Structur3D
Printing in Canada.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.750
Andrew, how are you?

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.969
ANDREW FINKLE: Good.

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:10.190
How are you?

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.670
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.230
Thank you for joining
us in the studio.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.670
ANDREW FINKLE: Awesome.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.260
Thanks for having me.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.030
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah, no worries.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.445
So tell us a little bit
about Structur3D Printing.

00:00:16.445 --> 00:00:17.195
ANDREW FINKLE: OK.

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:20.900
Structur3D Printing is looking
to solve the problem right now

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.930
in 3D printing, which is
the limitation of materials.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.140
So, traditionally,
3D printing has

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.840
been kind of like a
mechanized hot glue gun.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.170
So it'll take a hard
plastic, melt it down,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.430
and build something up.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.910
What we've created
is this new tool head

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.350
that will allow printing
with materials way

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.820
beyond just plastic.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.500
So we can print very
strong, flexible materials.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.240
We work with a lot of different
biomaterials and research

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.280
groups.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.460
So we're enabling the physical
developers of the world

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.100
to design and prototype
with many more of the things

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.433
that they're familiar
with in a day-to-day life.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:58.320
KORY JEFFREY: Cool.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.440
So what are some of
the things-- like what

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.540
are some of the materials?

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.610
You've obviously
brought some stuff here.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.766
ANDREW FINKLE: Right.

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:03.307
So some of the ones
I've brought here

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:05.280
are the fun-- so
these are silicones.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.420
So what kind of advantage
or different applications

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.480
this brings to the table is
the flexibility and durability.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.770
So one example is wearable
tech-type devices can now

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.160
be prototyped using our device.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.940
Things like a Fitbit,
a lot of people

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.300
have trouble finding the
right kind of texture.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.660
That's something that we can
help them get to that stage.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.870
A couple other big areas for
us are printing with foods.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.310
So food science
is really growing.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.810
And we're able to enable the
creation of a lot of new,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.100
I guess, textures and
ways to make food.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.950
So on the easy
end, it's something

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.217
like printing a cake
topper for your birthday

00:01:51.217 --> 00:01:52.050
that's personalized.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.840
It says, Happy Birthday Kory.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.750
And then on the high end,
there are research groups

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.680
around the world who are
growing meat in a lab,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.190
and we're able to help them take
this meat that they've grown

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.001
and print the steak.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.750
KORY JEFFREY: That's
actually really cool.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.729
That's cool.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.460
So what is the craziest
thing that you've

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.180
seen somebody print
with your machine

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.790
so far that you're aware of?

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.040
ANDREW FINKLE: I guess it's
not the craziest material,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.050
but the best thing I've seen
just in the last week or so

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.550
is one of our
Kickstarter backers,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.310
one of our early customers,
prints with his daughter

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.440
in clay and ceramics.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.160
And he creates his kids'
toys with his daughter.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.890
They design it on the
computer in the CAD software.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.220
And he'll print out the
toys, and the daughter

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.695
will paint them and create them.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.070
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.653
ANDREW FINKLE: Yeah,
it's really cool.

00:02:44.653 --> 00:02:48.110
We're trying right now to
partner with a company that

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.360
is growing shark fin meat,
trying to save endangered

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.580
species by creating a
different channel for people

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.520
to get this delicacy.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.610
And we're kind of the last step
that helps create the textures,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.230
create the densities, make
it actually not just taste,

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.910
but feel like the natural thing.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.690
KORY JEFFREY: Wow.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.832
So you mentioned you've
run a Kickstarter.

00:03:14.832 --> 00:03:15.790
ANDREW FINKLE: We have.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.030
KORY JEFFREY: So you've
sold a bunch of things.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.210
What stage are you at now?

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.777
What are you doing today?

00:03:19.777 --> 00:03:21.860
ANDREW FINKLE: So we're
actually in an accelerator

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.060
down here in San Francisco.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.390
We are focusing on
taking our company

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.410
to the next step, so figuring
out some different channels

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.400
and partners to work with
and really refining how--

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.600
or what we've learned
through the Kickstarter.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.730
So we had a wide
variety of customers

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:42.900
through the Kickstarter.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.860
And we found out where our
device is providing the most

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.620
value, and we're starting
to focus in on that.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.140
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.632
Obviously, you're at an
accelerator in the Valley.

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:55.090
You're here at
Founder World today.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.380
What attracted
you to this event?

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.830
ANDREW FINKLE: So we,
coming from Canada,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.840
kind of had a
limited view of how

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.940
the startup world and the whole
tech ecosystem worked here.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.000
So that is a big part
of why we're here,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.830
is getting to know other
companies, talking to people,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.010
really calibrating
ourselves with how things

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.475
are working in the Valley.

00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:19.266
KORY JEFFREY: Nice.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.210
As you look around here, you're
one of the demonstrators,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.670
obviously.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.280
But other than 3D printing,
are there other technologies,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.114
either here or otherwise, that
really kind of excite you guys?

00:04:33.114 --> 00:04:34.780
ANDREW FINKLE: Oh,
interesting question.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.730
I know for me-- so my
background is in nanotechnology.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.580
So I've seen a lot of what is
to come in different industries.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.270
And what is really
fascinating, being down here,

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.680
is I'm seeing them
come to market now.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.660
It's no longer just
stuff I saw in a textbook

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.760
and thought, oh,
this is really cool.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.760
It's actually happening.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.250
And that includes
things like growing meat

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.640
or different interfacing
with the human body

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.130
so that you could
create robotic arms that

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.760
are controlled by the brain.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.610
And it's just in the
digital fabrication space.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.510
So outside of 3D
printing, there are a lot

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.500
of really cool technologies.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.380
There is a 3D
printing company that

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.016
is creating life-sized 3D
printing sculptures out of wood

00:05:27.016 --> 00:05:28.390
and leather and
things like that.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.992
They just launched on
crowdfunding a few days ago

00:05:30.992 --> 00:05:32.700
and have already raised
over $30 million.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.700
They just ousted
Pebble as the leader.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.420
And so there's a lot of energy
and a lot of resources going

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.450
into new ways to make things.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.861
And that's one thing that
I'm really fascinated with.

00:05:45.861 --> 00:05:48.360
KORY JEFFREY: So on that vein,
do you have a favorite Google

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.740
technology?

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.276
ANDREW FINKLE: So I
think one thing that's

00:05:54.276 --> 00:05:56.900
really interesting me is Google
is getting into the 3D printing

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.260
space.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.727
I can't remember the name
of the company they just

00:06:00.727 --> 00:06:01.560
invested heavily in.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.860
But they're pushing a new
way of 3D printing, which

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.120
is almost like printing
with holographs,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.980
which is really cool.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.970
It really allows for
this mass customization

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.650
of products moving forward.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.210
And then, outside of
that, I think my favorite

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:23.770
is my Android phone.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:24.529
KORY JEFFREY: Yes!

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:26.570
ANDREW FINKLE: Yeah, I
used to be an Apple fanboy

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.494
and completely converted, and
I'm addicted to my phone now.

00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:32.160
KORY JEFFREY: Well,
welcome to the team.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.550
ANDREW FINKLE: Awesome.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:33.380
Thanks for having me.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.960
KORY JEFFREY: Awesome.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.750
Andrew, thanks so
much for joining me.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.200
ANDREW FINKLE: Thanks again.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.790
KORY JEFFREY: Yeah, no worries.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.206
And thank you guys
for joining us.

00:06:38.206 --> 00:06:40.780
We are on site at Founder
World in San Francisco.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.230
