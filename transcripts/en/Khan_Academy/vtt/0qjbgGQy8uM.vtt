00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:02.988
- Hi, this is Sal Khan,
founder of the Khan Academy.

00:00:02.988 --> 00:00:07.498
I just wanted to announce our
second annual Talent Search.

00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:09.036
As you may know, Khan Academy,

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:11.147
we're a not-for-profit
with a mission of a free

00:00:11.147 --> 00:00:13.739
world-class education
for anyone, anywhere.

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.273
And part of that is creating the content

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:17.963
that can reach students from Kindergarten

00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:19.395
all the way through early college

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:22.226
in all of the core academic subjects.

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:25.493
That content is videos,
it's articles and exercises.

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:27.195
And the reason why we do the Talent Search

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:29.491
is we're looking for folks who can really

00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.331
connect with students on those subjects.

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.956
And so this year we're doing
the talent search again,

00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:37.939
and we're especially looking
at core academic subjects

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.906
that aren't on Khan Academy already

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:42.069
or where Khan Academy
does not already have

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:43.634
a significant offering.

00:00:43.634 --> 00:00:45.758
I encourage you to go to
the Talent Search website

00:00:45.758 --> 00:00:47.389
to get a little bit more detail there.

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:49.307
You know, this is a really
exciting thing for us.

00:00:49.307 --> 00:00:51.890
There are going to be
prizes for the finalists,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.571
but more importantly it's
a way for us to foster

00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:57.931
more people getting involved
with content creation

00:00:57.931 --> 00:00:59.643
which I think all of you will enjoy

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:03.505
and a way for us to discover new talent.

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:06.526
Last year, out of the
finalists, two have actually

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:10.800
had content creation
contracts with Khan Academy

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.216
including Grant and David.

00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:15.464
- Hi everyone, my name is Grant Sanderson.

00:01:15.464 --> 00:01:18.153
I was one of the Talent
Search winners from last year.

00:01:18.153 --> 00:01:20.528
I now make multi-variable calculus videos

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:22.609
and some other content for Khan Academy.

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:23.872
And I just have to say,

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:25.920
as someone who cares
about reaching students

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.145
and who cares about
addressing needs like that,

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:31.546
I can't imagine a better
place to be than here.

00:01:31.546 --> 00:01:34.001
And that's not just because
you can reach a lot of people,

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.761
but what the Khan Academy
folk around here care about

00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:39.025
is just genuinely helping students.

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:42.549
- So I am the Grammar
Fellow at Khan Academy.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.902
I am very passionate about grammar.

00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:47.748
And I'm curious to know
what you're excited about.

00:01:47.748 --> 00:01:49.575
What are your big passions?

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:51.468
What do you love to think about?

00:01:51.468 --> 00:01:54.030
What do you love to tell people about?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.765
What do people like learning from you?

00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:57.925
Is it macroeconomics?

00:01:57.925 --> 00:01:59.191
Is it business theory?

00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.445
Is it psychology?

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:01.278
Whatever it is,

00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:02.847
whatever your passion is,

00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:06.309
put it into a video and send it to us.

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:08.581
- So please make your videos,

00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:09.742
have fun with them,

00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:11.663
think about how you can
connect with the world,

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:15.246
and send us your
submissions by August 1st.
