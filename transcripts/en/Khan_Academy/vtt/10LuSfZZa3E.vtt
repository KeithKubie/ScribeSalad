00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.140
Let's do a slightly more
involved Snell's law example.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.240
So I have this person
over here, sitting

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.510
at the edge of this pool.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.380
And they have a little
laser pointer in their hand

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.202
and they shine
their laser pointer.

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:14.660
So in their hand,
where they shine,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.970
it's 1.7 meters above
the surface of the pool.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.980
And they shine it so
it travels 8.1 meters

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.600
to touch the surface
of the water.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.660
And then the light
gets refracted inward.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.950
It's going to a slower medium.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.680
If you think about
the car analogy,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.560
the outside tires get to stay
outside a little bit longer,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.480
so they move faster.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.900
So it gets refracted inward.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.290
And then it hits the
bottom of the pool

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.220
at some point right over here.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.950
And the pool, they tell
us, is three meters deep.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:50.000
What I want to figure out is how
far away does this point hit.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.423
So what is this distance
right over here?

00:00:56.612 --> 00:00:58.070
And to figure that
out, I just need

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.249
to figure out what
this distance is.

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:02.790
I need to figure out what this
distance is-- so this distance

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.005
right over here.

00:01:04.005 --> 00:01:06.130
And then figure out what
that distance is, and then

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.870
add them up.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.980
So I can figure out
this part-- trying

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.280
to do it in a different
color-- this part right

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.860
until we hit the
surface of the water

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.180
and then figure out this
incremental distance, just

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.154
like that.

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:18.820
And hopefully with a
little trigonometry

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.310
and maybe a little
bit of Snell's law

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.620
we'll be able to get there.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.760
So let's start on maybe
what's the simplest thing.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.610
Let's just figure
out this distance.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.360
And it looks like it will
pay off later on, as well.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.950
So let's figure out this
distance right over here.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.800
So just the distance along
the surface of the water,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.860
to where the laser
point actually

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.810
starts touching the water.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.760
And this is just a straight up
Pythagorean theorem problem.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.870
This is a right angle.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.540
This is the
hypotenuse, over here.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.216
So this distance, let's
call this distance x.

00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:54.030
x squared plus
1.7 meters squared

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.227
is going to be equal
to 8.1 squared-- just

00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:57.560
straight up Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.620
So x squared plus
1.7 squared is going

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.260
to be equal to 8.1 squared.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.140
Or we could subtract 1.7
squared from both sides.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.360
We get x squared is equal to
8.1 squared minus 1.7 squared.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.070
If we want to solve
for x, x is going

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.730
to be the positive
square root of this,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.350
because we only care
about positive distances.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.570
x is going to be equal to the
principal root of 8.1 squared

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.460
minus 1.7 squared.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.210
And let's get our
calculator out for that.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:38.190
So x is going to be equal to
the square root of 8.1 squared

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.760
minus 1.7 squared.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:50.130
And I get 7.9-- looks about--
let me just round it, 7.92.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.900
So x is about 7.92, although we
could save that number there,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.510
so we can get a
more exact number.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.300
So this is equal to 7.92.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.440
That is x.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.160
Now, we just have to figure out
this incremental distance right

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.860
over here, add that
to this x, and then we

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.280
know this entire distance.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.210
So let's see how we
can think about it.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.700
So let's think about what
the incident angle is

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.820
and then the angle
of refraction is.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.560
So I've dropped a
perpendicular to the interface,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.950
or to the surface.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.970
So our incident angle is
this angle right over here.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.750
That is our incident angle.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.830
And remember,
Snell's law-- we care

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.220
about the sine of this angle.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.720
Actually, let me just write
down what we want to care about.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.140
So we know this is
our incident angle.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.540
This is our angle of refraction.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.000
We know that the
index of refraction

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.510
for this medium
out here-- and this

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.690
is air, so it's going to be the
index of refraction for air--

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.790
times the sine of theta 1--
this is just Snell's law,

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.200
so times our incident
angle, right here--

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.350
is going to be equal to
the index of refraction

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.910
for the water-- and
we'll put the values

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.970
in the next step-- times
the sine of theta 2-- times

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.890
the sine of our refraction
angle, sine of theta 2.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.100
Now, we know-- we can
figure out these ends

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.579
from this table right over here.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.220
I actually got this problem
from ck12.org's flex book

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.300
as well or at least the
image for the problem.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.810
And so if we want to
solve for theta 2--

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.174
or if we know theta 2, we
could then solve for this.

00:04:32.174 --> 00:04:34.340
And we'll do that with a
little bit of trigonometry.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.350
Actually we won't even have to--
if we know the sine of theta 2,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.370
we'll be able to solve for this.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.270
All right, we'll think
about it either way.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.840
Actually, we'll just
solve for this angle,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.200
and then if we know
this angle, then we'll

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.810
be able to use a little
trigonometry to figure out

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:51.352
this distance over here.

00:04:51.352 --> 00:04:53.560
So to solve for that angle,
we can look up these two.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.380
And so we just have to
figure out what this is.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.590
We need to figure out what
the sine of theta 1 is.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.820
So let's put in
all of the values.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.160
Our index of refraction
of air is 1.00029.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.770
So let me put that in there.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.140
So that's this.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.144
So 1.00029 times
the sine of theta.

00:05:13.144 --> 00:05:15.310
And you say, oh, how do we
figure out sine of theta?

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.170
We don't even know
what that angle is.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.510
But remember, this is
basic trigonometry.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.480
Remember "soh cah toa."

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.257
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:26.840
So if you have this
angle here-- let's

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.920
make it a part of
a right triangle.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.550
So if you make that as part
of a right triangle, opposite

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.950
over hypotenuse-- it's
the ratio of this side,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.827
it's the ratio of that
distance to the hypotenuse.

00:05:39.827 --> 00:05:41.660
This distance over here
we just figured out,

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.368
it's the same as this
distance down here.

00:05:43.368 --> 00:05:44.060
It's x.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.130
So this is 7.92.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.330
So the sine of theta
1 is going to be

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.050
the opposite of the angle,
opposite over the hypotenuse.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.920
That just comes from
the definition of sine.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.380
So it's going to be times-- so
this part right over here, sine

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.930
of theta 1-- we don't have
to know what theta 1 is.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:13.960
It's going to be 7.92 over 8.1.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.810
And that's going to be equal
to the index of refraction

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.100
of water.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.307
So that's index of
water is 1.33-- so let

00:06:21.307 --> 00:06:22.640
me do that in a different color.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.060
So that's going to be-- no, I
wanted to do a different color.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.900
So that's going to be-- let
me do it in this dark blue.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.851
So that's going to be 1.33
times sine of theta 2.

00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:37.850
And so, if we want to
solve for sine of theta 2,

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.900
you just divide both sides
of this equation by 1.33.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.650
So let's do that.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.650
So I'll do it over here.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.420
So if you divide
both sides by 1.33,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:58.280
we get 1.00029
times 7.92 over 8.1,

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.880
and we're also going
to divide by 1.33.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.120
So we're also dividing by 1.33.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.940
That is going to be equal
to this sine of theta 2.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.050
So let's figure what that is.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.210
So let's do that.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.650
Get the calculator out.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:26.174
So we have 1.00029 times 7.92.

00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:28.340
Well, actually I could even
say times second answer,

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.250
if we want this exact value.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.750
That was the last-- so I'm going
to do that-- second answer.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.570
So that's the actual
precise, not even rounding.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.030
And then we want to divide by
1.33, that's this right here.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.460
And then we want to divide
by 8.1, and we get that.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.890
And that's going to be equal
to the sine of theta 2.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.997
So that's going to be equal
to the sine of theta 2.

00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:53.080
So let me write this down.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:08:00.752
So we have 0.735 is equal
to the sine of theta 2.

00:08:00.752 --> 00:08:02.210
Now, we could take
the inverse sine

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.540
of both sides of this
equation to solve for theta 2.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.470
So we get theta 2 is
equal to-- let's just take

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.340
the inverse sine of this value.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.080
So I take the inverse sine of
the value that we just had,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.510
so answer is just
our last answer.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.570
And we have theta 2
being 47.3-- let's

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.550
say rounded-- 47.34 degrees.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:29.200
So this is 47.34 degrees.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.299
So we were able to figure out
what theta 2 is, 47.34 degrees.

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:36.590
So now we just have to use
a little bit of trigonometry

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:41.059
to actually figure out
this distance over here.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:44.490
Now what trig ratio involves--
so we know this angle.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.540
We want to figure out its
opposite side, to that angle.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.420
And we know the
adjacent side-- we

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.900
know that this right here is 3.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.030
So what trig identity deals
with opposite and adjacent?

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.900
Well, tangent-- toa.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.740
Tangent is opposite
over adjacent.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.230
So we know that the tangent
of this angle right over here

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:11.130
of 47.34 degrees is going to
be equal to this opposite side

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:15.110
over here-- so I'll
call that y-- is going

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.750
to equal y over
our adjacent side.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.400
And that's just 3 meters.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.340
Or if we want to solve
for y, we multiply

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.330
both sides of this
equation by 3.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:34.840
You get 3 times the tangent of
47.34 degrees is equal to y.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.890
So let's just get
the calculator out.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.430
So 3 times the tangent
of that 47.34 degrees--

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:45.170
I'll use the exact answer--
3 times the tangent of that

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.470
is 3.255.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.610
So this distance right here, y.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.990
And we're at the home stretch.

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:58.660
y is equal to 3.255 meters.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.280
Now, our question was, what
is this total distance?

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.900
So it's going to be
this distance, x,

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.130
plus y, plus the 3.25.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.830
So x was 7.92.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.540
And I'll round here.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.090
So it's literally just going
to be 7.92 plus our answer

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.650
just now.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.652
So we get about 11.18.

00:10:21.652 --> 00:10:24.110
Or maybe if we want to really
round, or get the same number

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.350
significant digits,
maybe 11.2 meters.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.550
I'll just say 11.18 meters.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.820
So this right here, the distance
that we wanted to figure out

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:40.300
is the point on the bottom of
the pool where the actual laser

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.280
pointer actually hits
the surface of the pool

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.950
will be 11.18--
approximately, I'm

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.320
rounding a little bit-- meters
from this edge of the pool

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.880
right there.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.990
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.531
It's a little bit more involved
than the Snell's law problem.

00:10:58.531 --> 00:11:00.790
But really the hard part was
just in the trigonometry,

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.080
recognizing that you didn't
have to know this angle,

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.590
because you have
all the information

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.726
for the sine of that angle.

00:11:05.726 --> 00:11:07.600
You could actually figure
out that angle now.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.430
Now that you know its
sine, you could figure out

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.340
the inverse sine of that.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.589
But that's not even necessary.

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:15.010
We know the sine of the angle
using basic trigonometry.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.250
We can use that and
Snell's law to figure out

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.534
this angle right here.

00:11:18.534 --> 00:11:19.950
And then once you
know this angle,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.420
use a little bit
more trigonometry

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.255
to figure out this
incremental distance.
