comprehension we forget the fact that

the human brain in our senses have a

reactions in the eye in our senses take

reactions in the eye in our senses take

place at a very definite speed the speed
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.940
place at a very definite speed the speed
of chemical reactions so we have a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
of chemical reactions so we have a
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.420

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430

in fractions of a second to a second two
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.219
in fractions of a second to a second two
minutes that's a normal frame of

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
minutes that's a normal frame of
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.200
minutes that's a normal frame of

a whole universe out there where events

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
a whole universe out there where events

events take place over a timescale of
billions of years and the sad thing is

billions of years and the sad thing is
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.069
billions of years and the sad thing is
that we humans our human brain is

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079
that we humans our human brain is
 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.719

example evolution why is it that so many

people don't believe in evolution

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
people don't believe in evolution
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.850
people don't believe in evolution
because they can't see it happening with

because they can't see it happening with
 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.580
because they can't see it happening with
their own eyes and now we're taking a

their own eyes and now we're taking a
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.980
their own eyes and now we're taking a
look at another time scale a scale of

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
look at another time scale a scale of
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.649
