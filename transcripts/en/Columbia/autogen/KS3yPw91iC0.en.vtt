about stents so a stent is some sort of

about stents so a stent is some sort of
 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.559
about stents so a stent is some sort of

said that stents do no better than

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030
said that stents do no better than
 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.939
said that stents do no better than
placebo but this guy said that wasn't

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949
placebo but this guy said that wasn't
 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.980
placebo but this guy said that wasn't
true he read the paper and actually

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990
true he read the paper and actually
 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.439
true he read the paper and actually
stents did better than placebo so I was

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449
stents did better than placebo so I was
 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.390
stents did better than placebo so I was
curious so I read the article and it was

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400
curious so I read the article and it was
 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.510
curious so I read the article and it was
a randomized trial where a hundred

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520
a randomized trial where a hundred
 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.339
a randomized trial where a hundred
patients got the stents and a hundred

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349
patients got the stents and a hundred
 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.950
patients got the stents and a hundred
people 100 patients got the sham surgery

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960
people 100 patients got the sham surgery
 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.540
people 100 patients got the sham surgery
where they do the surgery and they don't

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550
where they do the surgery and they don't
 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.869
where they do the surgery and they don't
put the stent in which don't give me

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:18.879
put the stent in which don't give me
 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:19.439
put the stent in which don't give me
that look

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449
that look
 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.559
that look
because they they consented to you know

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:22.569
because they they consented to you know
 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:24.929
because they they consented to you know
be randomized and yes it's very safe

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:24.939
be randomized and yes it's very safe
 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:27.059
be randomized and yes it's very safe
like there were no adverse events

00:06:27.059 --> 00:06:27.069
like there were no adverse events
 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.869
like there were no adverse events
apparently and they get like you get

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:30.879
apparently and they get like you get
 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.939
apparently and they get like you get
extra good goodies like if you

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949
extra good goodies like if you
 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:34.980
extra good goodies like if you
participate in a medical study they do

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990
participate in a medical study they do
 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.600
participate in a medical study they do
nice things to you and they give extra

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610
nice things to you and they give extra
 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.709
nice things to you and they give extra
care so it seemed fair enough and there

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:40.719
care so it seemed fair enough and there
 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:42.659
care so it seemed fair enough and there
there was a difference so that the stent

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669
there was a difference so that the stent
 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.939
there was a difference so that the stent
group did better than the placebo group

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:44.949
group did better than the placebo group
 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.430
group did better than the placebo group
but not statistically significantly

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440
but not statistically significantly
 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.409
but not statistically significantly
better so they said that stents didn't

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419
better so they said that stents didn't
 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.749
better so they said that stents didn't
work eh it's kind of funny I don't

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759
work eh it's kind of funny I don't
 

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.309
work eh it's kind of funny I don't
really I'm not an expert on the placebo

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319
really I'm not an expert on the placebo
 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.079
really I'm not an expert on the placebo
effect I think that's what like as a

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:58.089
effect I think that's what like as a
 

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:01.079
effect I think that's what like as a
statistician like I'm not an expert on X

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:01.089
statistician like I'm not an expert on X
 

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:03.749
statistician like I'm not an expert on X
you know for any X that I happen to

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759
you know for any X that I happen to
 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.529
you know for any X that I happen to
study and I but I wonder about the

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:07.539
study and I but I wonder about the
 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:09.119
study and I but I wonder about the
placebo effect because if you know

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:09.129
placebo effect because if you know
 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.890
placebo effect because if you know
there's a 50% chance you're actually

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:10.900
there's a 50% chance you're actually
 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.719
there's a 50% chance you're actually
getting the Sham treatment and I don't

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729
getting the Sham treatment and I don't
 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:15.869
getting the Sham treatment and I don't
know if you get like a 50% placebo or or

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:15.879
know if you get like a 50% placebo or or
 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:18.420
know if you get like a 50% placebo or or
what they do the people did this study

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430
what they do the people did this study
 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.189
what they do the people did this study
was very professional job they knew what

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199
was very professional job they knew what
 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:22.170
was very professional job they knew what
they were doing and they did standard

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180
they were doing and they did standard
 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.629
they were doing and they did standard
good practice so they asked people do

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639
good practice so they asked people do
 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.980
good practice so they asked people do
you think which treatment do you think

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990
you think which treatment do you think
 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.230
you think which treatment do you think
you got and most people most people

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240
you got and most people most people
 

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.240
you got and most people most people
didn't know and the ones who guessed

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:30.250
didn't know and the ones who guessed
 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.749
didn't know and the ones who guessed
like guessed right about 50% so like it

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759
like guessed right about 50% so like it
 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.159
like guessed right about 50% so like it
seemed that people didn't know what they

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:35.169
seemed that people didn't know what they
 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:37.350
seemed that people didn't know what they
were getting anyway I looked at the

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360
were getting anyway I looked at the
 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.429
were getting anyway I looked at the
paper and so I realized the analysis

00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:41.439
paper and so I realized the analysis
 

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:43.889
paper and so I realized the analysis
wasn't quite it wasn't wrong but they

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:43.899
wasn't quite it wasn't wrong but they
 

00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:45.659
wasn't quite it wasn't wrong but they
did this thing for all to gain score

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:45.669
did this thing for all to gain score
 

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:47.240
did this thing for all to gain score
where they look at the improvement for

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:47.250
where they look at the improvement for
 

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.550
where they look at the improvement for
pretest to post-test they didn't control

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560
pretest to post-test they didn't control
 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.040
pretest to post-test they didn't control
for differences in pretest between the

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.050
for differences in pretest between the
 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:53.390
for differences in pretest between the
groups if you do that you'll get more

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400
groups if you do that you'll get more
 

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.640
groups if you do that you'll get more
statistical efficiency so I thought

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:55.650
statistical efficiency so I thought
 

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.080
statistical efficiency so I thought
maybe I could get the raw data and

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.090
maybe I could get the raw data and
 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.490
maybe I could get the raw data and
analyze just kidding so I but I was able

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500
analyze just kidding so I but I was able
 

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.670
analyze just kidding so I but I was able
to read the paper you could actually

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680
to read the paper you could actually
 

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.920
to read the paper you could actually
deduce from the summary statistics in

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:06.930
deduce from the summary statistics in
 

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.170
deduce from the summary statistics in
the paper what the analysis would be if

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180
the paper what the analysis would be if
 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.790
the paper what the analysis would be if
you controlled appropriately for the

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:10.800
you controlled appropriately for the
 

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.650
you controlled appropriately for the
pretest score so I was able to

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660
pretest score so I was able to
 

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.480
pretest score so I was able to
reconstruct the analysis that they could

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:14.490
reconstruct the analysis that they could
 

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.160
reconstruct the analysis that they could
have done but before doing I got really

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.170
have done but before doing I got really
 

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.260
have done but before doing I got really
excited because I could tell from the

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:18.270
excited because I could tell from the
 

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.450
excited because I could tell from the
differences between pre and post that

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460
differences between pre and post that
 

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.550
differences between pre and post that
when I reanalyzed it would make the

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560
when I reanalyzed it would make the
 

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.170
when I reanalyzed it would make the
effect bigger and the standard error

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:24.180
effect bigger and the standard error
 

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.950
effect bigger and the standard error
smaller it was already at P equals point

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960
smaller it was already at P equals point
 

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.630
smaller it was already at P equals point
two which isn't like good enough it's

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:29.640
two which isn't like good enough it's
 

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.190
two which isn't like good enough it's
supposed to be 0.05 I knew it would get

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:31.200
supposed to be 0.05 I knew it would get
 

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.589
supposed to be 0.05 I knew it would get
better so I was so I had to go to work

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599
better so I was so I had to go to work
 

00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.140
better so I was so I had to go to work
like I don't know like teach a class or

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:36.150
like I don't know like teach a class or
 

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.399
like I don't know like teach a class or
something I don't under

00:08:37.399 --> 00:08:37.409
something I don't under
 

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.180
something I don't under
and so I quickly dashed off an email to

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.190
and so I quickly dashed off an email to
 

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.529
and so I quickly dashed off an email to
my colleague at the New York Times

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539
my colleague at the New York Times
 

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:44.990
my colleague at the New York Times
saying hey this is going to be big this

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.000
saying hey this is going to be big this
 

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
saying hey this is going to be big this
is great like you know so then I went

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.010
is great like you know so then I went
 

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.570
is great like you know so then I went
went back and like I was figuring it out

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:49.580
went back and like I was figuring it out
 

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.690
went back and like I was figuring it out
and it did just what I said except the

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700
and it did just what I said except the
 

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.650
and it did just what I said except the
p-value went from point two - 0.09 which

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:57.660
p-value went from point two - 0.09 which
 

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.450
p-value went from point two - 0.09 which
was like not what it's supposed to do

00:08:59.450 --> 00:08:59.460
was like not what it's supposed to do
 

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.220
was like not what it's supposed to do
for the story because it should be it

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:01.230
for the story because it should be it
 

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.260
for the story because it should be it
went to 0.04 and then I would be able to

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:03.270
went to 0.04 and then I would be able to
 

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.420
went to 0.04 and then I would be able to
say look once you do the right analysis

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:05.430
say look once you do the right analysis
 

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.220
say look once you do the right analysis
it become statistically significant so

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:07.230
it become statistically significant so
 

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.020
it become statistically significant so
you can see that by doing the right

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.030
you can see that by doing the right
 

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.240
you can see that by doing the right
analysis it changes the story completely

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.250
analysis it changes the story completely
 

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.640
analysis it changes the story completely
from Stentz don't work distance work the

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:13.650
from Stentz don't work distance work the
 

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.710

changed it's all you know we did it

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:19.460
changed it's all you know we did it
 

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.820

statistics but well went to 0.09 but

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:22.830
statistics but well went to 0.09 but
 

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.200

then I realized this is even a better

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:24.210
then I realized this is even a better
 

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.870
then I realized this is even a better
story really because what's so magic

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880
story really because what's so magic
 

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.390

about 0.05 or whatever right I mean so

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:29.400
about 0.05 or whatever right I mean so
 

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.550
about 0.05 or whatever right I mean so
the real point is that yeah that's dense

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:31.560
the real point is that yeah that's dense
 

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.980
the real point is that yeah that's dense
did better maybe the difference Iran

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:36.990
did better maybe the difference Iran
 

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.900
did better maybe the difference Iran
don't care if it's statistically

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:37.910
don't care if it's statistically
 

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.950
don't care if it's statistically
significant if the difference was not

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:39.960
significant if the difference was not
 

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.050
significant if the difference was not
clinically large and and I I think

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:44.060
clinically large and and I I think
 

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:49.100
clinically large and and I I think
actually like there's some issues I

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:49.110
actually like there's some issues I
 

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.170
actually like there's some issues I
think the study was very well done but

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:51.180
think the study was very well done but
 

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.460
think the study was very well done but
that's kind of the point is I think

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:52.470
that's kind of the point is I think
 

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.170

I'll show you that the data here from

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:56.530
I'll show you that the data here from
 

00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.270
I'll show you that the data here from
that from the published article they had

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:00.280
that from the published article they had
 

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.610
that from the published article they had
the number they had a data number of

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:02.620
the number they had a data number of
 

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.820
the number they had a data number of
babies born every day for a 20-year

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:05.830
babies born every day for a 20-year
 

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.920
babies born every day for a 20-year
period and you see do you see that the

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:07.930
period and you see do you see that the
 

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.530
period and you see do you see that the
heart there on the left that's and then

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:10.540
heart there on the left that's and then
 

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.240
heart there on the left that's and then
that's Valentine's Day there were more

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:12.250
that's Valentine's Day there were more
 

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.060
that's Valentine's Day there were more
babies born and then fewer on the week

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.070
babies born and then fewer on the week
 

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.220
babies born and then fewer on the week
before and the week after and then do

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:17.230
before and the week after and then do
 

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.850
before and the week after and then do
you see

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:17.860
you see
 

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.040
you see
isn't that cute the witch there yeah

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.050
isn't that cute the witch there yeah
 

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.280
isn't that cute the witch there yeah
that's Halloween yeah um so it's kind of

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:23.290
that's Halloween yeah um so it's kind of
 

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.770
that's Halloween yeah um so it's kind of
funny because like not only are there

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:25.780
funny because like not only are there
 

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.010
funny because like not only are there
more cesarean section births on

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:29.020
more cesarean section births on
 

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.560
more cesarean section births on
Valentine's Day because what shows love

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:31.570
Valentine's Day because what shows love
 

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.100
Valentine's Day because what shows love
more than but more natural births too

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.110
more than but more natural births too
 

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.850
more than but more natural births too
which seems kind of funny like how could

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:38.860
which seems kind of funny like how could
 

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.300
which seems kind of funny like how could
that be

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:39.310
that be
 

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.130
that be
although those of you with statistics

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:41.140
although those of you with statistics
 

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.160
although those of you with statistics
training will know that selection occurs

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:44.170
training will know that selection occurs
 

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.650
training will know that selection occurs
even on the things that aren't selected

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:46.660
even on the things that aren't selected
 

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.140
even on the things that aren't selected
because the natural births are all the

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.150
because the natural births are all the
 

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.170
because the natural births are all the
births that weren't induced or cesarean

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:52.180
births that weren't induced or cesarean
 

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.450
births that weren't induced or cesarean
sections so in fact you get selection

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:54.460
sections so in fact you get selection
 

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.490
sections so in fact you get selection
there too anyway this is kind of

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:56.500
there too anyway this is kind of
 

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.829
there too anyway this is kind of
interesting it's statistically

00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839
interesting it's statistically
 

00:11:57.839 --> 00:12:00.120
interesting it's statistically
significant you can see by those little

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.130
significant you can see by those little
 

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:04.110
significant you can see by those little
stars on someone sent me a paper the

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.120
stars on someone sent me a paper the
 

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.670
stars on someone sent me a paper the
other day it was some claim I didn't

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680
other day it was some claim I didn't
 

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.810
other day it was some claim I didn't
quite believe I looked at it really

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:06.820
quite believe I looked at it really
 

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.160
quite believe I looked at it really
carefully and it said it was

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.170
carefully and it said it was
 

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.930
carefully and it said it was
statistically significant at the point

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:09.940
statistically significant at the point
 

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.150
statistically significant at the point
one level which you're not really

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160
one level which you're not really
 

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.310
one level which you're not really
supposed to say but I just

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320
supposed to say but I just
 

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.050
supposed to say but I just
threw that out for those of you who are

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:16.060
threw that out for those of you who are
 

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.680
threw that out for those of you who are
into jargon like that um if you look at

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:19.690
into jargon like that um if you look at
 

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:25.079
into jargon like that um if you look at
this it's like this is is this real you

00:12:25.079 --> 00:12:25.089
this it's like this is is this real you
 

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:27.389
this it's like this is is this real you
know I'm not sure what should you do I

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:27.399
know I'm not sure what should you do I
 

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:29.120
know I'm not sure what should you do I
think what we should do is look at all

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.130
think what we should do is look at all
 

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.220
think what we should do is look at all
366 days of the year

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:31.230
366 days of the year
 

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.499
366 days of the year
so someone made this graph for me this

00:12:34.499 --> 00:12:34.509
so someone made this graph for me this
 

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:35.819
so someone made this graph for me this
is the benefits of collaboration

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:35.829
is the benefits of collaboration
 

00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:40.699
is the benefits of collaboration
somebody oh hey someone is this

00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:40.709
somebody oh hey someone is this
 

00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:41.879
somebody oh hey someone is this
hair-trigger

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:41.889
hair-trigger
 

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:45.840
hair-trigger
okay someone made this graph for me you

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:45.850
okay someone made this graph for me you
 

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.850
okay someone made this graph for me you
could ignore the curves this is just the

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:47.860
could ignore the curves this is just the
 

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.980
could ignore the curves this is just the
raw data the total number of babies born

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:49.990
raw data the total number of babies born
 

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.879
raw data the total number of babies born
each day of the year you can see fewer

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:53.889
each day of the year you can see fewer
 

00:12:53.889 --> 00:12:56.160
each day of the year you can see fewer
babies on New Year's and and July 4th

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:56.170
babies on New Year's and and July 4th
 

00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:59.370
babies on New Year's and and July 4th
and Christmas there's there's

00:12:59.370 --> 00:12:59.380
and Christmas there's there's
 

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.350
and Christmas there's there's
Valentine's Day and Halloween which sort

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360
Valentine's Day and Halloween which sort
 

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.600
Valentine's Day and Halloween which sort
of like it's not completely clear like

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:03.610
of like it's not completely clear like
 

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.480
of like it's not completely clear like
do they really stand out um you see a

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:06.490
do they really stand out um you see a
 

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.920
do they really stand out um you see a
wiggling um there are about 52 of those

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:10.930
wiggling um there are about 52 of those
 

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.249
wiggling um there are about 52 of those
cycles during the year because it's not

00:13:14.249 --> 00:13:14.259
cycles during the year because it's not
 

00:13:14.259 --> 00:13:16.680
cycles during the year because it's not
a 28 year period so there's some

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:16.690
a 28 year period so there's some
 

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.930
a 28 year period so there's some
confounding of day of week and date

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:18.940
confounding of day of week and date
 

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.840
confounding of day of week and date
during the year so we probably we need

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:21.850
during the year so we probably we need
 

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.819
during the year so we probably we need
to do a little bit more analysis if we

00:13:23.819 --> 00:13:23.829
to do a little bit more analysis if we
 

00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:25.590
to do a little bit more analysis if we
just look at this it's hard to know

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600
just look at this it's hard to know
 

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.389
just look at this it's hard to know
what's going on with Valentine's Day and

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399
what's going on with Valentine's Day and
 

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:31.790
what's going on with Valentine's Day and
Halloween so okay

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:31.800
Halloween so okay
 

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.230
Halloween so okay
someone made this graph for me which I

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240
someone made this graph for me which I
 

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.350
someone made this graph for me which I
kind of like because because I hate it

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360
kind of like because because I hate it
 

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.990
kind of like because because I hate it
so much because it's you know there's a

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000
so much because it's you know there's a
 

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.710
so much because it's you know there's a
principle of statistical graphics that

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720
principle of statistical graphics that
 

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.660
principle of statistical graphics that
graphs are comparisons and this graph is

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:45.670
graphs are comparisons and this graph is
 

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.550
graphs are comparisons and this graph is
sort of a wonderful way of comparing

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560
sort of a wonderful way of comparing
 

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.500
sort of a wonderful way of comparing
what's happening on the 21st of every

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:49.510
what's happening on the 21st of every
 

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.680
what's happening on the 21st of every
month going across which is kind of

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:52.690
month going across which is kind of
 

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.960
month going across which is kind of
goofy it also tells you more babies are

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:54.970
goofy it also tells you more babies are
 

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.629
goofy it also tells you more babies are
born in the summer and in the early fall

00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:57.639
born in the summer and in the early fall
 

00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:59.370
born in the summer and in the early fall
but you can see that much better from

00:13:59.370 --> 00:13:59.380
but you can see that much better from
 

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.949
but you can see that much better from
from this graph so this graph is kind of

00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959
from this graph so this graph is kind of
 

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:04.559
from this graph so this graph is kind of
horrible but I just wanted to can convey

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:04.569
horrible but I just wanted to can convey
 

00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:06.480
horrible but I just wanted to can convey
that I thought they would be interesting

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:06.490
that I thought they would be interesting
 

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:09.179
that I thought they would be interesting
to see that not everything we do is very

00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:09.189
to see that not everything we do is very
 

00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:11.880
to see that not everything we do is very
helpful actually

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:11.890
helpful actually
 

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.170
helpful actually
okay so I'll tell you the rest of that

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:14.180
okay so I'll tell you the rest of that
 

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.950
okay so I'll tell you the rest of that
story once we have the data for you to

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:17.960
story once we have the data for you to
 

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.650
story once we have the data for you to
see let me move on to the statistical

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:20.660
see let me move on to the statistical
 

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.620
see let me move on to the statistical
crisis in science I can start with an

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:23.630
crisis in science I can start with an
 

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.800
crisis in science I can start with an
example you might have heard of someone

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:26.810
example you might have heard of someone
 

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:30.070
example you might have heard of someone
did a study they wrote they looked at 50

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:30.080
did a study they wrote they looked at 50
 

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.850
did a study they wrote they looked at 50
common food ingredients and they scoured

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:33.860
common food ingredients and they scoured
 

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.590
common food ingredients and they scoured
the medical literature and they found of

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600
the medical literature and they found of
 

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.390
the medical literature and they found of
those 50 in green food ingredients

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:37.400
those 50 in green food ingredients
 

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.730
those 50 in green food ingredients
something like 40 had been discovered to

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:39.740
something like 40 had been discovered to
 

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.720
something like 40 had been discovered to
either cause cancer or prevent cancer

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:42.730
either cause cancer or prevent cancer
 

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:46.840
either cause cancer or prevent cancer
some of them both actually now my point

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:46.850
some of them both actually now my point
 

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.270
some of them both actually now my point
here is not that onions both cause and

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:49.280
here is not that onions both cause and
 

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.750
here is not that onions both cause and
prevent cancer but rather that there's a

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:52.760
prevent cancer but rather that there's a
 

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.490
prevent cancer but rather that there's a
problem with how medical research is

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:54.500
problem with how medical research is
 

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.520
problem with how medical research is
often conducted and communicated and a

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:57.530
often conducted and communicated and a
 

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.260
often conducted and communicated and a
problem also occurs in other fields such

00:14:59.260 --> 00:14:59.270
problem also occurs in other fields such
 

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.970
problem also occurs in other fields such
as psychology medicine and public health

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:00.980
as psychology medicine and public health
 

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.490
as psychology medicine and public health
and for example that this dense story

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:03.500
and for example that this dense story
 

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.180
and for example that this dense story
that they're led off with has this issue

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:07.190
that they're led off with has this issue
 

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.140
that they're led off with has this issue
like so a study is done some data are

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:11.150
like so a study is done some data are
 

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:12.850
like so a study is done some data are
collected and then the result is this

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:12.860
collected and then the result is this
 

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.100
collected and then the result is this
very strong conclusion like something

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:15.110
very strong conclusion like something
 

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.560
very strong conclusion like something
works or it doesn't work it's actually

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:17.570
works or it doesn't work it's actually
 

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.090
works or it doesn't work it's actually
kind of funny if you think about it

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:19.100
kind of funny if you think about it
 

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.280
kind of funny if you think about it
because it doesn't matter how bad your

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:21.290
because it doesn't matter how bad your
 

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.460
because it doesn't matter how bad your
data are you always can say it works or

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:24.470
data are you always can say it works or
 

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.900
data are you always can say it works or
it doesn't work it's like a free

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:25.910
it doesn't work it's like a free
 

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:27.850
it doesn't work it's like a free
headline I mean you could just be like

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:27.860
headline I mean you could just be like
 

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:29.470
headline I mean you could just be like
you could have a spinner and just

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480
you could have a spinner and just
 

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.720
you could have a spinner and just
generate random numbers and that would

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:31.730
generate random numbers and that would
 

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.750
generate random numbers and that would
be enough to get that not not that

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:34.760
be enough to get that not not that
 

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.840
be enough to get that not not that
anyone would do that just generate

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:37.850
anyone would do that just generate
 

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.450
anyone would do that just generate
random numbers they might have people

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:39.460
random numbers they might have people
 

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.010
random numbers they might have people
they might but they might be measuring

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:42.020
they might but they might be measuring
 

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.990
they might but they might be measuring
something that is so noisy that it's as

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000
something that is so noisy that it's as
 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.330
something that is so noisy that it's as
bad as being random numbers in

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:46.340
bad as being random numbers in
 

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.340
bad as being random numbers in
particular if you want to study things

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:48.350
particular if you want to study things
 

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.860
particular if you want to study things
like what causes cancer in

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:49.870
like what causes cancer in
 

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.150
like what causes cancer in
epidemiological studies that's kind of

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160
epidemiological studies that's kind of
 

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.160
epidemiological studies that's kind of
noisy because people can get cancer from

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:54.170
noisy because people can get cancer from
 

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.320

that's what you see the but the issue is

that's what you see the but the issue is
 

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.510
that's what you see the but the issue is
if you misinterpret it and then go

see it picks up Valentine's Day it's

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:25.530
see it picks up Valentine's Day it's
 

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.290
see it picks up Valentine's Day it's
actually interesting because Valentine's

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:27.300
actually interesting because Valentine's
 

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.660
actually interesting because Valentine's
Day is the only day that has too many

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:29.670

that's not quite true because December

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:34.830
that's not quite true because December
 

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.980
that's not quite true because December
24th and December 26 have too

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:36.990
24th and December 26 have too
 

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.320
24th and December 26 have too
any babies but that's because there's a

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:39.330
any babies but that's because there's a
 

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.500
any babies but that's because there's a
sort of principle that the baby has to

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:42.510
sort of principle that the baby has to
 

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.540
sort of principle that the baby has to
come out at some point or another so if

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:44.550
come out at some point or another so if
 

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.830
come out at some point or another so if
you have fewer babies one day you have

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840
you have fewer babies one day you have
 

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.740
you have fewer babies one day you have
to have more nearby but Valentine's Day

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:48.750
to have more nearby but Valentine's Day
 

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.660
to have more nearby but Valentine's Day
is kind of special so I actually really

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:50.670
is kind of special so I actually really
 

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.650
is kind of special so I actually really
like that paper that that found that um

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:53.660
like that paper that that found that um

then we we got more data this is from
 

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:04.130
then we we got more data this is from
2000 to 2015 and it's similar I want you

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:04.140
2000 to 2015 and it's similar I want you

to go back and look at this one for a
 

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.980
to go back and look at this one for a
second you see that the scale on the

what's going on with this because I
click it's like a delay okay that the

not so helpful if you see that like New

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:43.950
not so helpful if you see that like New
 

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.230
not so helpful if you see that like New
Year's they're about at 80 or so then if

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240
Year's they're about at 80 or so then if
 

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.049
Year's they're about at 80 or so then if
you look at the more recent data the

00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:50.059
you look at the more recent data the
 

00:19:50.059 --> 00:19:53.480

thank you now there are around 60 so

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:57.870
thank you now there are around 60 so

thank you now there are around 60 so
there's just a lot more induce births

00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460
there's just a lot more induce births
 

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.890
there's just a lot more induce births
than there used to be but I actually

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900
than there used to be but I actually
 

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.390
than there used to be but I actually
want to focus on something slightly

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400
want to focus on something slightly
 

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.360
want to focus on something slightly
different here look at what's going on

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:05.370
different here look at what's going on
 

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:11.960
different here look at what's going on
around after 9/11 which is a less

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:11.970
around after 9/11 which is a less
 

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:13.730

popular birthday now do you see that

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:13.740
popular birthday now do you see that
 

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.410
popular birthday now do you see that
there's a two-week period where there's

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:15.420
there's a two-week period where there's
 

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.560
there's a two-week period where there's
too many babies and that seems to that

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:18.570
too many babies and that seems to that
 

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.930
too many babies and that seems to that
violates the baby has to come out

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940
violates the baby has to come out
 

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.600
violates the baby has to come out
somewhere principle you can't have like

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:23.610
somewhere principle you can't have like
 

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.600
somewhere principle you can't have like
you can't be like scheduling your babies

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:26.610
you can't be like scheduling your babies
 

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.460
you can't be like scheduling your babies
to for two straight weeks like where the

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:28.470
to for two straight weeks like where the
 

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.390
to for two straight weeks like where the
babies come from

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400
babies come from
 

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.580
babies come from
okay so what's really happening is that

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:31.590
okay so what's really happening is that
 

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.880
okay so what's really happening is that
the the sort of lump the the positive

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:34.890
the the sort of lump the the positive
 

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.400
the the sort of lump the the positive
thing that's happening after 9/11 is not

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:37.410
thing that's happening after 9/11 is not
 

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.380
thing that's happening after 9/11 is not
it's really not about scheduling birth

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:39.390
it's really not about scheduling birth
 

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.470
it's really not about scheduling birth
that's just a seasonal effect now look

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480
that's just a seasonal effect now look
 

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.880
that's just a seasonal effect now look
at that seasonal curve do you see how

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:43.890
at that seasonal curve do you see how
 

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.760
at that seasonal curve do you see how
smooth it is now if we go back to the

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:46.770
smooth it is now if we go back to the
 

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.970
smooth it is now if we go back to the
previous slide

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:49.980
 
 

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.570
 
if we go yes now you see there's like a

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:54.580
if we go yes now you see there's like a
 

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.040
if we go yes now you see there's like a
bump at the end of September so there

00:20:59.040 --> 00:20:59.050
bump at the end of September so there
 

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.900
bump at the end of September so there
was kind of a this model fit the data

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:00.910
was kind of a this model fit the data
 

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.000
was kind of a this model fit the data
the second model kind of fit the data

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.010
the second model kind of fit the data
 

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.740
the second model kind of fit the data
well I'm going to go back to the next

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:04.750
well I'm going to go back to the next
 

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:09.360
well I'm going to go back to the next
slide now please the yes this model sort

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:09.370
slide now please the yes this model sort
 

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:11.310
slide now please the yes this model sort
of fits the data wrong because it puts

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320
of fits the data wrong because it puts
 

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.980
of fits the data wrong because it puts
in this slow change in the jet in

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:13.990
in this slow change in the jet in
 

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.740
in this slow change in the jet in
November in September it puts it on the

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:16.750
November in September it puts it on the
 

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.270
November in September it puts it on the
bottom and it should be really on the

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:18.280
bottom and it should be really on the
 

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.850
bottom and it should be really on the
third thing so we realize there is a

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:20.860
third thing so we realize there is a
 

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.100
third thing so we realize there is a
problem with our model and the prep we

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.110
problem with our model and the prep we
 

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.230
problem with our model and the prep we
have prior information that's not in the

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:25.240
have prior information that's not in the
 

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.620
have prior information that's not in the
model and the information is the baby

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:28.630
model and the information is the baby
 

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.960
model and the information is the baby
has to come out somewhere right so our

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:30.970
has to come out somewhere right so our
 

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.420
has to come out somewhere right so our
model said that every day all three

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:33.430
model said that every day all three
 

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.700

days of the year there could be a spike

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740
days of the year there could be a spike
 

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.620
days of the year there could be a spike
extra bursts are not enough burst and it

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:40.630
extra bursts are not enough burst and it
 

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.360
extra bursts are not enough burst and it
tries to fit what we really need is a

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:42.370
tries to fit what we really need is a
 

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:45.030
tries to fit what we really need is a
model with a ringing so it says there's

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.040
model with a ringing so it says there's
 

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.040
model with a ringing so it says there's
a day with two not enough births and

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:47.050
a day with two not enough births and
 

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.660
a day with two not enough births and
then the days before and after have to

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:48.670
then the days before and after have to
 

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.310
then the days before and after have to
have extra births to counterbalance that

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320
have extra births to counterbalance that
 

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.040
have extra births to counterbalance that
otherwise it doesn't add up so we didn't

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.050
otherwise it doesn't add up so we didn't
 

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.450
otherwise it doesn't add up so we didn't
put that in the model and their first

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:54.460
put that in the model and their first
 

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.670
put that in the model and their first
data analysis we got lucky and it sort

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:56.680
data analysis we got lucky and it sort
 

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.500
data analysis we got lucky and it sort
of worked out but in the second data

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:58.510
of worked out but in the second data
 

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.140
of worked out but in the second data
analysis it didn't like discover the

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.150
analysis it didn't like discover the
 

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:05.430
analysis it didn't like discover the
right thing and and so I there are a lot

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440
right thing and and so I there are a lot
 

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:11.580
right thing and and so I there are a lot
of points of this example but maybe the

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:11.590
of points of this example but maybe the
 

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.320
of points of this example but maybe the
most important is the way that we go

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:13.330
most important is the way that we go
 

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.480
most important is the way that we go
back and forth between our model our

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:15.490
back and forth between our model our
 

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.780
back and forth between our model our
data and our scientific questions we're

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:18.790
data and our scientific questions we're
 

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:21.120
data and our scientific questions we're
not we're sort of circling through

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:21.130
not we're sort of circling through
 

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.400
not we're sort of circling through
looping back and the stronger the model

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:23.410
looping back and the stronger the model
 

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.110
looping back and the stronger the model
we make the more we can learn when the

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120
we make the more we can learn when the
 

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.220
we make the more we can learn when the
model doesn't doesn't fit um now the

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:29.230
model doesn't doesn't fit um now the
 

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.740
model doesn't doesn't fit um now the
other relevant point about this is it

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:31.750
other relevant point about this is it
 

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.840
other relevant point about this is it

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:28.920
intervention with their mothers at the
 

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.040
intervention with their mothers at the
age of four and half of them didn't now

it only got published recently because

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:32.790
it only got published recently because
 

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.090
it only got published recently because
they followed them up for 20 years and

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100
they followed them up for 20 years and
 

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.760
they followed them up for 20 years and
they recorded their earnings once they

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:37.770
they recorded their earnings once they
 

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.340
they recorded their earnings once they
were grownups and they found that the

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:40.350
were grownups and they found that the
 

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.760
were grownups and they found that the
kids who had the intervention had 42%

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:43.770
kids who had the intervention had 42%
 

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.260
kids who had the intervention had 42%
higher earnings than the kids without

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:45.270
higher earnings than the kids without
 

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.410
higher earnings than the kids without
the intervention now 42% is pretty good

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:48.420
the intervention now 42% is pretty good
 

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.080
the intervention now 42% is pretty good
in fact not only was it a large number

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:51.090
in fact not only was it a large number
 

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:53.299
in fact not only was it a large number
but it was statistically significant to

00:27:53.299 --> 00:27:53.309
but it was statistically significant to
 

00:27:53.309 --> 00:27:55.130
but it was statistically significant to
be statistically significant you have to

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140
be statistically significant you have to
 

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.630
be statistically significant you have to
be at least two standard errors away

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640
be at least two standard errors away
 

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.000
be at least two standard errors away
from zero a standard error is a measure

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.010
from zero a standard error is a measure
 

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.610
from zero a standard error is a measure
of uncertainty and so the standard error

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620
of uncertainty and so the standard error
 

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:05.620
of uncertainty and so the standard error
of this study was about 20 points so

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:05.630
of this study was about 20 points so
 

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:12.560
of this study was about 20 points so
what what that means is what does that

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:12.570
what what that means is what does that
 

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.070
what what that means is what does that
mean

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080
mean
 

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.530
mean
well that means that they couldn't have

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:15.540
well that means that they couldn't have
 

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.500
well that means that they couldn't have
seen an estimate of less than 40 percent

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:18.510
seen an estimate of less than 40 percent
 

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.450
seen an estimate of less than 40 percent
or it wouldn't have been statistically

00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:20.460
or it wouldn't have been statistically
 

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:21.710
or it wouldn't have been statistically
significant it wouldn't have been

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720

this is 1 standard error which is 20
 

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.540
this is 1 standard error which is 20
percent in fact any effect estimate had

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:32.550
percent in fact any effect estimate had
 

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:36.049
percent in fact any effect estimate had
to be at least plus 40 or minus 40 or it

00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059
to be at least plus 40 or minus 40 or it
 

00:28:36.059 --> 00:28:37.970
to be at least plus 40 or minus 40 or it
wouldn't have been published so when

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980
wouldn't have been published so when
 

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.980
wouldn't have been published so when
they said it was not only statistically

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:39.990
they said it was not only statistically
 

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.740
they said it was not only statistically
significant it was also large it was a

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:42.750
significant it was also large it was a
 

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.660
significant it was also large it was a
statistically significant it had to be

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:44.670
statistically significant it had to be
 

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:50.450
statistically significant it had to be
large now let's just suppose well I'll

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460
large now let's just suppose well I'll
 

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.310

of the kids left Jamaica the kids who

00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200
of the kids left Jamaica the kids who
 

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.660
of the kids left Jamaica the kids who
left Jamaica actually had higher

00:28:59.660 --> 00:28:59.670
left Jamaica actually had higher
 

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:01.160
left Jamaica actually had higher
earnings and the ones who didn't leave

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:01.170
earnings and the ones who didn't leave
 

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.140
earnings and the ones who didn't leave
Jamaica more kids in the treatment group

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:03.150
Jamaica more kids in the treatment group
 

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:04.880
Jamaica more kids in the treatment group
left Jamaica and in the control group

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:04.890
left Jamaica and in the control group
 

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.710
left Jamaica and in the control group
there were different missing data than

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720
there were different missing data than
 

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.750
there were different missing data than
that's okay that that always happens let

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760
that's okay that that always happens let
 

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.610
that's okay that that always happens let
me ask you this what did the true effect

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620
me ask you this what did the true effect
 

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.640
me ask you this what did the true effect
was 5 percent that would be pretty good

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:13.650
was 5 percent that would be pretty good
 

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.440
was 5 percent that would be pretty good
if you could do an intervention for

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:15.450
if you could do an intervention for
 

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:16.910
if you could do an intervention for
four-year-olds and then 20 years later

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:16.920
four-year-olds and then 20 years later
 

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.560
four-year-olds and then 20 years later
their incomes are 5 percent higher that

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:18.570
their incomes are 5 percent higher that
 

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:19.910
their incomes are 5 percent higher that
would be great well if the estimate were

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:19.920
would be great well if the estimate were
 

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.910
would be great well if the estimate were
5 percent then the published estimate

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:22.920
5 percent then the published estimate
 

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.430
5 percent then the published estimate
from this study has to be at least 8

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440
from this study has to be at least 8
 

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.210
from this study has to be at least 8
times larger than the true effect well

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.220
times larger than the true effect well
 

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.740
times larger than the true effect well
then you might say well 8 times that's

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:30.750
then you might say well 8 times that's
 

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.240
then you might say well 8 times that's
that's kind of too bad but at least they

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.250
that's kind of too bad but at least they
 

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.370
that's kind of too bad but at least they
got the direction right but I don't know

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380
got the direction right but I don't know
 

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.960
got the direction right but I don't know
that they got the direction right what

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:35.970
that they got the direction right what
 

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:37.700
that they got the direction right what
if the true effect was minus 5 percent

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:37.710
if the true effect was minus 5 percent
 

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.950
if the true effect was minus 5 percent
well that's silly how could it hurt to

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960
well that's silly how could it hurt to
 

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.280
well that's silly how could it hurt to
do an

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:40.290
do an
 

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.480
do an
intervention well you could you could

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:41.490
intervention well you could you could
 

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.820
intervention well you could you could
imagine it you know all they thought you

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:43.830
imagine it you know all they thought you
 

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:45.800
imagine it you know all they thought you
know well we're all set we don't need to

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:45.810
know well we're all set we don't need to
 

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:47.240
know well we're all set we don't need to
do XY and Z because we're getting the

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.250
do XY and Z because we're getting the
 

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.500
do XY and Z because we're getting the
intervention you know whatever I don't

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:48.510
intervention you know whatever I don't
 

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:51.500
intervention you know whatever I don't
know baby it hurts because after all if

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:51.510
know baby it hurts because after all if
 

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.030
know baby it hurts because after all if
they spent an hour a week or two hour a

they spent an hour a week or two hour a
 

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.560
they spent an hour a week or two hour a
week doing this maybe they were doing

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:54.570
week doing this maybe they were doing

that instead of doing something you know

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:56.310

more more useful right inter with their
time opportunity cost right we've heard

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.140
time opportunity cost right we've heard
 

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:01.640
time opportunity cost right we've heard
about that

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:01.650
about that
 

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:04.030
about that
what did the true effect or minus 5%

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:04.040
what did the true effect or minus 5%
 

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.620
what did the true effect or minus 5%
well the estimated effect would still

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:06.630
well the estimated effect would still
 

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.590
well the estimated effect would still
have to be at least 40% so it could be -

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600
have to be at least 40% so it could be -
 

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.000
have to be at least 40% so it could be -
it could be too high by a factor of

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:11.010
it could be too high by a factor of
 

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.970
it could be too high by a factor of
eight in the wrong direction even now we

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:13.980
eight in the wrong direction even now we
 

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:16.430
eight in the wrong direction even now we
call this the statistical significance

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440
call this the statistical significance
 

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.250
call this the statistical significance
filter it leads to systemic over

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260
filter it leads to systemic over
 

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.700
filter it leads to systemic over
estimates of effect sizes it's one of

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:22.710
estimates of effect sizes it's one of
 

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.930
estimates of effect sizes it's one of
these things that everybody knows and

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940
these things that everybody knows and
 

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.460
these things that everybody knows and
people don't know so they call these

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:25.470
people don't know so they call these
 

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.590
people don't know so they call these
things unbiased estimates even though

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600
things unbiased estimates even though
 

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.570
things unbiased estimates even though
they can be eight times higher than the

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580
they can be eight times higher than the
 

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.190
they can be eight times higher than the
true effect but it's it's a little bit

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200
true effect but it's it's a little bit
 

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.200
true effect but it's it's a little bit
worse than this because there's a

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.210
worse than this because there's a
 

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.180
worse than this because there's a
feedback loop and the feedback loop goes

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:38.190
feedback loop and the feedback loop goes
 

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:42.230
feedback loop and the feedback loop goes
as follows I'm designing a new study so

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240
as follows I'm designing a new study so
 

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.960
as follows I'm designing a new study so
how large should my study be well I have

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:44.970
how large should my study be well I have
 

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.370
how large should my study be well I have
to have a sense of how large could be

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380
to have a sense of how large could be
 

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.740
to have a sense of how large could be
effect B so I look in the literature and

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:48.750
effect B so I look in the literature and
 

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:50.630
effect B so I look in the literature and
the literature says oh this treatment

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640
the literature says oh this treatment
 

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.510
the literature says oh this treatment
has an effect of 40% oh this is a pretty

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520
has an effect of 40% oh this is a pretty
 

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.220
has an effect of 40% oh this is a pretty
big effect I guess if we study is this

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:55.230
big effect I guess if we study is this
 

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.860

big I'm very likely of a high power I'm

it's not like conventional polling is so

00:37:59.120 --> 00:37:59.130
it's not like conventional polling is so

so we adjusted the Xbox poll for

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:16.170
so we adjusted the Xbox poll for
 

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.250
so we adjusted the Xbox poll for
demographics we shifted based on their

ethnicity and their age and so forth and
 

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.630
ethnicity and their age and so forth and
then you get these this estimate over

something like pollster calm although
it's kind of impressive because each dot

00:38:34.279 --> 00:38:34.289
it's kind of impressive because each dot
 

00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:36.140
it's kind of impressive because each dot
data from a separate day they're not

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:36.150
data from a separate day they're not
 

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.059
data from a separate day they're not
this is not a running average it's

00:38:38.059 --> 00:38:38.069
this is not a running average it's
 

00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:43.459
this is not a running average it's
actually that the data pretty cool we

00:38:43.459 --> 00:38:43.469
actually that the data pretty cool we
 

00:38:43.469 --> 00:38:46.159
actually that the data pretty cool we
could do better though because in this

00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:46.169
could do better though because in this
 

00:38:46.169 --> 00:38:50.509
could do better though because in this
poll we also asked people are they

00:38:50.509 --> 00:38:50.519
poll we also asked people are they
 

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:52.130
poll we also asked people are they
Democrat Republican or an independent

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.140
Democrat Republican or an independent
 

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.599
Democrat Republican or an independent
and we asked how they voted in the

00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:53.609
and we asked how they voted in the
 

00:38:53.609 --> 00:38:55.909
and we asked how they voted in the
previous election and we can also adjust

00:38:55.909 --> 00:38:55.919
previous election and we can also adjust
 

00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:57.589
previous election and we can also adjust
for that because the poll had too many

00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599
for that because the poll had too many
 

00:38:57.599 --> 00:39:00.289
for that because the poll had too many
Republicans and after you do that you

00:39:00.289 --> 00:39:00.299
Republicans and after you do that you
 

00:39:00.299 --> 00:39:02.689
Republicans and after you do that you
get the dark line here so the light line

00:39:02.689 --> 00:39:02.699
get the dark line here so the light line
 

00:39:02.699 --> 00:39:05.659
get the dark line here so the light line
is what you got from the just adjusting

00:39:05.659 --> 00:39:05.669
is what you got from the just adjusting
 

00:39:05.669 --> 00:39:07.309
is what you got from the just adjusting
for demographics so by adjusting for

00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319
for demographics so by adjusting for
 

00:39:07.319 --> 00:39:09.529
for demographics so by adjusting for
partisanship that actually gets rid of

00:39:09.529 --> 00:39:09.539
partisanship that actually gets rid of
 

00:39:09.539 --> 00:39:11.539
partisanship that actually gets rid of
more than half of the variation over

00:39:11.539 --> 00:39:11.549
more than half of the variation over
 

00:39:11.549 --> 00:39:16.519
more than half of the variation over
time what this tells us I mean we went

00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:16.529
time what this tells us I mean we went
 

00:39:16.529 --> 00:39:18.229
time what this tells us I mean we went
through a lot to try to interpret this

00:39:18.229 --> 00:39:18.239
through a lot to try to interpret this
 

00:39:18.239 --> 00:39:20.569
through a lot to try to interpret this
but I think what this tells us is that

00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:20.579
but I think what this tells us is that
 

00:39:20.579 --> 00:39:23.269
but I think what this tells us is that
most of the variation in the polls is

00:39:23.269 --> 00:39:23.279
most of the variation in the polls is
 

00:39:23.279 --> 00:39:26.989
most of the variation in the polls is
due to differential non-response so when

00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:26.999
due to differential non-response so when
 

00:39:26.999 --> 00:39:31.130
due to differential non-response so when
your candidate is not doing well you

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:31.140
your candidate is not doing well you
 

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.809
your candidate is not doing well you
don't really want to respond to the poll

00:39:32.809 --> 00:39:32.819
don't really want to respond to the poll
 

00:39:32.819 --> 00:39:36.439
don't really want to respond to the poll
and so your candidates even less well

00:39:36.439 --> 00:39:36.449
and so your candidates even less well
 

00:39:36.449 --> 00:39:38.719
and so your candidates even less well
Nepal and when your candidates doing

00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:38.729
Nepal and when your candidates doing
 

00:39:38.729 --> 00:39:40.939
Nepal and when your candidates doing
well they're like yeah I'll play the

00:39:40.939 --> 00:39:40.949
well they're like yeah I'll play the
 

00:39:40.949 --> 00:39:43.579
well they're like yeah I'll play the
polling game this is fun yeah how's my

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:43.589
polling game this is fun yeah how's my
 

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:45.919
polling game this is fun yeah how's my
guy doing let's check let's check again

00:39:45.919 --> 00:39:45.929
guy doing let's check let's check again
 

00:39:45.929 --> 00:39:47.749
guy doing let's check let's check again
let's see it's Mike I still ahead this

00:39:47.749 --> 00:39:47.759
let's see it's Mike I still ahead this
 

00:39:47.759 --> 00:39:51.469
let's see it's Mike I still ahead this
is great this is fun and so the poll

00:39:51.469 --> 00:39:51.479
is great this is fun and so the poll
 

00:39:51.479 --> 00:39:52.729
is great this is fun and so the poll
this exagerate s--

00:39:52.729 --> 00:39:52.739
this exagerate s--
 

00:39:52.739 --> 00:39:56.269
this exagerate s--
suites in true public opinion now what's

00:39:56.269 --> 00:39:56.279
suites in true public opinion now what's
 

00:39:56.279 --> 00:39:59.479
suites in true public opinion now what's
going on here is that 60% of people vote

00:39:59.479 --> 00:39:59.489
going on here is that 60% of people vote
 

00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:02.329
going on here is that 60% of people vote
but less than 10% of people participate

00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:02.339
but less than 10% of people participate
 

00:40:02.339 --> 00:40:04.489
but less than 10% of people participate
in polls so answering a survey is

00:40:04.489 --> 00:40:04.499
in polls so answering a survey is
 

00:40:04.499 --> 00:40:07.969
in polls so answering a survey is
optional and whether you answer a survey

00:40:07.969 --> 00:40:07.979
optional and whether you answer a survey
 

00:40:07.979 --> 00:40:10.849
optional and whether you answer a survey
depends a lot a lot on your mood so this

00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:10.859
depends a lot a lot on your mood so this
 

00:40:10.859 --> 00:40:13.880
depends a lot a lot on your mood so this
is kind of an amazing example because

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:13.890
is kind of an amazing example because
 

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:15.559
is kind of an amazing example because
not only did we do better than

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:15.569
not only did we do better than
 

00:40:15.569 --> 00:40:17.029
not only did we do better than
conventional polls but we learned

00:40:17.029 --> 00:40:17.039
conventional polls but we learned
 

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:18.890
conventional polls but we learned
something new and it all kind of fits

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:18.900
something new and it all kind of fits
 

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.589
something new and it all kind of fits
together and again as with the birthday

00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599
together and again as with the birthday
 

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:23.419
together and again as with the birthday
example it fits together because we're

00:40:23.419 --> 00:40:23.429
example it fits together because we're
 

00:40:23.429 --> 00:40:25.429
example it fits together because we're
looking at more things if I had just

00:40:25.429 --> 00:40:25.439
looking at more things if I had just
 

00:40:25.439 --> 00:40:27.799
looking at more things if I had just
studied one day and tried to adjust it

00:40:27.799 --> 00:40:27.809
studied one day and tried to adjust it
 

00:40:27.809 --> 00:40:30.140
studied one day and tried to adjust it
perfectly I wouldn't have learned we

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:30.150
perfectly I wouldn't have learned we
 

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:35.310
perfectly I wouldn't have learned we
wouldn't have learned from that

big models the most important aspect of
 

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:21.510
big models the most important aspect of
a statistical method is not what it does

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520
a statistical method is not what it does
 

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:24.290
a statistical method is not what it does
with the data but what data it uses and

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300
with the data but what data it uses and
 

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.000
with the data but what data it uses and
so the important part of a big model is

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.010
so the important part of a big model is
 

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.830
so the important part of a big model is
that it's big enough to allow you to put

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:28.840
that it's big enough to allow you to put
 

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:34.470
that it's big enough to allow you to put
the data in this afternoon my department

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480
the data in this afternoon my department
 

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.750
the data in this afternoon my department
chair richard davis came by and he said

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760
chair richard davis came by and he said
 

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.490
chair richard davis came by and he said
you're giving this talk he said don't

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:38.500
you're giving this talk he said don't
 

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.760
you're giving this talk he said don't
forget don't forget to plug statistics

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:41.770
forget don't forget to plug statistics
 

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:45.360
forget don't forget to plug statistics
and say how important so I was thinking

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:45.370
and say how important so I was thinking
 

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:46.820
and say how important so I was thinking
about that

00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:46.830
about that
 

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:49.830
about that
so math I'll talk about math but like

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:49.840
so math I'll talk about math but like
 

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.400
so math I'll talk about math but like
mathematics plays three roles in this

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:53.410
mathematics plays three roles in this
 

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:56.310
mathematics plays three roles in this
story the first is it's a substitute for

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:56.320
story the first is it's a substitute for
 

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.240
story the first is it's a substitute for
replication

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:57.250
replication
 

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:00.180
replication
it's a substitute for data someone does

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:00.190
it's a substitute for data someone does
 

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:02.520
it's a substitute for data someone does
a study and I can say looking at the

00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:02.530
a study and I can say looking at the
 

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.250
a study and I can say looking at the
math don't bother replicating this study

00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:05.260
math don't bother replicating this study
 

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.339
math don't bother replicating this study
it's not gonna work it's all noise I can

00:43:08.339 --> 00:43:08.349
it's not gonna work it's all noise I can
 

00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:10.320
it's not gonna work it's all noise I can
see you know your ass - your effect is

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:10.330
see you know your ass - your effect is
 

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:11.940
see you know your ass - your effect is
no more than this big in your standard

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:11.950
no more than this big in your standard
 

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:14.580

error is this big so math help me math

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:14.590
error is this big so math help me math

statistics setting we use mathematical

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:22.060
statistics setting we use mathematical
 

00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:24.330
statistics setting we use mathematical
models for variation how we did stuff

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:24.340
models for variation how we did stuff
 

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:26.670
models for variation how we did stuff
like that birthday example or the Xbox

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680
like that birthday example or the Xbox
 

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.370
like that birthday example or the Xbox
we have models

00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:29.380
we have models
 

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:31.980
we have models
you can't just stare at the data and do

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:31.990
you can't just stare at the data and do
 

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:34.050
you can't just stare at the data and do
that finally we need a lot of math to

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:34.060
that finally we need a lot of math to
 

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.150
that finally we need a lot of math to
make the computing work so to actually

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160
make the computing work so to actually
 

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.339
make the computing work so to actually
fit the models we want to fit require a

00:43:38.339 --> 00:43:38.349
fit the models we want to fit require a
 

00:43:38.349 --> 00:43:43.200

lot of a lot of research there's two

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:43.210
lot of a lot of research there's two
 

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:45.180
lot of a lot of research there's two
things I wanted to mention before

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:45.190
things I wanted to mention before
 

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:49.500
things I wanted to mention before
closing and one is the folk theorem of

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:49.510
closing and one is the folk theorem of
 

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:52.170
closing and one is the folk theorem of
statistical computing which is that when

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:52.180
statistical computing which is that when
 

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.030
statistical computing which is that when
you have a problem with your computation

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040
you have a problem with your computation
 

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.740
you have a problem with your computation
typically there's a problem with your

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:55.750
typically there's a problem with your
 

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.160
typically there's a problem with your
model when your computer is running slow

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:58.170
model when your computer is running slow
 

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:00.420

there's often like something that went

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:00.430
there's often like something that went
 

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:04.020
there's often like something that went
wrong that you did wrong and and that

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:04.030
wrong that you did wrong and and that
 

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:07.020
wrong that you did wrong and and that
again like it's I'm sort of mentioning

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:07.030
again like it's I'm sort of mentioning
 

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:08.460
again like it's I'm sort of mentioning
that like a little bit of what it feels

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:08.470
that like a little bit of what it feels
 

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:12.510
that like a little bit of what it feels
like to do what it to do what we do um

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:12.520
like to do what it to do what we do um
 

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.060
like to do what it to do what we do um
the other thing that I wanted to say was

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:15.070
the other thing that I wanted to say was
 

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:19.130
the other thing that I wanted to say was
that about these political studies

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140
that about these political studies
 

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.990
that about these political studies
claims that voters are affected by

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000
claims that voters are affected by
 

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.800
claims that voters are affected by
little things strange things like

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:24.810
little things strange things like
 

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.630
little things strange things like
sporting events and shark attacks a

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:27.640
sporting events and shark attacks a
 

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:30.120
sporting events and shark attacks a
claim that voters are shallow is very

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:30.130
claim that voters are shallow is very
 

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.400
claim that voters are shallow is very
popular on the left and on the right and

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:32.410
popular on the left and on the right and
 

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.680
popular on the left and on the right and
on the left you can say well voters are

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:34.690
on the left you can say well voters are
 

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:37.680
on the left you can say well voters are
so shallow this system is a sham on the

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:37.690
so shallow this system is a sham on the
 

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:40.440
so shallow this system is a sham on the
right it can be used to discredit

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:40.450
right it can be used to discredit
 

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.810
right it can be used to discredit
democracy and say well gee if we don't

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:42.820
democracy and say well gee if we don't
 

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.970
democracy and say well gee if we don't
trust voters we should diminish the

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:44.980
trust voters we should diminish the
 

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.339
trust voters we should diminish the
political sphere get rid of taxes

00:44:47.339 --> 00:44:47.349
political sphere get rid of taxes
 

00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:50.040
political sphere get rid of taxes
because we don't trust democracy and and

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:50.050
because we don't trust democracy and and
 

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:53.010
because we don't trust democracy and and
I don't think that's right and I say

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:53.020
I don't think that's right and I say
 

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.020
I don't think that's right and I say
that kind of as a statistician I think a

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.030
that kind of as a statistician I think a
 

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.140
that kind of as a statistician I think a
lot of these claims that have been made

00:44:57.140 --> 00:44:57.150
lot of these claims that have been made
 

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:01.089
lot of these claims that have been made
have been made based on very noisy data

00:45:01.089 --> 00:45:01.099
have been made based on very noisy data
 

00:45:01.099 --> 00:45:03.769
have been made based on very noisy data
people have set themselves up to find

00:45:03.769 --> 00:45:03.779
people have set themselves up to find
 

00:45:03.779 --> 00:45:06.259
people have set themselves up to find
effects so they look to find something

00:45:06.259 --> 00:45:06.269
effects so they look to find something
 

00:45:06.269 --> 00:45:08.450
effects so they look to find something
and they find it and in that world every

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460
and they find it and in that world every
 

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.640
and they find it and in that world every
nudge has a large effect and I don't

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:10.650
nudge has a large effect and I don't
 

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.620
nudge has a large effect and I don't
think that's does not seem to actually

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:12.630
think that's does not seem to actually
 

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.079
think that's does not seem to actually
describe the world as I see it and that

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:15.089
describe the world as I see it and that
 

00:45:15.089 --> 00:45:17.779
describe the world as I see it and that
Xbox example showed how all these swings

00:45:17.779 --> 00:45:17.789
Xbox example showed how all these swings
 

00:45:17.789 --> 00:45:19.819
Xbox example showed how all these swings
that you see in raw data when you look

00:45:19.819 --> 00:45:19.829
that you see in raw data when you look
 

00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:21.079
that you see in raw data when you look
at them carefully there's there's

00:45:21.079 --> 00:45:21.089
at them carefully there's there's
 

00:45:21.089 --> 00:45:23.529
at them carefully there's there's
actually a lot more a lot more stability

00:45:23.529 --> 00:45:23.539
actually a lot more a lot more stability
 

00:45:23.539 --> 00:45:30.400
actually a lot more a lot more stability
so in summary I want to close with I

different p-value from the results and
 

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:48.350
different p-value from the results and
so my question is since so much of

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:48.360
so my question is since so much of
 

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.480
so my question is since so much of
medical research is based on this idea

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:50.490
medical research is based on this idea
 

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:52.490
medical research is based on this idea
of drug versus placebo and before and

00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500
of drug versus placebo and before and
 

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.560
of drug versus placebo and before and
after effects why is there not a

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:54.570
after effects why is there not a
 

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:56.660
after effects why is there not a
standard for medical research so that

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:56.670
standard for medical research so that
 

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.520
standard for medical research so that
given a certain set of data all

00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:58.530
given a certain set of data all
 

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.200
given a certain set of data all
researchers would obtain the same

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:00.210
researchers would obtain the same
 

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:03.890
researchers would obtain the same
p-value I don't think the p-value is so

00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900
p-value I don't think the p-value is so
 

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.200
p-value I don't think the p-value is so
important so I think we should be moving

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:06.210
important so I think we should be moving
 

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.290
important so I think we should be moving
toward a framework of continuous quality

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300
toward a framework of continuous quality
 

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.020
toward a framework of continuous quality
improvement which is an idea that's been

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:12.030
improvement which is an idea that's been
 

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:15.800
improvement which is an idea that's been
around in industry since the 1920s has

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:15.810
around in industry since the 1920s has
 

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.930
around in industry since the 1920s has
been very popular in the Japanese auto

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940
been very popular in the Japanese auto
 

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.630

industry for for many decades I think

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640
industry for for many decades I think
 

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.420
industry for for many decades I think
the model medical research I think the

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:23.430
the model medical research I think the
 

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.610
the model medical research I think the
model should not be we have this

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:25.620
model should not be we have this
 

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.400
model should not be we have this
isolated thing which works I think we

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:28.410
isolated thing which works I think we
 

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.850
isolated thing which works I think we
should be talking about continuing to

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:30.860
should be talking about continuing to
 

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:36.200
should be talking about continuing to
process improvement in which I believe

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:36.210
process improvement in which I believe
 

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:39.730
process improvement in which I believe
that the doctors in patients who are

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:39.740
that the doctors in patients who are
 

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.410
that the doctors in patients who are
trying out these methods should be more

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420
trying out these methods should be more
 

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:45.560
trying out these methods should be more
active participants and so I that the

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:45.570
active participants and so I that the
 

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:48.590
active participants and so I that the
point is that a stent is not an abstract

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:48.600
point is that a stent is not an abstract
 

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.570
point is that a stent is not an abstract
thing if people are doing it for a

00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:50.580
thing if people are doing it for a
 

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.820
thing if people are doing it for a
reason and I think that there should be

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:52.830
reason and I think that there should be
 

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:56.090
reason and I think that there should be
in the ideal world more experimentation

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:56.100
in the ideal world more experimentation
 

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.100
in the ideal world more experimentation
and data collection at the level of the

00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:58.110
and data collection at the level of the
 

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:00.590
and data collection at the level of the
individual patient moving away from this

was I think another interesting example

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:35.320

that there were certain state polls that

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:55.600
that there were certain state polls that
 

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.300
that there were certain state polls that
didn't do so well because they didn't do

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:57.310
didn't do so well because they didn't do

it's a funny thing about state polls

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:05.430
it's a funny thing about state polls
 

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:10.230
it's a funny thing about state polls
that a state poll is as expensive as a

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240
that a state poll is as expensive as a
 

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.230
that a state poll is as expensive as a
national poll because surveying 1,500

national poll because surveying 1,500
 

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.690
national poll because surveying 1,500
people just cost the same amount but the

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:15.700
people just cost the same amount but the
 

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.520
people just cost the same amount but the
people who do state poll like there's a

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:17.530
people who do state poll like there's a
 

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.200
people who do state poll like there's a
lot less money to be made in the state

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:19.210
lot less money to be made in the state
 

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:21.480

what do I think is a solution I think

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:23.290
what do I think is a solution I think
 

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:25.050
what do I think is a solution I think
the solution is to use the national

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:25.060
the solution is to use the national
 

00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:28.350
the solution is to use the national
polls and use partial pooling Mr P to

very related question but near the end

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:41.560
very related question but near the end
 

00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:42.570
very related question but near the end
of your talk you mentioned about

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:42.580
of your talk you mentioned about
 

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.450
of your talk you mentioned about
voluntary response bias and especially

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:45.460
voluntary response bias and especially
 

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.610
voluntary response bias and especially
things with like an Xbox poll and on

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:47.620
things with like an Xbox poll and on
 

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:49.740
things with like an Xbox poll and on
campus you know there are these polls

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:49.750
campus you know there are these polls
 

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:52.410
campus you know there are these polls
all the time when someone is designing

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:52.420
all the time when someone is designing
 

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:55.320
all the time when someone is designing
these type of poll polls or surveys what

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:55.330
these type of poll polls or surveys what
 

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:56.400
these type of poll polls or surveys what
should they have in mind

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:56.410
should they have in mind
 

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.470
should they have in mind
from the outset try to eliminate that

00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480
from the outset try to eliminate that
 

00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.730
from the outset try to eliminate that
bias before they have to take into

00:49:59.730 --> 00:49:59.740
bias before they have to take into
 

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.130
bias before they have to take into
account all those variables I think the

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:02.140
account all those variables I think the
 

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.930
account all those variables I think the
number one thing is you should think of

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:03.940
number one thing is you should think of
 

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.970
number one thing is you should think of
the people who respond your to the polls

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:05.980
the people who respond your to the polls
 

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:08.670
the people who respond your to the polls
as your research partners don't think of

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:08.680
as your research partners don't think of
 

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.810
as your research partners don't think of
them as like like you know like animals

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:12.820
them as like like you know like animals
 

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:14.580
them as like like you know like animals
that you're measuring you like think of

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:14.590
that you're measuring you like think of
 

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:17.730
that you're measuring you like think of
them as like participants so figure out

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:17.740
them as like participants so figure out
 

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.849
them as like participants so figure out
like what you want to know from them

00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:19.859
like what you want to know from them
 

00:50:19.859 --> 00:50:21.289
like what you want to know from them
and how you can ask it and how they can

00:50:21.289 --> 00:50:21.299
and how you can ask it and how they can
 

00:50:21.299 --> 00:50:23.359
and how you can ask it and how they can
help because conditional on someone

00:50:23.359 --> 00:50:23.369
help because conditional on someone
 

00:50:23.369 --> 00:50:25.039

responding to a poll in the first place

00:50:25.039 --> 00:50:25.049
responding to a poll in the first place
 

00:50:25.049 --> 00:50:26.930
responding to a poll in the first place
they probably want to help you I mean

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:26.940
they probably want to help you I mean
 

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:29.660

one reason why people like I mean yeah

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:29.670
one reason why people like I mean yeah
 

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.249
one reason why people like I mean yeah
so I think you want to take advantage of

00:50:31.249 --> 00:50:31.259
so I think you want to take advantage of
 

00:50:31.259 --> 00:50:33.289
so I think you want to take advantage of
that resource and that's tended to be

00:50:33.289 --> 00:50:33.299
that resource and that's tended to be
 

00:50:33.299 --> 00:50:34.099
that resource and that's tended to be
wasted

00:50:34.099 --> 00:50:34.109
wasted
 

00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:36.140
wasted
traditionally what people do is they do

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:36.150
traditionally what people do is they do
 

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:37.819
traditionally what people do is they do
a poll and they're like hey we trick

00:50:37.819 --> 00:50:37.829
a poll and they're like hey we trick
 

00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:39.440
a poll and they're like hey we trick
somebody into answering our survey now

00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:39.450
somebody into answering our survey now
 

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:40.940
somebody into answering our survey now
let's bombard them with a bunch of

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:40.950
let's bombard them with a bunch of
 

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:43.729
let's bombard them with a bunch of
questions but but I think especially in

00:50:43.729 --> 00:50:43.739
questions but but I think especially in
 

00:50:43.739 --> 00:50:46.309
questions but but I think especially in
a particular area like you know not like

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319
a particular area like you know not like
 

00:50:46.319 --> 00:50:47.809
a particular area like you know not like
an election poll but something you're

00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819
an election poll but something you're
 

00:50:47.819 --> 00:50:50.059
an election poll but something you're
personally working on you can get a lot

00:50:50.059 --> 00:50:50.069
personally working on you can get a lot
 

00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:52.670
personally working on you can get a lot
out of showing some respect for your

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680
out of showing some respect for your
 

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:57.529
out of showing some respect for your
survey participants thank you hi

00:50:57.529 --> 00:50:57.539
survey participants thank you hi
 

00:50:57.539 --> 00:51:00.769
survey participants thank you hi
professor so you you LinkedIn you're in

00:51:00.769 --> 00:51:00.779
professor so you you LinkedIn you're in
 

00:51:00.779 --> 00:51:04.999
professor so you you LinkedIn you're in
your blog a paper that questioned the

00:51:04.999 --> 00:51:05.009
your blog a paper that questioned the
 

00:51:05.009 --> 00:51:08.720
your blog a paper that questioned the
the validity of confidence intervals and

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:08.730
the validity of confidence intervals and
 

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:12.069
the validity of confidence intervals and
standard errors and in that paper they

00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079
standard errors and in that paper they
 

00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:14.299
standard errors and in that paper they
pointedly say that we shouldn't try to

00:51:14.299 --> 00:51:14.309
pointedly say that we shouldn't try to
 

00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:15.920
pointedly say that we shouldn't try to
interpret standard errors because that's

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:15.930
interpret standard errors because that's
 

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:18.410
interpret standard errors because that's
like to draw inference from statistics

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420
like to draw inference from statistics
 

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.509
like to draw inference from statistics
because that's essentially applying a

00:51:20.509 --> 00:51:20.519
because that's essentially applying a
 

00:51:20.519 --> 00:51:22.430
because that's essentially applying a
Bayesian framework so without without

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440
Bayesian framework so without without
 

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.319
Bayesian framework so without without
getting too technical when we read

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:24.329
getting too technical when we read
 

00:51:24.329 --> 00:51:27.739
getting too technical when we read
papers should we should we be assuming

00:51:27.739 --> 00:51:27.749
papers should we should we be assuming
 

00:51:27.749 --> 00:51:29.599
papers should we should we be assuming
that the standard errors are close

00:51:29.599 --> 00:51:29.609
that the standard errors are close
 

00:51:29.609 --> 00:51:31.660
that the standard errors are close
enough to what the the Bayesian

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:31.670
enough to what the the Bayesian
 

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.849
enough to what the the Bayesian
alternative would be or should we take

00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859
alternative would be or should we take
 

00:51:34.859 --> 00:51:37.130
alternative would be or should we take
these with more more more grains of salt

00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140
these with more more more grains of salt
 

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.440
these with more more more grains of salt
well I usually would interpret the

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:39.450
well I usually would interpret the
 

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:43.039
well I usually would interpret the
results as inferences based on certain

00:51:43.039 --> 00:51:43.049
results as inferences based on certain
 

00:51:43.049 --> 00:51:45.579
results as inferences based on certain
conventional assumptions so the

00:51:45.579 --> 00:51:45.589
conventional assumptions so the
 

00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:47.839
conventional assumptions so the
conventional assumption like if we take

00:51:47.839 --> 00:51:47.849
conventional assumption like if we take
 

00:51:47.849 --> 00:51:50.269
conventional assumption like if we take
the the Jamaica study the early

00:51:50.269 --> 00:51:50.279
the the Jamaica study the early
 

00:51:50.279 --> 00:51:52.370
the the Jamaica study the early
childhood intervention the conventional

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380
childhood intervention the conventional
 

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.720
childhood intervention the conventional
assumption is the effect could be

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:53.730
assumption is the effect could be
 

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:55.729
assumption is the effect could be
anywhere from like minus infinity to

00:51:55.729 --> 00:51:55.739
anywhere from like minus infinity to
 

00:51:55.739 --> 00:51:58.460
anywhere from like minus infinity to
plus infinity and in that if it could be

00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:58.470
plus infinity and in that if it could be
 

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:00.319
plus infinity and in that if it could be
anywhere in that range this is what you

00:52:00.319 --> 00:52:00.329
anywhere in that range this is what you
 

00:52:00.329 --> 00:52:02.420
anywhere in that range this is what you
can learn if you then say well actually

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:02.430
can learn if you then say well actually
 

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:04.099
can learn if you then say well actually
realistically I think the effect is

00:52:04.099 --> 00:52:04.109
realistically I think the effect is
 

00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:06.589
realistically I think the effect is
probably less than 10% then that will

00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599
probably less than 10% then that will
 

00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:08.989
probably less than 10% then that will
that will change the interpretation of

00:52:08.989 --> 00:52:08.999
that will change the interpretation of
 

00:52:08.999 --> 00:52:10.999
that will change the interpretation of
these statements so in some sense the

00:52:10.999 --> 00:52:11.009
these statements so in some sense the
 

00:52:11.009 --> 00:52:12.680
these statements so in some sense the
problem is not with the standard error

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:12.690
problem is not with the standard error
 

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:14.509
problem is not with the standard error
it's what people do with the standard

00:52:14.509 --> 00:52:14.519
it's what people do with the standard
 

00:52:14.519 --> 00:52:19.309
it's what people do with the standard
error okay thank you hi my name is

Charles I'm a PhD student in the
 

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:24.049
Charles I'm a PhD student in the
statistics department and I want to pick

00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059
statistics department and I want to pick
 

00:52:24.059 --> 00:52:25.819
statistics department and I want to pick
up on something you said at the

00:52:25.819 --> 00:52:25.829
up on something you said at the
 

00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:29.029
up on something you said at the
beginning of your talk which was my

00:52:29.029 --> 00:52:29.039
beginning of your talk which was my
 

00:52:29.039 --> 00:52:30.279
beginning of your talk which was my
specialty is

00:52:30.279 --> 00:52:30.289
specialty is
 

00:52:30.289 --> 00:52:32.679
specialty is
X and there's no such X and it seems

00:52:32.679 --> 00:52:32.689
X and there's no such X and it seems
 

00:52:32.689 --> 00:52:35.289
X and there's no such X and it seems
that in light of the statistical crisis

00:52:35.289 --> 00:52:35.299
that in light of the statistical crisis
 

00:52:35.299 --> 00:52:37.329
that in light of the statistical crisis
the reaction has been what scientists

00:52:37.329 --> 00:52:37.339
the reaction has been what scientists
 

00:52:37.339 --> 00:52:41.229
the reaction has been what scientists
need to learn more statistics the method

00:52:41.229 --> 00:52:41.239
need to learn more statistics the method
 

00:52:41.239 --> 00:52:43.390
need to learn more statistics the method
and I'm wondering well how much does it

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400
and I'm wondering well how much does it
 

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.400
and I'm wondering well how much does it
go the other way how much that decisions

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:45.410
go the other way how much that decisions
 

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:49.209
go the other way how much that decisions
need to learn more science and has there

00:52:49.209 --> 00:52:49.219
need to learn more science and has there
 

00:52:49.219 --> 00:52:52.359
need to learn more science and has there
have been initiatives in that direction

00:52:52.359 --> 00:52:52.369
have been initiatives in that direction
 

00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:55.239
have been initiatives in that direction
well I typically feel that every

00:52:55.239 --> 00:52:55.249
well I typically feel that every
 

00:52:55.249 --> 00:52:57.640
well I typically feel that every
statistician is an expert in at most one

00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:57.650
statistician is an expert in at most one
 

00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:00.640
statistician is an expert in at most one
subject so I really am an expert on

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:00.650
subject so I really am an expert on
 

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:02.439
subject so I really am an expert on
American politics I know something about

00:53:02.439 --> 00:53:02.449
American politics I know something about
 

00:53:02.449 --> 00:53:04.059
American politics I know something about
that but like everything else like

00:53:04.059 --> 00:53:04.069
that but like everything else like
 

00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:05.949
that but like everything else like
toxicology or the other things I'm

00:53:05.949 --> 00:53:05.959
toxicology or the other things I'm
 

00:53:05.959 --> 00:53:08.289
toxicology or the other things I'm
working on I'm kind of winging it but

00:53:08.289 --> 00:53:08.299
working on I'm kind of winging it but
 

00:53:08.299 --> 00:53:09.400
working on I'm kind of winging it but
you know there aren't that many

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:09.410
you know there aren't that many
 

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:11.079
you know there aren't that many
statisticians there's a lot more of

00:53:11.079 --> 00:53:11.089
statisticians there's a lot more of
 

00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:13.630
statisticians there's a lot more of
other people so even if I mean if every

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:13.640
other people so even if I mean if every
 

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.489
other people so even if I mean if every
statistician I think it is good for

00:53:15.489 --> 00:53:15.499
statistician I think it is good for
 

00:53:15.499 --> 00:53:17.319
statistician I think it is good for
every statistician to be an expert in

00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:17.329
every statistician to be an expert in
 

00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:20.829
every statistician to be an expert in
some area but that's somehow kind of not

00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839
some area but that's somehow kind of not
 

00:53:20.839 --> 00:53:23.019
some area but that's somehow kind of not
enough but again like I think the

00:53:23.019 --> 00:53:23.029
enough but again like I think the
 

00:53:23.029 --> 00:53:26.469
enough but again like I think the
original sin in statistics was this idea

00:53:26.469 --> 00:53:26.479
original sin in statistics was this idea
 

00:53:26.479 --> 00:53:29.620
original sin in statistics was this idea
that we can get strong conclusions from

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:29.630
that we can get strong conclusions from
 

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.709
that we can get strong conclusions from
any data and that's that and we we have

00:53:32.709 --> 00:53:32.719
any data and that's that and we we have
 

00:53:32.719 --> 00:53:35.140
any data and that's that and we we have
to avoid that so we have to I mean at

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:35.150
to avoid that so we have to I mean at
 

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:36.849
to avoid that so we have to I mean at
statisticians I think we have to stop

00:53:36.849 --> 00:53:36.859
statisticians I think we have to stop
 

00:53:36.859 --> 00:53:39.819
statisticians I think we have to stop
doing that to people before worrying

00:53:39.819 --> 00:53:39.829
doing that to people before worrying
 

00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:40.989
doing that to people before worrying
about what to do next

00:53:40.989 --> 00:53:40.999
about what to do next
 

00:53:40.999 --> 00:53:44.380
about what to do next
thank you I very much thank you for this

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:44.390
thank you I very much thank you for this
 

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:46.409
thank you I very much thank you for this
last quote because I think it's very

00:53:46.409 --> 00:53:46.419
last quote because I think it's very
 

00:53:46.419 --> 00:53:51.189
last quote because I think it's very
meditative somehow so I wonder why do we

00:53:51.189 --> 00:53:51.199
meditative somehow so I wonder why do we
 

00:53:51.199 --> 00:53:52.779
meditative somehow so I wonder why do we
need to reduce the variation but

00:53:52.779 --> 00:53:52.789
need to reduce the variation but
 

00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:54.609
need to reduce the variation but
especially in statistics you want to

00:53:54.609 --> 00:53:54.619
especially in statistics you want to
 

00:53:54.619 --> 00:53:56.439
especially in statistics you want to
have the variation data for you to

00:53:56.439 --> 00:53:56.449
have the variation data for you to
 

00:53:56.449 --> 00:53:59.529
have the variation data for you to
reveal relations to to show the reads

00:53:59.529 --> 00:53:59.539
reveal relations to to show the reads
 

00:53:59.539 --> 00:54:01.779
reveal relations to to show the reads
all the relations but then why don't you

00:54:01.779 --> 00:54:01.789
all the relations but then why don't you
 

00:54:01.789 --> 00:54:04.390
all the relations but then why don't you
don't wander with the variations I mean

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400
don't wander with the variations I mean
 

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.370
don't wander with the variations I mean
and use that I think something you can

00:54:06.370 --> 00:54:06.380
and use that I think something you can
 

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.759
and use that I think something you can
apply that for your state of mind is

00:54:09.759 --> 00:54:09.769
apply that for your state of mind is
 

00:54:09.769 --> 00:54:13.329
apply that for your state of mind is
that you know you have to sort of

00:54:13.329 --> 00:54:13.339
that you know you have to sort of
 

00:54:13.339 --> 00:54:15.039
that you know you have to sort of
separate yourself from the data

00:54:15.039 --> 00:54:15.049
separate yourself from the data
 

00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:17.319
separate yourself from the data
okay so data have variation there's

00:54:17.319 --> 00:54:17.329
okay so data have variation there's
 

00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:19.359
okay so data have variation there's
variation in the data we do this study

00:54:19.359 --> 00:54:19.369
variation in the data we do this study
 

00:54:19.369 --> 00:54:21.309
variation in the data we do this study
and the stents and we measure how long

00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319
and the stents and we measure how long
 

00:54:21.319 --> 00:54:23.559
and the stents and we measure how long
people can exercise and it's a noisy

00:54:23.559 --> 00:54:23.569
people can exercise and it's a noisy
 

00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:26.589
people can exercise and it's a noisy
measure but I think that probably what

00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599
measure but I think that probably what
 

00:54:26.599 --> 00:54:28.239
measure but I think that probably what
you really want to be doing is getting

00:54:28.239 --> 00:54:28.249
you really want to be doing is getting
 

00:54:28.249 --> 00:54:30.969
you really want to be doing is getting
better measurements doing comparisons

00:54:30.969 --> 00:54:30.979
better measurements doing comparisons
 

00:54:30.979 --> 00:54:33.069
better measurements doing comparisons
within people like getting multiple

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:33.079
within people like getting multiple
 

00:54:33.079 --> 00:54:34.929
within people like getting multiple
measurements again the X Box survey

00:54:34.929 --> 00:54:34.939
measurements again the X Box survey
 

00:54:34.939 --> 00:54:37.599
measurements again the X Box survey
people responded multiple times so we

00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:37.609
people responded multiple times so we
 

00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:39.789
people responded multiple times so we
can have information on how on people

00:54:39.789 --> 00:54:39.799
can have information on how on people
 

00:54:39.799 --> 00:54:41.059
can have information on how on people
changing their opinion

00:54:41.059 --> 00:54:41.069
changing their opinion
 

00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:43.699
changing their opinion
and I think a lot of like we're often

00:54:43.699 --> 00:54:43.709
and I think a lot of like we're often
 

00:54:43.709 --> 00:54:45.890
and I think a lot of like we're often
researchers are trapped in the data and

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900
researchers are trapped in the data and
 

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.319
researchers are trapped in the data and
one thing this is remember I told you

00:54:48.319 --> 00:54:48.329
one thing this is remember I told you
 

00:54:48.329 --> 00:54:49.819
one thing this is remember I told you
about this feedback loop where people

00:54:49.819 --> 00:54:49.829
about this feedback loop where people
 

00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:51.529
about this feedback loop where people
overestimate the effect size that gives

00:54:51.529 --> 00:54:51.539
overestimate the effect size that gives
 

00:54:51.539 --> 00:54:53.120
overestimate the effect size that gives
them over confidence than they do the

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:53.130
them over confidence than they do the
 

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.339
them over confidence than they do the
next study well another problem of that

00:54:55.339 --> 00:54:55.349
next study well another problem of that
 

00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:58.339
next study well another problem of that
is it's kind of when it's too easy to

00:54:58.339 --> 00:54:58.349
is it's kind of when it's too easy to
 

00:54:58.349 --> 00:55:01.099
is it's kind of when it's too easy to
like win like that there's not much of a

00:55:01.099 --> 00:55:01.109
like win like that there's not much of a
 

00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:03.679
like win like that there's not much of a
motivation to work hard and get good

00:55:03.679 --> 00:55:03.689
motivation to work hard and get good
 

00:55:03.689 --> 00:55:06.019
motivation to work hard and get good
data and like so you know anything

00:55:06.019 --> 00:55:06.029
data and like so you know anything
 

00:55:06.029 --> 00:55:07.400
data and like so you know anything
you're doing a study one what's the

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:07.410
you're doing a study one what's the
 

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.989
you're doing a study one what's the
ultimate effect whether people live or

00:55:08.989 --> 00:55:08.999
ultimate effect whether people live or
 

00:55:08.999 --> 00:55:09.409
ultimate effect whether people live or
die

00:55:09.409 --> 00:55:09.419
die
 

00:55:09.419 --> 00:55:11.029
die
okay well that's great but a lot of

00:55:11.029 --> 00:55:11.039
okay well that's great but a lot of
 

00:55:11.039 --> 00:55:12.769
okay well that's great but a lot of
things cause people to live or die so

00:55:12.769 --> 00:55:12.779
things cause people to live or die so
 

00:55:12.779 --> 00:55:14.359
things cause people to live or die so
your data are gonna be very noisy you

00:55:14.359 --> 00:55:14.369
your data are gonna be very noisy you
 

00:55:14.369 --> 00:55:15.769
your data are gonna be very noisy you
probably want to get some intermediate

00:55:15.769 --> 00:55:15.779
probably want to get some intermediate
 

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:21.349
probably want to get some intermediate
measurements and I think there's kind of

00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359
measurements and I think there's kind of
 

00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:22.819
measurements and I think there's kind of
a negative message and a positive

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:22.829
a negative message and a positive
 

00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:24.890
a negative message and a positive
message I have and the negative message

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900
message I have and the negative message
 

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:28.459
message I have and the negative message
is that it's - it can be sort of too

00:55:28.459 --> 00:55:28.469
is that it's - it can be sort of too
 

00:55:28.469 --> 00:55:30.979
is that it's - it can be sort of too
easy to fool yourself and even worse to

00:55:30.979 --> 00:55:30.989
easy to fool yourself and even worse to
 

00:55:30.989 --> 00:55:34.249
easy to fool yourself and even worse to
fool other people with noisy data so you

00:55:34.249 --> 00:55:34.259
fool other people with noisy data so you
 

00:55:34.259 --> 00:55:37.009
fool other people with noisy data so you
the idea of the negative message is no

00:55:37.009 --> 00:55:37.019
the idea of the negative message is no
 

00:55:37.019 --> 00:55:38.299
the idea of the negative message is no
I'd either I don't want to do that

00:55:38.299 --> 00:55:38.309
I'd either I don't want to do that
 

00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:41.359
I'd either I don't want to do that
because I don't want to do I don't want

00:55:41.359 --> 00:55:41.369
because I don't want to do I don't want
 

00:55:41.369 --> 00:55:43.130
because I don't want to do I don't want
to do bad science I want you know I want

00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140
to do bad science I want you know I want
 

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.019
to do bad science I want you know I want
to discover real things not fake things

00:55:45.019 --> 00:55:45.029
to discover real things not fake things
 

00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:47.120
to discover real things not fake things
or like well I don't want to publish

00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:47.130
or like well I don't want to publish
 

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.229
or like well I don't want to publish
stuff like that I don't want to do stuff

00:55:48.229 --> 00:55:48.239
stuff like that I don't want to do stuff
 

00:55:48.239 --> 00:55:49.399
stuff like that I don't want to do stuff
like that because in the future it's

00:55:49.399 --> 00:55:49.409
like that because in the future it's
 

00:55:49.409 --> 00:55:51.049
like that because in the future it's
gonna get rejected by a journal because

00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059
gonna get rejected by a journal because
 

00:55:51.059 --> 00:55:52.309
gonna get rejected by a journal because
it's not pre registered you know

00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319
it's not pre registered you know
 

00:55:52.319 --> 00:55:54.380
it's not pre registered you know
whatever it is then there's a motivation

00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:54.390
whatever it is then there's a motivation
 

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:56.209
whatever it is then there's a motivation
to stop doing that but then how do you

00:55:56.209 --> 00:55:56.219
to stop doing that but then how do you
 

00:55:56.219 --> 00:55:58.699
to stop doing that but then how do you
do things right then you have that these

00:55:58.699 --> 00:55:58.709
do things right then you have that these
 

00:55:58.709 --> 00:56:01.370
do things right then you have that these
examples where we fit big models to the

00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380
examples where we fit big models to the
 

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.289
examples where we fit big models to the
big data but you shouldn't think of the

00:56:03.289 --> 00:56:03.299
big data but you shouldn't think of the
 

00:56:03.299 --> 00:56:04.640
big data but you shouldn't think of the
data I was just sitting there being

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:04.650
data I was just sitting there being
 

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:08.329
data I was just sitting there being
noisy you it's your job to get non noisy

00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339
noisy you it's your job to get non noisy
 

00:56:08.339 --> 00:56:11.089
noisy you it's your job to get non noisy
data or to measure what you want to

00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099
data or to measure what you want to
 

00:56:11.099 --> 00:56:16.370
data or to measure what you want to
measure or to try to do that so question

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:16.380
measure or to try to do that so question
 

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:21.499
measure or to try to do that so question
do you meditate what you meditate oh no

00:56:21.499 --> 00:56:21.509
do you meditate what you meditate oh no
 

00:56:21.509 --> 00:56:22.939
do you meditate what you meditate oh no
this is what you know this is the

00:56:22.939 --> 00:56:22.949
this is what you know this is the
 

00:56:22.949 --> 00:56:24.979
this is what you know this is the
serenity prayer associated with

00:56:24.979 --> 00:56:24.989
serenity prayer associated with
 

00:56:24.989 --> 00:56:26.839
serenity prayer associated with
Alcoholics Anonymous and I just never

00:56:26.839 --> 00:56:26.849
Alcoholics Anonymous and I just never
 

00:56:26.849 --> 00:56:30.019
Alcoholics Anonymous and I just never
altered it slightly because I just it

00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:30.029
altered it slightly because I just it
 

00:56:30.029 --> 00:56:32.719
altered it slightly because I just it
struck me that this idea that the

00:56:32.719 --> 00:56:32.729
struck me that this idea that the
 

00:56:32.729 --> 00:56:36.109
struck me that this idea that the
variation I mean we do I mean I think

00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119
variation I mean we do I mean I think
 

00:56:36.119 --> 00:56:38.419
variation I mean we do I mean I think
that I just seemed like it was perfect

00:56:38.419 --> 00:56:38.429
that I just seemed like it was perfect
 

00:56:38.429 --> 00:56:40.999
that I just seemed like it was perfect
so that's why I did that slight

00:56:40.999 --> 00:56:41.009
so that's why I did that slight
 

00:56:41.009 --> 00:56:44.940
so that's why I did that slight
alteration and who you are now my model

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:44.950
alteration and who you are now my model
 

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.130
alteration and who you are now my model
or someone who can keep his cool in the

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:47.140
or someone who can keep his cool in the
 

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:50.640
or someone who can keep his cool in the
face of recalcitrant technology thank

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:50.650
face of recalcitrant technology thank
 

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:52.530
face of recalcitrant technology thank
you for a brilliant lecture thank you

00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:52.540
you for a brilliant lecture thank you
 

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:53.790
you for a brilliant lecture thank you
for an entertaining measure and thank

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:53.800
for an entertaining measure and thank
 

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.950
for an entertaining measure and thank
you for dealing with the PowerPoint that

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:55.960
you for dealing with the PowerPoint that
 

00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:58.440
you for dealing with the PowerPoint that
didn't can not just before you say

00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:58.450
didn't can not just before you say
 

00:56:58.450 --> 00:56:59.910
didn't can not just before you say
goodbye when they tell you it's to tell

00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920
goodbye when they tell you it's to tell
 

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.070
goodbye when they tell you it's to tell
story because probably the best talk I

00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:02.080
story because probably the best talk I
 

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.370
story because probably the best talk I
ever gave was when speaking at MIT and I

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:05.380
ever gave was when speaking at MIT and I
 

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.930
ever gave was when speaking at MIT and I
was giving a talk on statistical

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:06.940
was giving a talk on statistical
 

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:09.960
was giving a talk on statistical
graphics and the power went out and was

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:09.970
graphics and the power went out and was
 

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.600
graphics and the power went out and was
in graphics and so we were just talking

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:12.610
in graphics and so we were just talking
 

00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:13.860
in graphics and so we were just talking
we had a whole conversation about

00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:13.870
we had a whole conversation about
 

00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:16.260
we had a whole conversation about
graphics without using any graphs and it

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:16.270
graphics without using any graphs and it
 

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:17.910
graphics without using any graphs and it
was great you know so yeah you don't

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920
was great you know so yeah you don't
 

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:19.530
was great you know so yeah you don't
need you don't need the technology you

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:19.540
need you don't need the technology you
 

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.690
need you don't need the technology you
can't rely on it thank you very much

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:21.700
can't rely on it thank you very much
 

00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:22.850
can't rely on it thank you very much
you're all invited to a reception

00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:22.860
you're all invited to a reception
 

00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:31.949
