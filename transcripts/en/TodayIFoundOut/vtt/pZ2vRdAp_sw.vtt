00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.519
Dating back to the dawn of Modern English,
the expression “beside myself” has been

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.490
used to denote someone not in his right mind.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.730
After William conquered England in 1066, French
became the language of scholars, clergy and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.109
nobility in Britain and remained so even throughout
much of the grinding 100 Years War between

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.699
England and France (1337-1450s).

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.440
However, by the end of that conflict, the
English were pretty much done with anything

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440
French.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.059
During the Middle English period (around 1100-1500),
books were rare, having to be hand-copied,

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.949
and were mostly written in French or Latin.

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.289
As the English became more embittered with
the French, a desire arose among the British

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.660
to establish the language of the common people,
English, as that of the entire country.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.820
One effort to accomplish this was to print
books in English, not only for the students

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.269
and dons at its premier universities Oxford
and Cambridge, but for the general populace

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.269
as well.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:12.119
In 1476, William Caxton (1422-1492), who learned
the art of printing in Cologne, France, while

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.079
translating The Recuyell of the Histories
of Troye from French to English, established

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.240
the first English printing press at Westminster.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.979
Cornering the burgeoning book market, he immediately
began to print original English works (i.e.,

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.110
The Canterbury Tales), as well as translations
(often from French editions).

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.480
Notably, in 1490, he translated the Aeneid
from a French version, Eneydos.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.650
In the work, dedicated to King Henry VII’s
son, Arthur, Caxton translates the French

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.430
phrase, “hors de soi” (meaning “outside
herself”) to “mad &amp; beside herself”

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.310
(with regard to Dido’s mental state when
she learned of Aeneas’ departure), marking

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.150
the first time the expression is used in print.[1]

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.180
Note that the substitute of “beside” for
“outside” was perfectly appropriate since,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.259
at that time (although today obsolete), “outside”
was one of the well-used meanings of “beside,”

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.789
having first been recorded in the English
Wycliffte Sermons in the 1370s.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.840
In any event, between the Eneydos, the Canterbury
Tales and Le Morte d’Arthur, as well as

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.070
100 or so other books, Caxton’s efforts
at bringing English to England helped standardize

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:30.720
its spelling and ushered in the Modern English
era (1500 – present).
