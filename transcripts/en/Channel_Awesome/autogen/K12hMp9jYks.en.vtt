could you do sort of say well if I was
in<00:12:39.160><c> that</c><00:12:39.220><c> situation</c><00:12:39.490><c> like</c><00:12:39.940><c> what</c><00:12:40.090><c> what</c><00:12:41.080><c> would</c><00:12:41.290><c> I</c>

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:45.670 align:start position:0%
I actually get bullet like when Bolin
 

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
I actually get bullet like when Bolin
was<00:12:45.880><c> handing</c><00:12:46.300><c> the</c><00:12:46.390><c> food</c><00:12:46.570><c> over</c><00:12:46.870><c> to</c><00:12:46.990><c> somebody</c>

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
was handing the food over to somebody
feeding<00:12:48.250><c> them</c><00:12:48.400><c> and</c><00:12:48.880><c> then</c><00:12:49.090><c> um</c><00:12:49.750><c> what's</c><00:12:50.680><c> her</c><00:12:50.770><c> face</c>

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:50.950 align:start position:0%
feeding them and then um what's her face
 

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
feeding them and then um what's her face
is<00:12:51.220><c> just</c><00:12:51.250><c> like</c><00:12:51.550><c> looking</c><00:12:51.880><c> at</c><00:12:52.030><c> him</c><00:12:52.240><c> just</c><00:12:52.510><c> like</c>

is just like looking at him just like
 

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.330 align:start position:0%
is just like looking at him just like
yes<00:12:52.900><c> or</c><00:12:53.020><c> turning</c><00:12:53.380><c> away</c><00:12:53.470><c> it's</c><00:12:53.860><c> yeah</c><00:12:54.040><c> and</c><00:12:54.280><c> I</c>

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:54.340 align:start position:0%
yes or turning away it's yeah and I

yes or turning away it's yeah and I
might<00:12:54.520><c> get</c><00:12:54.730><c> I</c><00:12:54.790><c> was</c><00:12:54.970><c> like</c><00:12:55.210><c> if</c><00:12:55.360><c> I</c><00:12:55.480><c> were</c><00:12:55.540><c> Bolin</c><00:12:55.990><c> I'd</c>

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:56.110 align:start position:0%
might get I was like if I were Bolin I'd
 

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
might get I was like if I were Bolin I'd
be<00:12:56.200><c> like</c><00:12:56.380><c> I'm</c><00:12:56.710><c> helping</c><00:12:57.310><c> people</c><00:12:57.340><c> what's</c><00:12:58.030><c> your</c>

00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:58.270 align:start position:0%
be like I'm helping people what's your
 

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
be like I'm helping people what's your
problem<00:12:58.750><c> but</c><00:12:59.260><c> you</c><00:12:59.410><c> know</c><00:12:59.590><c> you</c><00:12:59.650><c> get</c><00:12:59.920><c> her</c><00:13:00.190><c> side</c>

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:00.430 align:start position:0%
problem but you know you get her side
 

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
problem but you know you get her side
yeah

00:13:01.319 --> 00:13:01.329 align:start position:0%
yeah
 

00:13:01.329 --> 00:13:04.470 align:start position:0%
yeah
so<00:13:01.779><c> it</c><00:13:02.069><c> very</c><00:13:03.069><c> identifiable</c><00:13:03.579><c> and</c><00:13:04.029><c> I</c><00:13:04.089><c> think</c><00:13:04.329><c> that</c>

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
so it very identifiable and I think that
 

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
so it very identifiable and I think that
is<00:13:04.629><c> sort</c><00:13:04.809><c> of</c><00:13:04.989><c> strangely</c><00:13:05.860><c> enough</c><00:13:06.040><c> the</c><00:13:06.279><c> key</c><00:13:06.759><c> to</c>

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:07.029 align:start position:0%
is sort of strangely enough the key to
 

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
is sort of strangely enough the key to
good<00:13:07.269><c> I</c><00:13:07.720><c> don't</c><00:13:08.619><c> want</c><00:13:08.739><c> to</c><00:13:08.799><c> say</c><00:13:08.860><c> political</c><00:13:09.309><c> drama</c>

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:09.610 align:start position:0%
good I don't want to say political drama
 

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.889 align:start position:0%
good I don't want to say political drama
because<00:13:09.879><c> I</c><00:13:09.999><c> don't</c><00:13:10.209><c> want</c><00:13:10.360><c> to</c><00:13:10.420><c> say</c><00:13:10.569><c> this</c><00:13:10.689><c> is</c><00:13:10.839><c> a</c>

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:10.899 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to say this is a
 

00:13:10.899 --> 00:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to say this is a

00:13:12.179 --> 00:13:12.189 align:start position:0%
record as a political drought that is
 

00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:13.470 align:start position:0%
record as a political drought that is

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
kind of Turing into that is that you
 

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.539 align:start position:0%
kind of Turing into that is that you

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:15.549 align:start position:0%
understand both sides whichever one do
 

00:13:15.549 --> 00:13:17.789 align:start position:0%
understand both sides whichever one do
you<00:13:15.610><c> agree</c><00:13:15.790><c> with</c><00:13:16.089><c> you</c><00:13:16.239><c> get</c><00:13:16.689><c> sort</c><00:13:17.499><c> of</c><00:13:17.619><c> where</c>

00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:17.799 align:start position:0%
you agree with you get sort of where
 

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:19.530 align:start position:0%
you agree with you get sort of where
each<00:13:17.920><c> one</c><00:13:18.160><c> is</c><00:13:18.309><c> coming</c><00:13:18.670><c> and</c><00:13:18.819><c> this</c><00:13:18.939><c> feels</c><00:13:19.360><c> like</c>

each one is coming and this feels like
 

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.729 align:start position:0%
each one is coming and this feels like

00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
way which is kind of cool actually yeah
 

00:18:39.539 --> 00:18:41.419 align:start position:0%
way which is kind of cool actually yeah
but<00:18:39.809><c> but</c><00:18:39.960><c> this</c><00:18:40.080><c> one</c><00:18:40.289><c> like</c><00:18:40.440><c> I</c><00:18:40.530><c> say</c><00:18:40.679><c> I</c><00:18:40.710><c> can't</c><00:18:40.950><c> I</c><00:18:41.100><c> I</c>

00:18:41.419 --> 00:18:41.429 align:start position:0%
but but this one like I say I can't I I
 

00:18:41.429 --> 00:18:44.450 align:start position:0%
but but this one like I say I can't I I
think<00:18:42.140><c> it</c><00:18:43.140><c> may</c><00:18:43.350><c> be</c><00:18:43.380><c> more</c><00:18:43.530><c> for</c><00:18:43.890><c> adults</c><00:18:44.100><c> I</c><00:18:44.309><c> don't</c>

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
think it may be more for adults I don't
 

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
think it may be more for adults I don't
know<00:18:44.549><c> me</c><00:18:44.669><c> not</c><00:18:44.880><c> for</c><00:18:45.059><c> kids</c><00:18:45.240><c> but</c><00:18:45.419><c> I</c><00:18:45.630><c> think</c><00:18:46.049><c> uh</c><00:18:46.289><c> we</c>

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.010 align:start position:0%
know me not for kids but I think uh we
 

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:48.649 align:start position:0%
know me not for kids but I think uh we
can<00:18:47.130><c> relate</c><00:18:47.340><c> to</c><00:18:47.490><c> it</c><00:18:47.610><c> more</c><00:18:47.640><c> because</c><00:18:48.150><c> I</c><00:18:48.179><c> mean</c><00:18:48.539><c> we</c>

00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
can relate to it more because I mean we
 

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:50.510 align:start position:0%
can relate to it more because I mean we
