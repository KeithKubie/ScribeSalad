00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.150
STEVE BAZYL: Hi, everyone.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.970
And thanks for tuning in for
this week's "Google Developers

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.610
Live" for Google Drive.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.910
Today we are joined by Mike
Borozdin from DocuSign, and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.650
we're going to talk
about their app.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.250
You'll get a quick demo,
talk about some of

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.580
the integration points.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.060
There have been some really cool
stuff with Google Drive

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.280
and Apps Script, so a lot
of stuff to show.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.545
We don't have any product
announcements this week, but

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:50.190
we are going to spend a lot of
time learning the ins and outs

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.160
of DocuSign, their APIs, and
talk about all the cool stuff

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.640
you can do.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.770
So Mike, why don't you tell
people a little bit about

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.320
DocuSign, what you do, and
then give a quick demo.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.120
MIKE BOROZDIN: Sure, sure.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.380
Thank you.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.540
So DocuSign is an electronic
signature service.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.460
It basically allows people to
sign documents and contracts

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.380
without having to print them
out or use fax machines.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.790
DocuSign's been around,
actually, for quite some time.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.050
It's closing in on 10 years.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.030
STEVE BAZYL: How long have
you been with DocuSign?

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.630
MIKE BOROZDIN: Actually,
a long time as well.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.520
It's going to be seven
years next month.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.740
So it's an eternity
in tech world.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.300
But it's been great.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.590
It's been great.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.400
The company has been doubling
staff and the revenue, like,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.940
every 12 to 18 months.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.640
So always new challenges and
always exciting, and it's been

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.430
fantastic to see the
market adoptions.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.770
STEVE BAZYL: And we've, I think,
been working together

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.900
for quite a while, actually.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.420
I think the first integrations
you've had with Google Apps go

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.840
back probably two
or three years.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.090
And they keep getting
better and better.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.990
So why don't you give people
a quick look at some of the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.320
things that you've been doing?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.140
MIKE BOROZDIN: Sure.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.720
So oftentimes, actually, even
though we have, like, 40

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.710
million users, I still see a lot
of people that have never

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.370
seen electronic signature.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.710
So when I have a chance to
present our products, I always

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.620
start with signing.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.940
A lot of people now when I talk
to them say, like, oh

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.550
yeah, sure.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.950
I have used DocuSign with my
real estate transaction or

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.210
something along those lines.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.270
But if you've never signed a
DocuSign document, I'm going

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.490
to show you this
on the screen.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.750
You might get an email
invitation saying, like, hey,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.170
there's some documents for
you to review and sign.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.840
And there's a yellow button,
and you click it.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.120
And it basically tells you Mr.
So and So, Ms. So and So

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.470
requested a signature.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.850
You click that, and
you see here a

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.010
rendering of a document.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.090
And if you've never signed
anything with DocuSign, what

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.330
you go through first
is adopting

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.800
your electronic signature.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.915
And you can just select
a pre-defined one.

00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:12.570
Or potentially you
can draw one.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.080
But I'm not so good
at drawing it.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.500
STEVE BAZYL: It's probably a
lot easier on a tablet or a

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.180
phone, or something like that.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.420
MIKE BOROZDIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.220
There, a lot of people
really like it.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.900
So once you actually adopt
your signature, from that

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.710
point on what you can
do is you can

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.210
apply it on a document.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.720
So here you see I only
had one place to

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.500
sign, so I signed that.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.310
And then I confirmed that
that was actually

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.930
my final step there.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.880
And I'm done.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.760
So on a very basic level, the
people that receive DocuSign

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.790
documents see that flow.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.790
And as you can see, in 30
seconds or less they're able

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.240
to sign a document and return
it back to the sender.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.000
But when it comes to the Google
integrations, which

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.880
we've been working and iterating
on and trying to

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.530
improve all the time and
continuously try to improve,

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.550
just this morning you gave me
some more pointers, I think

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.550
the most popular integration we
have is with Google Drive.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.390
So this is where if you have a
document in Drive that you're

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.120
looking to send out to somebody
for a signature, you

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.520
can very quickly open
it with DocuSign.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.460
And when you do that, DocuSign
integration will go in and

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.040
grab the document.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.810
And then you can put the sticky
tabs in the places

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.360
where you want the signers
to sign or initial.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.210
And we support all of the form
fields and regular expressions

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.370
and all of those conditional
validation stuff.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.900
And then you go and basically
send it out and

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.950
then request a signature.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.600
So once they sign it, it comes
right back to Drive,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.835
where it came from.

00:06:05.835 --> 00:06:09.610
STEVE BAZYL: So if you have a
library of prepared contracts

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.340
or templates for different
topics, then you just quickly

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.260
generate a new version design.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.580
And do you actually save the
templates as well, where the

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.560
sticky tabs are?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.570
MIKE BOROZDIN: Yeah.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.030
There's a way for you to save
the templates or create new

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.490
ones, so for people, they
can save their workflow

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.020
themselves.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.620
And oftentimes if it's a company
and if they have an

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.310
administrator, that
administrator can create

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.330
templates that just minimize the
errors and just streamline

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.540
the workflow for people.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.000
So all of that stuff
is very possible.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.330
Actions are important.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.680
STEVE BAZYL: At Google I/O, you
showed off what I thought

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.670
was actually a really cool
demonstration of embedding the

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.470
document signature
functionality

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.210
right in Google Docs.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.060
Can you talk a little bit about
that, and maybe show

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.740
what that's looking like?

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.300
I know it's not quite ready for
broad use yet, but I think

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.930
it's a good indicator of kind
of what the potentials are

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.710
going forward.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:09.160
MIKE BOROZDIN: Yeah.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.270
That's great.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.230
So first of all, we
love our Google

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.480
partnership, first of all.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.630
It's been great in many
different ways.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.480
So any time there's something
on the horizon from Google,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.450
another integration point or
another API, we always look

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.820
for ways to integrate
it into our product.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.440
So Google Docs is one of
the most requested

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.890
features from our users.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.560
Actually, Google Drive is our
number one document source.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.540
So when people select
cloud-based document sources,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.810
Google Drive is the top one.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.760
So Google Docs, people
oftentimes edit a document,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.490
they want to maybe add something
here or they want to

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:00.970
edit or delete a clause
or whatnot.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:07.420
And again, who likes to go
through many, many steps to

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.350
just do a simple thing?

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.960
People prefer that everything
is integrated.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.660
And here you can see there's
a DocuSign menu.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.940
And when you click that
menu we've got a

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.050
side panel open up.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.030
So this is all written
in Apps Script.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.190
And the panel, the UI's popped
up, this is all integrated

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.680
with Google Docs.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.990
It obviously has all
of the context.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.419
This is the document you're
working on, who you are, how

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.130
to pair you up with the right
DocuSign account.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.760
And in this express mode right
here, what you can do is you

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.750
can say, I'm going to send
this to somebody,

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:51.190
for example, Mike.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.610
You fill this out and then
you send it out.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.420
So it's all about just making
it super easy for people.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.810
STEVE BAZYL: So you quickly
update the contract that you

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.440
want to send, and send that
out for a signature, and

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.880
shorten that process a lot.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.890
You also have some
mobile apps.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.645
The mobile app is really nice.

00:09:09.645 --> 00:09:09.960
MIKE BOROZDIN: Thank you.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.470
STEVE BAZYL: Earlier, we were
looking at this on a Nexus 7.

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.570
And it was a beautiful app, and
a really nice experience.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.160
And you also have some other
integrations with Gmail as

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.420
well, right?

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.520
In terms of being able to sign
attachments and so on.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.390
MIKE BOROZDIN: Right,
right, right.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.410
Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:31.230
So Google Apps is another
popular integration of ours.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:37.120
So folks that use Google
Enterprise applications like

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.900
Docs and Calendar and Gmail, can
go to the marketplace and

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.900
install Docu--

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.550
don't know about DocuSign yet,
but I can help them.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.830
Right?

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.660
They send this.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.200
And they said, hey, can you
sign this doc, please?

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.440
Well, again, there's an
easy button here.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.180
I can go in and what happens in
the background is actually

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:06.910
we get the context
out of the email.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.760
And we try to be smart
all the time.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.510
We'll try and say, like, OK.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.830
You've got your email addresses
there already,

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.540
you've got your documents
already, so let's do the best

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.250
we can to bring all of that
information together.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.880
And it's probably the people
that you want to sign

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.370
documents with, so we bring
it into DocuSign.

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:34.380
And then you can lay out the
workflow here and either sign

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:36.570
yourself or request a signature
from somebody.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.480
STEVE BAZYL: Very cool.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.220
And actually, we were talking
earlier, and this is maybe one

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.940
of the areas where--

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.100
actually, could you
go back a screen?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.820
Because there are a couple
things on here that we were

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.070
talking about earlier that I
think would be kind of useful

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.680
for developers to
take a look at.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.420
So you also have the ability to
obviously pick from online

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.630
Cloud Storage, or choose an
online document, [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:02.240
files.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:02.780
MIKE BOROZDIN: Yeah.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:03.770
Let's try that again.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.570
I think now that I've requested
it once, I probably

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.540
don't need to go through
that again.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.556
But yeah, there was that
authorization screen.

00:11:12.556 --> 00:11:12.922
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:16.210
And so one of the things that
we covered here a few weeks

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.850
ago on our "GDLs" was, we've
actually covered this topic a

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.380
few times, the difficulty of
implementing file pickers,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.320
particularly for
a large corpus.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.800
If you're hitting a very large
enterprise with hundreds of

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.900
thousands of millions of
documents, it can actually get

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:38.500
very difficult and expensive to
build these types of UIs.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.730
And also, just recently did
some research to find that

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.870
users actually don't like
when applications

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.210
access their full drive.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.780
And actually, it's a pretty
significant drop off.

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.955
It's about 10% additional
drop off in acceptance.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:58.840
Yeah, so there's a whole bunch
of different options in terms

00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.670
of file pickers.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:04.110
And I know Dropbox as well
has Filepicker widgets.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.970
There's some third parties
in terms of--

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.350
Filepicker.io, which we
had on as a guest.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.190
So for developers out there,
if you are in a situation

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.500
where you do have to implement
multiple cloud providers,

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:20.140
there are options rather than
having to build each one of

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.120
them yourself.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.590
And some this you've been
working on for a while.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.370
And some of these options
weren't always available.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.740
MIKE BOROZDIN: Right.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.210
STEVE BAZYL: So it's certainly
understandable.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:34.236
But yeah, it's something that
you can probably simplify a

00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:37.880
lot and just make this
a much faster--

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.820
MIKE BOROZDIN: It's a
nice way of saying

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.890
it's time for a refresh.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:40.383
I get it.

00:12:40.383 --> 00:12:41.370
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:41.960
MIKE BOROZDIN: OK.

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.140
Yeah, no.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.810
You're right.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.440
STEVE BAZYL: It's just making
it simpler for users.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.080
MIKE BOROZDIN: Absolutely.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.600
STEVE BAZYL: I know you could
take advantage of our pickers

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.400
really fast.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.650
You don't have to sit there and
fetch pages and pages of

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.720
documents and so on.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.080
MIKE BOROZDIN: You know where
we do use your picker is in

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.100
our mobile app.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.710
And there we see the difference
is tremendous.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:11.740
So when you use our DocuSign
Ink product on an Android

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:19.570
tablet or your Google phone,
when you use the native picker

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:24.640
from Drive, that is a noticeable
difference.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.030
You don't need to time it,
because it's so obvious.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.430
So I don't know.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.920
I assume you guys do some
caching of stuff.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.520
STEVE BAZYL: Right.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.330
In that case, you're calling
into the native Drive app, if

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.040
it's installed.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.600
And that has all the
metadata cache.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.980
And we can share that
information a lot faster.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.680
MIKE BOROZDIN: Yeah,
super fast.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.890
STEVE BAZYL: Yeah.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.260
The mobile app is beautiful.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.990
So great job on that.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.240
MIKE BOROZDIN: Thanks.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.590
STEVE BAZYL: It's a great app.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.350
I've surprisingly only recently
have started using

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.990
electronic signatures for all
the things I need to do.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:06.220
And it's a hard habit to get
out of printing and signing

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:06.950
and scanning.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:10.330
But it makes a huge, huge,
huge difference.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.600
MIKE BOROZDIN: Thank you.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.480
STEVE BAZYL: So one of the
things I also wanted to talk

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.520
about is you actually have
a set of APIs as well.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.770
MIKE BOROZDIN: We do, yeah.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.180
STEVE BAZYL: And since we have
a little bit of a similar

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.880
audience in terms of people
that work with documents,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.360
especially people with Google
Apps, a lot of enterprise and

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.720
small business cases, anything
about your API, what you have

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.040
to offer that you think
would be interesting?

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:34.880
MIKE BOROZDIN: Absolutely.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.100
So we actually put a lot
of effort into our API.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.360
I think platform is sort of like
an abused term nowadays.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.760
But I would say that when it
comes to DocuSign, I really,

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.620
truly believe that we are a
platform because about 50% of

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.930
all our transactions
come through API.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:58.290
STEVE BAZYL: Oh, wow.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:04.280
MIKE BOROZDIN: So 50% of our
business and our users don't

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.740
use our web interface directly,
they use us from

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.770
applications like Drive and
third party integrations.

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:18.150
So we put a lot of emphasis on
making it easy for developers

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.170
to get going with electronic
signatures.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:28.380
So if you're taking notes,
docusign.com/devcenter or

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.980
developer-center, either one,
is a special part of our

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.290
website that's dedicated
to developers.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:41.510
And you can get a free
development account and get a

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.400
sandbox and start kicking
the tires.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:48.550
Because we know that developers,
they want to see

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.780
stuff work immediately.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.490
So the faster you can get down
to a working script or a

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:59.110
working program, the more
successful you're going to be.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:04.100
And we've got code samples in
five different languages, and

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:10.390
an interactive way to
exercise our APIs.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.510
And it generates JSON for you.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.485
And yeah, it's been great.

00:16:15.485 --> 00:16:20.140
First of all, we love working
with developers because the

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.670
type of genius that
you come across--

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:23.820
sometimes you're like, wow.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.650
You did that?

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.050
That is amazing.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:28.910
And just working with
smart people is

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.935
always, always a pleasure.

00:16:29.935 --> 00:16:32.150
STEVE BAZYL: And you
occasionally host meet-ups and

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.290
everything at your offices
in San Francisco.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.230
MIKE BOROZDIN: Yeah.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.080
STEVE BAZYL: You have other
offices as well, right?

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:38.480
MIKE BOROZDIN: Yeah.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.530
STEVE BAZYL: I think you're
up in Washington.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.680
MIKE BOROZDIN: Seattle,
Washington

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:41.980
we have a big office.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.050
We have a big office
here, right in

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.460
downtown San Francisco.

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:52.750
And we try to be engaged in
the developer community.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:57.080
And we also try to sort of give
back to the community by

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.920
hosting meet-ups at least a
couple of times a month and

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.319
just providing people with
resources and doing hack

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:06.250
nights and whatnot.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.310
STEVE BAZYL: Very cool.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:10.160
MIKE BOROZDIN: It's really
fun, actually.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.470
It's really fun for
us as well.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.849
STEVE BAZYL: And one
last question.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:18.640
I know you mentioned earlier,
Drive was your primary source,

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.340
or at least largest source, of
cloud storage documents.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.650
We were chatting a little bit
earlier about the Chrome Web

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.819
Store and some of the
leads that you're

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.190
generating from that.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:33.100
And I imagine for a company
that's largely come from the

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.180
enterprise space and more
traditional sales cycle, it's

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.920
a nice addition to bring in some
of these online sales and

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:44.070
different types of leads than
what you would normally get

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.035
through your sales force.

00:17:45.035 --> 00:17:46.020
MIKE BOROZDIN: Sure.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:52.440
So both Drive and Google Apps
are fantastic in terms of a

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.610
channel for us.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.570
And this is all public
information, you can go to

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:00.780
Chrome Web Store and you can
see that we have close to

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.600
80,000 people that have
signed up for DocuSign

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.820
through that channel.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.960
And this is all, like with
a lot of things that are

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.890
associated with Google, once you
figure out how to properly

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:18.220
use the tools, you're kind of
riding the Google wave.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.390
And it's fantastic.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.740
So Google Apps is another great
channel where that's

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:30.100
more geared towards the
enterprises and corporate

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.230
businesses.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:36.580
And we get a lot of
leads from that.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.080
And that's been great as well.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.930
And of course, being featured
on the Android store--

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:44.190
STEVE BAZYL: Oh, nice.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:45.020
Yeah.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.060
MIKE BOROZDIN: --the
Google Play store.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.810
Yeah, that helped a bunch
as well, so thank you.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.380
Like I said, we just love
our partnership here.

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.450
And to many more years.

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.170
STEVE BAZYL: Very cool.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.310
I know you need to get back
up into the city--

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.690
MIKE BOROZDIN: Yeah,
thank you.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.250
STEVE BAZYL: --for some
meetings up there.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.570
So but yeah, this
has been great.

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.300
Thanks for the demos
and the insights.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.970
Next week, we will be here
with floreysoft.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.800
So Daniel Florey, the founder
of that company, will be

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.410
joining us remotely.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.660
And he's going to talk about
some of the new apps that

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.790
they've been building, Editey
as well as Ultradox and some

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.640
other cool stuff.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.700
And yeah, we'll be
back next week.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.210
Again, Mike, thanks for coming
and taking some time out of

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:31.645
your schedule.

00:19:31.645 --> 00:19:32.200
MIKE BOROZDIN: Thank
you, yeah.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.540
STEVE BAZYL: And we'll see
everyone next week.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:20:42.082
