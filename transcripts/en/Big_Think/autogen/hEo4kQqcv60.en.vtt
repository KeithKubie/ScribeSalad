and and there was in fact we work in HIV

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080
and and there was in fact we work in HIV
 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.080
and and there was in fact we work in HIV
as well as hepatitis C and there was in

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090
as well as hepatitis C and there was in
 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.990
as well as hepatitis C and there was in
fact an example of this where there was

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000
fact an example of this where there was
 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.399
fact an example of this where there was
a genetic finding reported that

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:37.409
a genetic finding reported that
 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.680
a genetic finding reported that
suggested that a genetic difference that

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690
suggested that a genetic difference that
 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.160
suggested that a genetic difference that
is almost completely different between

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170
is almost completely different between
 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.180
is almost completely different between

ancestry where you have one form that's
 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.219
ancestry where you have one form that's
the common form in much of many parts of

the common form in much of many parts of
 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:52.469

Africa and another that's the common
form outside of Africa there was a study

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179
form outside of Africa there was a study
 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.239
form outside of Africa there was a study
that suggested that this particular

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249
that suggested that this particular
 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.910
that suggested that this particular
genetic difference and had a gene called

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920
genetic difference and had a gene called
 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.669
genetic difference and had a gene called
the duffy locus that this particular

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679
the duffy locus that this particular
 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.749
the duffy locus that this particular
genetic difference influenced a

genetic difference influenced a
susceptibility to infection with HIV and

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909
susceptibility to infection with HIV and
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.929
susceptibility to infection with HIV and
the study in fact was not a strong study

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939
the study in fact was not a strong study
 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.840
the study in fact was not a strong study
it did not have good controls yet

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850
it did not have good controls yet
 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.469
it did not have good controls yet
because it suggested that the form that

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479
because it suggested that the form that
 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.450
because it suggested that the form that
was common in Africa made people more

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460
was common in Africa made people more
 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.969
was common in Africa made people more
vulnerable to infection because it was

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979
vulnerable to infection because it was
 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.010
vulnerable to infection because it was
suggested that that made people more

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020
suggested that that made people more
 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.929
suggested that that made people more
vulnerable in fact Bill Clinton picked

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939
vulnerable in fact Bill Clinton picked
 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.940

up on it and when he visited Africa said

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950
up on it and when he visited Africa said
 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.109
up on it and when he visited Africa said
well we now have this genetic

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119
well we now have this genetic
 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.630
well we now have this genetic
explanation for why there's so much HIV

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640
explanation for why there's so much HIV
 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.209
explanation for why there's so much HIV
in Africa and that statement was wrong

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219
in Africa and that statement was wrong
 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.880
in Africa and that statement was wrong
from every single perspective the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890
from every single perspective the
 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.529
from every single perspective the
initial report of that finding other

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539
initial report of that finding other
 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.169
initial report of that finding other
groups tried to replicate and could not

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179
groups tried to replicate and could not
 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.300
groups tried to replicate and could not
replicate we do not believe it's true in

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310
replicate we do not believe it's true in
 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.580
replicate we do not believe it's true in
the first place and even if it were true

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590
the first place and even if it were true
 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.679
the first place and even if it were true
it is certainly not the case that you

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689
it is certainly not the case that you
 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.289
it is certainly not the case that you
could infer from that that the epidemic

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299
could infer from that that the epidemic
 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.020
could infer from that that the epidemic
of HIV in Africa is in fact due to due

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030
of HIV in Africa is in fact due to due
 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.669
of HIV in Africa is in fact due to due
to the underlying genetics as opposed to

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679
to the underlying genetics as opposed to
 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.679
to the underlying genetics as opposed to
other things like behavior so I think

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689
other things like behavior so I think
 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.899
other things like behavior so I think
there we had a real example where the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909
there we had a real example where the
 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.469
there we had a real example where the
genetics was dramatically overstated by

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479
genetics was dramatically overstated by
 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.870
genetics was dramatically overstated by
by a very influential individual and I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880
by a very influential individual and I
 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.350
by a very influential individual and I
don't fault him for that

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
don't fault him for that
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.780
don't fault him for that
I actually fault the scientific

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790
I actually fault the scientific
 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.440
I actually fault the scientific
community for not being more careful

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
community for not being more careful
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.150
community for not being more careful
about what it states as as as real

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160
about what it states as as as real
 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.340
about what it states as as as real
because what the scientific community

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350
because what the scientific community
 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.620
because what the scientific community
states has an influence on people's

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630
states has an influence on people's
 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.200
states has an influence on people's
thinking even when it isn't true

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210
thinking even when it isn't true
 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.570
thinking even when it isn't true
and so when this was then corrected as

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580
and so when this was then corrected as
 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.460
and so when this was then corrected as
this as science does correct itself over

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470
this as science does correct itself over
 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.570
this as science does correct itself over

yet said oh by the way what I said

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740
yet said oh by the way what I said
 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.680
yet said oh by the way what I said
earlier isn't correct and and in fact

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690
earlier isn't correct and and in fact
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.660
earlier isn't correct and and in fact
the New York Times covered this and I

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
the New York Times covered this and I
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910
the New York Times covered this and I
don't think they've reported anything

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
don't think they've reported anything
 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.560
don't think they've reported anything
saying well now four papers have shown

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
saying well now four papers have shown
 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.210
saying well now four papers have shown
that you know they can't replicate those

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
that you know they can't replicate those
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.430
that you know they can't replicate those
results so I think that's something that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
results so I think that's something that
 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.410
results so I think that's something that
we need to be real real careful of and I

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420
we need to be real real careful of and I
 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.740
we need to be real real careful of and I
I suppose I would say that that

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750
I suppose I would say that that
 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.150
I suppose I would say that that
influential people politicians and

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160
influential people politicians and
 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.070
influential people politicians and
others could probably do a little bit

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080
others could probably do a little bit
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.050
others could probably do a little bit
better job of being careful for example

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060
better job of being careful for example
 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.420
better job of being careful for example
maybe you pick up the phone to a few

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430
maybe you pick up the phone to a few
 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.190
maybe you pick up the phone to a few
geneticists before you decide to make a

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200
geneticists before you decide to make a
 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.199
geneticists before you decide to make a
statement like that and say hey is this

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209
statement like that and say hey is this
 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.940
statement like that and say hey is this
convincing as the solid because you

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
convincing as the solid because you
 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.040
convincing as the solid because you
wouldn't in that case have had to ask

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050
wouldn't in that case have had to ask
 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.900
wouldn't in that case have had to ask
too many geneticists before you would

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910
too many geneticists before you would
 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.690
too many geneticists before you would
have got some warning signs
