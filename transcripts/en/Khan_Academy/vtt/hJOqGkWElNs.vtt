00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.737
Solve for x and y.

00:00:01.737 --> 00:00:03.570
And we have two equations
with two unknowns.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.390
Negative 3y plus
4x is equal to 11,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.290
and y plus 2x is equal to 13.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.780
What we could do is try to
solve this using elimination.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.780
Maybe we can add these
two equations together

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.620
to get some variables
to cancel out.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.740
But if we just add
y and negative 3y,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.750
those won't cancel out.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.920
And if we just add a 2x and
4x, those won't cancel out.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.210
But maybe we can scale
one of these equations,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.210
so that we will get
some cancellation.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.250
If this y could
somehow become a 3y,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.250
then 3y and negative
3y would cancel out.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.780
And so the easiest way
to turn this y into a 3y

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.890
is to just multiply
this entire equation,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.740
so we don't actually change
the information in it, by 3.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.490
So let's multiply
both sides by 3.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:54.650
If we multiply the left-hand
side by 3, we get 3y plus 6x.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.500
We have to multiply
every term by 3.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.440
3y plus 6x is equal
to 3 times 13 is 39.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.290
So this equation
and this equation

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.540
are the exact same equation.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.100
I've just multiplied both sides
by 3 to go from here to here.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.780
So I multiplied by 3.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.260
And of course, we have this
original equation up here.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.290
That negative 3y plus
4x is equal to 11.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.370
And now, if we add the left-hand
side and the right-hand sides

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.960
of this equation, something
interesting happens.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.860
The negative 3y and the
positive 3y cancel out.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.710
That was the whole point behind
multiplying this second guy

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.090
over here by 3.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.110
So let's add them.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.700
So if we add, these
guys cancel out.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.500
We have 4x plus 6x is 10x.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.050
And that is equal to 11
plus 39, which is 50.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.380
And then we can divide
both sides by 10.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.200
We get x is equal to
50 divided by 10 is 5.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.610
And then we could go
substitute back to solve for y.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.320
If x is 5, we could use the
second equation right over

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.820
here.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.590
We get y plus 2 times 5.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.280
I'll do it in that same color.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.570
2 times 5 is equal to 13.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.350
Or y plus 10 is equal to 13.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.460
We can subtract 10
from both sides.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.560
And we will get y.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.640
These cancel out.
y is equal to 3.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.660
So our solution that
we get for x and y

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.620
is that x is equal to 5.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.210
And y is equal to 3.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.610
And we can verify that it
works in both equations.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.300
In this top equation-- let
me do it in a new color--

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:40.290
negative 3 times 3 plus 4
times 5 is-- this is negative

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.130
9 plus 20, which is,
indeed, equal to 11.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.050
So both of these satisfy
the first equation.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.500
And then if we take the second
equation, 3 plus 2 times 5,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.550
that's 3 plus 10, that
does, indeed, equal 13.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.182
So it definitely satisfies both.

00:02:59.182 --> 00:03:00.140
And I want to be clear.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.040
You could have solved
this with substitution.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.600
Or you could have changed which
equation you scale so that we

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.820
get different
cancellations when we add

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.904
or different eliminations.

00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:10.736
So another way that we
could have done this,

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:12.830
we could've kept the
first equation the same.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.670
Negative 3y plus
4x is equal to 11.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.050
But maybe we want this 2x
to cancel with this 4x.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.424
And the only way
we could do that

00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:24.960
is if this 2x could
become a negative 4x.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.820
And the way to get from
a 2x to a negative 4x

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.900
is to multiply it by negative 2.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.770
So let's multiply this entire
equation by negative 2.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.030
So it would become
negative 2y minus

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.310
4x is equal to negative 26.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.660
And if we then add
the two equations,

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.130
the x's will cancel out.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.220
You have negative
3y minus 2y, which

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.100
is negative 5y is
equal to 11 minus 26.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.950
That's negative 15.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.800
Now, you can divide both
sides by negative 5.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.790
And you get-- the negatives
cancel out-- y is equal to 3.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.870
So in this situation,
we eliminated

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.940
the x's first to solve for y.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.900
And then you could go back,
substitute, and solve for x.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.120
You'll get x is equal to 5.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.860
The first time we did it,
we eliminated the y's.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.940
We scaled this
equation right here so

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.730
that the y's would cancel out.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.980
And so we solved for the x
first and then substituted back.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.880
Either way works.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.580
You get x is equal to 5.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.567
y is equal to 3.
