Great. You're listening to radio man,

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.600
the podcast from New York public radio, public radio, w.

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.580
Y. C. N. N. P. R. Hello everyone. I'm Jad from Radiolab.

4
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.110
I'm here to tell you that we're getting very close to season four,

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.020
but before we get started, I wanted to just point you to something.

6
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.200
We have started a blog, a radio lab blog,

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.510
which will contain all kinds of stuff, ringtones, even extra interviews,

8
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:37.380
videos. I'll be posting some music, putting some cool articles.

9
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:41.130
Robert will be putting some posts on there, so if you need a fix,

10
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.000
if you're bored at work, there's interested in you know, cool ideas.

11
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.001
Check out radiolab.org click on blog now about to change your life just a little

12
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:56.700
bit. I'm going to play you one of my favorite pieces of all times for one of my

13
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:59.400
favorite producers of all time. Her name is Sharon Elise.

14
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:03.600
She's an Australian and she makes all of these pieces,

15
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.960
which are kind of in the same manner that radio labs sometimes does radio,

16
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.570
which sounds a little bit like music, but it's also like radio,

17
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.780
but it's like music. She's in that, in that spirit as well.

18
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:17.430
She will take speech and edit it into a musical little situation.

19
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.200
I don't want to say too much more about it except to say that it is called

20
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.210
simply if,

21
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.820
<v 1>if [inaudible]</v>

22
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.310
if is,

23
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.880
it's a lot of [inaudible] trying to help someone before flower finch

24
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.310
is all we're flying with the friend of the fish. If,

25
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.060
if I was a a bird

26
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.130
<v 0>looking at the children that will really sick,</v>

27
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.290
<v 1>if, if</v>

28
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.870
crocodile, if,

29
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.940
if our plants,

30
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.390
like if our kid teach kitty,

31
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.510
if, if, if,

32
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.620
if, if, if,

33
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.303
if,

34
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.313
if,

35
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.570
if I was, uh, a bird and I saw a vantage around someone's head,

36
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.760
I'd pretend it was my nest and start laying her eggs there

37
00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.150
if [inaudible].

38
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.310
Oh, darn it. Well, he didn't. Huh?

39
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.810
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

40
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.810
<v 1>if I were finch nesting and in the children's hospital and I saw a caster or</v>

41
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.680
around someone's leg, I'd think, is that the, um,

42
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.440
what Michael was saying, if Andrea in the beach scuttle fisheries it yet,

43
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.200
I think it was a Scott, a scuttle fish, and I'd start shoving my bacon on it.

44
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.453
<v 2>Hello.</v>

45
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.170
<v 1>Sweet Woo. The coral fish inside of his fall.</v>

46
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.480
[inaudible] in the children's hospital. I'd be thinking,

47
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.440
thinking, who's in the cage? Is it me or is it you? Well,

48
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.620
it's mainly fish.

49
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.410
When I first get there, they, why me, you know, take a blood test,

50
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.620
see how high and write it all down.

51
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.700
[inaudible] someone comes in and says, well this is what's up via this, this,

52
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:19.900
this, this and this.

53
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.303
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

54
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.510
<v 1>my, it was low calcium</v>

55
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.010
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

56
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.940
<v 1>this, this, this, this and this.</v>

57
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.380
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

58
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.240
<v 1>if are a kid,</v>

59
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.630
it'll like if our plan at the children's hospital and I saw the kids go past,

60
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.120
I think to myself,

61
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.480
I'm lucky the plants seeing all these sick kids go by and I'm as fetus fiddle or

62
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:02.730
I might be turned into a fiddle that I'll be fit as a fiddle.

63
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.910
And just the other week I had a biopsy. They, they,

64
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.300
they put you to sleep and then everything goes,

65
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.830
I'll find you when you are in a sleep a, it just goes to see if it's a, um,

66
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.430
a lollipop. You know those big ones, how they roll

67
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.373
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

68
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:27.260
<v 1>no.</v>

69
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.260
It's like when you get a pencil and your pain rate in certain places,

70
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.250
the those spiral kind of like, and when you roll it,

71
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.330
it goes all funny

72
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.743
<v 4>brown.</v>

73
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.450
That that sort of felt like everything was going round and round and round and

75
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.280
round and land. I wake up and then I go to

76
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.320
bed feeling money fro who's a funny,

77
00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.900
if he's, Oh our frog in the children's hospital,

78
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.730
I'd be stuck in someone's fright because they swallowed me.

79
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.200
Now they got a frog in their throat.

80
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.200
If I was a good yes,

81
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.010
he's good in a children's hospital, drawing a picture,

82
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.960
I draw a cat and say, Ooh, I [inaudible].

83
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.800
I draw a polytech.

84
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.680
<v 5>Yep. Yep.</v>

85
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.860
<v 1>I always ruin a good picture. I add things on tickles. Nice.</v>

86
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:40.970
Now keep adding and adding and adding and adding. Yet when I finish,

87
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:44.420
I think I've got too many things. See like this.

88
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:51.010
I drew a doggy flat and then I decided to do a bed and then I described as as a

89
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:54.200
pillar and I decided to do the nurse.

90
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.420
Then I just started to do his hands.

91
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.720
Then I decided to do little by little shadow within day.

92
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.810
No wonder the sheets, the dog, he,

93
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.910
he's spewing up [inaudible].

94
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.233
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

95
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.150
<v 1>Yes, like the drawings and the art.</v>

96
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.010
They made me get better because once I did them, I thought, oh,

97
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:22.890
this is a not picture. And then insight made me feel a little,

98
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.270
you know, that fuzzy feeling yet.

99
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.760
<v 6>Woo, Woo, Woo, Woo, Woo.</v>

100
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.140
<v 1>It's our TT, right?</v>

101
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.700
If our kid sleeping on a bed,

102
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.970
<v 0>that's if by Australian producers share to lease to find out more about shared</v>

103
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:54.840
