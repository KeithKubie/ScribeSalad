00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.310
It was a great place I remembered as an undergraduate

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.109
it was of romantic fun kind of

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:12.869
exciting somewhat naughty place

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:13.750
but

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.880
architecturally it's quite significant the building
was built by Warren and Wetmore

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.410
about 1900, somewhere in that range.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.119
the very famous architects who went on to build
grand central station

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.590
they designed this thing with two huge working
baronial fireplaces

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.390
skylights so it was all lit during the day
there was trellis on the Wall, big palms,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.290
gigantic wooden beams over the pool and the
water

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.980
flowed out into the pool from of be river head
god mouth.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.620
Essentially what happened is that they
discovered that it had a crack in it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.130
and when they drained it for a routine
cleaning they found that it had been leaking

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.389
water and so at that time it was decided to

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:55.370
convert it to a theatre.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:02.370
The architecture of this space
is, I've never seen anything like it before,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.419
I mean it's obviously built in a pool, but that just

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:10.120
changes a bit the dynamic of the theatre.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.939
They did fill out the bottom
of the pool a little bit so it's not completely sunken,

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.329
however it is stadium seating so it does
slope downwards towards the stage.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:24.430
and the stage is sunken a little bit, I'd say perhaps

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.390
about a good

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.790
four feet

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.340
so yeah it does have an interesting 
effect in that way.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.340
Both my co director and I really liked what we 
saw the space as being able to do

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.120
and we also felt that this was something that actually was 
working out even better than we thought when we first saw the space.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.810
It does work as a theatre space

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.460
but

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.970
as a architectural space, as an Edwardian architectural space

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.660
it really is unique.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.110
I think it's one of the things that all of the
alumni from Adam's remember

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.459
as being sort of one of the signature things of
the house
