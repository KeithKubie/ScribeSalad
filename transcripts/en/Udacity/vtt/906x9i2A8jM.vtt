00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.360
So we use a combination of things.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.440
Over my career I've used
lots of different things,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.080
all the way from itracking to
usability to quantitative analysis.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.390
But I think the most important
thing is to be iterative and

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.700
to be in a process of learning.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.590
The worst case scenario you can get
to is what I call the sort of culture

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.730
of delivery.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.290
Which is, your whole processes
are aligned to one ship date,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.810
and we redesigned checkout.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.990
Okay, what's the next project?

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.130
And we shipped that, that's done.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.050
All right, that's a culture of delivery.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.540
A culture of learning is,
hey, we're going to try this.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.650
Oh, let's see what we can learn
before we actually build it.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.020
Oh, we started to build it.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.430
Let's prototype it, and
make it better and better.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.050
Hey, we launched it.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:38.680
What happened?

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.330
Let's measure.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.130
We should tweak that.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.910
Let's keep measuring.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.090
Let's keep learning.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.070
When you do that then you find
all of these opportunities for

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.219
optimization, and for insights,
that you wouldn't have.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.987
If all you're doing is
getting to that launch and

00:00:52.987 --> 00:00:56.040
then moving on to the next
launch after that.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.360
So internally here I have
a number of different teams that

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.630
look at both sides of the equation.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.420
We do rapid iterative
prototyping up front.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.730
So we'll build a little prototype, we'll
put users through it, and we'll learn,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.550
do they understand our intent.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.440
Can they actually act on what
we're trying to allow them to do?

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.930
And then after launch,
we'll go and track the metrics and

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.920
sometimes with the metrics you'll see,
oh that's weird.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.120
Why is that going on?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.500
And then the next natural step is
to actually go talk to people.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.547
There's a case study that Expedia
published a long time ago.

00:01:28.547 --> 00:01:31.206
Which was fascinating to me
because they had a check out flow,

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:32.820
standard thing, right.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.720
You have booked the trip and
you're going through and they had this

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.340
optional field called company,
right above billing information.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.340
And for whatever reason,
people would enter their company, and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.290
then start putting in the address
of their company below company,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.910
which kind of makes sense.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.750
But what happened is,
they would get these billing errors.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.015
Because they put in a billing address
that is not the billing address of

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:56.965
the credit card, instead it's
the company that they work for,

00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:58.495
this was an optional field.

00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:01.855
So Expedia removed it, and
instantly they got 12 million more

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:06.035
in profit a year overnight just from
dropping this one optional field.

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:08.565
And until you actually see
somebody go through a flow,

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:11.399
how would you ever guess why there's so
many errors?

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.590
You have to talk to a couple people and
go, oh they think it's their

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.660
company's address that's why we're
getting all these billing errors.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.560
It's not like bad credit cards or
what have you.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.260
So that combination of
the quantitative data,

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.500
hm, lots of errors in billing addresses,
and qualitative,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.380
why let's talk to them, really let's
you fix the product and make it work.
