00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.970
- I brought cards
to do magic tricks.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.272
- [Reggie] Oh, yes!

00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:10.910
- [David] Alright, go ahead
and make sure these are.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.412 align:start size:84% position:16%
Just take a look,
it's a regular deck.

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.748 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Reggie] Yep, regular
deck, no magnetic filters.

00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:15.582
- [David] Nothing in there?

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:16.416
- Nope.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.284
- Now,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.721 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm not going to
shuffle or anything.

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:26.026 align:start size:88% position:13%
I want you to pick three
cards, three cards.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.961
- There's one.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.596 align:start size:81% position:19%
Don't show them
to you, obviously.

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:32.265
- [David] Don't show them to me.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.467
- [Jim] Uh oh, not that one.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.971
- [David] Okay,
show them to Jim.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.305
- Yeah. Alright.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.008
- Do you want me to
say them out loud?

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.277
- [David] Nope, I don't you
tell me at all. Alright.

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:49.249
Now I want you to place them
anywhere in the deck, alright?

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.517
But all three together.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:51.818
All three together?
- All three together.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.486
- [David] Alright,
tell me when to stop.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.788
Okay.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.056
Alright.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.191
Now I want you to go
ahead and shuffle.

00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.526
I won't even look, you
can do whatever you want.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:00.727
- You won't look
at me shuffling?

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.961
- Nope.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.263
- [Reggie] That's
pretty intense.

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.597
I think we're--

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.266 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What's he doing over there?
- Either that or--

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.500
- [Jim] What's he doing
over there? He's not--

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.435
- [Man] Staring at
one of the posters.

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.602
- [Jim] He's just staring.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:10.837 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Man] I'm watching
him intently.

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.305
He's just staring
at it like this.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.706 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Jim] Is he using a
mirror to look backwards?

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.575 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I'm not seeing anything,
I have no mirror.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.043
- [Jim] His hands, he's
got a hand on a beer.

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:17.977
- Tell me when you're done.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.746
- [Reggie] Alright, I'm done.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.247
- [Man] He's looking
at the fridge now.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.982
- This, and then I'm gonna, I
am gonna do this real quick.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:23.817
- Oh, wow.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:25.552
- Okay.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.688 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now, Reggie, we've never
met before, is that correct?

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:30.690
- [Reggie] That's correct.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.493
- And this is not pre-arranged
in any way whatsoever, is it?

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:34.727
- It has not been.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.763
- [David] Okay, we're
going to flap these,

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.065
that's the technical parlance,

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.166
and you tell me when to stop.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.734
- [Reggie] Okay.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.002
Stop.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.971
- Okay, I'm gonna put
this card down here.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.006
Tell me when to stop.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.274
- [Reggie] Stop.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.743
- Okay, I'm gonna put
this card down here.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.946
Tell me when to stop.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:53.780
- Stop.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.515
- [David] Okay.

00:01:55.515 --> 00:01:58.084 align:start size:84% position:16%
Alright, so the
bottom three cards,

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.486
are the ones you
told me to stop.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.320 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Okay.
- I'm going to

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.754
put these over here.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:02.589
- [Reggie] Looking
at them right there.

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:03.690
- [David] Okay.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.657
Tell me when to stop

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:06.659 align:start size:75% position:25%
- [Reggie] Stop.
- Okay.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.264 align:start size:84% position:16%
Tell me when to stop.
- [Reggie] Stop.

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:12.765
- [David] Alright.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.136
And tell me when to stop.

00:02:18.438 --> 00:02:19.939
- [Reggie] (laughing) stop.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.743 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [David] (laughing)
okay, we have three more.

00:02:23.743 --> 00:02:25.011
I'm gonna put that pile here.

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:26.679
- [Reggie] Okay.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.981 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [David] Alright, Jim.
- [Jim] Yes, sir?

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.015
- [David] Tell me when to stop.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.984 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Stop.
- [David] Okay.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.052
Alright, tell me when to stop.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.154
- [Jim] Stop.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.758
- And tell me when to stop.

00:02:38.758 --> 00:02:39.826
- [Jim] Stop.

00:02:42.195 --> 00:02:44.898
- These three cards are
going to go over here.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:46.699 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Jim] This is my
favorite trick of yours.

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.635 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [David] Okay,
gonna put that there.

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.203
So we have three,
we all saw this?

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.804
- [Paul] Yes.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.040
- Now, is one of your cards

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.743
one of these cards?

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.913
- [Reggie] (laughing)

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.685
- [David] Reggie?

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.156
- Eh, I don't quite remember.

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.192 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Paul] What, you don't
remember the cards?

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.426
- [David] Jim, is
one of these cards

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.527
one of the cards you picked out?

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:15.929
- [Jim] I think so.

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.397
- Which one?

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:18.331
- This one.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.800
- [David] Ha ha!

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:24.737
Alright, thank you.

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.242 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Reggie] Was that
"alright" indicating the end?

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.777 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What?
- That was pretty good.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.679
- [Reggie] That "alright,"
was it indicating the end?

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.080
- [Jim] I haven't seen
that before, that's a.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.215
- [Man] He got your card.

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.482
- Pretty good.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.450
- [Paul] I would
say that you guys--

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.384
- So you know how to do that--

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.619
- [Paul] You guys failed in

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:41.221
the remembering
of the card part.

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.488
That is more disturbing.

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:44.657
- Thank god Jim was there.
