00:00:00.978 --> 00:00:04.181
- [Announcer] This UCSD-TV
program is presented by

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:06.535
University of California Television.

00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:07.729

00:00:11.134 --> 00:00:14.134
to keep up with the latest programs.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.901
(classical music)

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:25.708
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape,

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:28.208
bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.124
long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:39.322
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:42.652
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:44.735
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:45.997 --> 00:00:48.260
We grow up slowly.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.883
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.966
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.640
We shape the future from our

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.390
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:03.598
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.598 --> 00:01:06.600
to exchange insights on who we are

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.267
and how we got here.

00:01:09.693 --> 00:01:11.310
An exploration made possible

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.393
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:33.359
(mellow piano music)

00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:13.219
- I'd like to begin by

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.648
acknowledging and appreciating the talk

00:02:14.648 --> 00:02:18.265
that I just heard, which
really emphasized this,

00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:21.025
that animals and humans
can get the same diseases

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:23.226
and yet physicians and veterinarians

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:25.897
rarely consult with one another,

00:02:25.897 --> 00:02:28.537
and that human and non-human
animal commonalities

00:02:28.537 --> 00:02:30.801
can be used to diagnose, threat,

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:33.551
and heal patients of all species.

00:02:34.774 --> 00:02:36.568
And I also would like to acknowledge

00:02:36.568 --> 00:02:39.544
that this comes as Barbara pointed out

00:02:39.544 --> 00:02:42.616
from a long lineage
that goes back to Oslo,

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:44.301
and one of those steps along the way

00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:46.496
was one of our own here, Kurt Benirschke,

00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:49.375
unfortunately couldn't be
here because of an illness,

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:51.092
the founding director of CRESZS

00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:53.203
and professor of pathology here

00:02:53.203 --> 00:02:56.071
who really emphasized one medicine.

00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:59.024
I'd like to flip the coin around,

00:02:59.024 --> 00:03:01.736
and science has always
two sides to every coin,

00:03:01.736 --> 00:03:05.444
and say, are there
human-specific diseases?

00:03:05.444 --> 00:03:08.931
What we've been hearing
about is the evolutionary

00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:12.277
biology and diseases of a
large variety of animals,

00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:15.022
mostly warm-blooded social
animals, vertebrates,

00:03:15.022 --> 00:03:17.831
and you can see an entire lineage here.

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.247
Let's zoom in on the
group that we belong to,

00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:23.444
primates, and zoom in further,

00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:26.138
and among these primates
we have new-world monkeys,

00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:30.838
old-world monkeys, gibbons,
various so-called great apes,

00:03:30.838 --> 00:03:32.505
and then us, humans.

00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:35.395
If we zoom in further here,

00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:38.371
we can see that we shared common ancestors

00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:42.653
with orangutans, gorillas,
chimpanzees, bonobos

00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:46.123
just a very short time
ago in evolutionary time.

00:03:46.123 --> 00:03:47.656
And here's another way to look at it.

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:49.437
In millions of years before present,

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:53.139
there's certainly some
discussion about the time frame,

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.444
but the very important
point to make here is that

00:03:56.444 --> 00:04:00.092
while we classified all
these species as great apes,

00:04:00.092 --> 00:04:02.774
the main difference between
chimpanzees and bonobos

00:04:02.774 --> 00:04:07.079
is less than 1% of their
amino acid sequence level.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.523
In fact, we are closer to
bonobos and chimpanzees

00:04:09.523 --> 00:04:11.688
than they are to gorillas.

00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:13.692
In fact, we are closer to chimpanzees

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:16.488
than mice and rats are to each other.

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:19.023
So really, the classification
should be like this,

00:04:19.023 --> 00:04:22.696
we are hominids, and
then among the hominids,

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:25.545
the lineage is leading
to us, the hominins.

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:28.994
So if you have a species that's 99%

00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:30.741
identical to us at the protein level,

00:04:30.741 --> 00:04:32.356
how could you possibly have anything

00:04:32.356 --> 00:04:33.722
that's different between them?

00:04:33.722 --> 00:04:35.314
And in fact, when I first
got into this field,

00:04:35.314 --> 00:04:38.694
I found out at the veterinarians that

00:04:38.694 --> 00:04:40.396
the primates center I went to were using

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:42.216
Harrison's textbook of internal medicine,

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:44.322
same textbook I'd used.

00:04:44.322 --> 00:04:46.291
So that made sense.

00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:47.675
But if you wanna say there's such a thing

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:49.561
as a human-specific disease,

00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:52.291
it's got to be very common in humans,

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.875
rarely reported in
closely-related species,

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:55.901
now this is very important,

00:04:55.901 --> 00:04:57.817
I'm zooming in on this
clip, not about things

00:04:57.817 --> 00:05:01.516
that happened at distant
portions of evolution,

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:04.555
even in captivity and could not
be experimentally reproduced

00:05:04.555 --> 00:05:06.440
in such species, and I should warn you,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.644
I'm gonna talk about a few
really horrible experiments

00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:10.642
that were done a long time ago

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:12.565
that will never be done again.

00:05:12.565 --> 00:05:15.687
So there's a caveat:
who do you compare with?

00:05:15.687 --> 00:05:18.041
In my opinion, reliable
information is limited

00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:22.227
to data on a few thousand
great apes in captivity

00:05:22.227 --> 00:05:25.482
which were cared for at
NIH-funded facilities,

00:05:25.482 --> 00:05:27.942
with full veterinary care,
probably better medical care

00:05:27.942 --> 00:05:31.949
than most Americans get,
and full necropsies.

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.788
Sp this is a reasonable data
said to compare with humans.

00:05:34.788 --> 00:05:36.633
I think comparing with wild chimpanzees

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:40.466
and self-domesticated
humans isn't that useful

00:05:41.697 --> 00:05:44.256
in this question that
we are trying to ask.

00:05:44.256 --> 00:05:46.219
So when I went to Yerkes Primate Center

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:48.070
and other centers and asked, and said,

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.314
"What's the commonest cause of death

00:05:49.314 --> 00:05:51.236
"in captive adult chimpanzees?"

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:52.850
And they said, "Heart disease,

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.170
"heart attacks, heart failures."

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.287
So I said, "Oh, it's the same thing."

00:05:56.287 --> 00:05:58.946
But then my wife, Nissi
Varki, who's a pathologist,

00:05:58.946 --> 00:06:00.508
went to see what is going on.

00:06:00.508 --> 00:06:01.341
She came back and said,

00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:04.664
"You fool, it's mostly
a different disease!"

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:07.335
And so we got together with
various experts across,

00:06:07.335 --> 00:06:10.040
including Kurt, and wrote
this article that says

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.965
Heart Disease is Common
in Humans and Chimpanzees,

00:06:13.965 --> 00:06:18.048
But is mostly Caused by
Different Pathological Processes.

00:06:18.048 --> 00:06:19.585
So in comparing these two species,

00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:22.232
amazingly, it turns out
that while we humans,

00:06:22.232 --> 00:06:23.641
essentially all of our heart attacks

00:06:23.641 --> 00:06:24.921
are due to what you heard about,

00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:27.985
atherosclerotic coronary
blockade in the arteries,

00:06:27.985 --> 00:06:29.645
chimpanzees do get atherosclerosis,

00:06:29.645 --> 00:06:33.506
but it rarely ever leads
to coronary thrombosis.

00:06:33.506 --> 00:06:35.787
Instead, they get this
very peculiar kind of

00:06:35.787 --> 00:06:39.954
scarring in the myocardium,
in the heart muscle, fibrosis,

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.867
so-called interstitial myocardial
fibrosis in great apes.

00:06:44.867 --> 00:06:49.237
This gives rise to abnormal
rhythms, heart failure,

00:06:49.237 --> 00:06:51.517
and heart attacks, so it looks like humans

00:06:51.517 --> 00:06:54.510
but in autopsies, it's
a different disease.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.001
In fact, since we wrote this article now

00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.250
put this out, it's
become so well-recognized

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.843
that interstitial myocardial
fibrosis is such a

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:06.272
major common in captive
great apes in all the zoos

00:07:06.272 --> 00:07:09.857
that all the zoos led by Zoo
Atlanta have gotten together

00:07:09.857 --> 00:07:13.102
and found a network to figure
out what is this disease,

00:07:13.102 --> 00:07:16.205
and why is it killing all our great apes.

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:19.055
And so there are two
mysteries to be solved.

00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:21.837
One is, why do we humans not often get

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:24.101
this fibrotic heart
disease that's so common

00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:26.557
in our closest evolutionary cousins?

00:07:26.557 --> 00:07:29.238
Conversely, why do
great apes not often get

00:07:29.238 --> 00:07:30.694
the kind of heart disease we get

00:07:30.694 --> 00:07:32.083
that's so common in humans?

00:07:32.083 --> 00:07:33.958
Since we're genetically so similar,

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.779
there must be a very
limited number of reasons.

00:07:36.779 --> 00:07:39.461
We'd immediately say, "Ah,
it's just cholesterol."

00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:42.710
In fact, cholesterol is the leading thing

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.846
that pushes atherosclerotic heart disease,

00:07:44.846 --> 00:07:46.239
but look at this figure here.

00:07:46.239 --> 00:07:48.809
Above is the black line,

00:07:48.809 --> 00:07:50.803
chimpanzee levels of cholesterol.

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:53.195
Even at birth and soon after
birth in the first decade,

00:07:53.195 --> 00:07:56.185
they're so high that they
should be on statins.

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.964
And they have similar HDL levels.

00:07:58.964 --> 00:08:02.812
They have APOE4 ancestral
allele, higher Lp(a) levels,

00:08:02.812 --> 00:08:06.808
sedentary lifestyles,
hypertension, and so on.

00:08:06.808 --> 00:08:09.948
Now, to be fair, there are
some amino acid differences

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.835
in those two very important proteins

00:08:11.835 --> 00:08:13.923
and that may be part of the story.

00:08:13.923 --> 00:08:16.433
So based on this kind of
work, Nissi Varki and I

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:18.691
went to several of these primate centers

00:08:18.691 --> 00:08:21.907
and tried to learn more about
this biomedical differences.

00:08:21.907 --> 00:08:23.757
In this case, we're
focusing on differences.

00:08:23.757 --> 00:08:25.825
I wanna be clear, there
are many similarities,

00:08:25.825 --> 00:08:28.189
which I'm not gonna talk about.

00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:31.135
And so we, of course, worked
on sialic acid biology.

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:32.826
That's another story for another day,

00:08:32.826 --> 00:08:36.449
but this article also talks
about those differences.

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:37.871
So here's a list of candidates

00:08:37.871 --> 00:08:40.919
for human-specific diseases
that I call definite,

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.438
meaning the data so far
suggest that long list.

00:08:43.438 --> 00:08:45.147
Obviously, I'm not going to
go through the whole list.

00:08:45.147 --> 00:08:47.129
I'll give you a few examples.

00:08:47.129 --> 00:08:49.457
The big one, of course,
that I mentioned is this

00:08:49.457 --> 00:08:52.485
remarkable difference in the
rates of coronary thrombosis

00:08:52.485 --> 00:08:55.308
was this interstitial myocardial fibrosis.

00:08:55.308 --> 00:08:57.507
In fact, spontaneous coronary thrombosis

00:08:57.507 --> 00:08:59.173
due to atherosclerosis
seems to be very rare

00:08:59.173 --> 00:09:01.711
in other animals, in the
absence of experimental

00:09:01.711 --> 00:09:04.469
genetic or dietary manipulations.

00:09:04.469 --> 00:09:07.207
And the human-specific mechanics,
undoubtedly as mentioned,

00:09:07.207 --> 00:09:10.268
have to do partly with
behavioral and dietary changes,

00:09:10.268 --> 00:09:13.206
although I'm looking forward
to the talk from Mike Gurvin

00:09:13.206 --> 00:09:16.577
on this hunter-gatherer heart disease,

00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:20.301
these amino acid changes
in these two proteins,

00:09:20.301 --> 00:09:21.898
and something I'm not gonna go into,

00:09:21.898 --> 00:09:24.981
genetic change in sialic
acid that seems to have

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.261
made our immune cells much
more prone to inflammation

00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:29.781
and also contributes to the effects

00:09:29.781 --> 00:09:31.345
of red meat and heart attacks,

00:09:31.345 --> 00:09:34.310
but that's, of course, a specialized case.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.221
Here's another disease, malignant malaria,

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:37.933
the big killer malaria.

00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:40.342
Horrible, horrible
studies done in the 1920s

00:09:40.342 --> 00:09:43.140
and 1940s in the Belgian Congo,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.651
two-way cross-transfusions
between chimpanzees

00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:49.358
and humans infected or
non-infected with malaria.

00:09:49.358 --> 00:09:51.825
No evidence of across infection.

00:09:51.825 --> 00:09:53.376
It turned out the parasites look the same

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:55.449
but are different.

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:57.494
Fast forward almost a century and work by

00:09:57.494 --> 00:10:00.639
CARTA member Francisco
Ayala and others showed

00:10:00.639 --> 00:10:04.568
that all the falciparum in
the world, this killer malaria

00:10:04.568 --> 00:10:07.305
belongs to a very small
plate in the midst of

00:10:07.305 --> 00:10:10.012
many, many, many other ape malarias.

00:10:10.012 --> 00:10:11.761
In fact, Barbara Han later showed

00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:14.552
that Plasmodium falciparum probably arose

00:10:14.552 --> 00:10:18.364
by a single transfer from
one gorilla to a human,

00:10:18.364 --> 00:10:20.838
sometime we don't know exactly when,

00:10:20.838 --> 00:10:22.586
a few tens of thousands of years ago.

00:10:22.586 --> 00:10:25.581
So Pascal Gagneuxa
summarized it like this.

00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:27.207
Ape malarias are very common,

00:10:27.207 --> 00:10:29.021
and because of the sialic acid change,

00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:31.205
I'm not going to go into,

00:10:31.205 --> 00:10:35.291
we escaped the target
and we had a free ride

00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:36.934
for a million years or so,

00:10:36.934 --> 00:10:40.886
but the parasites always win in the end.

00:10:40.886 --> 00:10:43.726
And finally the parasite
in that one transfer

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:46.130
switched to bind the
human kind of sialic acid

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.256
and then, of course,
we spread to mosquitoes

00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:52.568
in our environment, and
the rest is history.

00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:55.048
Here's another one,
typhoid fever, big killer

00:10:55.048 --> 00:10:58.500
throughout human history
until very recently.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.807
And it turns out there's been
a host adaptation to humans.

00:11:02.807 --> 00:11:06.247
Again, most horrible
studies done in the 1960s,

00:11:06.247 --> 00:11:10.414
large doses of Salmonella type
fever given to chimpanzees.

00:11:11.456 --> 00:11:15.623
Survival was much better, and
they were much less sensitive.

00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:19.223
It turns out we can find
an explanation for this.

00:11:19.223 --> 00:11:21.013
There's a human kind of sialic acid

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.917
shown on this side of the screen,

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:23.861
and the other side of the screen,

00:11:23.861 --> 00:11:26.987
Gc is the chimpanzee type of sialic acid.

00:11:26.987 --> 00:11:28.689
And the typhoid toxin only binds

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:31.069
to the human kind of sialic acid.

00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:34.612
And so using most models,
we can sort of show

00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:36.069
that this is what's going on,

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:38.750
that we have the
sensitivity and resistance.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.263
Cholera, Robert Koch, the
famous microbiologist said,

00:11:42.263 --> 00:11:44.365
"Although these experiments
are constantly repeated

00:11:44.365 --> 00:11:47.355
"with material from fresh cholera cases,

00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:48.407
"our mice remained healthy.

00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:50.485
"We then made experiments
on monkeys, cats,

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:52.292
"poultry, dogs, and other animals,

00:11:52.292 --> 00:11:54.398
"and we were never able
to arrive at anything

00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:57.277
"similar to a cholera process."

00:11:57.277 --> 00:12:00.907
So far, there's nothing
except a baby rabbit model.

00:12:00.907 --> 00:12:02.916
Of course, there's explanation for this.

00:12:02.916 --> 00:12:04.964
Now I've been talking mostly
about infectious disease

00:12:04.964 --> 00:12:06.358
from Jared Diamond and others,

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:07.943
and if you look in the
bottom of the screen,

00:12:07.943 --> 00:12:10.061
you can see that certain
diseases like rabies

00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:12.714
can spread throughout many animals.

00:12:12.714 --> 00:12:15.396
And then eventually a disease
makes its way into humans

00:12:15.396 --> 00:12:17.074
and by what's called the red queen effect,

00:12:17.074 --> 00:12:20.337
becomes highly specialized on one species.

00:12:20.337 --> 00:12:22.272
And so some of this is not so surprising,

00:12:22.272 --> 00:12:25.033
but the fact is that
there are such diseases.

00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:27.960
There's one set of definite diseases

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.032
that are kinda interesting.

00:12:29.032 --> 00:12:32.082
These are gonorrhea,
various other organisms

00:12:32.082 --> 00:12:34.096
that infect newborns.

00:12:34.096 --> 00:12:36.856
But it appears that these
bacteria have done is

00:12:36.856 --> 00:12:40.511
invent the human kind of
sialic acid and coat themselves

00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:45.006
in what my colleague, Victor
Nizet, calls molecular mimicry,

00:12:45.006 --> 00:12:47.908
basically wolves in sheep's clothing.

00:12:47.908 --> 00:12:50.543
And they're very successful pathogens.

00:12:50.543 --> 00:12:52.752
Okay, so that's some examples.

00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:56.462
I haven't gone through all of
them human-specific diseases

00:12:56.462 --> 00:12:58.554
that seem to be human-specific.

00:12:58.554 --> 00:13:00.249
What about probable ones?

00:13:00.249 --> 00:13:01.490
Alzheimer's Disease.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.364
Another CARTA member, Doc
Finch has written this.

00:13:04.364 --> 00:13:08.357
Commentary: is Alzheimer's
disease uniquely human?

00:13:08.357 --> 00:13:11.051
"That Alzheimer's disease may
be a human-specific disease

00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:13.565
"was hypothesized in 1989.

00:13:13.565 --> 00:13:17.061
"Apes accumulate considerable
amyloid plaques after 40,

00:13:17.061 --> 00:13:19.453
"an age at which these
are uncommon in humans.

00:13:19.453 --> 00:13:22.355
"Despite this early
plaque buildup, ape brains

00:13:22.355 --> 00:13:24.838
"have not shown dystrophic
neurites near plaques.

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:28.125
"Aging great ape brains
also have few tangles.

00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:30.799
"We cautiously support this hypothesis."

00:13:30.799 --> 00:13:33.640
And this is under further investigation.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.513
Carcinomas of epithelial origin.

00:13:36.513 --> 00:13:39.896
To date, of these few thousand
apes cared for in captivity,

00:13:39.896 --> 00:13:42.184
not a single case of
carcinoma of the esophagus,

00:13:42.184 --> 00:13:46.351
lung, stomach, pancreas, colon,
uterus, ovary or prostate.

00:13:46.351 --> 00:13:49.300
And so Nissi and I looked
into this and concluded that

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.793
while relative carcinoma
risk is a likely difference

00:13:51.793 --> 00:13:54.633
between humans and
chimpanzees and other apes,

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:58.054
a more systematic survey is needed.

00:13:58.054 --> 00:14:01.575
Of course, age is a factor,
not just environment.

00:14:01.575 --> 00:14:03.398
And so you'd say, well,
a lot of these diseases

00:14:03.398 --> 00:14:05.862
we're mentioning have to do with age.

00:14:05.862 --> 00:14:08.335
But in fact, chimpanzees
in captivity can live

00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:12.907
up to the age of 45, 50,
occasionally even up to 60.

00:14:12.907 --> 00:14:14.435
And so they are in the age range,

00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:16.518
if you're looking at the
rates of human cancer here

00:14:16.518 --> 00:14:18.878
in human males and females,
but you might expect

00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:21.655
to at least see a few carcinomas,

00:14:21.655 --> 00:14:24.245
a few heart attacks of the human kind

00:14:24.245 --> 00:14:27.309
and a few early cases of
Alzheimer's-like disease,

00:14:27.309 --> 00:14:29.016
but none have been seen.

00:14:29.016 --> 00:14:30.504
Possible examples.

00:14:30.504 --> 00:14:31.766
Another long list.

00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:34.634
And here we have what is
called absence of evidence,

00:14:34.634 --> 00:14:37.198
it's not evidence of absence.

00:14:37.198 --> 00:14:38.948
We really don't know.

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:44.342
But it's kinda interesting
that bronchial asthma,

00:14:46.378 --> 00:14:48.402
I've been looking for a
case of bronchial asthma

00:14:48.402 --> 00:14:53.050
in a great ape, or for
that matter, in a monkey,

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.135
and there's no papers about this,

00:14:55.135 --> 00:14:57.294
except the papers like this.

00:14:57.294 --> 00:14:59.929
Here's a paper about
the asthma-like syndrome

00:14:59.929 --> 00:15:02.053
in a single monkey that says

00:15:02.053 --> 00:15:04.884
"The present case is remarkable

00:15:04.884 --> 00:15:07.842
"in that there's a paucity of
reports of naturally occurring

00:15:07.842 --> 00:15:10.731
"allergy airway disease
in non-human primates."

00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:13.163
This could have to do with
the hygiene hypothesis.

00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:15.492
Other issues remains to be seen.

00:15:15.492 --> 00:15:18.786
Anyway, to conclude,
disease profiles of humans

00:15:18.786 --> 00:15:20.764
and chimpanzees are rather different,

00:15:20.764 --> 00:15:23.579
considering how
genetically similar we are.

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:27.636
Chimpanzees, contrary to the original idea

00:15:27.636 --> 00:15:30.515
of NIH and health
sciences, are poor models

00:15:30.515 --> 00:15:32.773
of many human disease,
and should not be used

00:15:32.773 --> 00:15:36.126
to model human diseases
very often, if at all.

00:15:36.126 --> 00:15:38.636
Humans, conversely, are
likely to be poor models

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:41.468
of many chimpanzee diseases.

00:15:41.468 --> 00:15:43.281
So there are huge ethical issues here.

00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:45.069
Chimpanzees are sentient beings.

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:46.611
I wouldn't do anything to a chimpanzee

00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:48.539
I wouldn't do it to a human,

00:15:48.539 --> 00:15:51.891
and with even greater
care than with humans.

00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:54.887
And back in 2005, Jim
More, Pascal Gagneuxa and I

00:15:54.887 --> 00:15:57.488
wrote this ethics paper.

00:15:57.488 --> 00:15:59.882
We suggested that we conduct
research on great apes

00:15:59.882 --> 00:16:01.806
following principles generally similar

00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:04.349
to those accepted for human research,

00:16:04.349 --> 00:16:06.272
and even suggested that the researchers

00:16:06.272 --> 00:16:08.905
should volunteer to be
subjects in the same studies.

00:16:08.905 --> 00:16:10.806
(audience laughing)

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:12.517
Since I wrote this, I keep getting these

00:16:12.517 --> 00:16:16.226
letters saying, "Please sign this document

00:16:16.226 --> 00:16:19.568
"banning all future
research on chimpanzees."

00:16:19.568 --> 00:16:21.228
And my answer is, "That's a terrible idea.

00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:24.984
"Would you ban all future
research on humans?"

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.685
But unfortunately, that's what's happened

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:29.792
for other reasons, really good reasons of

00:16:29.792 --> 00:16:32.600
getting chimpanzees out of
not-very-good facilities

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.955
and avoiding invasive research.

00:16:34.955 --> 00:16:37.521
Then I just threw up its hand on this,

00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:41.290
stopped all chimpanzee
research, practically speaking.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.643
And the question is, will the
ban on chimpanzee research

00:16:43.643 --> 00:16:46.798
actually do more harm
than good to both species?

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:50.325
And add to that a final corollary,
chimpanzees would benefit

00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:53.669
from more ethical studies
of their own diseases,

00:16:53.669 --> 00:16:55.366
and I'm hoping that we can still keep

00:16:55.366 --> 00:16:57.335
this area of research open because

00:16:57.335 --> 00:17:01.758
I think it's important for
both humans and chimpanzees

00:17:01.758 --> 00:17:03.993
and the diseases that we both get.

00:17:03.993 --> 00:17:05.186
Thank you.

00:17:05.186 --> 00:17:08.269
(mellow piano music)

00:17:11.969 --> 00:17:13.479
- One out of every four deaths

00:17:13.479 --> 00:17:15.493
basically in the US and the UK

00:17:15.493 --> 00:17:17.176
are from heart disease.

00:17:17.176 --> 00:17:19.527
So it's basically the number one killer,

00:17:19.527 --> 00:17:21.574
not just in the industrialized world,

00:17:21.574 --> 00:17:23.962
and a major source of cost

00:17:23.962 --> 00:17:25.966
burning our health care system,

00:17:25.966 --> 00:17:28.538
but also around the world,

00:17:28.538 --> 00:17:30.163
including in developing world,

00:17:30.163 --> 00:17:33.323
that heart disease and its
more insidious form of it,

00:17:33.323 --> 00:17:36.409
atherosclerosis, is the source of say,

00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:39.682
every three out of 10 deaths
around the world today.

00:17:39.682 --> 00:17:43.092
So it's so familiar to us
that the obvious question is

00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:48.073
well, is atherosclerosis
really a universal aspect

00:17:48.073 --> 00:17:49.626
of just human aging?

00:17:49.626 --> 00:17:51.344
It's sort of an inevitable aspect.

00:17:51.344 --> 00:17:53.113
By the time you're 20,
you probably already have

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:55.389
some of the fatty streaks
that will later go on

00:17:55.389 --> 00:17:57.836
to become more complicated lesions

00:17:57.836 --> 00:17:59.442
and create problems for us.

00:17:59.442 --> 00:18:00.563
Or is that not the case?

00:18:00.563 --> 00:18:05.009
And so, maybe atherosclerosis,
the process is universal

00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:07.967
but maybe it does or
does not always present

00:18:07.967 --> 00:18:11.344
clinical manifestations that
will affect our morbidity,

00:18:11.344 --> 00:18:13.064
and ultimately, mortality.

00:18:13.064 --> 00:18:15.429
So a standard kind of
story is that if we could

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:19.157
zoom back into the past and
look at hunter-gatherers,

00:18:19.157 --> 00:18:22.035
that hunter-gatherers
wouldn't have these types

00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:24.387
of heart disease, or
other types of problems,

00:18:24.387 --> 00:18:27.557
and that it's modern
features of our lifestyle

00:18:27.557 --> 00:18:29.908
that is making us ill,
that there's a mismatch

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:32.248
between our genetic adaptations

00:18:32.248 --> 00:18:35.139
and modern features of lifestyle.

00:18:35.139 --> 00:18:38.306
So changes in our nutrition, our diet,

00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:42.672
our physical activity, our
bad habits as Barbara said,

00:18:42.672 --> 00:18:46.148
like cigarette smoking
and alcohol consumption,

00:18:46.148 --> 00:18:48.619
that these are maybe
what create the problem,

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:50.384
and that hunter-gatherers
would have little

00:18:50.384 --> 00:18:53.112
or no coronary heart disease.

00:18:53.112 --> 00:18:55.658
And the evidence for this is often

00:18:55.658 --> 00:18:57.388
focused on some risk factors,

00:18:57.388 --> 00:19:01.471
so cholesterol, Type II
diabetes, low prevalence,

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:06.933
that their risk factors seem
to suggest a healthy heart.

00:19:06.933 --> 00:19:08.909
But there are some problems here is that

00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:10.576
we don't really know

00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.187
that in these types of populations

00:19:13.187 --> 00:19:15.804
that heart disease is fairly absent.

00:19:15.804 --> 00:19:18.427
First of all, the
numbers are fairly small.

00:19:18.427 --> 00:19:21.950
And often, there'd be a
medical team, like in the 1950s

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.928
or 60s that would sweep through a village,

00:19:23.928 --> 00:19:25.207
but fairly quickly.

00:19:25.207 --> 00:19:29.871
And so, it could be that
people who have heart disease

00:19:29.871 --> 00:19:31.755
died fairly quickly from it,

00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:34.254
and so unless you've spent
a long time in an area,

00:19:34.254 --> 00:19:36.471
you might not actually see the real cases

00:19:36.471 --> 00:19:38.999
if the case fatality rate is quite high.

00:19:38.999 --> 00:19:40.984
And it could be that,
you know, those people

00:19:40.984 --> 00:19:43.223
got weeded out of the population early.

00:19:43.223 --> 00:19:45.754
And so if you looked at
people over the age of 60,

00:19:45.754 --> 00:19:47.350
no one has heart disease maybe because

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.611
they died earlier on in life.

00:19:49.611 --> 00:19:52.470
But also, the assessment
is fairly indirect

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.209
as I mentioned, you know, it's easy

00:19:54.209 --> 00:19:57.142
to kind of take someone's blood pressure,

00:19:57.142 --> 00:19:59.139
to measure how much cholesterol they have,

00:19:59.139 --> 00:20:01.422
to measure their BMI, but it's much harder

00:20:01.422 --> 00:20:03.324
to get a direct assessment.

00:20:03.324 --> 00:20:04.987
And of course, if certain risk factors

00:20:04.987 --> 00:20:07.384
worked differently in
different human populations,

00:20:07.384 --> 00:20:09.624
then it might not be a
one-to-one relationship

00:20:09.624 --> 00:20:11.704
that the risk factors tell you about

00:20:11.704 --> 00:20:14.708
the actual underlying heart disease.

00:20:14.708 --> 00:20:17.452
And one good example from the 70s,

00:20:17.452 --> 00:20:20.356
was kind of became a
established fact almost

00:20:20.356 --> 00:20:24.172
that the Inuit up near the arctic north,

00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:26.295
and in Alaska and Greenland in particular,

00:20:26.295 --> 00:20:28.906
that they don't have atherosclerosis,

00:20:28.906 --> 00:20:30.346
and they don't have heart disease,

00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:33.191
and particularly their marine-rich diet

00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:35.875
and particularly omega-3s
was one good reason

00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:39.089
why despite a very meat-based diet,

00:20:39.089 --> 00:20:41.452
that they would not have heart disease.

00:20:41.452 --> 00:20:43.673
But it actually turns out there were some

00:20:43.673 --> 00:20:45.699
unreliable mortality statistics

00:20:45.699 --> 00:20:48.140
some of those earlier
inferences were based on

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.649
and further kind of x-ray
and ultrasound studies

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:51.828
actually show the opposite,

00:20:51.828 --> 00:20:54.929
that there is quite a decent
amount of atherosclerosis

00:20:54.929 --> 00:20:57.012
and that heart disease didn't
really look that different

00:20:57.012 --> 00:20:59.564
from near surrounding populations,

00:20:59.564 --> 00:21:02.061
and that stroke might even be higher.

00:21:02.061 --> 00:21:04.796
And also, more recent meta-analyses show

00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:08.193
no effect of omega-3 fish
oils on heart-related deaths,

00:21:08.193 --> 00:21:10.195
heart attacks and strokes.

00:21:10.195 --> 00:21:12.527
So the standard story is
actually a little bit different

00:21:12.527 --> 00:21:14.979
when you look into it in more detail.

00:21:14.979 --> 00:21:17.828
And also, the Horus group, which we'll see

00:21:17.828 --> 00:21:20.641
a little bit more further in the talk,

00:21:20.641 --> 00:21:23.963
looked at a unique sample of 137 mummies

00:21:23.963 --> 00:21:26.692
across four world regions, so

00:21:26.692 --> 00:21:28.600
ancient Egypt, ancient Peru,

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.044
the southwest of the US,
and the Aleutian Islands,

00:21:33.044 --> 00:21:36.071
and across 4,000 years of history,

00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:38.196
and he looked at different arterial beds

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:40.605
for evidence of calcification.

00:21:40.605 --> 00:21:43.688
So a more direct measure using CT scans,

00:21:43.688 --> 00:21:46.096
whole body CT scans of these mummies.

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:48.356
So for example, here you've got,

00:21:48.356 --> 00:21:52.134
these are both two Unangan
women from the Aleutian Islands,

00:21:52.134 --> 00:21:55.721
up here, is woman about
50, here a woman about 30,

00:21:55.721 --> 00:21:58.279
and you can see some
evidence of calcification

00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:01.710
in the aortic arch on top
and in the carotid artery

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.193
down here on the bottom.

00:22:03.193 --> 00:22:07.006
And what they found was
evidence of calcification

00:22:07.006 --> 00:22:09.090
across all arterial beds,

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:11.113
across all four populations.

00:22:11.113 --> 00:22:13.399
And so they argued that,

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:16.142
their conclusion was that
we found that heart disease

00:22:16.142 --> 00:22:19.068
is a serial killer that's
been stalking mankind

00:22:19.068 --> 00:22:20.736
for thousands of years.

00:22:20.736 --> 00:22:23.319
The presence of atherosclerosis
in pre-modern human beings

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:26.313
suggests that the disease
is an inherent component

00:22:26.313 --> 00:22:28.585
of human aging, and not characteristic

00:22:28.585 --> 00:22:31.261
of any specific diet or lifestyle.

00:22:31.261 --> 00:22:33.658
So now the paleo diet
people hated this, right,

00:22:33.658 --> 00:22:36.093
because they were basically
saying, "Look, it's all over,

00:22:36.093 --> 00:22:37.189
"it doesn't matter what you eat.

00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:39.902
"We find evidence of this everywhere."

00:22:39.902 --> 00:22:42.207
But of course, all the
mummies have been long dead

00:22:42.207 --> 00:22:44.377
so it's hard to know what
they actually died of

00:22:44.377 --> 00:22:46.074
and whether that atherosclerosis

00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:48.949
might have been relevant
to their daily lives.

00:22:48.949 --> 00:22:52.185
Now also, if we're riding
off of Adjit's talk,

00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:54.390
we now know that chimpanzees,

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.617
while the number one
cause of death in captives

00:22:57.617 --> 00:23:00.632
is heart attacks, it's not exactly coming

00:23:00.632 --> 00:23:04.382
from the same ideology
as human heart attacks

00:23:05.382 --> 00:23:06.843
That chimpanzees do not seem to have

00:23:06.843 --> 00:23:08.981
the same kind of atherosclerosis,

00:23:08.981 --> 00:23:11.298
coronary artery disease is rare,

00:23:11.298 --> 00:23:13.676
but the heart failure
instead is through this

00:23:13.676 --> 00:23:17.163
diffused interstitial myocardial fibrosis

00:23:17.163 --> 00:23:19.087
often triggered by arrythmias.

00:23:19.087 --> 00:23:22.083
You can see the diffused kind of

00:23:22.083 --> 00:23:25.703
fibrosis in the heart
tissue in chimpanzees,

00:23:25.703 --> 00:23:28.620
the kind of sub-endothelial plaques

00:23:29.563 --> 00:23:31.896
in the human interior lumen,

00:23:32.838 --> 00:23:34.297
that this is very different.

00:23:34.297 --> 00:23:36.795
And in captive chimpanzees,
despite the fact

00:23:36.795 --> 00:23:38.847
that they have higher cholesterol levels,

00:23:38.847 --> 00:23:42.763
they're homozygous for
alleles in the ApoE4

00:23:42.763 --> 00:23:46.843
that are higher risk of
atherosclerosis in humans

00:23:46.843 --> 00:23:48.647
and less physical activity,

00:23:48.647 --> 00:23:50.989
so quite remarkable difference.

00:23:50.989 --> 00:23:54.610
Now the standard kind
of evolutionary story

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.360
brought to us by some
evolutionary biologists

00:23:59.325 --> 00:24:01.937
in the critical foundational contributions

00:24:01.937 --> 00:24:04.770
Medawar as well as Holdane and Hamilton,

00:24:08.017 --> 00:24:09.804
that basically that the force of selection

00:24:09.804 --> 00:24:13.207
declines with age as
fertility is dropping,

00:24:13.207 --> 00:24:16.679
so the relative contributions
for future generations

00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:20.362
are declining, and so
you can have mutations

00:24:20.362 --> 00:24:22.955
that exert effects late
in life that might be

00:24:22.955 --> 00:24:26.830
somewhat blind to the
effects of natural selection,

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.246
especially if they have
beneficial effects early in life.

00:24:30.246 --> 00:24:33.756
So what that means is that
you've got deleterious effects

00:24:33.756 --> 00:24:36.557
that manifest, say, later in life,

00:24:36.557 --> 00:24:39.392
fall under the selection shadow.

00:24:39.392 --> 00:24:40.807
And it actually turns out

00:24:40.807 --> 00:24:42.945
when you actually look at the cases,

00:24:42.945 --> 00:24:45.806
this is from US data, the actual incidence

00:24:45.806 --> 00:24:48.823
of heart attacks and fail
coronary heart disease,

00:24:48.823 --> 00:24:52.990
that those cases do fall
into this selection shadow.

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:56.331
So one kind of knee-jerk
response is, well, maybe

00:24:56.331 --> 00:24:58.895
again, these things have
always been with us,

00:24:58.895 --> 00:25:01.053
but in hunter-gatherers, if you're not

00:25:01.053 --> 00:25:03.630
gonna live to this kind of age range,

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.971
then you're not gonna see
these types of ailments.

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:08.591
And so that might be the end of story,

00:25:08.591 --> 00:25:10.594
and that our longer
lives in modern society

00:25:10.594 --> 00:25:13.047
is why we see so much more of it today.

00:25:13.047 --> 00:25:14.722
But that doesn't really
seem to be the case.

00:25:14.722 --> 00:25:17.131
If we take some of the
best demographic data

00:25:17.131 --> 00:25:20.662
out there on hunter-gatherers
as kind of a key,

00:25:20.662 --> 00:25:22.453
obviously, living
hunter-gatherers are not the same

00:25:22.453 --> 00:25:26.492
as our ancestors, but it's
the closest thing we have

00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:29.413
to try to understand
what life and mortality

00:25:29.413 --> 00:25:32.883
might be like without
all the modern amenities.

00:25:32.883 --> 00:25:34.904
And so, in hunter-gatherers
where the average

00:25:34.904 --> 00:25:38.650
life expectancy at birth
is in the either high 20s

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.004
or low 30s, compared to what we're used to

00:25:41.004 --> 00:25:44.053
in the US and other first-world countries

00:25:44.053 --> 00:25:45.784
is a dramatic difference.

00:25:45.784 --> 00:25:47.360
But if you notice, this is the ratio

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.079
of the mortality in hunter-gatherers,

00:25:49.079 --> 00:25:53.041
say, the American mortality
and it's quite high,

00:25:53.041 --> 00:25:54.988
the difference, but most
of those differences

00:25:54.988 --> 00:25:56.517
are early in life.

00:25:56.517 --> 00:25:59.554
And that by the time
you get to, say age 15,

00:25:59.554 --> 00:26:02.155
the mortality difference
has dropped from, say 200,

00:26:02.155 --> 00:26:06.116
early in life to 14 times
higher in hunter-gatherers,

00:26:06.116 --> 00:26:09.109
to about age 40, seven times
higher in hunter-gatherers,

00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:11.054
and by age 60, that mortality difference

00:26:11.054 --> 00:26:14.045
is only three times higher.

00:26:14.045 --> 00:26:18.322
So if you live past this
early period of high mortality

00:26:18.322 --> 00:26:20.885
and you survived to age 15, the mortal age

00:26:20.885 --> 00:26:24.612
of adult death is actually
it ranges from 68 to 78

00:26:24.612 --> 00:26:27.403
in this hunter-gatherer populations.

00:26:27.403 --> 00:26:29.472
So it's not probably the case

00:26:29.472 --> 00:26:31.807
that the absence of older people

00:26:31.807 --> 00:26:34.353
is why we don't see
these types of problems

00:26:34.353 --> 00:26:37.145
presenting these kinds of populations.

00:26:37.145 --> 00:26:38.773
So I wanted to move beyond mortality

00:26:38.773 --> 00:26:40.255
and actually look at living bodies

00:26:40.255 --> 00:26:43.519
to see, well, okay, two
people actually have

00:26:43.519 --> 00:26:44.995
some more direct evidence.

00:26:44.995 --> 00:26:47.816
And so since I mentioned since 1999,

00:26:47.816 --> 00:26:51.782
we've been working in
central lowland Bolivia

00:26:51.782 --> 00:26:55.601
with the Tsimane, so again,
horticulturist population

00:26:55.601 --> 00:26:58.337
that share many similarities
with hunter-gatherers,

00:26:58.337 --> 00:26:59.687
their fertility is quite high,

00:26:59.687 --> 00:27:02.808
their fairly high pathogen load,

00:27:02.808 --> 00:27:04.968
most of their diet, not all their diet

00:27:04.968 --> 00:27:07.262
basically coming from the land, from fish,

00:27:07.262 --> 00:27:10.762
from their fields and also from wild game.

00:27:14.081 --> 00:27:15.623
Taking advantage of the French government

00:27:15.623 --> 00:27:18.206
donating a 16-slice CT scanner,

00:27:19.912 --> 00:27:24.079
just a mere 10 hours and
several days in a canoe away,

00:27:26.944 --> 00:27:29.699
we brought people to the CT scanner

00:27:29.699 --> 00:27:34.065
to get a more direct
measure of atherosclerosis

00:27:34.065 --> 00:27:38.295
through looking at coronary
arterial calcification

00:27:38.295 --> 00:27:40.545
based on thoracic CT scans.

00:27:45.003 --> 00:27:47.522
So using the exact same
methods for scoring

00:27:47.522 --> 00:27:51.189
as in US studies, what
we compared Americans

00:27:52.204 --> 00:27:54.694
to the Tsimani, it actually turns out that

00:27:54.694 --> 00:27:57.163
well, the Tsimanis, these are here in red,

00:27:57.163 --> 00:28:00.719
there is evidence of
atherosclerosis, of calcification,

00:28:00.719 --> 00:28:05.061
but the levels are much lower
than what we see in the US.

00:28:05.061 --> 00:28:06.861
Now the mesa, this is
the multi-ethnic study

00:28:06.861 --> 00:28:08.258
of atherosclerosis.

00:28:08.258 --> 00:28:10.798
These are asymptomatic
people without heart disease

00:28:10.798 --> 00:28:13.494
or diabetes that are in the sample.

00:28:13.494 --> 00:28:17.330
So compared to those,
the percentage of people

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.100
with any calcification
is much, much lower.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.505
And in fact, the Tsimani reached a level

00:28:23.505 --> 00:28:28.289
that the Americans have, that's
a gap of over 20, 25 years.

00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:30.560
And so one easier way of thing about this

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.553
and this kind of obscure
calcification scoring

00:28:34.553 --> 00:28:36.859
is what's called the arterial age,

00:28:36.859 --> 00:28:39.658
and this is basically what age,

00:28:39.658 --> 00:28:42.223
based on the CAC score you have,

00:28:42.223 --> 00:28:44.946
was that at the equivalent
of someone in the MACE study.

00:28:44.946 --> 00:28:48.613
And compared to what you would expect

00:28:48.613 --> 00:28:51.044
based on just the calcification score,

00:28:51.044 --> 00:28:53.508
that the Tsimanis show
evidence that basically

00:28:53.508 --> 00:28:56.782
estimated arterial ages, that are about

00:28:56.782 --> 00:29:00.949
20, 25 years younger than
their chronological age.

00:29:02.069 --> 00:29:04.331
But the great thing about
working with living people,

00:29:04.331 --> 00:29:06.132
if the story ended there, we might say,

00:29:06.132 --> 00:29:08.041
well, look, just like we
found with the mummies,

00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:10.145
there's atherosclerosis in the Tsimani.

00:29:10.145 --> 00:29:12.859
But here at the clinical
findings really suggest

00:29:12.859 --> 00:29:15.952
minimum manifestations of atherosclerosis.

00:29:15.952 --> 00:29:19.799
So over the past decade,
we found minimal obesity,

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:22.308
hypertension, cigarette smoking,

00:29:22.308 --> 00:29:25.761
moderate-high physical activity,

00:29:25.761 --> 00:29:27.768
low cholesterol levels,

00:29:27.768 --> 00:29:32.336
low your bad, your low density
lipoprotein cholesterol,

00:29:32.336 --> 00:29:35.711
low blood glucose, so all the risk factors

00:29:35.711 --> 00:29:37.294
are fairly minimal.

00:29:38.414 --> 00:29:40.705
And then if we actually
look based on EKGs,

00:29:40.705 --> 00:29:43.595
if we look for evidence of past infarcts,

00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:47.762
over 1,100 EKGs, we've
looked at people 40 and up,

00:29:49.512 --> 00:29:52.047
maybe one case of an infarct

00:29:52.047 --> 00:29:54.517
looked at by our team of cardiologists.

00:29:54.517 --> 00:29:58.020
And even that, a couple
of the cardiologists

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.171
think it's dubious.

00:30:00.171 --> 00:30:03.062
And also based on other evidence with EKGs

00:30:03.062 --> 00:30:05.145
and also with ultrasound,

00:30:06.245 --> 00:30:10.429
evidence of preserved systolic
and diastolic function.

00:30:10.429 --> 00:30:12.829
And it's not the case
that the young people

00:30:12.829 --> 00:30:14.769
that have these conditions,

00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:17.442
then are dying at early ages,

00:30:17.442 --> 00:30:20.473
or that these people have
high case fatality rates,

00:30:20.473 --> 00:30:23.941
so based on verbal autopsies,
over the past 15 years,

00:30:23.941 --> 00:30:26.005
we don't see very much evidence at all,

00:30:26.005 --> 00:30:26.977
in fact, like maybe one case of someone

00:30:26.977 --> 00:30:29.059
who may have died of a heart attack.

00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:30.641
So there really doesn't
seem like there's evidence

00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:32.711
of mortality selection that is explaining

00:30:32.711 --> 00:30:34.388
these differences away.

00:30:34.388 --> 00:30:35.721
Now this is in spite of the fact,

00:30:35.721 --> 00:30:37.813
you know they have some protective factors

00:30:37.813 --> 00:30:41.235
but they also have very
high levels of inflammation.

00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:43.849
And you know, in the past 20 years or so,

00:30:43.849 --> 00:30:47.216
it's well-known that inflammation
is a major risk factor.

00:30:47.216 --> 00:30:48.847
In fact, it is a
fundamental to the process

00:30:48.847 --> 00:30:51.000
of what we know about atherosclerosis,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.174
and by a number of biomarkers,
CE reactive protein is one

00:30:55.174 --> 00:30:56.759
many of you might be familiar with because

00:30:56.759 --> 00:31:00.135
you often get it done
by your own clinician.

00:31:00.135 --> 00:31:02.326
They have very high levels
and cumulative levels

00:31:02.326 --> 00:31:05.043
over their life course, levels that would

00:31:05.043 --> 00:31:07.566
basically associate with
having heart disease

00:31:07.566 --> 00:31:09.066
amongst ourselves.

00:31:10.116 --> 00:31:11.626
And they also have low levels of

00:31:11.626 --> 00:31:15.793
the high-density lipoproteins
or good cholesterol.

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:21.042
So a few take-home messages
for a larger biomedical field.

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:26.570
First of all, it doesn't seem
like the inflammation story

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.564
is very complete, that the
same kind of risk factor

00:31:29.564 --> 00:31:32.938
might not exert the same
types of effects everywhere.

00:31:32.938 --> 00:31:34.670
I mean, probably would not have known that

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.528
if we didn't look at populations that are

00:31:38.528 --> 00:31:40.974
I guess as Katie brought up,

00:31:40.974 --> 00:31:43.352
looking at non-weird populations,

00:31:43.352 --> 00:31:45.549
and particularly
populations that experience

00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:48.688
lots of infection and have very different

00:31:48.688 --> 00:31:51.208
kind of lifestyle than we have.

00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:52.702
And in fact, not only do they have

00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:54.327
high levels of inflammation,

00:31:54.327 --> 00:31:57.059
but biomarkers of inflammation
are either unrelated

00:31:57.059 --> 00:32:01.163
or in some ways oppositely
associated with our measures

00:32:01.163 --> 00:32:05.281
of arterial calcification
and other indicators

00:32:05.281 --> 00:32:07.092
of atherosclerosis.

00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:10.731
And it could be that
inflammation that we experience

00:32:10.731 --> 00:32:13.779
from cigarette smoking, from obesity,

00:32:13.779 --> 00:32:15.526
the so-called sterile inflammation

00:32:15.526 --> 00:32:18.038
might have different
effects than inflammation

00:32:18.038 --> 00:32:19.787
that is induced under the conditions

00:32:19.787 --> 00:32:21.436
more representative of the past

00:32:21.436 --> 00:32:24.251
which would be more from infection.

00:32:24.251 --> 00:32:26.437
But also, there are other
types of infections,

00:32:26.437 --> 00:32:30.231
particularly helminths,
these are intestinal worms,

00:32:30.231 --> 00:32:33.040
our old friends that we've carried with us

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.007
for long, long periods of
our evolutionary history,

00:32:36.007 --> 00:32:38.785
that they exert regulatory
effects on the immune system

00:32:38.785 --> 00:32:43.296
and also anti-inflammatory
effects that might perhaps

00:32:43.296 --> 00:32:45.939
protect against the
otherwise destructive effects

00:32:45.939 --> 00:32:47.272
of inflammation.

00:32:48.935 --> 00:32:50.854
And the other take-home is that

00:32:50.854 --> 00:32:54.560
what we consider average
might not be really normal.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.727
So James O'Keefe, a physician
back in the early 2000s,

00:32:59.587 --> 00:33:02.504
argued the case based on randomized

00:33:03.547 --> 00:33:06.572
placebo-controlled studies with statins

00:33:06.572 --> 00:33:10.191
that if you look at
the chronic LDL levels,

00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:12.233
and you looked at a whole bunch of things,

00:33:12.233 --> 00:33:14.265
this is just the decrease over time

00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:18.432
in the lumenal diameter, so
the interior of the artery,

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:22.950
but you gotta change
the Y axis and make it

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:26.008
heart attacks and other cardiac events,

00:33:26.008 --> 00:33:27.656
that when you actually looked at

00:33:27.656 --> 00:33:29.960
how the occurrence of these things

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.446
in relation to the chronic LDL levels,

00:33:32.446 --> 00:33:34.656
it seemed to be a somewhat
linear relationship

00:33:34.656 --> 00:33:37.630
to the point where if you draw the line,

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.624
that you would expect
to almost zero events.

00:33:40.624 --> 00:33:43.336
In this particular graph,
it would mean basically

00:33:43.336 --> 00:33:46.332
a slowing of atherosclerosis
to the point of stopping

00:33:46.332 --> 00:33:50.074
at a level of about 70
or just less than 70,

00:33:50.074 --> 00:33:52.346
and so they were arguing
in a series of papers

00:33:52.346 --> 00:33:56.513
that the optimal LDL should
be something between 50 to 70,

00:33:57.364 --> 00:34:01.288
whereas your typical recommendations,
at least up until 2013

00:34:01.288 --> 00:34:05.038
when the statin-based
recommendations changed

00:34:06.606 --> 00:34:08.367
so that we're not reaching a target level.

00:34:08.367 --> 00:34:11.624
But it used to be that
a hundred was a level.

00:34:11.624 --> 00:34:13.301
But it actually turns out
there's a decent amount

00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:17.614
of heart attacks in the
region between 70 to 100.

00:34:17.614 --> 00:34:19.273
And this is just from the Tsimane,

00:34:19.273 --> 00:34:20.801
but if we looked at other populations

00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:22.320
it would be a similar case.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.983
The distribution of the
LDL here in the Tsimane

00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:29.370
compared to Americans, and
it might be a little hard,

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:33.260
sorry, to see the numbers, but
the mode in the average there

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.757
is about 70 for the Tsimane,

00:34:35.757 --> 00:34:40.314
whereas about 85% of Americans
have LDL higher than that.

00:34:40.314 --> 00:34:44.998
And that what's yellow there
is in that 70 to 100 region

00:34:44.998 --> 00:34:48.007
that basically many of
Americans would fall into,

00:34:48.007 --> 00:34:51.163
even if they were taking statins.

00:34:51.163 --> 00:34:55.246
So less than 70 is a
hunter-gatherer level of LDL

00:34:56.426 --> 00:34:59.508
that might be more extreme
but probably very difficult

00:34:59.508 --> 00:35:02.595
for us as omnivores to reach,

00:35:02.595 --> 00:35:06.500
unless perhaps you're taking statins.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.551
So just to summarize and conclude,

00:35:08.551 --> 00:35:10.867
atherosclerosis is present

00:35:10.867 --> 00:35:13.659
just like we observed in the mummies,

00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:17.068
but it's less pervasive
than we see in the West.

00:35:17.068 --> 00:35:19.326
So certain features of
cardiovascular aging

00:35:19.326 --> 00:35:20.485
may be universal.

00:35:20.485 --> 00:35:22.251
So you might see some calcifications

00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:26.475
and stiffening of the arteries,
there's some declines,

00:35:26.475 --> 00:35:30.460
they might be delayed in
systolic and diastolic function,

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.358
but they occur nonetheless.

00:35:32.358 --> 00:35:34.198
Yet the clinical manifestation,

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:37.301
so whether it's heart
attacks, hyper tension,

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:39.914
peripheral arterial disease, strokes,

00:35:39.914 --> 00:35:42.064
that those themselves
might not be universal,

00:35:42.064 --> 00:35:44.177
and were likely very rare throughout

00:35:44.177 --> 00:35:46.995
human evolutionary
history, despite the fact

00:35:46.995 --> 00:35:51.162
that we can observe
calcifications in these mummies.

00:35:52.072 --> 00:35:53.560
And also I think it behooves us

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.371
to revisit common risk factors.

00:35:55.371 --> 00:35:57.914
That inflammation might be high

00:35:57.914 --> 00:36:00.768
in hunter-gatherer populations,
but immune function

00:36:00.768 --> 00:36:04.567
might be better regulated in
a very different environment,

00:36:04.567 --> 00:36:08.734
particularly in presence of a
more diverse set of pathogens.

00:36:09.691 --> 00:36:11.951
And it also raises the
question of what is normal,

00:36:11.951 --> 00:36:14.853
what are the target levels
of different biomarkers

00:36:14.853 --> 00:36:17.256
like LDL that we should be reaching,

00:36:17.256 --> 00:36:18.533
what might they have been like

00:36:18.533 --> 00:36:21.563
over the course of evolutionary history.

00:36:21.563 --> 00:36:23.212
And to take advantage of the fact,

00:36:23.212 --> 00:36:26.035
if we hadn't looked at a
population like the Tsimane,

00:36:26.035 --> 00:36:27.687
these non weird populations,

00:36:27.687 --> 00:36:30.016
so we can actually learn quite a bit

00:36:30.016 --> 00:36:33.266
about our own health in, say, the U.S.,

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.205
by focusing on people that
are more likely to have

00:36:38.205 --> 00:36:42.612
certain types of infections
that could be cardio-protective.

00:36:42.612 --> 00:36:47.077
Even a lot of our standard
model organisms in the lab

00:36:47.077 --> 00:36:49.994
are infection-free, and so
there might some limitations

00:36:49.994 --> 00:36:51.675
of what can be gained.

00:36:51.675 --> 00:36:54.426
And also taking advantage of the fact,

00:36:54.426 --> 00:36:55.843
and the horror of the fact,

00:36:55.843 --> 00:36:58.250
that all indigenous
populations around the world

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.852
are in different states of flux,

00:37:00.852 --> 00:37:04.015
so it's a kind of quasi-natural laboratory

00:37:04.015 --> 00:37:07.794
for looking at the changes
in lifestyle and environment

00:37:07.794 --> 00:37:11.917
on how that shapes increases
in Type II diabetes risk

00:37:11.917 --> 00:37:13.757
and in heart disease.

00:37:13.757 --> 00:37:16.979
And so it's sort of untapped
territory that very,

00:37:16.979 --> 00:37:20.259
in fact I don't know any
biomedically-oriented folks

00:37:20.259 --> 00:37:24.311
that are working in these
populations to try to learn more

00:37:24.311 --> 00:37:27.501
about the underlying ideology.

00:37:27.501 --> 00:37:29.334
And so for the future,

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:32.704
one thing that a take-home message

00:37:32.704 --> 00:37:34.414
is if the story was just that

00:37:34.414 --> 00:37:38.164
"Look, exercise more,
eat well, don't smoke."

00:37:39.179 --> 00:37:40.012
We already knew.

00:37:40.012 --> 00:37:44.323
Those are your standard Framingham
Study kinda risk factors.

00:37:44.323 --> 00:37:47.125
And I think those do
make a big difference.

00:37:47.125 --> 00:37:49.616
But also, regulated immune function

00:37:49.616 --> 00:37:51.161
in the presence of certain parasites

00:37:51.161 --> 00:37:54.131
might also have some protective
aspects on their heart.

00:37:54.131 --> 00:37:55.886
And that maybe in the future we might see

00:37:55.886 --> 00:37:57.976
that the hygiene hypothesis,

00:37:57.976 --> 00:38:00.864
this idea that we're not exposed

00:38:00.864 --> 00:38:05.417
to the same type of critters
as we would have in the past,

00:38:05.417 --> 00:38:08.576
that not only helps explain
auto-immune type diseases

00:38:08.576 --> 00:38:12.378
currently, but also may be
extended to heart disease.

00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:15.535
Thank you very much for your time.

00:38:15.535 --> 00:38:18.618
(mellow piano music)

00:38:22.807 --> 00:38:26.066
- So I will discuss today
the relation between

00:38:26.066 --> 00:38:30.958
inflammation and metabolism
and metabolic homeostasis

00:38:30.958 --> 00:38:32.458
and diseases susceptibility.

00:38:34.357 --> 00:38:37.749
Inflammation is a protective response

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:40.146
to a variety of challenges
that we may experience,

00:38:40.146 --> 00:38:42.100
including infection and injury

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.841
and various types of tissue
stress and malfunctions

00:38:45.841 --> 00:38:47.913
and all the things that can go wrong.

00:38:47.913 --> 00:38:50.171
All of them can induce
an inflammatory response

00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:52.504
that meant to be protective.

00:38:53.411 --> 00:38:57.108
And depending on the type of
challenge that we experience,

00:38:57.108 --> 00:38:59.957
there's different physiological
or intended purpose

00:38:59.957 --> 00:39:04.266
of the responses, such as
host defense from infection,

00:39:04.266 --> 00:39:07.035
tissue repair response or restoration

00:39:07.035 --> 00:39:09.564
of a normal state of the tissues.

00:39:09.564 --> 00:39:12.545
And what is very interesting
about inflammation

00:39:12.545 --> 00:39:15.587
and very clinically important is that

00:39:15.587 --> 00:39:17.628
all these different
pathways to inflammation

00:39:17.628 --> 00:39:21.982
can result in a variety
of pathological sequel,

00:39:21.982 --> 00:39:24.552
including auto-immune diseases, sepsis,

00:39:24.552 --> 00:39:27.009
fibrotic diseases, tumor growth,

00:39:27.009 --> 00:39:29.500
and a variety of diseases for homeostasis

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.347
that are becoming more and more common

00:39:31.347 --> 00:39:33.558
in modern lifestyles.

00:39:33.558 --> 00:39:37.113
To give a very, very simplified
summary of inflammation

00:39:37.113 --> 00:39:38.929
of inflammatory pathway.

00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:40.537
When inducers of inflammation

00:39:40.537 --> 00:39:44.205
such as pathogens or tissue
damage are encountered,

00:39:44.205 --> 00:39:46.550
cells in our bodies, such as macrophages

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.983
and epithelial cells and so on

00:39:47.983 --> 00:39:50.835
detect these inducers and produce various

00:39:50.835 --> 00:39:53.841
inflammatory mediators,
including cytokines

00:39:53.841 --> 00:39:56.372
that some of them were mentioned already.

00:39:56.372 --> 00:39:57.451
And what these mediators do,

00:39:57.451 --> 00:40:01.331
they act on practically
every tissue in the body

00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:03.884
and they change some
functional characteristics

00:40:03.884 --> 00:40:07.134
that intend to either cause elimination

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:09.962
of whatever caused inflammation,

00:40:09.962 --> 00:40:13.667
or adaptation to the
presence of these conditions.

00:40:13.667 --> 00:40:18.630
And why inflammation is so
broadly associated with diseases,

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:22.843
very symbolically, it
could be summarized here.

00:40:22.843 --> 00:40:26.542
So for every trait,
including defense traits,

00:40:26.542 --> 00:40:30.249
there are benefits and costs for defenses.

00:40:30.249 --> 00:40:33.003
The cost are particularly pronounced.

00:40:33.003 --> 00:40:35.518
And the traits would
be evolutionary stable

00:40:35.518 --> 00:40:39.018
if the benefits are higher than the costs.

00:40:40.719 --> 00:40:43.535
And anything in this
green part of the triangle

00:40:43.535 --> 00:40:47.568
would be therefore potentially
evolutionary stable

00:40:47.568 --> 00:40:50.320
and everything here would be unstable.

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.162
And the problem is that,
in the case of traits

00:40:54.162 --> 00:40:58.329
that can provide very high
benefits such as survival,

00:40:59.269 --> 00:41:01.829
the acceptable cost can also be very high.

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:04.389
And that leads to this type of picture

00:41:04.389 --> 00:41:07.472
where the part of this upper triangle

00:41:08.869 --> 00:41:10.583
that's on the right side

00:41:10.583 --> 00:41:13.138
where benefit can still outweigh the cost

00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:15.856
but in terms of the
absolute value of the cost,

00:41:15.856 --> 00:41:18.278
this would be already, from
the patient perspective

00:41:18.278 --> 00:41:19.752
at least, and the doctor's perspective,

00:41:19.752 --> 00:41:23.159
this would be already in the disease zone.

00:41:23.159 --> 00:41:26.845
This would be conditions
that we would experience as

00:41:26.845 --> 00:41:29.619
something that is
definitely not well being

00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:32.571
and doctors would diagnose
as being various types

00:41:32.571 --> 00:41:35.891
of pathological or disease
conditions even though

00:41:35.891 --> 00:41:39.724
they still provide more
benefit than the cost.

00:41:41.717 --> 00:41:45.016
And what we're interested
in is in the biology

00:41:45.016 --> 00:41:49.856
of this upper right corner,
where the high benefits

00:41:49.856 --> 00:41:53.538
associated with very high
cost and where we basically

00:41:53.538 --> 00:41:57.450
on the edge of the chaos or transition

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:01.617
into the pathological states
that can be potentially lethal.

00:42:03.508 --> 00:42:06.557
And this type of biology deals with

00:42:06.557 --> 00:42:08.973
not just common conditions,

00:42:08.973 --> 00:42:12.948
like mild infections or mild anomalies,

00:42:12.948 --> 00:42:17.129
but it has to do with,
essentially biology of survival.

00:42:17.129 --> 00:42:20.863
What are the kinds of
mechanisms that are employed

00:42:20.863 --> 00:42:25.030
by our system, by our
organism in order to survive

00:42:26.046 --> 00:42:27.759
critical conditions?

00:42:27.759 --> 00:42:31.373
The ones the are just
one step away from death.

00:42:31.373 --> 00:42:33.832
And this is just in a very schematic way

00:42:33.832 --> 00:42:38.737
summarized here, so if we
consider this type of disease tree

00:42:38.737 --> 00:42:41.671
there're many conditions that we can

00:42:41.671 --> 00:42:43.674
one step away from health

00:42:43.674 --> 00:42:46.591
this various common mild illnesses,

00:42:47.501 --> 00:42:50.827
this has conditions that make you go

00:42:50.827 --> 00:42:53.353
to see a primary care physician.

00:42:53.353 --> 00:42:55.423
If there're complications
of this conditions

00:42:55.423 --> 00:42:58.528
you get referred to some
internal medicine specialist.

00:42:58.528 --> 00:43:01.511
These are more complex diseases,

00:43:01.511 --> 00:43:03.930
but you can still recover
and go back to health.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:07.473
And in severe cases you can get into this

00:43:07.473 --> 00:43:11.223
critical illness state
when you get into ICU.

00:43:12.469 --> 00:43:14.075
And you still can recover from here,

00:43:14.075 --> 00:43:16.492
and in this critical illness state,

00:43:16.492 --> 00:43:20.551
which is conditions like
sepsis, pneumonia, heart attack,

00:43:20.551 --> 00:43:22.653
brain damage and so forth.

00:43:22.653 --> 00:43:26.820
In these conditions you are
one step away from this tree

00:43:27.676 --> 00:43:31.188
proximal mechanisms that
lead directly to death.

00:43:31.188 --> 00:43:32.660
And these are points of no return,

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:35.742
which is respiratory failure,
cardiovascular failure,

00:43:35.742 --> 00:43:39.220
or damage to the brain areas
that control respiration

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.885
and cardiovascular function.

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:43.539
So we're interested in what happens here,

00:43:43.539 --> 00:43:45.992
what kind of mechanisms may be evolved

00:43:45.992 --> 00:43:49.805
to prevent this transition
into this point of no return.

00:43:49.805 --> 00:43:52.035
The case I will discuss today has to do

00:43:52.035 --> 00:43:55.902
with this very enigmatic
and very interesting

00:43:55.902 --> 00:43:58.096
and familiar to everyone,

00:43:58.096 --> 00:44:01.055
set of conditions known
as sickness behaviors.

00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:02.991
This is something everybody
in this room experience

00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:06.919
when you have flu or any
other type of severe infection

00:44:06.919 --> 00:44:10.137
or other types of acute
illness, we all experience

00:44:10.137 --> 00:44:14.084
this set of conditions
such as loss of appetite,

00:44:14.084 --> 00:44:17.424
social withdrawal, fatigue, sleepiness

00:44:17.424 --> 00:44:18.441
and so on and so forth.

00:44:18.441 --> 00:44:21.117
So these are all stereotypic conditions

00:44:21.117 --> 00:44:23.244
that are associated with acute illness,

00:44:23.244 --> 00:44:25.730
most commonly with acute infections.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.680
So flue symptoms would
all be in that category.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.580
And the biology of sickness behavior

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.197
has not been really well-understood,

00:44:34.197 --> 00:44:37.040
although there were early
studies that demonstrated

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.258
that sickness behavior
is not just a consequence

00:44:40.258 --> 00:44:43.928
of system being destroyed by a pathogen,

00:44:43.928 --> 00:44:46.063
but rather these are motivated behaviors,

00:44:46.063 --> 00:44:48.489
in other words they are
intended by the organism

00:44:48.489 --> 00:44:49.682
for some reason.

00:44:49.682 --> 00:44:51.482
And there's been many speculations

00:44:51.482 --> 00:44:54.972
that whether there is
aspects of sickness behavior,

00:44:54.972 --> 00:44:58.897
perhaps held the immune
system to fight infection

00:44:58.897 --> 00:45:01.569
or maybe there's some other
way that they may contribute

00:45:01.569 --> 00:45:04.069
to dealing with acute illness.

00:45:06.526 --> 00:45:09.042
So we were interested in investigating

00:45:09.042 --> 00:45:12.245
aspects of acute illness,
including loss of appetite

00:45:12.245 --> 00:45:15.868
and change in sleeping patterns,
and how they may contribute

00:45:15.868 --> 00:45:18.618
to survival of the acute illness.

00:45:20.594 --> 00:45:24.830
So there are two ways we
can survive an infection

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:27.464
or any other challenge for that matter.

00:45:27.464 --> 00:45:30.287
We can either resist it, so
in the case of infection,

00:45:30.287 --> 00:45:32.523
normally where we would be in this state,

00:45:32.523 --> 00:45:35.606
where we're healthy and there's a low

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.126
or a negligible pathogen load,

00:45:40.126 --> 00:45:43.849
and as we get infected
and pathogen expand,

00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:47.900
we can become ill as
indicated by this position,

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.899
and from here, we can
either go back to health

00:45:49.899 --> 00:45:52.214
by getting rid of
pathogen, which is the role

00:45:52.214 --> 00:45:55.532
of the immune system,
and this is referred to

00:45:55.532 --> 00:45:57.996
a resistance to disease,

00:45:57.996 --> 00:46:01.851
or we can adapt to the
presence of the pathogen

00:46:01.851 --> 00:46:06.122
and go back to the healthy
state despite microbial load.

00:46:06.122 --> 00:46:09.320
And this would be referred
to as increased tolerance

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.141
to infection or tolerance to damage.

00:46:12.141 --> 00:46:14.671
There are two ways that
pathogens cause damage.

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:18.689
One is directly through tissue
destruction through toxins,

00:46:18.689 --> 00:46:20.868
viral infections and so forth.

00:46:20.868 --> 00:46:24.590
And the second more common
way that pathogens infections

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:28.673
call illness is due to
damage by the inflammation

00:46:29.688 --> 00:46:31.809
caused by infection.

00:46:31.809 --> 00:46:34.649
And so we were interested in figuring out

00:46:34.649 --> 00:46:38.151
whether sickness behaviors
provide benefit first of all,

00:46:38.151 --> 00:46:42.301
secondly whether they provide
benefit because they promote

00:46:42.301 --> 00:46:45.649
immune function and
resistance to infection,

00:46:45.649 --> 00:46:48.632
or whether they provide
benefit by promoting

00:46:48.632 --> 00:46:52.058
tissue protection and tolerance
to inflammatory damage

00:46:52.058 --> 00:46:55.126
or pathogen induced damage.

00:46:55.126 --> 00:46:59.036
Just like in humans and
mice or in any animals

00:46:59.036 --> 00:47:02.533
that've been studied all
the way back to insects,

00:47:02.533 --> 00:47:07.159
when they are ill with acute
infection, they stop eating,

00:47:07.159 --> 00:47:10.218
this is food consumption
in mice after they received

00:47:10.218 --> 00:47:12.973
a dose of listeria infection.

00:47:12.973 --> 00:47:15.889
This is common food
poisoning type of infection.

00:47:15.889 --> 00:47:19.060
They stop eating and until
they start clearing infection

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:22.380
and they start recovering and
then they start eating again.

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.180
But there's a very profound anorexia

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.605
associated with infection
as you can see here.

00:47:29.605 --> 00:47:33.386
So some studies done over
40 years ago actually found

00:47:33.386 --> 00:47:36.108
that in the model of listeria infection,

00:47:36.108 --> 00:47:39.734
if mice are force-fed
then mortality increases.

00:47:39.734 --> 00:47:42.254
And this is what we reproduce here.

00:47:42.254 --> 00:47:45.785
So this is showing survival
of mice that are given

00:47:45.785 --> 00:47:49.952
LD 50 dose of listeria, those
that kills half of mice,

00:47:50.795 --> 00:47:52.346
and this is what's shown here.

00:47:52.346 --> 00:47:55.077
And if they're force-fed
then all of them die.

00:47:55.077 --> 00:47:59.084
And they were fed just 20%
of daily caloric intake,

00:47:59.084 --> 00:48:00.636
so they're not really stuffed with food,

00:48:00.636 --> 00:48:01.998
they're just given a little bit of food

00:48:01.998 --> 00:48:03.121
and that kills them.

00:48:03.121 --> 00:48:04.404
And the food that we use is actually

00:48:04.404 --> 00:48:07.654
the same food that's used in ICU units.

00:48:09.422 --> 00:48:13.618
And then we ask what
component of food kills.

00:48:13.618 --> 00:48:16.618
So we gave them separately proteins,

00:48:19.095 --> 00:48:20.849
fat, and sugar.

00:48:20.849 --> 00:48:23.988
And it turns out that sugar
alone or glucose alone

00:48:23.988 --> 00:48:27.071
was sufficient to kill them,
whether it was given orally

00:48:27.071 --> 00:48:28.571
or intravenously.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.194
So just giving them a small dose of sugar,

00:48:32.194 --> 00:48:36.257
only 2% of normal daily
caloric intake of glucose,

00:48:36.257 --> 00:48:39.674
was sufficient to kill 100% of mice.

00:48:41.027 --> 00:48:45.234
Conversely, if we gave them
glucose inhibitor called 2DG,

00:48:45.234 --> 00:48:48.517
2-deoxyglucose, it's a
modified form of glucose

00:48:48.517 --> 00:48:52.377
that cannot be metabolized so
it blocks glucose utilization

00:48:52.377 --> 00:48:56.293
then 100% of mice would survive.

00:48:56.293 --> 00:49:00.837
And importantly, this was not
because the immune system was

00:49:00.837 --> 00:49:05.787
affected in its ability to treat
to get rid of the pathogen,

00:49:05.787 --> 00:49:08.838
and it's not because
there was high dose of

00:49:08.838 --> 00:49:10.329
higher magnitude of inflammation,

00:49:10.329 --> 00:49:12.096
because there were not different between

00:49:12.096 --> 00:49:15.751
mice given glucose or
not as you can see here.

00:49:15.751 --> 00:49:18.831
So this indicated that
mice survived or died

00:49:18.831 --> 00:49:19.955
from this manipulation

00:49:19.955 --> 00:49:24.208
because of the affect
on tissue protection,

00:49:24.208 --> 00:49:27.831
not on the immune function itself.

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.202
So then ask what would happen

00:49:29.202 --> 00:49:31.535
in the most severe condition, like sepsis.

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:36.083
Sepsis is the condition when
infection becomes systemic,

00:49:36.083 --> 00:49:37.359
when it gets into blood.

00:49:37.359 --> 00:49:39.794
In this case it's a bacterial
sepsis that's mimicked

00:49:39.794 --> 00:49:43.627
by giving mice this
component and a toxin LPS.

00:49:44.891 --> 00:49:49.471
And as you can see here, if
mice given LPS or septic mice,

00:49:49.471 --> 00:49:52.201
if they are given food, they die.

00:49:52.201 --> 00:49:53.471
Compared to a control,

00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:56.218
where they're just given saline solution.

00:49:56.218 --> 00:49:59.357
And importantly if
they're just given sugar,

00:49:59.357 --> 00:50:02.128
then they all drop dead.

00:50:02.128 --> 00:50:05.733
But most excitingly they're
just getting the simple drug

00:50:05.733 --> 00:50:08.069
that blocks glucose utilization,

00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:11.410
then 100% of them can
be rescued from sepsis.

00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:14.797
And sepsis is a really
terrible intractable condition

00:50:14.797 --> 00:50:18.964
that is still a very common
cause of death in ICUs.

00:50:21.142 --> 00:50:25.142
So again, the mortality
or protection from death

00:50:26.228 --> 00:50:28.203
in these manipulations was not dependent

00:50:28.203 --> 00:50:31.086
on the degree of
inflammation as shown here,

00:50:31.086 --> 00:50:35.928
was example of a couple
of inflammatory mediators.

00:50:35.928 --> 00:50:39.258
And again, indicating that it was due to

00:50:39.258 --> 00:50:42.925
increased tissue protection from damage

00:50:42.925 --> 00:50:45.427
caused by severe inflammation

00:50:45.427 --> 00:50:48.010
that is associated with sepsis.

00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:50.256
Then we asked what would happen

00:50:50.256 --> 00:50:53.141
in a different type of infection.

00:50:53.141 --> 00:50:55.088
So, so far I showed bacterial infection

00:50:55.088 --> 00:50:58.199
and bacterial sepsis, and
now we ask what would happen

00:50:58.199 --> 00:51:00.616
in influenza virus infection.

00:51:01.505 --> 00:51:05.672
So when mice are infected with
flu virus, again they undergo

00:51:06.548 --> 00:51:09.542
this period of anorexia
when they stop eating

00:51:09.542 --> 00:51:11.922
until they start recovering.

00:51:11.922 --> 00:51:16.247
And if they're force-fed,
to our great surprise,

00:51:16.247 --> 00:51:18.918
they actually survive better.

00:51:18.918 --> 00:51:23.085
So this is now giving almost
lethal dose of flu infection,

00:51:24.252 --> 00:51:28.583
most mice die, but when
they're given that food

00:51:28.583 --> 00:51:30.416
most of them survived.

00:51:31.499 --> 00:51:34.332
And also if they're given glucose

00:51:34.332 --> 00:51:36.820
that also provided partial protection,

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:40.388
and if they're given 2DG glucose inhibitor

00:51:40.388 --> 00:51:42.221
then all of them dropped dead.

00:51:42.221 --> 00:51:44.842
So it was exact opposite to what happened

00:51:44.842 --> 00:51:48.082
in bacterial infection
and bacterial sepsis.

00:51:48.082 --> 00:51:52.249
And again, the effect of glucose
was not due to its impact

00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:55.448
on inflammatory response.

00:51:55.448 --> 00:51:58.070
So in viral infections
it's a different type

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:00.292
of inflammatory response,
which is dominated

00:52:00.292 --> 00:52:04.745
by interference shown
here, they're the same.

00:52:04.745 --> 00:52:08.201
And those of burden of
the virus in the lungs

00:52:08.201 --> 00:52:10.013
was also the same, was not different.

00:52:10.013 --> 00:52:12.960
Again, suggesting the
effects are due to impact

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.460
on tolerance to tissue damage.

00:52:16.686 --> 00:52:20.182
And the data that I'm not gonna
show, but I summarized here,

00:52:20.182 --> 00:52:24.349
what we found is that death
from viral inflammation

00:52:25.303 --> 00:52:29.285
was associated with
decline in vital functions,

00:52:29.285 --> 00:52:32.329
like respiration, blood pressure, so on,

00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:33.950
suggesting that there was a failure

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:37.503
in autonomic control
centers in the brain stem.

00:52:37.503 --> 00:52:41.003
And if mice are given food or glucose,

00:52:41.003 --> 00:52:44.332
then these declines in autonomic
functions could be rescued,

00:52:44.332 --> 00:52:47.235
they're given 2DG, they're enhanced.

00:52:47.235 --> 00:52:50.363
In contrast, death from
bacterial sepsis was associated

00:52:50.363 --> 00:52:53.780
with neuronal damage in the mid-brain area

00:52:56.182 --> 00:53:00.508
and the death was immediately
proceeded by convulsions.

00:53:00.508 --> 00:53:03.100
And these were blocked by 2DG

00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:05.712
and they were enhanced by glucose.

00:53:05.712 --> 00:53:08.571
So we did PET scan analysis and found

00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:11.213
that glucose utilization under conditions

00:53:11.213 --> 00:53:13.794
of bacterial inflammation
versus viral inflammation

00:53:13.794 --> 00:53:14.748
was very different,

00:53:14.748 --> 00:53:18.391
and it segregated exactly
to this to this brain areas.

00:53:18.391 --> 00:53:19.977
Such that in viral inflammation

00:53:19.977 --> 00:53:22.738
it was primarily in brain stem,

00:53:22.738 --> 00:53:26.905
and in bacterial inflammation
it was in mid-brain area.

00:53:30.582 --> 00:53:35.172
The increased delivery
of glucose to this areas

00:53:35.172 --> 00:53:38.910
related to the impact of
glucose or glucose inhibitors

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:41.338
on the damage to these areas.

00:53:41.338 --> 00:53:44.051
And then we asked what does
the mechanism of damage

00:53:44.051 --> 00:53:45.381
and what's happening there.

00:53:45.381 --> 00:53:48.708
So I will just summarize
that part of the study.

00:53:48.708 --> 00:53:52.875
What we found was that in the
case of viral inflammation,

00:53:53.895 --> 00:53:56.932
what happens with cells that
are infected with a virus,

00:53:56.932 --> 00:53:58.724
one of the things that happens,

00:53:58.724 --> 00:54:01.781
there is particular type of
cellular stress response,

00:54:01.781 --> 00:54:05.820
known as unfolded protein
response, that has two branches.

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:09.375
One branch tries to adapt
to this stress condition

00:54:09.375 --> 00:54:11.929
and to resolve it, and if that fails,

00:54:11.929 --> 00:54:16.408
the second branch would kill
the cells, as a second option.

00:54:16.408 --> 00:54:20.075
And this death from this
response is mediated

00:54:20.075 --> 00:54:22.272
by this particular gene called CHOP,

00:54:22.272 --> 00:54:24.605
it's a transcription factor.

00:54:27.192 --> 00:54:31.905
And what is known is that glucose
deprivation can exacerbate

00:54:31.905 --> 00:54:36.595
in unfolded protein response,
this stress response pathway.

00:54:36.595 --> 00:54:39.442
And so we hypothesized
that that brain stem area,

00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:41.835
the neurons in the brain stem,

00:54:41.835 --> 00:54:44.752
for reasons that remain mysterious,

00:54:45.894 --> 00:54:49.573
underwent this excessive
unfold protein response stress

00:54:49.573 --> 00:54:53.740
that was ameliorated by
glucose and exacerbated by 2DG.

00:54:55.005 --> 00:54:58.586
And then we asked whether
this pathway of cell death

00:54:58.586 --> 00:55:01.970
or neuronal damage mediated
by this gene is involved.

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:05.783
And for that we asked whether
mice that have a mutation

00:55:05.783 --> 00:55:07.991
in this gene, whether
they would be rescued

00:55:07.991 --> 00:55:12.279
from the effect of such
inflammatory manipulation.

00:55:12.279 --> 00:55:15.436
And indeed what we found, if
we just look at this blue line,

00:55:15.436 --> 00:55:18.353
these are mice that have infection,

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:21.562
that have viral inflammation,

00:55:21.562 --> 00:55:23.575
and they'd given 2DG they all die,

00:55:23.575 --> 00:55:26.634
and if they don't have that gene CHOP,

00:55:26.634 --> 00:55:29.209
then they all survive.

00:55:29.209 --> 00:55:32.351
And so the mechanism here
is related to a blockade

00:55:32.351 --> 00:55:35.442
of this pathway for neuron dysfunction.

00:55:35.442 --> 00:55:39.609
And finally in the case of
sepsis or bacterial inflammation,

00:55:40.515 --> 00:55:44.845
fasting metabolism that
protected them from death

00:55:44.845 --> 00:55:49.064
was related to the switch
from normal fat metabolism

00:55:49.064 --> 00:55:53.138
to a fasted metabolism,
which there's a switch to

00:55:53.138 --> 00:55:56.706
fuels from glucose to
ketones, and that which was

00:55:56.706 --> 00:56:00.097
necessary for mice to survive sepsis.

00:56:00.097 --> 00:56:02.942
And this is shown here,
that giving glucose blocked

00:56:02.942 --> 00:56:07.507
transition to fasting metabolism
and deletion of the gene

00:56:07.507 --> 00:56:10.942
that is responsible for keone production,

00:56:10.942 --> 00:56:13.609
made mice susceptible to sepsis.

00:56:16.147 --> 00:56:18.916
As I mentioned immediately before death,

00:56:18.916 --> 00:56:21.493
mice had convulsion in sepsis.

00:56:21.493 --> 00:56:25.012
So what we did in this
final set of experiments,

00:56:25.012 --> 00:56:28.482
if we gave the mice anti-epileptic drug

00:56:28.482 --> 00:56:31.340
called valporic acid,
then we could rescue them

00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:34.923
from death even when
they're given glucose.

00:56:35.944 --> 00:56:38.755
And so that indicated that
the reason that that worked

00:56:38.755 --> 00:56:41.882
is because valporic acid, unlike
this other drug shown here,

00:56:41.882 --> 00:56:45.426
which is Keppra, which is
also anti-convulsion drug,

00:56:45.426 --> 00:56:48.348
valporic acid, one of its
mechanism is related to

00:56:48.348 --> 00:56:51.702
the effect through the same
effect that ketones have

00:56:51.702 --> 00:56:55.054
on a particular class
of enzymes in the cell.

00:56:55.054 --> 00:56:57.641
So I will summarize it here,

00:56:57.641 --> 00:57:00.532
that there are two
different pathways to death,

00:57:00.532 --> 00:57:03.869
and fasting metabolism
is protective in one case

00:57:03.869 --> 00:57:06.479
and detrimental in the other case.

00:57:06.479 --> 00:57:11.462
And the final, the implication
for human treatment in ICU

00:57:11.462 --> 00:57:13.862
is that all clinical trials done so far,

00:57:13.862 --> 00:57:18.029
with nutrient manipulation
in ICU units have been done

00:57:19.384 --> 00:57:22.760
on patients that have not been separated

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.919
based on cause of sepsis,
bacterial versus viral.

00:57:25.919 --> 00:57:29.045
And the results of the studies were mixed.

00:57:29.045 --> 00:57:31.192
And we think that it's because
they were not separated

00:57:31.192 --> 00:57:33.803
and they basically
cancelled each other out.

00:57:33.803 --> 00:57:36.920
So now we are planning to
conduct a clinical trial

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.867
where we'll separate them,
based on causes of sepsis.

00:57:40.867 --> 00:57:44.277
So this is the summary and
finally this work was done

00:57:44.277 --> 00:57:46.276
by three very talented
scientist in the lab,

00:57:46.276 --> 00:57:49.776
Harding Luan, Sarah Huen, and Andrew Wang.

00:57:51.339 --> 00:57:53.913
And we had help from
other colleagues at Yale,

00:57:53.913 --> 00:57:56.318
and thank you for your attention.
