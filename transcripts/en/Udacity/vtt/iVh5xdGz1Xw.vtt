00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.920
Let's examine our analysis so far.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.450
So when we left off, we had updated our model to add an offset so

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.700
that our guess is always 8,855.5 seconds.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.375
However, we've just done an information gain analysis to discover that

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:25.700
intertweet time is very strongly affected by tweet length and mention distance.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.400
Let's update our diagram in order to reflect that.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.410
Let's update our regression estimator to include the new features.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.640
In our new estimator, we're going to pay attention to, in addition to elapsed

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.030
time, the length of the previous tweet and the number of seconds

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.000
that has elapsed since Marco Arment or John Siracusa has mentioned this person.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.180
We're ready now to think about a model to implement this new

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.900
regression estimator.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.690
What kind of model should we use?

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.800
Well, let's think about it.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.220
We're trying to build a model that captures the relationship between intertweet

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.450
time, elapsed time since previous tweet, otherwise known as delta t,

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.130
the length of the previous tweet,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.410
and the amount of time that has passed since a close friend has mentioned him.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.780
Let's first consider the classical statistics way of looking at

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.979
the relationship between two random variables.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.740
That would be covariance.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.430
Specifically, let's go into IPython Notebook now and

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.340
examine the covariance between intertweet time and mention distance.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.510
So to evaluate covariance between intertweet time and the mention distance,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.450
we're going to use the linear regression model from the sklearn package.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.620
We're going to ask the question, essentially, what does linear regression think

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.750
the relationship is between intertweet time and mention distance?

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.790
So we fit the model.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.540
The coefficient of the model will give us our value for covariance.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.949
As you can see, the coefficient is quite low, 0.015.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.540
This is very strange, right?

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.920
Information gain and the two histogram plots that we looked at showed very

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.880
clearly that mention distance has quite a high impact on intertweet time.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.280
What's going on here?
