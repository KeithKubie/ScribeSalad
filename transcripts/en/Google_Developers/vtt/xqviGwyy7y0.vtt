00:00:02.688 --> 00:00:04.040
Hello.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.210
I'm here today to talk about
designing for a mobile mind.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.430
About great design for
a smartphone websites.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.840
So my name is Jenny Gove and
I'm a user experience researcher

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.440
at Google.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.640
Before we get into
our latest learnings

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.380
about how to design
great mobile websites,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.290
I want to tell you a story
about a missed opportunity.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.510
A mobile experience I
had just the other week.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.000
So, sometimes I
get the opportunity

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.130
to go and work in New York.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.710
And I really enjoy
this because I

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.240
can take advantage of all the
cultural opportunities there

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.470
are there and see some
shows or see some event.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.810
And when I was there
last time I decided

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.820
to go and see this great little
concert that I saw coming up.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.030
So in my hotel room, on my
laptop, I booked a ticket.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.130
And it was kind of this
venue which has small seats.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.010
It was nearly sold
out, but I managed

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.069
to get some tickets
on a small table that

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.760
has, like, three seats left.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.680
The next day at work I
was talking to a colleague

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.740
and she was at a loose
end for that evening.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.810
And so I suggested
she come along.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.280
And so I pulled out my mobile
phone and I pulled up the site.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.250
And because I work
on this stuff,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.900
I was pretty delighted to
see from this kind of venue,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.820
a really nice mobile
optimized site.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.170
So I pursued that and I
found a couple of buttons.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.970
One was for the venue,
to choose the best seats.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.520
And one was for me to
pick the seats myself.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.820
Which in this instance is
obviously what I wanted to do,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.300
since I wanted to choose
seats next to mine.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.550
So I clicked that button,
but nothing happened.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.880
There was a big white page.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.270
Very disappointing.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.350
And as I was fumbling around
the site, looking for what else

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.140
I could do to buy tickets, I was
looking for like a call button,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.310
maybe I could call the venue.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.280
But meanwhile my friend
sort of said, you know,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.860
don't worry about it, I'll
find something else to do.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.380
So, this was, you
know, such a shame

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.460
because it was such a missed
opportunity for this venue.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.360
I was about to purchase
tickets and I couldn't.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.980
The venue had done really well.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.970
They've done a lot of work or
mobile optimizing their site.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.660
But they haven't
done well enough.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.045
And I wanted to spend
my money and I couldn't.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:29.950
So effectively they were
throwing money away.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.800
So why are we talking
about this now at I/O 2014?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.520
Well, we know that there is
amazing smartphone growth.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.990
We heard just yesterday
in the keynote,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.850
some incredible stats .

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.060
Let's recap those stats that
Sundar started his keynote

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.420
with yesterday.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.080
So the industry shipped
over three million devices

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.620
last quarter.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.155
And they're on
track to ship well

00:02:56.155 --> 00:03:00.290
over a billion phones each year.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.370
The number of 30 day actives
for Android is over a billion.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.040
It's been doubling every year.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.390
And we have people checking
their phone 100 billion times

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.370
each day.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.860
So to put this in perspective
over the last few years,

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.730
the media have kind of
made comparisons for us.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.010
One of those ones
they made is, you

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.400
know there are more mobile
devices, and mobile device

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.290
subscriptions than there are
toothbrushes in the world.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.010
So these kind of stats put
it in perspective for us.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.900
Mobile growth is phenomenal.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.150
This very recent graph
shows a dramatic growth

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.710
in mobile usage of the
percentage of web usage.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.360
This is page views.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.495
Just from May last
year to May this year.

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:47.405
The growth is strong everywhere.

00:03:47.405 --> 00:03:49.800
And all this growth
is great, right,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.030
because using our devices is
always such a great experience,

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.790
right?

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.100
Just like this, just like
we see in the marketing.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.790
It's so easy, these people
don't have a care in the world.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.700
They're happy smiling people.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.140
They don't have
any frustrations.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.890
They don't have
frustrations while they're

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.430
trying to check out
on their mobile.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.770
All the type is legible.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.660
Well, as a user
experience researcher,

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.540
I spend my time
observing people's use

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.440
of phones and mobile websites.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.769
And in the last few years
I've heard a lot of things

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.019
like this, from
previous studies,

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.420
I've heard the mobile websites
feel like they're cut down.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.440
They're harder to navigate.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.876
They're sparser in features.

00:04:31.876 --> 00:04:37.840
They're smaller, poor in
design, and unfamiliar.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.270
So some of these things
have been true in the past.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.770
Sometimes companies have not
put all of their inventory

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.210
on mobile.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.770
And people are
confused because they

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.920
know they can purchase
these things from a company.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.930
Or they know that they can
get particular information

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.840
from a company.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.440
And they just can't
find it on mobile.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.440
People can be worried that
they might miss something.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.130
They often have a sense
of time urgency on mobile.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.150
So to get some more
context, here's

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.595
a participant quote
from a shopping studies

00:05:07.595 --> 00:05:10.390
that I ran, where one
of our participants

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.220
described shopping
for a birthday gift

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.180
on a mobile phone.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.510
And I'll quote her.

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.320
She said, "I was worried
I would miss something.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.310
I was worried about
screwing something up.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.810
And you know her birthday
was coming up quick."

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.432
So I think this really nicely
illustrates this quote.

00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:25.890
It illustrates that
people are just

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.760
trying to get stuff done when
they tend to mobile sites.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.866
So we want to fix the poor
experiences you've heard about.

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:34.490
And the good news is, we know it
can be done, because there are

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.610
some examples of really
great sites out there

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.570
that are engaging users.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.660
So we at Google have been pretty
vocal in the last few years

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.890
about the importance of
creating a great mobile site.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.230
But given those things
we've heard users saying

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.830
about mobile
experiences, we think

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.230
we need to do more
to help you make

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.150
those great mobile experiences.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.790
So we decided to put resources
into creating materials

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.810
and guidelines to help you.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.810
And there's compelling
evidence we should do so.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.280
If we look at some
case studies--

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.160
So the Huffington Post
redesigned their mobile site.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.600
And that work led to
great success for them.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.120
It resulted in 50% time
spent on their mobile device.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.310
37% more unique visitors.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.750
And they managed to reach
29% of all US mobile users.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.430
So, in a different vertical,
Plusnet's Telco, in the UK,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.010
they redesigned all their
sites through the creation

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.570
of responsive site.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.770
And they had a tenfold
increase in mobile conversion.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.610
And their time to
convert decreased 40%.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.460
One more example here.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.090
This is the Cancer.org, it's
the American Cancer Society.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.850
And they went mobile
and that resulted

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.800
in 250% increase in
mobile visits in one year.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.140
A three times increase
in mobile revenue,

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.830
that donations in the
case of Cancer.org.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.960
And they saw higher
rates of mobile access

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.790
to key areas of their site.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.950
And I love the quote that
came from the principle

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.610
of digital platforms
at Cancer.org.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.410
She said she wanted to
distribute Cancer.org

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.200
experiences as
widely as possible,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.710
to as broad an
audience as possible.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.930
And it was mission
imperative to mobilize

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.240
all the Cancer.org content.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.900
And I think why this
is so compelling

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.690
to me is because
this can go for,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.980
kind of, any company really.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.110
If you don't pay for your
mobile users on the web,

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.810
then you're missing a
bunch of your users.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.895
Mobile web can be a
gateway to your business.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.070
So we're focusing on this
now because mobile usage

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.690
is growing so rapidly.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.960
And because mobile provides an
increasingly important gateway

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.230
to your business.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.770
And we want to put
you in a position

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.670
where you can create a
better experience for users.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.230
We want to develop a better
ecosystem for the mobile web.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.910
And we want to tell you how
the designs of sites that

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.710
provide a really good
experience differ

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.620
from those that have
user experience flaws.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.540
And we want to do this on the
basis of data versus expert

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.690
opinion so that you can have
confidence in the information

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.600
that we give you.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.980
So I decided to run a study.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.440
I wrote a research plan.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.200
And then we teamed
up with AnswerLab,

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.950
which is a user
research company.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.780
And they have to scale.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.730
And they helped us to
really make this happen.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.510
And we examined how
a range of views

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.990
is interacted with a
diverse group of websites.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.200
So I'm going to tell you
briefly how we set up the study.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.190
We studied user interaction on
a 100 different mobile sites,

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.730
and these ranged from
really large retailers,

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:49.910
to service providers, and sites
that had information on them.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.170
We also included some
lesser known websites

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.500
that been growing
in recent years

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.090
to make sure we
weren't only capturing

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.400
what those big
companies were doing.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.630
Participants brought in their
own iOS or Android devices

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.960
so that they were
familiar with the phone.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.730
And this study focused
on smart phones.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.320
So there were 119 participants.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.420
And although those numbers
don't seem big by Google scale,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.580
this is the usability study,
so each participant came in

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.890
for a separate hour, so
that's 119 hours of the study.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.480
And so really, it was a
very large usability study.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.990
And participants worked through
tasks for each of these sites.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.380
The method we used was
traditional usability testing

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.960
with think aloud protocol.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.860
So they spoke aloud
as we had them

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.340
go through different
tasks on their sites.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.020
This provides us with
insight into understanding

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.170
the details of where there
were problems with sites

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.370
and where the experience
was really, kind of smooth

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.910
and seamless.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.430
And they also provided
ratings for the site.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.850
The result of this
large usability study

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.930
were collated to form 25
mobile web design principles.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.510
And these key
findings are intended

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.300
to help you build
better mobile sites,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.560
and increase engagement and
conversion for your business.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.420
So we've categorize
these into five sections.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:15.170
These are mobile homepage
and navigation, site search,

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:20.600
commerce and conversions,
optimizing form entry,

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.175
and site-wide design
considerations.

00:10:23.175 --> 00:10:25.330
So these principles
are all about

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.560
creating a better
experience for users,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.060
enabling them to have a trouble
free experience on your site,

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.990
whatever kind of site that
is, information, retail,

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.706
e-commerce, or lead generation.

00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:38.330
So we're going to
look at some examples

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.610
from these 25 principles.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.860
And we're going to talk
about the guidance based

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.430
off the study results.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.955
So let's start with mobile
homepage and site navigation.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.060
So the first and the
foremost important thing

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.080
to do for your
business is figure out

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.450
the primary purpose
that your site exists.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.470
In our study we
tested interfaces

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.580
similar to the one on the
left and the one on the right.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.342
When users got to
the one on the left

00:11:06.342 --> 00:11:07.980
they had a particular
task in mind,

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.390
but the only action
available to them

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.615
was for them to learn more.

00:11:12.615 --> 00:11:14.501
It was kind of vague
and they really

00:11:14.501 --> 00:11:16.000
didn't have the
confidence that they

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.610
were going to be able to get
to what they wanted to get to.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.880
In contrast, in the
Progressive site

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.590
on the right, lead
generation site,

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.520
they've made it really clear
that users can get a quote,

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.430
they can find a local agent,
they can make a payment.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:35.500
One women's magazine site that
we saw had buttons at the top.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.370
And they were labeled
specials and looks.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.880
These were very vague,
and participants really

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.470
didn't know what they would get.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.190
So mobile users really want
their information here and now.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.290
And figuring out what those
key calls to action are

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.190
is the primary thing
you need to do.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.280
Secondary content
and calls to action

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.850
can be accessed either
further down the screen

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:57.050
or behind the menu icon.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.970
The next thing is to keep
menu's short and sweet.

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.460
So we saw a number of
extensive menus on mobile,

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.710
and nobody is going to
scroll through them.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.680
But we kind of
analyzed the sites,

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.180
and we saw that
some sites have done

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.690
a really good job of moving
from desktop to mobile,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:20.220
and reconsidering their
menu structure for mobile.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:21.940
So Macy's does a
great job of this

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.906
if you take a look
at their site.

00:12:24.906 --> 00:12:28.180
Consider how you can present
the fewest menu items possible,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.910
but still keep those
categories really distinct.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:33.830
You can do some user testing
to help you with this.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.236
Do users understand the
different menu items

00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:37.610
you're offering,
and do they know

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:38.776
what would lie beneath them?

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.850
When mobile users navigate
through your site,

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.940
they want an easy way to
get back to your home page.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.930
For example, perhaps
they want to get back

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.220
to do another search,
or perhaps they

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.790
want to start a new browse
experience through your site.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.270
In this study the users
expected tapping the logo

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:02.180
on the top of the
page, on the left

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.330
to take them back
to the home page.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.240
And they became really
frustrated if it didn't work.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.290
So this is a really good example
of the principle in action.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.940
1-800-Flowers does
this well here.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.430
So let's summarize the
homepage takeaways.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.240
Keep calls to action
front and center.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.590
So, even if you're
developing a responsive site,

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:27.090
you need to think about how that
should be designed for mobile.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.610
Keep menu's short and sweet.

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.395
Make sure you're not having to
scroll a great deal on mobile

00:13:31.395 --> 00:13:34.400
through your menus, and
that they're distinct.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.441
And make it easy to get
back to the home page.

00:13:38.441 --> 00:13:40.440
Next we'll look at the
importance of mobile site

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:40.940
search.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.430
So along with the home page
that focuses on calls to action,

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.680
our study showed
just how important

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.010
it is to provide good,
clear search functionality.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:54.240
So the design on the
right here, is great.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.440
You can see when you do
your such immediately.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.140
There's a nice big search field.

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:03.530
Now, it might sound
surprising to me,

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.570
you know, like, Google says
search is important, you know,

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:08.120
wow.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.812
Well, I can tell
you that in our team

00:14:09.812 --> 00:14:11.520
we actually had quite
a bit of discussion

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.260
about this before we
actually ran this study.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.260
The thought being that, people
often find it difficult,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.690
so we heard, to type on mobile.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.990
So maybe navigation
is the primary thing

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.730
that we should be doing
on mobile devices.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.870
But we found search to
be really important.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.950
It's all to do with users
having that sense of urgency,

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.450
and wanting to get to their
content, sort of immediately.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:42.640
So we found that,
particularly in retail sites,

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.510
search is hugely important,
and on many other sites too.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:49.410
And often on other sites
when users couldn't

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.320
find that key call
to action-- I think

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.800
they're having a
football match next door.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.820
They will turn to search next.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.320
OK.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.220
So, often it's tempting to put
the site search behind an icon.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:09.160
We found that it was much
more noticeable and visible

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.390
to people when the site
search was an actual field,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.760
and people found it more
difficult to find search

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.860
behind an icon.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.870
And I feel like, you know,
if site's like Home Depot

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.220
and Macy's can do this well,
so can the rest of us probably.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.260
So to really scaffold
user's tasks,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.470
the search needs to be smart.

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.340
And signs of smart
search include

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.910
providing auto-complete
in the search field,

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.770
suggesting search
terms and filters,

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.510
correcting misspelling, and
providing related matches

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.040
and search results.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.260
So all of those things together
in providing great search

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.510
is about getting users to
the relevant results as soon

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.100
as possible.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:52.190
Now, the site search results
need to be relevant, of course.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.860
And this goes for search results
as well as auto-complete.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:59.020
So, you can see some
differences here.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.570
Too often we saw results
such as those on the left.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.590
In that example the
word kids is surfacing

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.340
lots of different
things, but things

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.830
are particularly useful
for people in a clothing

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:15.470
store in terms of logically
grouping the responses.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:18.990
On the right, Macy's
do a good job here.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.510
They lead you to different
categories of clothing.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:25.670
So kids sweaters, kids boots,
kids shoes, kids jeans.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.960
On other occasions, in the
search results themselves,

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.190
we saw lots of
irrelevant results.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.920
And people really
don't have the patience

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.480
to scroll through
multiple pages of results.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.210
If the first few
results aren't relevant,

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.751
they might leave
and go away and then

00:16:37.751 --> 00:16:39.840
you potentially lost that user.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.340
One way forward
with this might be

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.500
to consider using
Google's custom search

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.470
engine in your site.

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:49.420
So, filters go even
further to helping

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.180
users find the
results they need.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.700
In some cases in
our study we found

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.230
that even though
companies had gone

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.870
to the extent of making filters
available, unfortunately

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.370
they weren't discoverable.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.819
So, this is a mock-up as you
can see, on the left-hand side.

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:07.790
But it's an example
of an actual site

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.109
we found where people were
searching for clothing.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:15.030
And they had to scroll through
about six pages of results

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.180
in order to eventually find the
filters to narrow their search.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.810
And they had thousands
of search results.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.500
So this was really,
really painful.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.410
And we found lots of people
abandon this task in that case.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.490
Note that the user should
never inadvertently

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.150
be able to filter the results
to a null set, of course.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:37.380
But we did see
that in the study.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:39.260
As the user's use
controls, make sure

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.200
that you can do things
like provide them

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.590
with the number of results
that they're going to see.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.580
And that gives them
an idea of, you know,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.210
is this the kind of
results that I want to see?

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.810
If it's got 20 items, or
if it's got two items.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.760
Now another way to assist users
in narrowing the results to get

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.990
to what they want is in what
we call a guided approach.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.520
You can think of these are
kind of like, pre-filters,

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.695
or simple questions to
provide more of a guarantee

00:18:05.695 --> 00:18:09.590
to your users that the search
terms they eventually put in,

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:13.460
or the navigation they do
here will lead to the results

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.900
that they need.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.060
So in this example,
imagine you're

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:18.650
selling a limited
set of products,

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:22.160
like shoes, bags
and accessories.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.220
After asking the user which
of these their interested in,

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:28.220
you might upfront ask,
you know, whether they

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.090
want women's shoes, men's shoes.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:32.819
You might also ask the size.

00:18:32.819 --> 00:18:34.360
And then the user
knows they're going

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.770
to get perfectly
matched search results.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.462
And for you, you're making
your user more satisfied.

00:18:40.462 --> 00:18:41.920
The thing that
you're doing here is

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.990
you're pulling away a
lot of your content,

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.470
so that it doesn't sort
of infiltrate the things

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.010
that they want to look for.

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:51.240
I can give you a really
nice example of this in one

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.610
of the sites we studied.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.350
It was the fight
for providing care.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.040
It provides things like senior
care, after-school care,

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.387
and pet care.

00:18:59.387 --> 00:19:00.970
Now the last thing
that somebody wants

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:02.950
when they do a search
for senior care

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.670
is to find pet care in
their search results.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.630
And so they had a guided
approach like this.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.250
And it made sure that
whatever search they did,

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.455
they weren't going to end
up with after-school care

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:19.630
in their senior care, or
pet care in their senior.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.070
So a few questions up
front for some businesses

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.680
can really help ensure
that those users get

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.250
more relevant results
right off the bat.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:28.920
And it's particularly
useful if there's

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.920
one to three key
attributes that you

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.470
can ask upfront
to get them there.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.770
So let's look at the
take-aways for site search.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:39.150
Make site search visible.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.210
That nice, clear
field at the top.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.560
Ensure that the
results are relevant.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.200
Implement filters to
narrow those results.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.202
And guide users to
better search results

00:19:52.202 --> 00:19:54.035
if you're able to do
that with your content.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.040
There were a number of
ways that we discovered

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.110
the design of site can help
people towards confession

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:04.140
on mobile.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.050
People really want to
convert on their own terms,

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:07.770
very definitely.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.670
So we want sites to
work with people,

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:12.440
rather than work against people.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.990
And unfortunately
in the study we

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:16.870
saw quite a few examples
of sites themselves

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:21.150
being barriers to that
engagement and to that use.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.070
So, firstly, beware of making
enemies at registration gates.

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.980
Don't require custom account
registration upfront.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.245
And you'd be surprised at
the amount of this we saw.

00:20:32.245 --> 00:20:35.360
We understand that getting
access to customer information

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.670
and preferences can be really
integral to your business,

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.880
but don't ask for it too early.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.440
Many of the sites that
user's rated the lowest

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.720
were those where they were
forced to create an account

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.690
upfront in order to continue.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.120
Users want to explore
and browse content,

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.620
perhaps get some
of their tasks down

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.120
before they commit to providing
their personal information.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.030
And similarly, let users
check out as a guest.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:05.690
If you're enabling people
to purchase something,

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.440
or perhaps they can
send off for information

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.840
you want to aim for
that option to enable

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.590
users to check out as guests.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.940
This is because, in our study we
found that participants really

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.640
perceive the value of this.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.940
And it's because, while
they're doing their tasks,

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.180
they're thinking, I want
to purchase this thing,

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.890
or I want to get
this information.

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:30.360
I don't want to stop and have
to think of an email password,

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.870
or whether I want to connect
to my particular social network

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.230
to this account, and
whether that's OK.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.740
So, if you wait
until afterwards,

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.960
enable users to do
their tasks, then you

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.320
can also have
another opportunity

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.290
to ask them to register
and you can offer them

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.270
tangible benefits as
well, such as perhaps,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.560
tracking their order.

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.670
And remember you
don't want to negate

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:59.300
the benefits of
purchasing by having

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.610
a process that
isn't smooth here.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:06.180
All browsers allow the ability
to auto-complete in forms.

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.480
So make sure you
don't turn that off.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.730
Users really like the
benefit of auto-completing.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.950
So just let the browser
do it's job at that point.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.670
And there are other ways
to convert users too.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.450
And there you can
see the check-out.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.760
So, picking up
where you left off.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.220
Now, we've talked
about this quite

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:28.140
a lot at this
conference already.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.740
And providing users with
the opportunity to do that

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.430
was really helpful.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.590
Within this study itself,
we saw a number of users

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.040
want to pick up on
things later on.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.150
After all, in this
particular situation

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:42.580
they were in a usability
study, they often

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.300
found things they
wanted to see later.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.300
Now this can happen in
real life too, of course.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.760
Perhaps you want to look at
something on a bigger screen.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.310
Another goal.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.367
Perhaps you're distracted
at this moment,

00:22:56.367 --> 00:22:57.950
you have to do
something else, and you

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.280
want to just pick up
on this thing later.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.910
So we painfully
observed several users

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:06.150
copying and pasting
the URL, which

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.120
is really quite
hard to do mobile.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.540
Then going and opening their
email client, pasting it in.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.107
It was really, yeah, it
was really quite painful.

00:23:14.107 --> 00:23:15.690
And then, of course
you have the issue

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.680
that you might lose that
user because they've

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.940
kind of gone to
do something else.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.870
So the best practices we saw
here at this present time

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.380
is to offer users opportunities
within the site itself

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.170
to pick up where they
left off later on.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:35.120
So, I've seen opportunities
for people to pin things.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.640
I've seen opportunities
for people

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.900
to email within the site itself.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:41.550
You keep all that
within the site,

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.360
but they can email themselves.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.270
And obviously, postings on
various social networks.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.580
Often at the moment,
this is used for sharing,

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.920
but we saw a number
of examples of people

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.240
using this for themselves to
pick up where they left off,

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.300
for themselves at a
later point and time.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.350
And related to this,
you need to create

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:02.790
a consistent URL
structure on your site.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.930
So that when people
do share URL's

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.130
from their mobile or their
desktop they can use them.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.110
So on that note,
our recommendation

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:12.120
is to build a
responsive site that

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.630
enables that consistent
URL structure

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.780
rather than resorting
to an m dot site

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.640
where they have be redirected
for users between sites.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.580
And if anyone saw Paul
Lewis' talk today,

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.070
where we saw the hit that
redirect causes in terms

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.595
of time lag to load
that mobile page.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.800
So let's review the commerce
and conversion take-aways.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.280
So let users explore
before they commit.

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.540
You can always fill
that registration

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.040
in at a later point.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.190
Let users purchases
as a guest, and enable

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.360
users to pick up
where they left off.

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.060
Optimizing form entry.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.750
Forms, don't you love
filing in forms on mobile?

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.000
It can be really
painful, I know.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.190
And you know, it's arguably
the most painful thing

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.390
that you can do mobile.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:05.380
So let's look at a
few of these things.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.690
Now I should say before
I start, we actually

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:10.190
learn a lot of these
things on desktops.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.930
But somehow when we moved to
mobile we forgot a lot of them.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:17.450
So these are just often
general good design principles,

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.170
but they matter
even more on mobile.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.760
Yet that form on the left.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.270
Design a form that's efficient
for the user to fill in.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:30.250
And not overwhelming like
that one on the left.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:33.270
We saw more forms
than we'd have liked

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:37.080
to have seen in this study
that looked like that.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.366
One thing we found was, it's
really good to chunk the form.

00:25:41.366 --> 00:25:42.740
Again, this is a
principle that's

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.120
taken from our experience
with forms on the desktop.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.220
And it's helpful to make sure
that those chunks in the form,

00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.160
are of equal size,
and equal difficulty.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.810
So you can see
this example here.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.230
There's, I think five
different steps to this form.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.750
And the user on the
Progressive site

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:06.540
can easily see what they're
going to have to fill in.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:08.410
So make sure your
forms look more

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:11.490
like the one on the right--
Think about your site now.

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.560
Then the one on the left.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.550
Another useful way to streamline
the conversion experience

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.910
for users is to know and
use what already exists

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.160
in terms of information the
user has already provided.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.020
We found that auto-filling,
whenever possible,

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.880
was of huge benefit to users.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.800
It's a bit sad to
have to tell you this,

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.570
but when this happens, when
auto-complete and auto-filling

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:41.150
worked, the users were
surprised and delighted.

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.970
Of course it shouldn't be that
way, but that's the way it was.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.834
Because they're so used to
struggling through forms.

00:26:46.834 --> 00:26:48.750
So they would either
struggle through the form

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.850
or they'd abandon their task and
try to do it a different way.

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.780
So it's just
frustrating for users

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.040
to have to put it in twice.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.440
We've all been there,
it's kind of horrible.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.270
So for registered users,
remember and pre-fill

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:02.900
their preferences.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.450
For new users, offer
third party check out,

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.500
and sign-in services.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.460
One specific example is to check
that you don't require users

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.430
to, for example, enter
billing or shipping

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.800
information that has
already been entered,

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:21.050
that already exists in their
third party check out account.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.900
Now every tap counts on mobile.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.930
For submitting
information, users really

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.040
noticed and appreciated websites
that would automatically

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.010
present number pads
for entering zip codes,

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.690
using the contextual
keyboard in the right way.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.730
Or automatically
advance the number

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.510
fields as they entered them.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.860
It can be really painful
for users when that happens.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.090
So the experience that
people are left with

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:44.125
is a really poor one.

00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:47.100
And you know, two forms can
look very, very similar.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.110
We tested two pizza
delivery forms,

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:52.150
and they looked
incredibly similar.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.820
But the number of taps
it took on each form

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.340
was very different,
because one of them

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.230
wasn't doing things
like surfacing

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.600
this contextual keyboard.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:05.170
So seek out any
opportunities to eliminate

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.140
any wasted taps in your form.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.080
And here is some additional
information and technical help

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.990
that you can get on choosing
the best input type.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.817
And this is part of the
web fundamentals materials

00:28:17.817 --> 00:28:19.900
we've been talking a lot
about at this conference.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.340
So, good labeling
is really important.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.940
If forms aren't labeled
according to best practices,

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.670
and again users can get totally
blocked and they can't proceed.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:34.800
So, they can be labeled, of
course outside the field.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.080
And it's becoming more and
more popular to label them

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.510
inside the field, but just
be careful how you do it,

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:42.610
and make sure that if users
back out of that, then

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.490
the label becomes visible again.

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.250
Because we had a
user in our study

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.420
who was entering their email
address, and then they got

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.260
distracted, and then they
came back, and went back,

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.340
saw the word address,
but didn't see

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.890
that it was email
address and started

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:58.360
entering their home address.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.590
So this labeling needs
to be really clear.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.150
Now working with dates.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.800
The recommendation here is
to provide visual calendars

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.000
where you can.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.560
Because users often
need more context

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.530
when scheduling
appointments, and travel

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.950
dates, and things like that.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.740
Provide them with a calendar
because if they don't have one

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.240
they are often unable
to figure think

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.960
about what day of
the week it is.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.020
That's often the primary
information people need,

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:26.960
like, I'm going to
leave on a Friday.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.070
And so figuring out what the
actual date is, can be complex.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:33.190
And we saw users, again,
come out of the tasks

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.759
that they were doing, and go
to find their calendar app.

00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:37.550
You know, again, you've
got the possibility

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.550
that you could lose them.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:42.680
We found on travel sites,
that it was problematic

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.120
when users had to choose an
outward date and a return date

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.240
within the same calendar.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.520
That seemed to be like
an experience that

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.730
was very difficult for them.

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.800
It wasn't smooth, and so
the best practice there

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.200
is to provide two calendars,
one for the outward date

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.540
and one for the return date.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:05.190
Note also that there are system
ways of dealing with dates.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.890
But on the mobile
at this time you

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:12.010
don't get control of styling
in the custom chrome browser.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.890
Now remember that I mentioned
that completing mobile web

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:19.950
forms was arguably the most
difficult experience on mobile.

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:22.050
Well I may have been wrong.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.730
Because what's more
painful than that

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.820
is having to do
it all over again

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.750
because you did it
wrong the first time.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:30.240
Yeah, lot's of nods.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.890
OK.

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.980
So, there are standard
best practices,

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.110
of course, when it
comes to helping users

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.100
recover from, and
correct their errors.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.910
We need to provide clear error
messaging, not cryptic error

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:43.380
messaging, and we
need to highlight

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.270
the fields that need
to be corrected.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:49.270
We need to make sure that
the error message isn't just

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:52.240
at the top of the
screen, and nothing

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.940
is highlighting the field.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.550
But really, the best way to
address submission errors

00:30:56.550 --> 00:31:00.380
in web forms is to
avoid them altogether.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.260
If we can combine those
clear descriptions

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.650
with real-time error validation.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.730
This was the most
effective combination

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.470
for enabling users to
just go through that form

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.890
once and get it done.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:15.075
And there were examples,
but not very many

00:31:15.075 --> 00:31:17.560
of sites out there that
were doing real-time error

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.410
validation, and it was by far
and away the best experience.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:26.890
So let's summarize the takeaways
about optimizing form entry.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:30.890
So designing efficient forms,
chunking them like we saw.

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.860
Using pre-existing information.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.510
Streamlining that
information at entry.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.120
Go and test your forms
on your websites.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.510
See how many taps it takes.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:45.450
See if you're using
those contextual inputs.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.590
Minimize form errors
with labeling.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.860
Provide visual
calendars for dates,

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.792
and real-time
validation of forms,

00:31:51.792 --> 00:31:54.000
so that your users only have
to go through them once.

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.400
Now there are a number of
site-wide design principles

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.120
that we uncovered
during the course

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.790
of doing this study
on multiple users.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.240
And we're going to
look at this now.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.560
So one of the main reasons
that you make a mobile site

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.710
is because it's painful to do
all that pitching and zooming

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:18.050
when desktop sites
appear on mobile.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.480
It's hard to pan and zoom
around on mobile, especially

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.170
in multi-dimensions.

00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:27.860
And it often leads to trouble
with users viewing your images

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.220
properly or viewing
your text property.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.420
Some really frustrating
experiences that users had was

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.730
when the home screen
loaded fully zoomed in.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.260
They had no idea
where they were.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.200
And when a user
zooms in on a screen

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.190
you really lose
control of your design,

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:45.960
increasing the likelihood
of discover-ability issues.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.695
So make sure, even if you feel
that you've mobile optimized,

00:32:50.695 --> 00:32:53.590
or made your site
mobile friendly,

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.320
make sure there aren't any
aspects of that site that

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.008
require users to pan and zoom.

00:33:00.008 --> 00:33:03.270
Now images on mobile, while
we're talking about that,

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:05.170
they can be very
small and people often

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.780
want to see details when
they're purchasing something,

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.190
for example.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.850
So, the best thing to do is
make sure those images are

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.820
tappable and expandable.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:17.610
On retail sites, customers
really want to see the texture,

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.140
they want to see the details.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:22.210
And participants got
frustrated if they

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.930
weren't able to see these.

00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:27.620
A good example of
tappable expandable images

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:29.780
is provided by
JCrew on their site,

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.970
so I suggest going and
having a look at that.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:35.970
Now location.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.670
We saw some examples of
GPS location information

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:41.450
being badly applied.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:44.260
So the example on the left
is going to be problematic.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.630
And the reason is, because
the user doesn't really

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:50.020
understand what you're
going to be doing with that.

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.970
They kind of need to see
the context of how you're

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:56.280
going to be using
their GPS location.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.800
In our study, when users
were asked to book a hotel

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.590
room in Boston for a conference,
that's the task we gave them,

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.960
on a particularly
popular hotel's website,

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.920
they were prompted to
share their GPS information

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.770
immediately after
tapping the find

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:14.409
and book call to action
on the home page.

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.440
Accepting the request
resulted in the location field

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.190
automatically populating
with the user's current city.

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:23.940
But we saw that several
users automatically

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.080
accepted this request.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.070
They didn't really
think about it.

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.118
And one user became
particularly frustrated

00:34:29.118 --> 00:34:31.409
because they were trying to
book their hotel in Boston,

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:35.750
but it kept bringing up
hotels in their home city.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:37.780
And we also saw UI issues.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.600
For example, where a
site had a field that

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.909
said current location,
it looked to the user

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.780
liked they needed to
tap that, and they

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.739
needed to interact with it.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.780
And then they thought that
their current location

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.190
would be populated.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.449
But it wasn't the case
on this particular site,

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:57.730
if they left it alone, which
is what the developer intended,

00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:59.790
this would result in
their current location

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:00.980
being detected.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.620
But the user just couldn't
tell, and got very frustrated.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.570
So a better experience is
to make sure the user always

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:12.290
understands why you're asking
for location information.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.730
And then it's helpful
to let the users choose

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:17.910
to populate the location
field at the appropriate place

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:21.560
in the flow, and to a
clear call to action,

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.300
something like find near me.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:29.700
Now this point about
thinking about keeping users

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.550
in the single browser window.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.230
We've already looked
at that a little bit.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:36.800
We've looked at
it about, in terms

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:42.679
of sharing information and also
picking up where you left off.

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:44.470
But you need to think
about all the reasons

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:46.249
that users might
leave your site.

00:35:46.249 --> 00:35:48.290
Because it's not really
what you want them to do.

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:51.560
You want them to stay,
you want to potentially

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.340
have them convert on
purchasing something or getting

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:57.000
more information.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.170
Having the user switch
between browsing windows

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:02.580
can be problematic because
they do have this tendency

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.030
to go off and look
at other things.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.720
So think of all the
ways, one of those ways

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.210
might be that they go and
look for coupon codes.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:14.135
So we found some good examples
of sites, this site here

00:36:14.135 --> 00:36:17.170
and then I think we saw some
pizza sites, and other sites

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:19.840
where they decided to
provide coupons of their own.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:25.430
To kind of stop users doing this
and to keep them in their site.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.760
So try and do everything you can
to ensure that your users stay

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.930
in the browser window.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:32.250
Address those reasons
consumers might leave.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.840
Now many of the
websites we tested,

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.280
and the companies we were
looking at also had apps.

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.180
And all of them promoted
their apps in some way.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.990
Not surprisingly,
participants weren't at all

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:49.730
pleased with the situation that
happens on the left hand side.

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:52.180
I think we've seen
this all too often.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.700
This has being described
as the door slam.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.450
The user came to
your site to get

00:36:56.450 --> 00:37:00.940
some experience of your
company, or to do some task.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.720
And they didn't
appreciate anything

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.000
that hindered them
from doing that.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.060
In some cases this
was where there

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:10.860
was perfectly adequate, very
good mobile optimized UI right

00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:13.950
behind it which users
could actually use.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.280
And so, in this
situation, you're

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.670
losing the opportunity
to engage with users.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.980
So this full page
overlay or interstitial

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.540
is not a good idea.

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:29.250
It annoyed all but the most
loyal and familiar customers.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.370
Many sites promoted
their sites as banner

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:32.940
along the top or
bottom, and users

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.440
were fine with these
banners if they

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:37.040
were reasonably sized
and dismissible.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.260
They weren't too happy,
however, when the banner

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.430
started taking up too much
space and wouldn't go away.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:44.590
In landscape orientation,
think about that

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:46.540
too because the
banners can take up

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.420
really valuable
vertical screen space.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.320
So both Android
and iOS users were

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.522
used to seeing these
banner promotions,

00:37:55.522 --> 00:37:57.730
and they were quite happy
if they could dismiss them,

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:59.750
or perhaps they would
want to use them.

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.990
But the thing I really
want to emphasize here

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.190
is that mobile web is
an opportunity for you

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.620
to engage your users.

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:09.010
You might end up
with a great pool

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.800
of committed, engaged
users on the mobile web.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.220
It's a gateway to your
business, but you also

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.190
might have a population
of users there.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:19.109
So make sure that your
promotions are not

00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:21.025
getting in the way of
your key call to action.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.390
And this is one of the
most important principles.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:29.220
It's about taking all
these design practices

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.240
and creating a mobile optimized
site all the way through.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.620
Our study clearly
illustrated how much

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.820
uses preferred mobile optimized
sites over desktop sites viewed

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:39.850
on mobile.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:44.750
Many things, we saw lower
user ratings for desktop sites

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.420
on mobile, lower task
success, much more errors,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.240
all the things you'd expect.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.930
However, we found
that some sites

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:55.740
mixed mobile friendly
pages with desktop sites.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:57.535
So you start off
really, really well.

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:59.940
You like, yeah, I can
do this on this site.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.180
Hit a button, and
there you go, the text

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:05.950
is too small, it's a desktop
page, terrible experience.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:09.226
And we found that those actually
rated the worst of everything.

00:39:09.226 --> 00:39:11.600
And it's because it really
stopped users in their tracks,

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.206
right.

00:39:12.206 --> 00:39:13.580
They're trying to
do their tasks,

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.400
and it's even more of a
disappointment in a way

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:19.400
because it was more unexpected.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.100
So optimize your
site for mobile,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:24.480
and you need to optimize
the entire site.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.060
I know some of the sites can
be really humongous efforts,

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.300
and their can be thousands of
pages to make mobile friendly.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.480
So in those cases, if you can
only do it, sort of in chunks,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.960
I really advise thinking about
the main navigation parts

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.330
that people have to go through
to make sure that you're not

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.720
providing them with
that experience of going

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.730
from a friendly page
to a desktop page.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:51.310
You can look, of course,
at your analytics traffic

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.880
to try and work that out.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.170
So the site-wide take-aways.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.320
Don't make users pinch and
zoom, at all on your site.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.210
Provide expandable,
tappable images.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:06.570
Be clear why you need the
user's location for them,

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.840
so that that can be used wisely.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.620
Keep your user in a
single browser window.

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.800
So think about all those
reasons that they might leave.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.200
Don't let promotions
steal the show,

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:21.070
and optimize your
entire site for mobile.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:24.850
So that brings us to the end of
the principles we're reviewing.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.230
And we hope these things
that we've gone through

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.430
are going to be helpful to you
developing a better mobile web

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:31.304
experience.

00:40:31.304 --> 00:40:32.720
And I know you're
unlikely to have

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.620
to memorized this presentation.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:37.940
So the good news is, that
all these 25 principles

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:42.180
are available in a
white paper for you.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.480
And that white paper
explains what you need to do.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.590
We also have web
fundamentals, which

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:50.790
is an online resource
that tells you

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:55.400
about how to do some of these
things on the multi-device web.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.300
So if I've just
covered the what to do,

00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.940
which is the white
paper, you can

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:01.960
think of web fundamentals
of that as a how to do it.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.950
It covers a lot of the
technical guidance,

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:07.410
how to avoid the common
pitfalls that people

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.020
make when building sites.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:13.000
And it advocates for
responsive design.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.190
And we have a number
of performance tools.

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.600
The primary one is the
PageSpeed Insights tool.

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.930
And it's available to you.

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:24.340
It not only gives you insight
into the speed of your site,

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:27.310
and how that loads, and what
you can do to improve that.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.555
But it also has some
user experience feedback.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.020
Another easy way that you can
help yourself make a better

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.400
site is simply to have
users go through it.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.420
This is actually in
our usability lab,

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.500
but you don't need
any fancy equipment.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.120
You can just watch a
few users, perhaps set

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.190
some time to do that each week.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.000
See where the main problems are.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.970
And honestly you just
watch a few users

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.500
and you'll come
across those issues.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.083
You'll probably see
some of the things

00:41:53.083 --> 00:41:55.080
we've talked about today.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.970
And everyone can use
analytics, so trust that data

00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:01.940
and incorporate it
with your user testing.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.940
And then you'll
explore a pathway

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.900
to getting more
conversions on your site

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.080
and improving the
experience for users.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.370
So, creating a mobile website
is really imperative these days.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.100
And what I want to
say is it's not just

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.370
about shrinking
desktop to mobile.

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:22.490
Responsive design is a great
underlining technology.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.360
You've got the one code
base, which in the long term

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.040
will make things easier.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:31.540
But you do have to think about
how those elements of your site

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.870
are going to surface,
and what's important

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:37.000
at the different device sizes.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.680
The different context that
users are using those in.

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.520
So I want to conclude
with, now is the time

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.230
to really make improvements
to your mobile site.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.520
Think about all of the
resources and the effort

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.360
that's being put into
creating desktop sites.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:56.060
And think about applying
that same resource and effort

00:42:56.060 --> 00:43:00.370
and putting that into
your mobile site.

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:04.520
So to get going on mobile
sites, we have the principles,

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.780
we have web
fundamentals, and we're

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:09.210
going to develop a better
experience with more

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.320
conversions, so that you can
have happy and more engaged

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.570
users.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.270
So thank you for your time.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:19.030
And I'd be grateful
for hearing from you.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.660
So feedback on the
presentation will be a great.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:23.270
Please check out the principles.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:27.260
And I'm going to be around
for discussion and Q and A

00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:28.520
after this talk.

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.340
Thank you.
