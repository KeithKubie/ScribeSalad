00:00:00.542 --> 00:00:03.713
- [Mark] The flavor of
that lamb is just bursting.

00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:05.648
I'm willing to put my bet,

00:00:05.648 --> 00:00:09.815
if I bite right here it'll
just slide right off the bone.

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.679
Now that is pure joy, pure lamb joy.

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.346
(intense music)

00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:22.836
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.790
It's Mark Wiens and I am in
the beautiful little town

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.559
of Chania, which is on the
island of Crete in Greece.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.800
This is a place I've
always wanted to visit.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.342
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:34.388
Today we're going to explore Chania.

00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:36.079
I'm going to give you a full food tour.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.009
We're going to eat some
incredible local Cretan food

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:39.517
and Greek food.

00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:41.896
And then we're going to do
some sight-seeing around Chania

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:43.000
so stay tuned.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.300
This is going to be a day
of food and sight-seeing,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.026
of the amazing town of Chania in Crete.

00:00:49.026 --> 00:00:51.047
On our way first to go
eat an extremely popular

00:00:51.047 --> 00:00:52.152
local breakfast,

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.219
which is just outside of the old city.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.468
But one of the joys of being in Chania

00:00:56.468 --> 00:00:58.108
is just exploring the old town.

00:00:58.108 --> 00:01:01.564
These are actually the old
walls, but then if you walk,

00:01:01.564 --> 00:01:03.623
there's so many cool places.

00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:06.319
And it has so much
character, it's so charming.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:09.534
It's just absolutely
beautiful to just get lost

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:13.323
in the network of old lanes
and alleys within the old town.

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:15.990
(intense music)

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:26.537
One of the best things
you can possibly start

00:01:26.537 --> 00:01:28.464
your day with in Crete is bougatsa,

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:30.927
an incredible Greek breakfast pastry

00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:35.362
that will surely satisfy all
of your melted cheese dreams.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:36.195
This is filo?

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:37.127
- [Baker] Yes.

00:01:37.127 --> 00:01:37.960
- [Mark] Okay.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.776
- [Baker] You see how thin it is.

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:42.276
- [Mark] Yeah, it's very very.

00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:45.767
And is it olive oil?

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:47.153
- [Baker] Yes.

00:01:47.153 --> 00:01:48.326
- [Mark] Wow, okay.

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:50.316
They have the shop back here
where the kitchen is here

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:53.370
where the uncle is cooking.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.029
And he's the one, he's
the chef of the bougatsa.

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:58.745
And his son walked me over here.

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:01.462
It's a different shop hidden
back in the alley here

00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:04.145
whereas the storefront is the cafe.

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:08.211
And so he makes the bougatsa so delicately

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.522
and so beautifully.

00:02:09.522 --> 00:02:12.286
And just takes his time to take that filo

00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:14.468
and make it extremely paper thin.

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:15.709
You can actually see through it.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.404
It's so thin that it's translucent.

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:21.559
And then he adds on another type of dough

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:22.665
and then folds it up.

00:02:22.665 --> 00:02:24.465
And then he adds on a handful of the ...

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:26.352
- [Baker] Mizithra.

00:02:26.352 --> 00:02:27.947
- [Mark] Mizithra.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.582
- [Baker] Mizithra.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:33.648
- They told me that it's a
mixture of sheep and goat cheese

00:02:33.648 --> 00:02:37.696
and it's a very popular
type of cheese in Crete

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:39.183
made in Chania.

00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:41.609
And that's really all there is to it.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.517
And there's also a lot of olive oil,

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:45.915
which is very famous in Crete as well.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:49.098
And so he uses olive oil
to make these pastries.

00:02:49.098 --> 00:02:51.012
Then they bake in these ovens right here

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:52.248
until golden perfection.

00:02:52.248 --> 00:02:54.779
And then they transport
them over to the storefront

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.040
to serve them.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.707
Thank you very much.

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:06.153
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.300
So you can either order your bougatsa here

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.375
plain with no sugar or cinnamon.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:15.940
Or they'll add the sugar for you.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.262
Or they'll serve the sugar and cinnamon

00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:18.450
on the side for you even.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.804
You can add as much as you want.

00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:21.576
So I decided to go for no sugar at first.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.477
Then I might add a
little bit as I taste it.

00:03:24.477 --> 00:03:27.408
Look at that ratio of
cheese to filo dough.

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:29.363
It's just a couple layers of thin filo.

00:03:29.363 --> 00:03:34.181
And then you've got just a
heap of oozing, melting cheese

00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:35.611
in the middle there.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.111
That is beautiful.

00:03:38.688 --> 00:03:40.271
Oh that is amazing.

00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:43.535
Oh that cheese is really sharp

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:45.368
and a little bit sour.

00:03:46.974 --> 00:03:49.586
And then you've got just the
very thin layer of the filo

00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:50.956
which is crispy.

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:53.162
And right now with no sugar
on it it's not sweet at all.

00:03:53.162 --> 00:03:56.245
It's just like a giant cheese pastry.

00:03:59.843 --> 00:04:02.508
Oh this is the real deal right here.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:05.175
And the coffee has just arrived.

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:09.880
That is the perfect accompaniment to a

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.919
mound of melted cheese in
the morning for breakfast.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.252
(chuckling)

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:18.344
Oh it's nice and stout.

00:04:18.344 --> 00:04:20.499
Oh yeah, that is just a must.

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:21.722
And they go so well together.

00:04:21.722 --> 00:04:23.805
They're so complementary.

00:04:25.797 --> 00:04:29.475
To be honest, I'm so satisfied
with no sugar or cinnamon

00:04:29.475 --> 00:04:32.248
that I just want to eat the whole thing.

00:04:32.248 --> 00:04:33.321
I like this but I will try a little bit

00:04:33.321 --> 00:04:34.760
with the cinnamon and sugar.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.260
Because I think the majority of people do.

00:04:40.153 --> 00:04:43.067
Okay, I do see the attraction in that.

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:44.054
It is really good.

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:45.970
It really transforms it into,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.559
almost like a French toast
tasting type of thing,

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:49.916
but full of cheese.

00:04:49.916 --> 00:04:50.958
I'm more of a savory kind of guy

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:54.041
so I like the straight cheese pastry.

00:04:55.523 --> 00:04:57.498
That was just nothing short of incredible.

00:04:57.498 --> 00:05:00.447
That is possibly the best way
to get your morning started

00:05:00.447 --> 00:05:01.864
in Chania, Crete.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.503
(groovy music)

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.512
Conveniently located,
literally just down the road

00:05:16.512 --> 00:05:17.855
from where we just at that cafe

00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:22.430
is another legendary place
to eat gyro souvlaki,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.947
which is called Oasis.

00:05:24.947 --> 00:05:29.259
And this is, the owner is a
really friendly jolly man.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.270
He has been telling me
that they've been open

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.386
for over 50 years.

00:05:32.386 --> 00:05:34.660
And you walk into this little place.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.831
It's just a little hole
in the wall style place.

00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:39.006
You walk in here and immediately

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:43.873
your nose just gets overwhelmed
by that sensational aroma

00:05:43.873 --> 00:05:45.477
of oregano.

00:05:45.477 --> 00:05:49.644
And then you look at the
gyro, which is the revolving

00:05:51.141 --> 00:05:53.304
hunk of meat, which is pork.

00:05:53.304 --> 00:05:55.807
It slow moves on that spit.

00:05:55.807 --> 00:05:59.248
You see it's just caked
in oregano and some herbs.

00:05:59.248 --> 00:06:02.892
And then as soon as you order
one, he grabs a hot pita.

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:06.291
He adds in some tomatoes
and onions and tzatziki.

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.069
And then adds in the meat.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:10.773
And then adds in a handful of seasonings.

00:06:10.773 --> 00:06:13.563
Sprinkles on some salt and some

00:06:13.563 --> 00:06:15.673
I think some chili powder.

00:06:15.673 --> 00:06:18.763
And then he wraps it up
into a handheld treat.

00:06:18.763 --> 00:06:19.844
It's hot and fresh.

00:06:19.844 --> 00:06:21.420
Okay I cannot wait to try it.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.253
Thank you.

00:06:24.037 --> 00:06:24.870
Like this.

00:06:26.102 --> 00:06:26.935
Okay, wow.

00:06:28.613 --> 00:06:30.537
And they have some seats on the inside.

00:06:30.537 --> 00:06:32.722
And it's just a classic, classic.

00:06:32.722 --> 00:06:35.352
You can smell the history in
there along with the oregano.

00:06:35.352 --> 00:06:38.520
But I like these random
high chairs out here

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.318
on the side of the sidewalk.

00:06:40.318 --> 00:06:42.016
Oh it's so hot and fresh.

00:06:42.016 --> 00:06:43.990
You gotta come take a close up look at

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:45.998
what's all in here though.

00:06:45.998 --> 00:06:48.146
A handheld beauty, all
those thin strips of pork.

00:06:48.146 --> 00:06:49.828
You can see how much oregano is in there.

00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:51.160
That's tzatziki.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.480
And it's warm, it's hot, it's fresh.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.921
The onions, the chili powder.

00:06:55.921 --> 00:06:57.990
Okay, I can't talk any longer.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.974
Wow, give it a little squish

00:07:00.974 --> 00:07:04.141
to get all those ingredients mingling.

00:07:11.826 --> 00:07:14.002
You can taste the garlic in that tzatziki.

00:07:14.002 --> 00:07:16.823
And just like you can smell the oregano,

00:07:16.823 --> 00:07:19.454
you can really taste the oregano in there.

00:07:19.454 --> 00:07:22.059
You've got the fresh onions
and the fresh tomatoes.

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:25.138
Those strips of slow-cooked
pork and the pita

00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:27.888
is just hot and fresh and fluffy.

00:07:33.516 --> 00:07:36.191
You're gonna get some
tzatziki and some sauce

00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:40.312
on your lips and you don't
want that to go to waste.

00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:44.479
This is something you've got
to try when you're in Chania.

00:07:50.144 --> 00:07:52.462
And that pork is nice and tender, too.

00:07:52.462 --> 00:07:54.072
And it's literally just caked in oregano.

00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:54.905
- Okay?

00:07:54.905 --> 00:07:56.346
- [Mark] Thank you very much.

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:57.179
Really good.

00:07:57.179 --> 00:07:58.566
Thank you, thank you.

00:07:58.566 --> 00:07:59.416
Amazing, thank you.

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:00.249
- Bye bye.

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:01.169
- [Mark] Bye bye.

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:03.007
That went down very very easily.

00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:04.905
And not only, it's actually,

00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:07.407
he serves what's called a gyro pita.

00:08:07.407 --> 00:08:10.074
So it's gyro, which is the round of meat,

00:08:10.074 --> 00:08:12.161
the revolving round of
meat within a pita bread.

00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:16.328
And not only was that just
absolutely insanely incredible,

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.605
you will love it,

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:21.002
but the owner's friendliness and kindness

00:08:21.002 --> 00:08:22.768
will really blow you away, too.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.403
And that's really what eating
and traveling is all about,

00:08:25.403 --> 00:08:29.570
is meeting so many people who
are passionate about food.

00:08:31.318 --> 00:08:35.520
(horse feet clip-clopping)

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.539
Next up this food tour and
sight-seeing tour of Chania

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:39.555
is continuing.

00:08:39.555 --> 00:08:41.455
We're going to go,
which is actually again,

00:08:41.455 --> 00:08:44.277
right across the street,
and this is the old market.

00:08:44.277 --> 00:08:48.444
This is a really calm and
really nice, pleasant market

00:08:50.487 --> 00:08:51.440
to visit.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.368
They have all sorts of
traditional Cretan ingredients

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.131
that you can buy here, from vegetables.

00:08:57.131 --> 00:09:00.337
They have some specialty
Cretan cheese shops

00:09:00.337 --> 00:09:03.212
where you can buy your cheese,
you can buy Cretan honey.

00:09:03.212 --> 00:09:05.426
You can buy Cretan spices
like lots of oregano.

00:09:05.426 --> 00:09:09.699
But then they also have
a mix of souvenir shops

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:12.986
and clothes shops and then
a couple of restaurants

00:09:12.986 --> 00:09:15.679
and cafes that you can try
within the market, too.

00:09:15.679 --> 00:09:17.131
But I like how it's open air.

00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:21.400
It's covered, but it's very
spacious, it's open air.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.853
This market has lots of
history to it in Chania.

00:09:23.853 --> 00:09:26.906
And this is a great place
to wander and to stroll

00:09:26.906 --> 00:09:29.050
and especially you and I as food lovers.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.625
It's a great place to introduce yourself

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:37.396
to the different gourmet
delicacies that Crete has to offer.

00:09:37.396 --> 00:09:40.026
- [Man] This is lamb
with lettuce, lemon sauce

00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:41.276
and white wine.

00:09:43.236 --> 00:09:45.078
Traditional tripe.

00:09:45.078 --> 00:09:47.768
For lamb, very very good.

00:09:47.768 --> 00:09:49.150
The lamb.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:52.697
- [Mark] Oh yeah, I'll have lamb soup.

00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:56.272
Next up on this Cretan
food tour in Chania,

00:09:56.272 --> 00:09:58.060
we're stopping at a restaurant.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.817
They serve traditional Cretan food here.

00:09:59.817 --> 00:10:01.202
And they say that all the food is prepared

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:02.760
with local meats and vegetables

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.326
and lots of Cretan virgin olive oil.

00:10:05.326 --> 00:10:08.205
And this is the type of place that I love.

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:11.147
They cook all the dishes fresh.

00:10:11.147 --> 00:10:14.376
And they display all the
dishes here in the cabinet

00:10:14.376 --> 00:10:15.941
that you can pick and choose from,

00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:17.464
all the different Cretan stews

00:10:17.464 --> 00:10:19.380
and different dishes of the day.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.510
This is authentic,
traditional Cretan food.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.082
Everything looks outstanding.

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:27.751
They have a lot of lamb
dishes, a lot of meat.

00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:32.429
Everything looks like they've
been slow-cooked for hours

00:10:32.429 --> 00:10:35.099
to brew all those flavors together.

00:10:35.099 --> 00:10:37.375
And I got a couple of dishes

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:40.624
that I'm so excited to try right now.

00:10:40.624 --> 00:10:43.273
I gotta move in directly
for this lamb soup

00:10:43.273 --> 00:10:46.495
because it's just, he served
it just hot and piping.

00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:48.476
There are pieces of lamb here.

00:10:48.476 --> 00:10:52.204
I got some ribs and some
chunks and then on the bottom

00:10:52.204 --> 00:10:53.367
is the pasta.

00:10:53.367 --> 00:10:57.323
And this is a traditional
lamb soup, Cretan style.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.317
So let me just taste that soup.

00:10:58.317 --> 00:10:59.945
But he told me I could
garnish with chili flakes,

00:10:59.945 --> 00:11:01.945
which I absolutely will.

00:11:06.354 --> 00:11:07.354
Oh, oh yeah.

00:11:08.362 --> 00:11:09.512
You can taste it, that's lamb.

00:11:09.512 --> 00:11:11.540
That's some real lamb right there.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.152
And then it has a tomato-y flavor broth.

00:11:14.152 --> 00:11:16.443
A salty, tomato-y broth.

00:11:16.443 --> 00:11:18.853
That will be awesome with some citrus

00:11:18.853 --> 00:11:20.669
and some chilies in it.

00:11:20.669 --> 00:11:21.919
Oh yes, please.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.393
Chili flakes.

00:11:26.431 --> 00:11:27.915
And hit that with that lime,

00:11:27.915 --> 00:11:30.446
squeeze in that citrus.

00:11:30.446 --> 00:11:32.674
Yeah I'm not sure what
type of citrus this is.

00:11:32.674 --> 00:11:36.757
It looks like a cross
between a lemon and a lime.

00:11:39.407 --> 00:11:42.758
Okay and I have to go in
directly for that lamb.

00:11:42.758 --> 00:11:44.585
Oh, look at that, look at that cap.

00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:45.572
That cap of meat.

00:11:45.572 --> 00:11:47.732
Okay this sort of needs to be picked up.

00:11:47.732 --> 00:11:50.232
And scoop over, okay, perfect.

00:11:58.859 --> 00:12:00.939
Oh, there's nothing better

00:12:00.939 --> 00:12:03.795
than going in for a bite
of meat and coming out

00:12:03.795 --> 00:12:06.743
with just a completely clean bone.

00:12:06.743 --> 00:12:09.807
When I saw the lamb stomach
stew, I had to go for it.

00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:11.920
This is a well-known dish in Crete.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.491
And you can see these are
little pads of stew right here.

00:12:16.491 --> 00:12:19.571
This thing is quite a interesting,

00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:22.879
oh wow, that's like the
entire, oh look at that.

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:26.051
It's like, okay, I don't
really know what that is.

00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:29.690
But you can see it's kind
of an olive oil stew.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.873
I think there's some herbs
in there, maybe oregano.

00:12:31.873 --> 00:12:34.787
And then there's a zucchini
over here on the side.

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.769
But this appears like it's been stewed

00:12:36.769 --> 00:12:38.932
for a very very long time.

00:12:38.932 --> 00:12:42.086
You can see the different textures.

00:12:42.086 --> 00:12:46.253
I'll go in for two different
types of the stomach.

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:52.568
I'm a huge lover of tripe, I love tripe.

00:12:52.568 --> 00:12:56.174
But sometimes depending on how it's cooked

00:12:56.174 --> 00:13:00.341
it can be either tender or
rubbery or very rubbery.

00:13:01.643 --> 00:13:03.621
This is really tender.

00:13:03.621 --> 00:13:06.683
Like your first bite you do
have a little bit of bounce.

00:13:06.683 --> 00:13:09.943
Your teeth bounce off the tripe.

00:13:09.943 --> 00:13:12.614
But then after that,
it just sinks into it.

00:13:12.614 --> 00:13:13.755
It's very very tender.

00:13:13.755 --> 00:13:16.755
You can taste those little textural,

00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:20.361
they're kinda like sponges,

00:13:20.361 --> 00:13:24.563
but kinda like pieces of
towel at the same time.

00:13:24.563 --> 00:13:27.281
Get this with some chili flakes going on.

00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:29.252
The chili is not really very spicy.

00:13:29.252 --> 00:13:31.240
You could eat it by the spoonful.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.900
And then for this bite
I'll grab a piece of bread.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.968
Break bread, dip right into that sauce.

00:13:38.968 --> 00:13:40.644
You always gotta go
with the soft side down

00:13:40.644 --> 00:13:43.719
so you can absorb as much of
that goodness as possible.

00:13:43.719 --> 00:13:48.040
And I will scoop up a few
pieces of the tripe as well,

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.040
the stomach.

00:13:53.922 --> 00:13:57.672
Oh, oh that is a, that
is a dish right there.

00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:00.358
The last dish I got is an eggplant,

00:14:00.358 --> 00:14:02.761
which has been stuffed with feta cheese.

00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:04.292
Oh and more things, too.

00:14:04.292 --> 00:14:05.937
There are more things in here, too.

00:14:05.937 --> 00:14:06.770
Oh ...

00:14:07.854 --> 00:14:10.223
Looks like some peppers and some carrots

00:14:10.223 --> 00:14:11.325
and all sorts of things.

00:14:11.325 --> 00:14:14.986
I didn't even barely touch
it with my spoon and fork

00:14:14.986 --> 00:14:17.970
and it just completely fell apart.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.526
And you've got some cheese here.

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:22.682
Look at how just completely
soft that eggplant is.

00:14:22.682 --> 00:14:24.851
Okay I'm gonna have a piece,

00:14:24.851 --> 00:14:26.968
make sure I get some
of that cheese with it.

00:14:26.968 --> 00:14:29.385
And mix it up, oh here we go.

00:14:33.828 --> 00:14:34.995
Oh that's hot.

00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:37.647
That's right out of the oven.

00:14:37.647 --> 00:14:39.064
That is so juicy.

00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:43.254
Oh that's like a crazy juicy eggplant.

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.474
And it just melts in your mouth.

00:14:45.474 --> 00:14:46.589
All the food is good.

00:14:46.589 --> 00:14:48.255
This soup is outstanding.

00:14:48.255 --> 00:14:49.965
And I already ate that
other piece of lamb.

00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:54.878
But I just have to show you
the tenderness of this lamb.

00:14:54.878 --> 00:14:58.615
It's just, it's just
mind-blowingly tender.

00:14:58.615 --> 00:15:00.179
Watch, watch.

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:01.350
Oh.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.517
That is a beautiful sight.

00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:15.582
That is a happy happy soup.

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.970
The tripe is also outstanding,
but I have to be honest,

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.809
I have no idea what this is.

00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:24.816
Let me rehydrate it with some of that oil.

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:26.399
What could this be?

00:15:27.244 --> 00:15:29.133
I'm honestly not sure.

00:15:29.133 --> 00:15:32.486
This is some kind of
tube but it looks wrapped

00:15:32.486 --> 00:15:33.574
at the same time.

00:15:33.574 --> 00:15:36.686
Um I guess we just kinda break into this.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:37.751
Oh it's so tender.

00:15:37.751 --> 00:15:38.738
Oh and look at that.

00:15:38.738 --> 00:15:40.537
Yeah, it's just wrapped up.

00:15:40.537 --> 00:15:45.508
I think this is a bite that
needs an extra hit of chili.

00:15:45.508 --> 00:15:49.214
And by the way, I'm loving how
they love chili here as well.

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:51.547
It's the perfect complement.

00:15:55.802 --> 00:15:57.552
Oh yeah, it's tender.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.029
It has the same texture as
the other pieces of tripe.

00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:03.029
But without the padding.

00:16:04.915 --> 00:16:07.797
Oh, oh as you keep on tasting it, though,

00:16:07.797 --> 00:16:11.964
oh, okay, you can taste a little
bit of the entrail remains,

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:15.477
if you know what I mean.

00:16:15.477 --> 00:16:17.678
And as I keep on chewing,
the more I can taste

00:16:17.678 --> 00:16:20.865
kind of some natural particles.

00:16:20.865 --> 00:16:24.532
Like maybe some fibers
of grass within that.

00:16:25.801 --> 00:16:28.403
That's a bit of an
adventurous bit right there.

00:16:28.403 --> 00:16:30.886
I think that's a special piece.

00:16:30.886 --> 00:16:32.309
Just finished with that meal.

00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:34.473
That was some incredibly good Cretan food.

00:16:34.473 --> 00:16:36.050
This is a place that you can come.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.103
It's right within the
market in Chania town.

00:16:39.103 --> 00:16:42.214
And you can get some
authentic Cretan food.

00:16:42.214 --> 00:16:44.176
Okay I'm starting to get
a little bit full now.

00:16:44.176 --> 00:16:48.154
I think it's time to
walk around a little bit.

00:16:48.154 --> 00:16:52.460
(motorcycle engine revving)

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.850
Old town Crete is just a fantastic
place to explore on foot.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:57.672
You can walk around the narrow alleys.

00:16:57.672 --> 00:17:01.412
And there's something you can
discover everywhere you walk.

00:17:01.412 --> 00:17:05.683
And we're navigating our
way over to a church now.

00:17:05.683 --> 00:17:09.183
(traditional Greek music)

00:17:12.127 --> 00:17:14.032
Church is called Agio Nikolaos.

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:16.005
And it's right within the old town.

00:17:16.005 --> 00:17:18.873
It kind of has a fortress-like
appearance to it.

00:17:18.873 --> 00:17:22.089
They don't allow any photos
or videos on the inside

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.153
so you'll have to come
see it for yourself.

00:17:24.153 --> 00:17:25.616
But the inside is also really spectacular.

00:17:25.616 --> 00:17:28.474
It's colorful, there
are beautiful paintings

00:17:28.474 --> 00:17:30.228
and pieces of artwork.

00:17:30.228 --> 00:17:33.347
And I also really like
the floor inside as well.

00:17:33.347 --> 00:17:36.847
(traditional Greek music)

00:17:41.095 --> 00:17:43.957
One of the places that you
will inevitably come to explore

00:17:43.957 --> 00:17:45.750
is the central promenade,

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.462
right within the old town of Chania.

00:17:48.462 --> 00:17:52.133
And it's kind of the
central part of old town.

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:55.503
It's the place where now you'll
find a lot of restaurants

00:17:55.503 --> 00:17:57.616
and cafes that surround the water.

00:17:57.616 --> 00:18:00.065
But it's really extremely picturesque.

00:18:00.065 --> 00:18:02.736
It's a great place to take

00:18:02.736 --> 00:18:05.100
a morning or afternoon stroll, especially.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.705
And the water, what impresses
me is just how clean

00:18:07.705 --> 00:18:09.098
and clear the water is.

00:18:09.098 --> 00:18:11.118
I'm gonna keep on walking
along the promenade

00:18:11.118 --> 00:18:14.535
and try to make my way to the lighthouse.

00:18:19.386 --> 00:18:22.008
And on my way to the lighthouse, though,

00:18:22.008 --> 00:18:23.755
I'm passing through the
old Venetian harbor,

00:18:23.755 --> 00:18:27.255
now home to some really incredible yachts.

00:18:30.358 --> 00:18:32.505
It's actually quite a long walk.

00:18:32.505 --> 00:18:34.088
You need to walk all the way around,

00:18:34.088 --> 00:18:36.631
past the arsenal, past all the docks,

00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:38.534
all the ship docks, the yacht docks,

00:18:38.534 --> 00:18:42.451
to be able to reach the
base of the lighthouse.

00:18:46.587 --> 00:18:49.409
I finally made it to the base
of the lighthouse barricade,

00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:53.089
which creates the docks
and the calm water.

00:18:53.089 --> 00:18:55.102
And there's quite amazing views from here

00:18:55.102 --> 00:18:57.134
'cause you can see the
shore and the old town.

00:18:57.134 --> 00:18:59.189
And that's the arsenal back
there and all the boats.

00:18:59.189 --> 00:19:02.356
But the lighthouse is a ways up ahead.

00:19:03.482 --> 00:19:06.149
(intense music)

00:19:18.715 --> 00:19:20.609
The lighthouse itself is beautiful

00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:22.529
but the views of Chania, the old town

00:19:22.529 --> 00:19:24.963
and the mountains in the
background is spectacular.

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:28.159
And you can do a little
bit of rock hopping

00:19:28.159 --> 00:19:30.944
to get to the other
side of the light house.

00:19:30.944 --> 00:19:33.397
It's just on a base of rocks.

00:19:33.397 --> 00:19:35.267
The view is spectacular.

00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:36.416
And look at the lighthouse above me.

00:19:36.416 --> 00:19:39.012
Oh, I'm getting the sea breeze.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:43.272
You can see islands and just
the rugged peaks of Crete.

00:19:43.272 --> 00:19:45.439
Oh man, this is fantastic.

00:19:48.117 --> 00:19:50.797
That sea breeze is amazing.

00:19:50.797 --> 00:19:53.547
(waves crashing)

00:19:54.783 --> 00:19:57.450
(intense music)

00:20:08.898 --> 00:20:12.198
I had a little bit of a rest
after going to the lighthouse.

00:20:12.198 --> 00:20:14.612
The lighthouse was well worth the visit.

00:20:14.612 --> 00:20:16.249
You get some amazing
views when you walk out

00:20:16.249 --> 00:20:18.048
to the lighthouse.

00:20:18.048 --> 00:20:19.302
Highly recommended.

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:21.845
And we are now walking.

00:20:21.845 --> 00:20:23.192
It's going to be a little bit of a walk,

00:20:23.192 --> 00:20:26.006
but we wanted to enjoy
the evening on our way

00:20:26.006 --> 00:20:28.453
to a seafood restaurant
about two and half kilometers

00:20:28.453 --> 00:20:29.536
up the coast.

00:20:31.116 --> 00:20:33.866
(waves crashing)

00:20:35.585 --> 00:20:37.292
The walk so far has been beautiful.

00:20:37.292 --> 00:20:39.301
We're coming up on another swimming beach.

00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:40.796
And I think the restaurant
that we're going to

00:20:40.796 --> 00:20:45.698
is right over there, like
before the cliff starts.

00:20:45.698 --> 00:20:47.865
Getting closer to seafood.

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.540
(traditional Greek music)

00:20:53.905 --> 00:20:55.913
Along with the seafood, part of the reason

00:20:55.913 --> 00:20:57.780
that this restaurant is so well-known

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:01.151
is because it's right along
the water, the beautiful water,

00:21:01.151 --> 00:21:05.348
and also along the beautiful
abandoned buildings,

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:07.674
which sets the atmosphere.

00:21:07.674 --> 00:21:09.812
So they set the tables
out right on the beach,

00:21:09.812 --> 00:21:11.038
right on the water.

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:13.538
And we are arriving right now.

00:21:16.409 --> 00:21:19.150
We made it to the restaurant.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.105
This place has so much character.

00:21:21.105 --> 00:21:23.647
It's a really cool place and
it's a really popular place.

00:21:23.647 --> 00:21:25.354
And so that's part of
the reason we got here

00:21:25.354 --> 00:21:27.361
a little earlier than most
people would eat dinner.

00:21:27.361 --> 00:21:29.924
But most of the tables,
like all of these tables

00:21:29.924 --> 00:21:33.411
here on the shore are all reserved.

00:21:33.411 --> 00:21:35.938
So there was just three tables up here

00:21:35.938 --> 00:21:37.347
that are not reserved.

00:21:37.347 --> 00:21:39.294
So Ying and I got a table up here.

00:21:39.294 --> 00:21:41.922
But I'm not complaining at all.

00:21:41.922 --> 00:21:44.214
The view is still
spectacular and the food,

00:21:44.214 --> 00:21:47.523
well, I came here mostly for
the food, rather than the view,

00:21:47.523 --> 00:21:48.766
but the view is fantastic.

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:49.900
It's so quiet over here.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.092
It's among deserted, abandoned buildings.

00:21:53.092 --> 00:21:56.574
And the water is calm and just
lapping against the rocks.

00:21:56.574 --> 00:21:59.226
And this is fantastic.

00:21:59.226 --> 00:22:00.282
Hi.

00:22:00.282 --> 00:22:03.824
We're all here to eat some seafood.

00:22:03.824 --> 00:22:07.324
(traditional Greek music)

00:22:10.635 --> 00:22:12.725
The first round of food has all arrived.

00:22:12.725 --> 00:22:15.724
They brought us a big plate
of bread topped with oregano.

00:22:15.724 --> 00:22:18.508
And then we got some fried fresh squid.

00:22:18.508 --> 00:22:20.507
This is one of the classic
things that you have to eat

00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:21.610
when you are in Crete.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:22.941
It's called dakos.

00:22:22.941 --> 00:22:24.443
And then I also got some mussels.

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:28.588
And also I had to go for
a plate of fried zucchini.

00:22:28.588 --> 00:22:31.755
This all looks and smells spectacular.

00:22:35.496 --> 00:22:37.996
Wow, that melts in your mouth.

00:22:38.934 --> 00:22:42.738
That's like eggplant but even like mushier

00:22:42.738 --> 00:22:44.964
and more dissolving.

00:22:44.964 --> 00:22:46.160
Next up I gotta try the dakos.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.022
It is a rusk which is a
crunchy piece of bread

00:22:49.022 --> 00:22:51.741
on the bottom topped
with a tomato herb puree

00:22:51.741 --> 00:22:53.204
and then Cretan cheese.

00:22:53.204 --> 00:22:55.273
And this is a huge dakos.

00:22:55.273 --> 00:22:57.723
Oh wow, I think you have
to go in with your spoon

00:22:57.723 --> 00:22:59.186
and everything.

00:22:59.186 --> 00:23:01.573
And that bread just
absorbs all that tomato.

00:23:01.573 --> 00:23:02.656
Look at that.

00:23:05.338 --> 00:23:06.171
Mmm.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.011
That's a wonderfully simple combination.

00:23:12.011 --> 00:23:13.013
It's like a sponge.

00:23:13.013 --> 00:23:14.325
At first it's crunchy
but then it just absorbs

00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:15.530
all of that tomato juice.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:18.547
And then you've got the
salted cheese on top.

00:23:18.547 --> 00:23:20.624
You've got the oregano.

00:23:20.624 --> 00:23:24.525
And I like that it's really
really refreshing, served cool.

00:23:24.525 --> 00:23:25.746
Next up for the mussels
which have been cooked

00:23:25.746 --> 00:23:26.814
in olive oil.

00:23:26.814 --> 00:23:28.949
You can see there's a pool
of olive oil at the bottom.

00:23:28.949 --> 00:23:31.236
And I'm gonna just go ahead
and squeeze on that lemon

00:23:31.236 --> 00:23:33.436
because I know it needs it.

00:23:33.436 --> 00:23:35.269
This is what it needs.

00:23:37.005 --> 00:23:38.538
And this guy right here.

00:23:38.538 --> 00:23:40.456
There's some parsley on top.

00:23:40.456 --> 00:23:42.183
Oh, look at that.

00:23:42.183 --> 00:23:43.762
Let me pull him,

00:23:43.762 --> 00:23:47.429
oh you can feel how
juicy it is immediately.

00:23:53.329 --> 00:23:54.513
Oh.

00:23:54.513 --> 00:23:58.844
Those aren't like huge mussels,
but they are hugely juicy.

00:23:58.844 --> 00:24:00.339
It's like absolutely pure.

00:24:00.339 --> 00:24:02.879
You can taste a hint of that olive oil

00:24:02.879 --> 00:24:05.839
and then just that lemon
that I squeezed on top.

00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:07.685
Scoop some of that olive
oil into this shell

00:24:07.685 --> 00:24:11.518
with that mussel and eat
it altogether in one.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.363
Oh that's gonna be a juicy one.

00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:23.173
Oh with that olive oil soup at the bottom.

00:24:23.173 --> 00:24:24.835
Oh that's extraordinary.

00:24:24.835 --> 00:24:27.925
It's mostly all just because
of those fresh mussels.

00:24:27.925 --> 00:24:30.353
I think the squid has just
been very lightly breaded

00:24:30.353 --> 00:24:33.020
or battered and then deep-fried.

00:24:34.982 --> 00:24:37.982
Oh, mussel just fell onto the plate.

00:24:38.859 --> 00:24:40.558
Okay, we can detach the head.

00:24:40.558 --> 00:24:42.516
I'll go in for this body section.

00:24:42.516 --> 00:24:46.692
Oh you can see some of
those eggs squishing out.

00:24:46.692 --> 00:24:48.577
That's insanely tender.

00:24:48.577 --> 00:24:52.744
And its like, those eggs in
there, they're like butter.

00:24:54.846 --> 00:24:57.596
Oh that just melts in your mouth.

00:24:58.891 --> 00:25:02.880
And because it has eggs
in it, it literally gushes

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.297
with a buttery consistency in your mouth.

00:25:09.228 --> 00:25:10.061
Oh yeah.

00:25:10.996 --> 00:25:13.375
(man speaking indistinctly to Mark)

00:25:13.375 --> 00:25:17.035
We're usually from US but from Thailand.

00:25:17.035 --> 00:25:19.359
- [Man] You're from which city?

00:25:19.359 --> 00:25:20.776
- [Mark] Bangkok.

00:25:22.718 --> 00:25:25.934
- [Cook] The stomach, the
liver, we don't clean it.

00:25:25.934 --> 00:25:27.897
We leave everything inside.

00:25:27.897 --> 00:25:29.846
It's like pate.

00:25:29.846 --> 00:25:31.578
- [Mark] One of the best
things about this restaurant

00:25:31.578 --> 00:25:33.038
is the fresh fish.

00:25:33.038 --> 00:25:35.708
It's just straight out.

00:25:35.708 --> 00:25:38.741
- I like the way you carry your son.

00:25:38.741 --> 00:25:39.955
- Oh thank you very much.

00:25:39.955 --> 00:25:41.018
- Very clever.

00:25:41.018 --> 00:25:42.625
- Thank you.

00:25:42.625 --> 00:25:44.215
This is an amazing place.

00:25:44.215 --> 00:25:45.366
And you can go in there,

00:25:45.366 --> 00:25:46.901
they have the fresh catch of the day.

00:25:46.901 --> 00:25:48.308
You can choose your fish.

00:25:48.308 --> 00:25:52.694
So we just got two different
fish to try for this meal.

00:25:52.694 --> 00:25:56.194
(traditional Greek music)

00:25:58.885 --> 00:26:00.272
That is a crazy good mussel.

00:26:00.272 --> 00:26:01.567
Just finished with those appetizers

00:26:01.567 --> 00:26:02.878
and now just taking a little stroll

00:26:02.878 --> 00:26:05.537
and enjoying the sunset views.

00:26:05.537 --> 00:26:06.977
Such a fantastic place.

00:26:06.977 --> 00:26:08.542
And right now, now that
the sun is going down,

00:26:08.542 --> 00:26:12.502
it's becoming even better and
quieter and more peaceful,

00:26:12.502 --> 00:26:15.669
now the sun is not so hot and intense.

00:26:29.306 --> 00:26:30.460
Thank you.

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.848
I was going back and forth about deciding

00:26:31.848 --> 00:26:32.837
which fish to order.

00:26:32.837 --> 00:26:35.206
But the owner finally talked
me into ordering two fish.

00:26:35.206 --> 00:26:38.132
Both of them kinda small in
size so that we could taste.

00:26:38.132 --> 00:26:39.950
He said they're completely
different textures

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.118
and different tastes, so
we had to get them both.

00:26:43.118 --> 00:26:44.743
Say hello to this guy.

00:26:44.743 --> 00:26:47.645
He looks fantastic, look at that sauce.

00:26:47.645 --> 00:26:49.811
Okay I'm gonna dig into the cod first.

00:26:49.811 --> 00:26:52.971
He said this is the softest
fish you'll ever have.

00:26:52.971 --> 00:26:56.701
Okay, oh, and just look at that flakiness.

00:26:56.701 --> 00:27:00.868
It does look unbelievably
soft and melt-in-your mouth.

00:27:03.609 --> 00:27:07.890
Oh yeah, that is indeed one
of the most tender fish.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.105
The texture is just amazing.

00:27:10.105 --> 00:27:12.984
It's so soft, it's so juicy.

00:27:12.984 --> 00:27:14.248
You can tell that it's cod.

00:27:14.248 --> 00:27:16.409
It's almost like the
texture of crab, almost.

00:27:16.409 --> 00:27:18.522
Okay and next up for the other fish,

00:27:18.522 --> 00:27:22.189
which, I think, locally,
it's called skaros.

00:27:24.293 --> 00:27:25.692
Mmm.

00:27:25.692 --> 00:27:29.668
It's more of that kinda drier texture,

00:27:29.668 --> 00:27:32.848
kinda flakier, a little bit stringier,

00:27:32.848 --> 00:27:34.288
as opposed to the cod.

00:27:34.288 --> 00:27:37.705
Both are incredibly different in texture.

00:27:39.176 --> 00:27:41.719
And I think that is olive oil
sauce that they've put over it

00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:45.886
that makes it juicier and
really fragrant as well.

00:27:47.485 --> 00:27:50.735
And I'll take some of the fish as well.

00:27:52.354 --> 00:27:53.231
Wow.

00:27:53.231 --> 00:27:55.731
I think the cod is the winner.

00:27:58.349 --> 00:28:00.257
Okay, one of the benefits
of eating this fish

00:28:00.257 --> 00:28:02.977
that the owner told me is
that they keep the liver in it

00:28:02.977 --> 00:28:05.977
and you eat the liver, and eggs too.

00:28:06.831 --> 00:28:09.498
Mmm, oh that is insanely creamy.

00:28:11.005 --> 00:28:12.374
Oh that's like fish pudding.

00:28:12.374 --> 00:28:14.868
Just made it back to the
house after an amazing dinner.

00:28:14.868 --> 00:28:18.445
The sunset with the water and
those old abandoned buildings

00:28:18.445 --> 00:28:20.521
really made for a serene environment.

00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:21.691
The food was also outstanding.

00:28:21.691 --> 00:28:24.525
Those two fish at the end were awesome.

00:28:24.525 --> 00:28:28.417
And it's been an amazing
day in Chania, Crete.

00:28:28.417 --> 00:28:30.312
Everything we did, all the restaurants,

00:28:30.312 --> 00:28:31.912
I'll leave them in the
description box below

00:28:31.912 --> 00:28:33.096
so you can check them all out.

00:28:33.096 --> 00:28:36.405
And I wanna say a big thank
you for watching this video.

00:28:36.405 --> 00:28:38.237
