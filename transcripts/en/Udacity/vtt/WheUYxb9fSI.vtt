00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.260
Now that we've seen all the code
to render the watch face,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.190
we still need to look at how
the colors were configured.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.839
Let's load up

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.670
DigitalWatchFaceWearableConfigureActiv-
ity.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.350
This activity runs on the wearable and
is available

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.045
by the little gear icon when the watch
face face is selected on the wearable.

00:00:16.045 --> 00:00:17.865
This is a standard
Android Wear Activity.

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:19.715
There's nothing special about it.

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:21.485
It implements a wearable list view, and

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:24.055
shows a list of colors to
set as the background.

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:28.475
If we look at the on click handler, we
can see it calls UpdateConfigDataItem.

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:30.025
This method then sends out updates to

00:00:30.025 --> 00:00:32.295
other listeners on
the Android Wear network.

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:34.195
Let's go back to the main project.

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:36.400
If we look at the phone
application project,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.070
we can see
DigitalWatchFaceCompanionConfigActivity.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.380
This is an activity that
runs on the phone side.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.600
It's also a standard Android activity
that brings up some selectives for

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.710
different colors in the UI
like we tried earlier on.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.680
This code sends out updates to Android
Wear devices using the message API here.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.420
It can also receive data item
changes made from the wearable

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.640
configuration activity as well.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.170
The main difference here is that
the phone side implements many more

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.150
configuration options while
the wearable side was kept simple

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.410
due to the size of the display
