00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well let's see. Position is vertical. Here. Vertical. That's opposite the angle.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Opposite the hypotenuse. Okay. We're using the sine. Sine is opposite.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So we know that x is equal to Xmax times the sine of whatever this angle is.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But remember, we don't know what this angle is until we do some math.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The angle is omega t plus this phase. I didn't show you this letter before but we call this phi.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Phi is how far along in this cycle we started off, and we started off π/2 1/4 of a cycle ahead.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So I evaluate this for omega. I plug in π. For t, I plug in 7.2. And I get -0.81&lt;i&gt;Xmax.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If you got this, I'm very, very impressed. This was not easy.

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And if you didn't, don't worry. Go back and do it again. The beauty of online education.
