00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.770
lock when it comes to usernames and
passwords so it's an autofill system

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780
passwords so it's an autofill system
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.479
passwords so it's an autofill system
right so it auto fills text views

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489
right so it auto fills text views
 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.979
right so it auto fills text views
exactly the way you think and one of the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989
exactly the way you think and one of the
 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.720
exactly the way you think and one of the
most common text views to get auto

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
most common text views to get auto
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.659
most common text views to get auto
filled is usernames and passwords so the

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669
filled is usernames and passwords so the
 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.190
filled is usernames and passwords so the
way this works is after they log into

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
way this works is after they log into
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.569
way this works is after they log into
your application on their old device

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579
your application on their old device
 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.159
your application on their old device
they'll choose to save it to the

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169
they'll choose to save it to the
 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:09.800
they'll choose to save it to the
autofill service and that's going to go

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810
autofill service and that's going to go
 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.330
autofill service and that's going to go
up to the same data store as smart lock

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340
up to the same data store as smart lock
 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.949
up to the same data store as smart lock
it's a secure data store from passwords

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959
it's a secure data store from passwords
 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.330
it's a secure data store from passwords
and then when they come back on their

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340
and then when they come back on their
 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.679
and then when they come back on their
new device it's just gonna go ahead and

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689
new device it's just gonna go ahead and
 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.030
new device it's just gonna go ahead and
autofill so there's a couple things you

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040
autofill so there's a couple things you
 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.890
autofill so there's a couple things you
can do to get your application ready for

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900
can do to get your application ready for
 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.809
can do to get your application ready for
autofill one of the biggest ones is set

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819
autofill one of the biggest ones is set
 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.479
autofill one of the biggest ones is set
up a digital asset link that links your

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489
up a digital asset link that links your
 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.969
up a digital asset link that links your
web and your Android app so this is

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:25.979
web and your Android app so this is
 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.589
web and your Android app so this is
great because autofill has pluggable

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599
great because autofill has pluggable
 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.030
great because autofill has pluggable
password managers but all of the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040
password managers but all of the
 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.309
password managers but all of the
password managers support this and when

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319
password managers support this and when
 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.020
password managers support this and when
they do that what happens is the user

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030
they do that what happens is the user
 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.550
they do that what happens is the user
can log in on the web and if they're

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560
can log in on the web and if they're
 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.199
can log in on the web and if they're
using the same password manager on their

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209
using the same password manager on their
 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.149
using the same password manager on their
Android device they're gonna go ahead

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159
Android device they're gonna go ahead
 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.679
Android device they're gonna go ahead
and get those credentials transferred so

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689
and get those credentials transferred so
 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.059
and get those credentials transferred so
they log in on the web install your

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069
they log in on the web install your
 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.770
they log in on the web install your
Android app and the passwords already

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
Android app and the passwords already
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.089
Android app and the passwords already
saved that gets a seamless upgrade

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099
saved that gets a seamless upgrade
 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.830
saved that gets a seamless upgrade
experience to your Android application

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840
experience to your Android application
 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.509
experience to your Android application
another thing you have to do for

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519
another thing you have to do for
 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.339
another thing you have to do for
autofill well you don't have to do it

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349
autofill well you don't have to do it
 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.809
autofill well you don't have to do it
but if you want the best experience for

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819
but if you want the best experience for
 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.610
but if you want the best experience for
users you should setup autofill hints so

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620
users you should setup autofill hints so
 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.899
users you should setup autofill hints so
you should tell the autofill service

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909
you should tell the autofill service
 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.789
you should tell the autofill service
what's the user name what the password

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799
what's the user name what the password
 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.920
what's the user name what the password
field is that way the autofill service

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930
field is that way the autofill service
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.539
field is that way the autofill service
doesn't have to guess based on your IDs

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549
doesn't have to guess based on your IDs
 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.429
doesn't have to guess based on your IDs
and maybe get it wrong which is you know

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439
and maybe get it wrong which is you know
 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.839
and maybe get it wrong which is you know
probably the worst experience you can

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849
probably the worst experience you can
 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.179
probably the worst experience you can
give your users and then the last thing

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:05.189
give your users and then the last thing
 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.679
give your users and then the last thing
we're gonna talk about is auto backup I

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689
we're gonna talk about is auto backup I
 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.140
we're gonna talk about is auto backup I
might hand it over to Jeremy yeah so

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150
might hand it over to Jeremy yeah so
 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.629
might hand it over to Jeremy yeah so
auto backup is a great way to also

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639
auto backup is a great way to also

provide continuity to your users so even
 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.170
provide continuity to your users so even
if your app syncs to the cloud there's

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180
if your app syncs to the cloud there's
 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.259
if your app syncs to the cloud there's
still usually device specific settings

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269
still usually device specific settings
 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.969
still usually device specific settings
that you can backup and there's also you

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979
that you can backup and there's also you
 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:23.379
that you can backup and there's also you
know

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389
know
 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.999

when they launch your app when they're
 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.230
when they launch your app when they're
on a new phone so Auto Backup works by

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240
on a new phone so Auto Backup works by
 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.719
on a new phone so Auto Backup works by
when the phone's idle we back up to the

phone where the user installs the app it
will restore the data before the app

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:49.969
will restore the data before the app
 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.510
will restore the data before the app
runs for the first time and the user

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520
runs for the first time and the user
 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.700
runs for the first time and the user
picks up where they left off without any

and exclude specific files so for

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:01.879
and exclude specific files so for
 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:03.730
and exclude specific files so for
example you can exclude ooofff tokens or

example you can exclude ooofff tokens or
 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.519
