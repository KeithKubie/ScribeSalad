Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S. T. E. Yup. So maybe you just want to start at the beginning. So how did you bump into this? Well, you hate doing falling financial stories and that I did some financial stories, but I, I think my beat was more people in the headlines at the worst moment of their lives and then I would go in and become their friends and in the way we talk we would talk intimately about what downfall means when you've been at the mountain top.

Speaker 2:          00:39          Hey, I'm Jen Abu Rod, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today

Speaker 1:          00:43          the rest of Wall Street legend or Lard Maydoff

Speaker 2:          00:47          a behind the scenes look at the greatest financial fraud in history.

Speaker 3:          00:53          Billion Dolan Pyramids. Let's the hell is going on here. Who is buying Milliken? Tom have to wait. Come on by. I know you got that money man. Whatever money.

Speaker 2:          01:01          It's a series called Ponzi supernova from audible.com and she just set up how we got to it. Ellen Horne, the Great Ellen Horn, who was one of the founding members of radio lab a couple of years ago. She left us, it was very sad for us, but she went off to audible, teamed up with a guy named Steve Fishman who you just heard. And together they produced this series which has tape in it that has never before been heard. And it's pretty extraordinary and kind of, uh, you know, given what's happened recently with financial reforms up, up for reconsideration, what you're about to hear, you will find, uh, a little bit troubling and extremely timely. Yeah. And so what we did a couple of days ago, we got Steve and Ellen into the studio to play us some stuff and to talk about it. Yeah, sure. You spend the first episode really, oh, sorry. You spend the first episode really chasing the guy trying to get access to Bernie Madoff in prison.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Yeah. You know, I did all kinds of things. I mean, this was like years long pursuit. I would send Bernie novels in the mail. I would try and insult him. I copied out Sartre's play, no exit, and I sent that to him. You know, just to try and get a rise. I, I put money in his commissary account and then, you know, sent him a, you're welcome note. Never receiving a response. Do you know why at this point what was driving this? I mean, listen, Bernie has done this. I mean everybody knows and we keep reading about the details and we keep triangulating Bernie from friends who very obviously didn't know him. Investors who filed easily, obviously didn't know him. I want to hear this guy. Tell me, I want to say Bernie. Why did you do this? You were already rich. Come on. What's going on here?

Speaker 1:          02:51          I mean, Bernie had the greatest seed in the house to what was going on behind the scenes. So uh, Steve has explained to us for years, he just kept pestering the guy in Paris. Stubborn man. Yeah. In a talking to like a whole series of other prisoners, asking them to get the word to Bernie. And eventually just to cut to the chase one day my home phone rings. So I pick it up. It's a Sunday evening. The jets came is on and I got my two young kids running around and it's, you have a collect call from an inmate at a federal prison and then, and then you hear Bernie's voice saying Bernard Madoff in this kind of slightly did kind of discussed it, a tone of voice. And, and I was like, Captain Ahab. But now you have kids running around the room at jets game on, here's the phone call.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Oh my God. Are you ready? Oh, and I'm not ready. I don't have a pen and paper. I don't have a, a tape recorder and my kids are in the background. So my, my first reaction to Birdie on the phone is, hey, kids shut up. It's Bernie made. So then it called comment only in 15 minute bursts. And um, then, uh, the, for whatever reason, yeah, exactly. 15 minutes. Exactly 15 minutes. It just ends. And then the inmate has to wait 15 minutes to call you back. Wow. So he hangs up. I know I have 15 minutes. I'm running around him. I must have a tape recorder and then I find one in the closet. I, you know, tested it.

Speaker 4:          04:22          Ada [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:25          at this point we're just going to drop into the series.

Speaker 5:          04:28          Bernie. Yeah. You got, you got total in the middle of saying something. Situate. Just do it. I was so, it just got cut off.

Speaker 4:          04:35          Well yeah, I was just saying it was great to talk to you because you know, talking to you in person is so different than reading about you all the kind of caricature out there and the whole sense of you as being a, you know, just as one dimensional person.

Speaker 5:          04:50          It was nice talking to you too. Stay there through all these years. So it had been done.

Speaker 1:          04:57          So a burning made off is the greatest financial crook in history questions, but his voice is familiar to me. Male or Madoff could be the uncle I run into at Bar Mitzvahs. We have common roots, middle-class New York Jews and also an interest in the jet

Speaker 5:          05:14          going up the game or you know, I got it recorded. [inaudible] yeah, I like that. I can [inaudible] if I want to. What do you do? Are you near the TV room now? Yeah, yeah. Just phones are right. Right near the TV. Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:26          I tried to imagine the former chairman of the Nasdaq at a pay phone in a cell block, inmates lined up behind him with prison Mae tattoos, prison honed muscles. Oh, and you can and you can call at night too.

Speaker 5:          05:40          Yeah. I call it til 10 30 at night.

Speaker 1:          05:43          Prison is not what Bernie expected.

Speaker 5:          05:47          The way depicted of you. You were over the dope bars on the windows, you know, with the doors that I blocked that night. I a nice pretty big picture window. Open it.

Speaker 4:          05:58          Yeah. I mean I guess aside from being, you know, separated from everybody in Weldon.

Speaker 5:          06:03          Oh, it's, you know, ain't my family

Speaker 4:          06:06          probably not talking at Ruth right now.

Speaker 5:          06:07          No, it's just uh, the whole thing is uh, you know, it's just, I look, I, I know you'll never go.

Speaker 6:          06:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:23          Time's up. It's frustrating. A call starts, we build momentum. Bernie begins to open up and then the guillotine falls. Trust is tough to build on the timer and I need to be the person he will trust with the whole story, at least as he sees it. Bernie lets me know he has a story to tell. He's been misunderstood. I'm a good person. He tells me he starts with this. His family didn't have a clue. Bernie insists he shielded

Speaker 7:          06:56          his family. No, Billy kept them in the dark until the unseasonably warm afternoon of December 10 2008

Speaker 8:          07:05          Joe is sort of in a panic about the whole all in thing.

Speaker 7:          07:08          He was at his office, Bernard l Madoff securities, a family business.

Speaker 8:          07:13          What happened was [inaudible] came into my brother during the afternoon and said, what's wrong with that? Terrible. It's just falling apart. Uh, my brother came in 37, you know, you have to call the boys and something to call. They don't know what it is. And I said, I will on my own. I did that. I said, I can't tell them to you. All of us is up, just gonna fall apart. So, and I haven't heard from her. She had no idea. So we got into my car and we drove a few blocks going drive, drove into the new blocks to the apartment. Fifth was hall. We had bikes as part of that night.

Speaker 7:          07:56          They went into Bernie study,

Speaker 8:          07:58          that's what I broke down. And I told them, uh, crying and I played to him. [inaudible] got all this money out and I, you know, I'm not going to be able to recover it. And I was crying, right. And took me in his office and felt sorry for me. Uh, you know, I don't think it is. Oh, totally. Fuck it. Everybody was standing there talking, uh, that I should have brought, I don't know what else to tell you. I said, but, uh, I don't know what you're supposed to do now that I've told you this. So, uh,

Speaker 4:          08:42          and nobody gets angry at that point.

Speaker 8:          08:45          Everybody was fun that they were shocked. I mean, it was, and they were shocked, you know, have you looked [inaudible] one day and think your body is running this all a billion dollar business and everything is fine and he's happy, they're happy and all of a sudden the world comes crashing down. Uh, they thought the is the last time I have cried. Like that was witnessing all. When I found out my son, my dad's

Speaker 7:          09:13          Andrew, Bernie's youngest son, had been diagnosed with lymphoma five years earlier. He fought it and recovered fully. He considered changing jobs, but Bernie talked him into returning to work beside his dad, his brother, his uncle, his first cousin.

Speaker 8:          09:28          The family all got along well together and uh, it was wonderful having them there. I mean, we were very close family. I was very proud of my son. They were proud of me, you know, uh, what I accomplished it like being a Bagel off they hit and it was a lot of recognition in that while I was respected in the industry before this happened, that they loved that and I love having them in the business because it was successful at it. I kept them totally out of the loop. I mean, I didn't want to do it. I could let that be part of the loop and now all of a sudden they feel as it was this other side that they didn't really know. As for what happened next, the afternoon, I told them all, they immediately left. They went to a lawyer. The lawyer said, you gotta turn your father in a way that in. I never saw them again

Speaker 7:          10:17          and didn't hear from them again until two years into Bernie's 150 years sentence, his oldest son mark sent a message in the most horrible way the chaplain came to get you and what does he bring you to the chapel and roots on the phone and she tells you?

Speaker 9:          10:36          Yeah, I cried for a well over two weeks after he die.

Speaker 7:          10:42          Mark Madoff killed himself at age 46 hung himself with a dog leash in his soho loft while his toddler slept in the room next door, the date December 11 2010 two years to the day after his father's arrest to Burnie. Mark's message to him was clear, you ruined my life.

Speaker 9:          11:05          I tried. I tried in private because I didn't want to do it. [inaudible] if they switch over, they probably would've put date cause suicide squad is what they do. They all worried about me. They woke me up every hour on the hour to make sure that I was okay to God. I was a basket case for four weeks and

Speaker 7:          11:26          Bernie told me he still hoped he could reach Andrew and explain. But Andrew's cancer returned. He blamed the relapse on his father's crimes. The stress and shame of it all. Andrew Madoff died in 2014

Speaker 9:          11:42          I have tears in my eyes and I've told my views about certain things are not a day goes by tonight. I don't stop her. It sounds okay on the phone. Trust me, I'm not okay. You never will be.

Speaker 7:          11:54          Bernie though is a survivor. Once he confessed to the largest Ponzi scheme in history for him, the worst was over.

Speaker 4:          12:02          It must have been something of a relief to finally be able to get this off your shoulders.

Speaker 5:          12:08          Oh, it was IB. I wish that I would've caught earlier. I was under tremendous pressure. It was, it was absolute. It was a nightmare. Only for me. It was only a nightmare for me.

Speaker 4:          12:24          Yeah. I mean, you were looking down the barrel of this for you. I guess you, you Kinda knew it would end up here. Uh, you know where you are now. Sooner or later.

Speaker 9:          12:32          It's what I say, nightmare [inaudible] imagine not being able to tell anybody that I destroyed the family. They said, why did you need to do this? And I said, I don't know.

Speaker 5:          12:45          Yeah, see me. That's what I try to stick around here once a week. Yeah, the psychologist, I fortunately, they have a wonderful psychologists here and they're very helpful to me. Wow, that's great. That's right. Believe me. That's great. I have pupil sessions with her every week.

Speaker 7:          13:05          The New Yorker and his shrink seeking reassurance, searching for answers. Where does a monster come from?

Speaker 5:          13:12          I asked him, am I a sociopath? Privacy. You're absolutely not a sociopath. They said you have borrows, you have Rabois

Speaker 7:          13:21          I came to think of my conversations with Bernie as a kind of session too.

Speaker 1:          13:26          So I, I, Steve just, I mean I'm just curious. W what are you thinking at this point as you're talking to, I mean, we're running through his story and we've developed the kind of rapport, I mean, you know, there's a different generation, but Jewish roots, New York area. This is a guy who's familiar to me and I, and we develop a report and Bernie kind of tells me the story of his father and of how he got into this.

Speaker 5:          13:52          I bought it, built a sporting goods business. He owed the top, they called dodger sporting goods dented, but as a joke, a little too punching page. Right, on a metal rods. Yeah. And the a big successful business. And then during the Korean War it was a skill shortage. She couldn't get steel and it is business fail.

Speaker 6:          14:13          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          14:14          so you know, I lived through that. You Watch that happen, you see your father, oh boy. You idolize your build a big business and then everything you fight about, uh, you know, bad, something like that happening.

Speaker 7:          14:29          Bernie was determined to attain success, lasting success. The kind that had alluded his father, whatever it took.

Speaker 9:          14:37          I started the company in 1960

Speaker 6:          14:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          14:43          22 years old. He convinces a handful of investors to trust him. Friends, parents, former customers of his high school, lawn sprinkler business, clients of his father-in-law's accounting firm.

Speaker 5:          14:56          The first thing I did was I participated in a couple of Zulu issues.

Speaker 7:          15:01          New issues were hot in the 1960s though without the mad scramble and hype of today's IPOs. Back then there was no CNBC, no computers with new issues. He thought he'd hit on a moneymaking strategy and then the Walgett

Speaker 5:          15:16          correct the 62 with the Chub and missile crisis. Right. The whole noise should walk and wedded to the cane.

Speaker 7:          15:26          Bernie lost almost all of his clients' money as he tells it. He was embarrassed. He was in tears. We took them to her father. Bernie begged for a bail out. His father in law saved him. Bernie needed a better strategy.

Speaker 5:          15:41          We looked for a list of places where we could have a ditch.

Speaker 7:          15:43          The odds were against him as he sought Bernie. Wasn't one of the Wall Street elite. Did they make that clear that you know you're, you're not in the club and,

Speaker 5:          15:51          Oh yeah. I mean it was obvious to everybody. I mean, everybody knew it. You know, we were a small firm. You want to remember the duo stock fishing age. You know, it was very obvious.

Speaker 2:          16:02          Steve says that idea like of Bernie as that as a lower class kid from queens who wanted to prove himself to the big boys and be accepted. Steve says, that's one of the keys to really understanding how a guy like Bernie Madoff could have gotten into this gigantic fraud. Because when Bernie's business started to really take off, possibly increasingly through fraud, all of a sudden he had all of these guys from the big banks calling them up and wanting to take him out to lunch.

Speaker 7:          16:29          By the mid nineties word had spread people clamored to put their money in Madoff's IAA business.

Speaker 5:          16:34          So I opened up the individual accounts on people and I started thinking of these funds.

Speaker 7:          16:39          She Funds Bank funds and feeder funds created to funnel money to Madoff who pumped out those incredibly consistent returns.

Speaker 5:          16:48          So all of a sudden, if you have all these major banks,

Speaker 7:          16:50          it's flattering. It's flattering too. All right.

Speaker 5:          16:53          Yeah, of course it is. It feeds your ego. I mean, you know, you say to yourself, all right, all of a sudden these banks, which would give you the time of day, all of a sudden they're willing to give you affiliate dollars. I had already major banks coming down and the treating me, it isn't hard trip.

Speaker 7:          17:10          Everyone wanted to be with Bernie country club golfers, hedge funds, prestigious banks.

Speaker 5:          17:16          So they, they, they study if they should have been given, start out or fun, you know, but we need you to give it to the bunny. No, he, okay. I, you know, I think I can do it cause I thought that even if I started the short form of the stock to them, we just see a matter of weeks or months and you know, I'd be able to recover from it.

Speaker 7:          17:35          According to Bernie, this was the turning point. The market went against him. The boy genius failed. And the delusion of money, that was his undoing. He couldn't move billions of dollars in an out of market. My

Speaker 5:          17:50          mistake was I just should've left it at that. Instead, these partners just, you know, just get up pouring money into me. And it was very hard to turn down

Speaker 2:          17:59          irresistible for the young man once shut out of the club.

Speaker 4:          18:02          I mean, I guess the other thing there is, you know, we'll, you had a history of uh, you know, breaking up the, uh, the country club at the New York Stock Exchange with the market makers and uh, you know, now in some sense I guess you're, you're finally getting the recognition from those kind of same people that uh, they need you.

Speaker 5:          18:21          Yeah, that's right. And then it just, it just, the whole thing sort of spun out of control

Speaker 2:          18:27          then let me just, can I get something out of the way till Ponzi scheme, which we sort of need to know Ponzi scheme is I give you money to invest. Yeah. You pretend you invest that money but you don't. Instead what you do is you go out and you get new investors, take their money, give it to me, and then you go out and get even newer investors take their money, give it to the ones before them and on and on and on. So like all you're doing is just repositioning money. Like taking it from the new guys, giving it to the slightly less new guys, making it look like you're trading when you're not and it only works as long as you have new people coming in. You have need a constant stream of new people coming in with new money. But that all sort of fell apart in 2008 2008 when we had a huge stock market crash, Bernie woke up after decades. He was getting a lot of money in. All of a sudden one day people said, I want my money back. That's true. Me Too. Me Too. And he had not done anything except expect more money to come through the front door on that day. There was no money coming in the front door.

Speaker 5:          19:28          It just, the whole thing sort of spun out of control.

Speaker 2:          19:30          And so Barney's version, the fraud started because impressive people threw money at him. A good person who made a mistake

Speaker 1:          19:40          and we spend hours talking about this and it seems to me at some point that there's always going to be that next phone call. But there's that gap, you know, 15 minutes. I have to wait until the phone rings and, and one time the phone doesn't ring. Bernie doesn't call back. And I get from the prison a letter basically explaining that I have been declared a security risk. What is a security risk mean? I have no idea. And you know, it's some kind of catchall. I mean, I tried to appeal that to the bureau of prisons that it's unappealable. So basically the warden says, you know, we don't want this. There's a hassle, you know, he's a security risk. He can't,

Speaker 2:          20:21          don't, and, and, and, and just to synopsize just so at this point, having spent a hunk of time, you, you went into this thinking, okay, I'm going to sit in his shoes and I'm gonna feel him. And where are you right now at this point?

Speaker 1:          20:38          So now I've spoken to him for three or more hours. And you know, I've taken this journey with him. I've heard his story. I know you, I have felt some empathy for Bernie from his point of view. And so now I start to listen to the tapes and I, I start to really kind of dig in and uh, and it occurs to me that Bernie's telling me two stories. Bernie Madoff on one hand is this wizard conducting this incredible financial criminal wizardry, a master mind. And on the other hand, he's this kind of pawn.

Speaker 10:         21:16          Aw

Speaker 7:          21:17          Huh. Not a word you normally associate with Bernie Meda.

Speaker 2:          21:21          No. And actually that's more on that after the break because what ends up happening and where the cool revelations of the series is the way in which Bernie actually sees himself

Speaker 11:         21:30          as a victim and it's here where the story sort of starts to expand beyond him and you start to sort of see the much bigger field of play. Yeah. That's coming up after the break.

Speaker 2:          22:05          hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab. Today, we're playing a series of excerpts from a brand new series from audible called Ponzi supernova comes from reporter Steve Fishman and Ellen Horn, our former executive producer. And uh, it's a series about Bernie Madoff, the largest financial fraud in history. Uh, it's sort of a behind the scenes look. And in this series there's lots of really kind of crazy frankly, descriptions of how Bernie Madoff and his team pulled it off and how on many occasions they almost got caught for me, right? A US

Speaker 7:          22:41          attorney, Matthew Schwartz told me about one of the closest of the close calls, one starring Frank Dipascali Madoff's top. Lieutenant Dipascali testifies that he's, you know, sitting in a conference room with the auditors. They ask for, uh, this, this report called us Siack s I a c report. So picture it a conference room full of auditors, one asks for this routine report, something a legitimate trading firm would have on the shelf. Of course, Madoff isn't a legitimate trading firm, so they don't have it. Think quick, frank, and be cool in front of the auditors. Frank phones the computer programmers and says, Hey, can you bring up the siack report? And the guy says, basically the psych report, you told us we didn't need the psych report, where the hell am I going to get a psych report? And he says, great, I'll see you in 10 minutes, you know?

Speaker 7:          23:37          And then he does, as he described it, a little soft shoe to stall for time. Meanwhile, the team has minutes to a false report and then make it appear as if it's been idling on a shelf. They're frantically putting together and printing out this report, which is, you know, it's, it's half a foot thick off for time. Meanwhile, the team has minutes to prepare a false report and then make it appear as if it's been idling on a shelf. They're frantically putting together and printing out this report, which is, you know, it's, it's half a foot thick of this being paper Dot Matrix paper. And then it's supposed to be a report that's been lying around for a month and instead it's hot off the presses. So first they stick it in a refrigerator that's down in the investment advisory business to call it off and then they literally play football with it. They're tossing it around the room to one another to make it look weathered and then they run it up to a two deep pascal [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          24:44          the Pascali. Here's the siack report, who Cooley hands it to the auditors. There are close calls over and over again. It's fabulous theater. Steve actually described a Bernie Madoff's operation, right? You know that created like this massive $65 billion fraud as like super rickety, basically held together by tape and safety pins and old dot matrix printers and they're serious. Goes into a lot of detail about sort of the mechanics and how it worked. What caught our attention was the thing that we sort of mentioned before the break, this idea that Bernie saw himself, not as this like all powerful criminal mastermind, but as kind of a pond. Yeah. There was an original group of investors that Bernie made up found and this group is called the big four. That's exactly right. The big four. They came to be known. Even Madoff calls them the big four.

Speaker 7:          25:39          I had four prime big clients, Jeffry Picower, Norman Levy, Carl Shapiro and Stanley Chase, commonly referred to as the big four.

Speaker 13:         25:53          He was very clear that those accounts in particular Shapiro Levy, um, pick cower and chase, former assistant us attorney, Matt Schwartz, again were handled very differently from other accounts and were handled it in a way that, you know, it mattered less if there was a mistake for these accounts. The workmanship was quite different, more demanding, less exacting. Some employees were more meticulous than others and some clients you could afford to be less meticulous with

Speaker 7:          26:29          a net bond. Juno had been there a long time. She was employee number one in the Ponzi business. Garfinkel told me she handled the accounts of the big four.

Speaker 13:         26:38          Steve Garfinkel was one of the FBI agents who investigated Bernie Madoff's operation in nets clients the way she for gazy their, uh, account statements. There were some instances when the customer's got their accounts statements from net and complained that, oh, am I, you know, you promised me, uh, you know, 18% and I only got 16%. And they sent the s the statement back to Annette. So then she would do a new statement when miraculously you got the, uh, you know, your new statement with the new higher return made off himself,

Speaker 1:          27:19          says the accounts of the big four were for Gazy. They were doing all sorts of Schmader, a trays to Jewish term that we used where they were, you know, taking Los tres and the, the stuff that they did was unbelievable. And I were doing it through me. Hey, demanded Bernie do kinkier maneuvers.

Speaker 13:         27:40          Stanley chase for example, there was explicit testimony that he would not tolerate a single losing trade in his accounts. And he had a particular trading strategy where some times you could have a losing leg of a trade with the trade as a whole, as a winner. Cause it was a three legged trade. He wouldn't even tolerate that for some reason. Every single trade, every single leg of every single trade had to be a winner. Well, that doesn't happen in real life and no one can demand that of their money manager,

Speaker 1:          28:11          each of the big four, pay back millions and pick ours casing billions of dollars. Every one of them claimed Madoff had duped them. They weren't prosecuted and it's impossible

Speaker 13:         28:25          present return in a good year, but no one has the ability to rewrite history and turn stocks into bonds.

Speaker 1:          28:33          And so these men, mostly older, powerful mentors to Madoff open for me a new door into the Madoff Ponzi operation. They gave Bernie his break and then demanded that he provide them things he couldn't honestly achieve. These people are these people, and by that I mean the big four, whether it's them personally or their lieutenants or whoever it is, they are asking for things that are not possible, right? Bernie is accomplishing those things. So now ask yourself, who has the power in that relationship? Is it Bernie because he knows he's doing illegal things for these parties? Or is it the the party who set, who's now making Bernie do illegal things? It's both of them were. When Bernie said to you, gosh, like I, I discovered that people are really greedy. Remember that was in the beginning. Is this what he means that these people were using him? This is what Bernie means. And, and Bernie has actually a particular enmity for those big four. One of them, Jeffrey, pick our, took out $7 billion, $7 billion. This theme right

Speaker 7:          29:42          beyond what he invested. That's Ellen Horn who produced the series. Now the story of Jeffry Picower is one of the more dramatic moments in the series.

Speaker 14:         29:51          What's going on? Collab. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          30:00          10 months after Bernie Madoff's arrest, Barbara Picower wife of Madoff, the largest investor, Jeffry Picower dialed nine [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         30:08          there is at the bottom of the pools at the bottom of the pool that boom, okay.

Speaker 7:          30:15          This call was hard to listen to. It's upsetting.

Speaker 14:         30:18          Okay. See, I'm a lot, I'm gonna start the medics. You don't hang up. Okay. I'm going to put your tickets away for charter.

Speaker 15:         30:27          The fact that Jeffry Picower had a heart attack and drown in his pool. You can congratulate me on that.

Speaker 16:         30:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          30:33          according to Madoff, the fort pick out where it went for his final swim. Bernie phoned him.

Speaker 15:         30:40          I called up Jeffrey pick ours and you know, I said, you got to give him the money back. I said, you guys owe me money and I want the money back. Pick hours, you know, sit there. Well, you know, I don't have it all I did. I said, Jeffrey, I know that you have the money there is, you're worth $9 billion and I want 7 billion back.

Speaker 7:          31:03          Consider what made offs tone regarding the death of someone he knew for decades. What this says about Bernie Madoff, who he is, whenever someone hears that I interviewed Madoff, they always want to know, does Bernie feel remorse? I've interviewed serial killers, child rapists, people considered monsters. I suspended judgment. I wanted to hear their stories to understand them. This doesn't mean I wasn't horrified by what I heard, but I tried to see the world through their eyes and exercising empathy. At times I feel empathy for Bernie, but here's what struck me about Bernie. He didn't feel empathy. He claimed to feel remorse. He mouthed the words, but there was always a button.

Speaker 9:          31:57          Oh, a lot of my clients get a fiddle with every penny they put in there, please poverty, don't let me up. Excuse me. What I did, I mean, I don't feel sorry for you. You have a certain to be a client. I would. They were told Time and time again that you know, stop put more than 50% of their marketable right. With justice with me and with the odd, all that combination and all their statements, they saw it. There were things that they sign that basically they do that this kind of trading is speculative. Eventually they had doubts. They had doubts.

Speaker 16:         32:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          32:38          on the phone with me every

Speaker 1:          32:40          single time Bernie mentions victims, he can barely get through the apology before interrupting himself. They were warned. They were greedy. Always this strange, sorry, not sorry.

Speaker 5:          32:53          Yeah. I said brokerage firms can fail. I could go crazy and do something stupid. I said, it's, you know, if you want a guarantee, you know, put your money in government bonds.

Speaker 1:          33:08          It's impossible to tell the story of the fall of the house of Madoff without understanding that there were real victims. Real suffering. Back in early 2009 victims were telling stories of their ruined lives on TV, on the radio, on every local talk show, there was the worst thing that ever happened to us. This

Speaker 17:         33:31          can't be real. We have lost everything. I have lost everything and you've lost everything. Everything that we worked for goes down the drain at the end and dumpsters.

Speaker 5:          33:50          Now, of course, you listened to them. They're old. They're living at a dumpsters and they're, uh, they, you know, they don't have any money. It's on its own and I'm sure it's a, it's a traumatic experience for some, but you know, I made a lot of money for a lot of people.

Speaker 1:          34:03          Did you catch the remorse or was it too fleeting to register in your brain? My producers and I were in touch with dozens of victims to the victims. Bernie's indifference was in raging all over again, but it wasn't the slightest bit surprising. What is surprising is what happened to victims since Madoff dragged their $65 billion down a dark hall. I mean there is now, this is eight, nine years later, there is an industry that is created around the Madoff collapse. There are hundreds of lawyers working on recovering money, and that's a very complicated story. And, and when we try and tell, because you know what, a lot of people who lost money didn't have any inclination, couldn't have had any inkling that this was going on. So the justice group comes in, private lawyers, courts, judges, the Justice Department, and they tried to make amends, have they, justice is a fairly complicated issue.

Speaker 1:          35:13          And the universe created by Bernie Madoff. You have a trustee appointed to recover funds for victims. Well, some of those funds went to people who took those funds in good faith. They'd given Burnie millions of dollars. They took out a million plus one. And so they thought they were doing the right thing. They thought it was their money, but we've got to give money back to the people who lost more money than they put in. You're going to have to give some of your money to them. So it's a very complicated moral universe. Well, there's the individuals and then in the last category there are the banks and the investment institutions that sold Bernie to ordinary people all over the world. Yeah, there are these financial institutions, hedge funds raised billions of dollars, took them to Latin America, to Europe, all across the United States market and in Bernie Madoff as a safe bet. You know, he was weaponized by the financial system and so we wondered why weren't those hedge funds accountable for not doing their job and this is the still still happening. Still

Speaker 2:          36:28          unraveling. Still needs to be reported part of the story. Absolutely

Speaker 17:         36:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          36:38          that question about why the people who quote weaponized Bernie Madoff haven't been punished yet probably will never be punished. That is something that Ellen Horn and Steve Fishman tackle in the final episode in their series.
