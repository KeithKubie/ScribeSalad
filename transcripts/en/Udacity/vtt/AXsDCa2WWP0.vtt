00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.250
Welcome to 2D game
development with libGDX.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.430
I'm Jeremy, lifelong gamer and
course developer at UDACITY.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.783
&gt;&gt; And I'm James, UDACITY's
game depth curriculum designer.

00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:13.040
In this nano degree, you'll learn how to
use the libGDX framework to create games

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.740
that run anywhere from your desktop
to web browser to android or iOS.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.820
First, you'll explore the basics of the
game loop and drawing to create icicles.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.450
A game where you control
a character dodging an avalanche.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.790
&gt;&gt; Then for your first project,
you'll create a breakout clone called

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.280
Outbreak
&gt;&gt; Next,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.020
you'll learn to direct the complex
orchestra of entities and

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.410
interactions that make up a platforming
game featuring our hero, Gigi Gal.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.620
&gt;&gt; And for your second project,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.410
you apply these skills to a tap down
shooter called Space Kerfuffle.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.930
&gt;&gt; There are many ways to have
a career in game development.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.210
You can join an established studio.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.920
Or, if you're interested in
becoming an indie developer,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.410
you'll need to learn how
to monetize your games.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.560
&gt;&gt; The best way you can do that is to
make games that are fun and engaging.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.350
And you'll learn how to
integrate services for ads,

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.050
in app purchases, and even leaderboards.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.950
&gt;&gt; Then, you'll learn to use even
spicier features that will really make

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.150
your game stand out,
like physics and II.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.700
&gt;&gt; Finally, for your capstone project
you'll use all of these skills to make

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.740
a game of your own design.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740
&gt;&gt; Building games is challenging, but

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.980
at least you can always
procrastinate by testing a game.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.610
&gt;&gt; Best of luck in the nano degree.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.320
We can't wait to see
what you come up with.
