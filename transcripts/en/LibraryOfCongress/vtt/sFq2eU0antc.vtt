00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.980
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Thank you
for finding your way back again,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.050
I hope you had a good something
to eat and a breath of fresh air.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.590
There will be two panels
this afternoon.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.220
The first one is putting
data for work.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.120
For me, and I'm going to
talk more about this later,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.490
the key to helping
people find the archives

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.110
that are around is all the data.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.260 position:56%
And that's what this panel is about.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:50.040
Focusing on types of data, how you
produce it, what you do with it

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.980
and some of the ethical questions
of handling this type of data,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.380
which is very different
to handling data

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.250
from the physical sciences
for example.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.440
Now, you have the bios of
everybody on the panel.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.900
So, I'm not going to
introduce people at length.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.720
I'm going to take people in the
order that they're on this sheet.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.380
And luckily for me everyone
on the panel is on this sheet.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.680
So, we're okay [laugther].

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.920
So, we're going to start with Lee
Rainie who's infamous, no famous,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.670
sorry for being the
Director of Internet Science

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.900
and Technology Research at
the Pew Research Center.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.050
And we first met in Hong Kong.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.340
I've got that right
this time, haven't I?

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.610
Yeah, and this was,
oh a year or more ago.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.300
And I said, oh I'm
coming to Washington.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.810
Oh, let's do something together.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.880
And here we are.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.530
So, Lee you have your
time in the limelight now.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.900
&gt;&gt; LEE RAINIE: Thank you very much
and thank you for doing this Wendy,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.170
it's an amazing resource and if the
Doris Kerns-Goodwin of 100 years

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.330
from now is a good enough historian
she will discover what an important

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.140
event this was and why
it led to the good things

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.670
that she was writing
out in the next century.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.590
And anytime you can be in
the same room with Vint Cerf,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.130
first of all, you have
to say thanks.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.650
And so, we all say thanks to him.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.950 position:56%
I just wanted to start by underlying
a point that Richard Marciano made

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.480
about how data quality now
is so different from before

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.960
and it's the phase change in data

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.460
that really makes this a different
kind of environment for us.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.550
So, everybody talks about
volume, but one of the artifacts

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.380
of greater volume is that just
more people get to participate.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.220
One of the striking things we see
in the big national surveys we do

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.170
about the impact of the internet
on people is how grateful they are

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.890
that they can tell
their stories now.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.910
And they're not mediated through
industrial era media companies.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.190
And they get to tell their
own stories in their own way.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.600
And they get to find other people

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.380
who share those stories
and those circumstances.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.330
And it's an enormous impact.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.500
They're annoyed at the millions
and billions of other people

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.280
who tell their stories,
especially the wrong ones,

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.350
or the ones that are
spun up or lied up.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.940
But, by and large when people are
assessing their own information

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.220
environment, they're so grateful
now that they have a voice

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.860
and they have place in way that
you know GeoCities gave them a long

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.130
while back.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.080
The second dimension,
so volume is one.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.980
Velocity is the other.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.440
So, it's not just the pace
of information that's coming

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.710
through sort of normal channels,
but it's real time information.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.970
You know we can now
talk about location

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.850
as a really important indicator and
predictor of people's activities

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.160
and behaviors and things like that
in a way we never could before.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.480
You know Pew is a big
survey organization

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.690
and people are not very reliable

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.680
when you ask them specific
questions about their activities.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.020
Their media behaviors, their
location behaviors, their frequency

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.570
of doing things and stuff.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.550
Well, now we have reality
checks on that

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.940
when we have real time information
coming at the speed that it does

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.100
and being manipulated in
ways that can send signals

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.050
about what they're doing.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.160
And the variety of
information is also changing.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.720
Sort of in the same way that
people are glad to be able

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.200
to tell their stories there
are so many other places now

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.350
that can tell their
truth to the world.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.210
And this is enriching the amount
of information that's available.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.150
It's certainly expanding the number
of gatekeepers of information.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.790
It's changing the relationship
that people have with expertise.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.470
Who's an expert, and
who do you rely on

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.520
and where do you allocate your
trust and things like that.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.660
Which brings me to one of the
three points I want to make.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.560
I'm going to make three points and
two please in my little time here.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.460
Insofar as you have to make choices
about what information to archive

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.030
and what to focus on
and stuff like that,

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.510
I would argue that let's
be selfish about it.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.670
Let's tell what we
think, those of us

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.060
in the room think might be the
biggest story certainly of our era,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.300 position:56%
and maybe for a long period of time.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.540
It's the rise of the
internet and the web itself.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.430
It is changing the way people
think about their social worlds.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.410
It's changing the nature
of their social worlds.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.320
It's changing how they're
in community.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.570
It's changing how they
think about expertise.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.260
It's changing their
relationship to big institutions,

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.660
little institutions and
everything in between.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.070
It's changing the way they
allocate their attention.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.000
It's changing the way
they can act as agents

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.070
in their own behalf economically,
socially and politically.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.430
So, across the board.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.930
We're in the midst of a huge story.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.330
And I'm trying to think of another
time in history where people were

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.780
so aware that the ground was
changing underneath them.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.740
Maybe the arrival of atomic weapons
might be something that generated

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.730
as much, sort of immediate
commentary

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.410
about its impact on humanity.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.970
But that's the only
other one I can think of.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.810
So, we've got this big story to
tell and why not be intentional

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.310 position:56%
in the data that we collect and the
data that we preserve for the future

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.440 position:56%
in telling the story of this era and
all fo the change that it initiated.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.170
You know, in a way that
justifies archiving lots of stuff,

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.490
but maybe as you're sort of sitting
down, figuring out what collections

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.640
to amass, that could be one filter

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.110
through which you pass
your judgement.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.980
The second thing is that ironically
even as the volume velocity

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.640
and variety of information is
exploding there is an information

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.770
market that is degrading.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.610
And archivists can really play
a big role in helping undergird

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.480
that market and it's the
civic information market.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.590
One of the sort of great things
of the industrial era was

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.410
that newspapers arose and
newspapers were awesomely good

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.790
at bundling together all
kind of different content.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.220
But serving it up to you in a
way where the mayor got covered,

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.520
the school board got covered,
the zoning board got covered,

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.290
the state house got covered.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.760
National and international
capitals got covered.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.040
Well, as that bundle has been blown
up by the internet and each sort

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.160
of constituent part of the bundle
has found its own business model

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.160
and its own advertising base, what
has been orphaned in that process

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.050
in some sense is civic information.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.770 position:56%
So, you don't get as much
information about the mayor's office

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.210
and you don't find out what's
going on on the school board.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.500
And you don't necessarily know what
the zoning board is up to in a way

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.820
that you did when there
was a reporter in the room

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.350 position:56%
when all those things were happening

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:28.130
and when the material
is being released.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.380
And so, archivists can maybe
pay a role in sort of uplifting

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.400
that segment, even as the business
model for it is in trouble.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.850
I was so struck, maybe these
are the marching orders

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.870
to the datathon people, but I was
so struck that all of them marched

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.020
to civic information and
civic insight as a thing

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.990
that they thought was so
precious and so interesting

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.160
and so easily demonstrable there.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.460
Yeah for you guys.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.850
And everybody that's
part of that team.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.550
And that instinct to fill

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.300
in that information gap is
really good and important one.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.630
And finally, there's a movement
that's just poised to help you

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:10.680
in the archiving process and
in the explication process,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.340
which is the open data movement.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.940 position:56%
You know it's hard to archive stuff.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.810
It's hard to sort of think through
some of the ethical decisions

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.870
about scraping stuff
and things like that,

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.380
but this is all ours, you know?

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.230
The open data movement is built
around information we paid for

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:32.950
and whose copyright status and
whose ethical status is not nearly

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.580
in question to the degree that
the proprietary information

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:36.880
or other information is.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.280
And these folks are you know
in the same tribe as you guys.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.580
They love to hack.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.340
They want to figure out how

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.400
to make this information more
useful for civic purposes.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.850
So, those are my three points.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.400
Organize around the big
story, the rise of the web

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.470
and what it's meant to us all.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.350
Help a degrading information
environment

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.390 position:56%
and with the collapse of newspapers.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.220
And give a hand to the
open data movement.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.580
Now I have two pleas to end with.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.720
One plea is an affirmative one.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.750
Another ally group for you
guys is public librarians.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.690 position:56%
We do a lot of work related to
public libraries and they are poised

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.270
to help, especially in the model

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.760
that Vint was articulating
about, distributive archiving.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.900
They kind of have the skillset
and interest all ready.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.550
But they need marching orders
and they need help from you.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.030
And I think that you could
take advantage of that.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.560
They also, when I go out and
give speeches to librarians,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.560
we do a lot of research about
role of public libraries

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.410
in people's lives and
in community's lives.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.220
One of the things I say that
librarians can do in the future.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.660
There would be a real
service that sort

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.990
of matches an industrial age
service that they provided,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.650
is the algorithm fact checkers.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.570
They need training in that, they
need to know how to do that.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.370
But one of the things that as we
move into the age of the internet

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.360
of things and big data
analytics and stuff like that.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.410
Somebody's got to watch
the watchers.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.700
And the wonderful computer
scientists in the room are going

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.040
to do a good job at that.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.470
But there's an army out
there that might be willing

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.710
to help you on that [laughter].

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.200
And the final.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.940
So, think of public librarians
as good, useful, ready to charge

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.760
into battle allies for you.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.580 position:56%
And the final plea I'll make is
that even as all of these data arise

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.360
and the exciting ways to think
about capturing it and analyzing it

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.370
and stuff like that, don't
make the mistake of thinking

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:30.650
that it represents everything
and everyone who's important.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.300
Twenty percent of American adults,

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.240
one-fifth of America
adults use Twitter.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.680
Great resource, wonderful
to analyze,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.520
fabulous to do social
networking analysis off.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.040
But you know four-fifth of
adults don't use it in America

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.420
and the number is even higher
in other developed countries.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.710
And even higher in
developing countries.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:55.080 position:56%
It's you know and even for Facebook,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.910
1/3 of American adults
don't use Facebook.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.420 position:56%
So, don't necessarily think that
you are telling the full, full story

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.570
and it's certainly a representative
story by thinking that all

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.130
of this stuff that you're
amassing and analyzing stands

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.080 position:56%
in for everyone, because it doesn't.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.170
and there are ways that you can
backfill for some of those issues.

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.680
And there, you certainly,
sort of every day you get

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.420
up you should be thinking
about how can I serve

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.460
to narrow digital divides
rather than expand them.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.510
Thanks.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:32.590
[ Applause ]

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.890
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL:
That was wonderful.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.200 position:56%
And you're very neat, you kept time.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:42.200
And I'm fascinated by
how we move particularly

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.990
with the elections coming up, well
our referendum and your election,

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.930
which all seem completely
crazy to me.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:51.240
I wish we weren't having
a referendum.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.540
It's driving us apart and
it didn't need to happen.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:01.730
But the how we go from you know
the century we've had of polling

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:07.090
to the century of social media and
how these, you know how we do begin

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.560
to forecast what the
people are thinking.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.260
Now, it's my great pleasure
to introduce someone

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.580
who has become a great friend
of mine Professor Katy Börner,

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.320
who is a professor
Indiana University.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.180
You have the list of the
things that she does there.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.170
She's one of the most
amazing people.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.390
She's a force of nature.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.340
She produces the most amazing
maps and I know she's going

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:35.370
to show you this, but she produces
things like this, sorry, this here,

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:40.720
this amazing book of
maps, of science.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.390
And she's also one of the most
generous persons I've met in terms

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.930
of her time and her wish
to work with others.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.230
Kathy, over to you.

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.470
&gt;&gt; KATY BÖRNER: Thank you, Wendy.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.950
And thanks to all the
organizers for hosting us

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.840
in this beautiful palace
of knowledge and wisdom.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:10.070
Forward. So, I wanted to start
with a suggestion to chart the web,

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:15.740
to map it, to create an atlas
of all the different ways

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.670
that this web has been
helping us to find our way

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:24.520
to understand structures and
trends, to identify problems

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.000
with the data that exists, truly.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.570
To also understand what data,

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.750
we don't have because just
geospatial regions which are black

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.560
if you overlaid a number
of holes there.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.000
And to then take these maps
and bundle them all together

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.830
in what is known as an atlas.

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:45.500
And the presentation will start
with a few maps that are part

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.990
of the mapping science
exhibit and that show

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.100
that not only science today,

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.840
but also [inaudible] truly
connects us globally.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.500
And the first map I'm
showing here is a map

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.360
of scientific collaborations
between 2005 and 2009.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.190
Some of you might have
seen a similar map.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.820
On Facebook linkages.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.510
And so, this is I think
inspired by that map.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:11.230
And it really shows that we, today
are very much globally connected,

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:13.680
but you also get to see
that there are some areas

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.510
which are densely interlinked
and others

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.990 position:56%
which are more sparsely interlinked.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.860
I also saw this recent map which
some of you might have seen

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:27.270
in the news media and it
shows a cartogram style map

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.200
of how many domain
names actually exist

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.040
and how many different people
use these different domain names.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.620 position:56%
Another map, which was actually hand
drawn is shown here and you can zoom

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:48.490
in to see the big Google
landscape and data oceans etcetera.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.050
All these maps, by the
way are available online.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.670
So, you can zoom into them.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.960
So, if you go to simaps.org
you will find a hundred maps

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.470
that have been created by
more than 250 scholars.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.950
This is a map of Twitter activity
and you see that in the Netherlands

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.030
and you might also know
that in the Netherlands,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.850
people are holding a drink in
one hand, and their texting

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.510
with the other hand,
while they're driving.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.780
[ Laughter ]

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.560
But you also get to
see that these maps

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:25.680
of course redraw major
capitals, major railway

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.280
and other transportation lines.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.330
And you also get to see what
areas in Europe are multi-lingual

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.120
and what kind of languages
that might be.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:39.890
So, I think the plea here to
take the data we have and to try

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.480
to not only explore that data,
but also to communicate it

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.250
to a much larger audience.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.750
In an attempt to communicate
what we know about the work,

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:53.050
but also to communicate what we
don't know where the monsters are.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.180
There's a darkness's are.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.850
A team which also includes
some of my colleagues

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.150
at Indiana University
has used Twitter data

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.340
to map the mood of a nation.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.040
And it's interesting to see how
grumpy some are in the morning

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.680
and how happy they are
when the sun gets up.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:15.250
And I won't have time to look at
all these maps in detail here.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:19.070
But if you're interested in maps,
there's some handouts in the front

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.970
and again they're all online.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.000
This is a map which is
near and dear to my heart.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.120
It shows not only how
science sites itself,

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.240
which is how typically these
maps of science are created,

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.690
but how it's used, for instance in
doctor's offices by practitioners

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.590
which are desperate to have
parents go home with their child

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.370
and not without their children.

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:44.840
And so, here you get to see how
these different scientific papers

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.960
are downloaded one, and then
the next, and then the next.

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.140 position:56%
And then there is a sequence between
them, they are connected by a links.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.150
And the more often they're
downloaded after each other,

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.660
the stronger the linkages are.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.230
And the more closer in space they
are given these layered algorithms

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.290
we are using here.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.620 position:56%
Now, it would be wonderful if all of
us could actually read those maps,

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.640
and could make sense of them,
and could find our ways not only

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.050
in geospatial space, but
also in knowledge space.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.640
Unfortunately, however,
this might not be the case.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:22.030
So, we recently did a study on
six science museums in the US.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.850
It's still my hope that it's
different in Europe or Asia,

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:29.010
but in the US, we asked a thousand
youths and their caregivers

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:33.980
to read 20 maps, or each one
of them got 5 maps to read.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.120
And it turns out that those which
make it into science museums,

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.700
they actually do have a hard
time reading scatter plots,

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.580
reading cartogram maps,
reading networks.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.980
Networks are almost impossible
for many, many out there.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:55.150 position:56%
So, there is a huge need to help
people not only read and write text,

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.900
but also help them
read and write data.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:04.120 position:56%
And I would like to make the
argument that if you only read text,

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.710 position:56%
but never write text, then it's very
hard to actually be a good reader.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.890
And similarly, here, if you
only read data visualizations

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:15.140
which are shown in newspapers
or textbooks, but you never get

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.120
to make one, then it's also very,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.840
very hard to enter
practice specialization.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.090 position:56%
So, we have been trying to bring
materials online that empower anyone

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:29.120
from high school to
beyond 100 years of age.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.880
We have some of those in
our MOOC, to understand how

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.470
to actually take a dataset and
analyze it and visualize it

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.710
and communicate that
result to others.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.980
And we use visualization framework,

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.010
which first of all
introduces different task types

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.550
from statistical to
temporal, topical,

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:49.730
geospatial and network analysis.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.580
And different levels of analysis.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.280
So, from micro individual
level studies, to meso,

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.200
to macro population level studies.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.020
And if you now have that
table, which you see here,

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:08.100
then each cell actually refers
to a set of tools that are meant

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:11.320
for that particular purpose that
are developed by geographers,

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.310
or cartographers if it's
a rare question you have,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:20.080
or by network scientists if it's
a network, with whom question.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.550
Or by linguist if it's
a what question.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.220 position:56%
So, these tools are really developed
in very different areas of science,

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.950
but oftentimes you might have
multiple of these questions.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.080
So, this helps you to kind
of maneuver the landscapes

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:37.590
of different tools and workflows.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.370
And then, this is a
very simple workflow

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.280
of how you can work
data into knowledge.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.880
And it's always one, two, three.

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.270
Because it has to be so simple.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.010
You read data, you analyze
it, you visualize it.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:52.750
And then you select a reference
system, could be just two axes

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.160
or a map of the US for instance.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.470
Then you overlay the data and
then you start encoding the data.

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:02.260
And then you will probably see
that you don't have the right data,

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:05.860
or the data has a problem,
and then you do it all again.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.950
So, it's a very iterative process.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:12.100
And again, these are just different
reference systems you could swap

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.140
out, and this is a course schedule.

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.330
And there are two books,
one if more timely,

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.760
and it's actually co-written
with a librarian.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.700
So, Ted Polly he now is working
in Indianapolis as a librarian.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.790
And he has been instrumental
in bringing these materials

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:34.180
to many libraries in
the US, but also abroad.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.320
And then "The Atlas of
Knowledge" is a collection

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.420
of these different
maps has good examples,

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:41.450
but also has the visualization
framework.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.650
And we also use our
own microscope tools.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.880
And apparently, I don't have
any time to go into that detail.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.210
But ultimately students
are supposed to understand

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:53.180
that if they have an Excel file

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:58.330 position:56%
with different columns then they can
point to different types of columns.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.490
Let's say the year and topics.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.320
And then they can run a
topical analysis of bursts

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.170
of activity using these
two columns as input.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.410
Or if they have a column with
addresses and they can geolocate

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:16.670
and they can overlay it over a map
of the world, or a map of the US.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.070
And just by helping them understand
what columns a normal Excel file

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.400
facilitates what kind of analysis
they are far a step ahead.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.560
And then the tools also use that
organization in the menu system.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.860
And I'm out of time.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.360
Okay, so the visualization
framework can be found in that book

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.960
if you like, but what I wanted
to do it, I'm out of time,

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.420
make sure that you
also take home a flyer.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:52.330
So, maybe while I distract Wendy.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.560
Yeah, yeah.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.150
I'm not going to do it.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.390
I am out of time.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.590
I don't know why I
wanted so many slides.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.050
I'm very, very sorry [laugther].

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:10.170
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: This is
a typical academic all right.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.880
&gt;&gt; KATY BÖRNER: Found
my slide, sorry.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.710
So, those of you which do not
only want to look backwards,

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.790
but want to look forward
they might like to check

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.810
out that recent conference,

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:24.170
which Wendy was also involved
in as a keynote speaker.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:27.530
Because now all the slides and
all the recordings are online.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.670 position:56%
So, if you want to also use data to,

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.250
for a certain degree
predict the future,

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.110
I would recommend that website.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:36.910
Sorry.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:42.700
[ Applause ]

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.980
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: I love the
way we academics supposedly have a

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.430
different view of the
space time continuum

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:52.870
to everybody else [laugther].

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:57.130
But I would recommend you
to look at this material.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.010
Delve into those websites.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.270
And some of the students from here
are going to visit you next week.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.570
So, they'll be playing
with all this data.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:11.270
And the conference as well was
a really brilliant get together,

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:12.570
everybody.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.770
Now, it's my please to
introduce someone I've work

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.070
with for a long time.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.230
A very good friend of mine,
Professor James Hendler.

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:25.340
Lee talked about open data, and
of course Jim, who is at RPI,

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:32.930
he's very well known for the work
he's done on data at data.gov.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:37.710
And also, his seminal work
with Tim Berners-Lee and others

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:41.830
on the semantic web, which I think
is really important in this world.

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.580
This is not a conference
about the semantic web,

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.890
but maybe Tim will,
Jim will touch on it.

00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:48.070
Sorry, slip of the tongue there.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.510
And he's also the chair
of the website's trust

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.320 position:56%
so we work together on that as well.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.680
Jim, over to you.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.980
&gt;&gt; JAMES HENDLER: Thank you Wendy,

00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:00.170
and behalf of the Web Science
Trust let me welcome everyone.

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.350
We're very excited to be helping to
sponsor this event to some degree.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.240
And I'll let it go at
that because I don't want

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.680
to use all my time on that.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:11.250
But, I also was going
to take some time

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.570
to refute the most controversial
claim made this morning,

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.780
which was that the
internet was about puppies.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.750
But I don't have time for that.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:25.490 position:56%
Just Google Tim Berners-Lee and cats
and you'll find the correct answer.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.660 position:56%
But what I'd really like to do today
is start with a thought experiment.

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.160
We're all sitting here in
the Library of Congress

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.950
and particularly those of you who
are librarians and library trained,

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:41.360
you won't need much thought about
this, but for everyone else,

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:45.340
imagine if when this building
was first being conceived,

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.700
when this concept was first being
conceived, we had a search engine.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.460
That was a keyword
based search engine

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.850
like what we have on the web today.

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.690 position:56%
Right? So, instead of putting these
books in here, they were just thrown

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.260
in kind of at random, each
book was just given a number

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.160
and you would use the
search engine, right?

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.740
That would have been a
terrible way to build a library.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:13.110 position:56%
Right? and 140 years ago, this year,
the person who every librarian sort

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.870
of loves to hate and hates
to love is Melvil Dewey came

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.360
up with a very famous system;
the Dewey Decimal System.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.760
Which sort of way a way of
taxonomizing the whole world.

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.120
But it put books near each other

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.340
if they were sort of
conceptually close.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.180
And again, we can argue lots
of things there've been many,

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.900
many attempts over the years
to improve on that system,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.740
and yet it still hangs on.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.240
Partly for historic reasons,

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.830
but partly because it's
hard to do it differently.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:48.770
The problem is for data, that's not
even the word search engine isn't a

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.320
viable approach.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.690
Right? The umber 13
sitting in a column

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.950
in my database could be anything.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.310
Could be somebody's age,
could be representative

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.440
of some set of columns, anything.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.440
So, one of the real problems we
have with data, in fact with all

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.150
of the indexing of the web, but
particularly the data on the web,

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.670
is that we need an index structure.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:17.780
We need that Dewey Decimal
System replacement; however,

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:22.830
it clearly won't work to do
something very similar to Dewey.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:27.510
So, what I want to sort of hit on
today is four things we really need

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.160
to think about in terms of
organizing the web archive,

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.030
but particularly the
data aspects of it.

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:40.550
So, for the web itself the URL
system provides at least some kind

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.440
of organizational structure.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.510
And for the internet archive that's
to a large degree what's been used.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.880
And then on top of it you just try

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.140
to build very topical
things, and that works.

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:54.150
But again, in the data world,
in the next talk we'll talk more

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.380
about linking data
so I don't have to.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.030
But linked data is happening,
but that's not sufficient,

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.470
because again, that's about how to
get data organized in certain ways,

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.410
but it still doesn't tell us
how to find it, so discovery.

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.840 position:56%
It doesn't tell us how to integrate
it doesn't tell us whether what this

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.760
person was using here is similar
to what this person is using there.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:20.490
So, some observations, you know
sort of based on those 140 years

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.840
versus what we need to do.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.880
So, the first thing, clearly
anything we're going to do

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.220
about web data can't
be in a taxonomy.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.690
It can't be a tree.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:34.330
Vint put it very beautifully, he
said, the web is a web, right?

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:36.110
And it's not even just a graph.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:41.700 position:56%
It's a complex hypergraph structure
with a lot of different connectivity

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.400
and a lot of different kinds.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.360
And the data that lives and
powers that also tends to live

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.970
in that representational scheme.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.330
So, number one is how
do we even begin

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.910
to build something that's
an organizational structure

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.740
that doesn't live in the kind
of trees that we're taught

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.570
in library school is the
best way to organize things.

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:06.790
The second thing is
we really cannot name

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.830
down to the individual
data elements, right?

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.770
Really a lot of the data
sharing is about metadata.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.330
And you've heard that
word a lot today.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.390
And I'm not going to spend the
four or five hours I'd love

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.700
to spend explaining it in detail.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.890
But, we really need to
be thinking a lot about,

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.000
there's this data here, what is it?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.300
What is it about?

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.600
How do we find it?

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:32.340
So, once we get there, a lot
of techniques can be used

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.990
to figure out what's in it.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.380
But the real question is how do
I know and a lot of the things

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.400
that I've been trying to do
learning about data bottom

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.700
up are missing this point.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.000
So, having figure out
that this is a name

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.550
and that this column
is a data, right?

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.850
Makes a huge difference

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:52.830
if I'm reading a mortality
database, or a maternity database.

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.730
Right? One is the day
somebody was born,

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.630
the other is the day someone died.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.190
Right? But there's nothing in
the database that tells you this.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.970
It's in the description of
what the database is about.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:07.220
So, the second thing is we really
need to figure out ways to talk

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:11.880
about the datasets and how
they change and what's in them.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.330
The third one I'm going
to call more locality.

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:15.980
And this really talks to
that question we were asked

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.810
about cultures, languages, and
I'm going to add context to that.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:23.850 position:56%
So, we need linking across those
things, but we also need the ability

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.280 position:56%
to find things across these
different ways of thinking about it.

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.040
We're going to see
something a little later on,

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.340
I think Wendy's going to talk

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.980
about a project called
the Web Observatory,

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.650
which we've been involved in
together, but one of the problems

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.710
in that is again we're still
organizing the data based on sort

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.180
of the simple terms that
are put in by the creators

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.670
and we don't have a way of saying
these people who put it he dataset

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:50.530
in Chan Hi are thinking about
the communication differently

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.460
than these people who put
it in in San Francisco.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.730
Even though there may be
shared terms or context.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.810
And finally, we need a temporal
model, because data is not static.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.560
Books change slowly.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.690
And you know it's fairly easy
to refer to the second printing

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.420
of something, or the
second edition of something.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:16.010
Very hard to talk about this
particular data that was pulled

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.200
on such a such a date
at such and such a time,

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.480
where it is changing
at this kind of speed.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.140
So, when we were doing the
open data for data.gov one

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.700
of the big issues we were playing

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.300
with was how do we tell people
how often a given dataset changes?

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.210
And the decision was made
at a higher level than mine

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.020
to ignore that issue, right?

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:40.440
Because from the user's point of
view it didn't really matter much.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.300
It was just the developer
making sure they were pointing

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.930
at the most up-to-date API.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:48.820
But from the archivist view,
that's crucial if we want

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.740
to know what the data was
when we have to have a way

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.040
of talking about that when.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:57.050
There are some other but I
think those are the big four;

00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.960
that we need a way of
doing it not as a taxonomy.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.610
We need something that
goes to the metadata level,

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.060
rather than to the
data element level.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.800
We need some way of linking across
localities, cultures, and things.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.840
And we need a way of
capturing the temporal

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.880
and changing nature of data.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:21.510
So, actually when the sematic web
was first created there was a view

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:26.360
of building information
sources that live near the data,

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.780
linking them together and
having that grow bottom up.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.080
And what sort of has happened

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.850
over time is what's been called
link data has sort of moved

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:39.020
down to just trying to put data
elements together and that sort

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.430
of organizational structure has
moved up to languages like Owl

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.960
and complex ontology languages,

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.400
which have a role, but
it's not this role.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.810
So, a lot of what I'm pushing
nowadays and starting to try

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:54.900
to get a conversation and
really find the place to hold

00:31:54.900 --> 00:32:00.470
that conversation, is how do we
start to organize the information

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:05.200
about discovering data,
integrating data,

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.320
once we've pulled it together
validating data, some of the stuff

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.520
that would then feed
explaining and exploring data,

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.830
the [inaudible] etcetera.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:18.900
So, I'll stop there, but
we really need new models

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:22.780
of web ontology, of
link data etcetera.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:28.010
That are tied to data description
linking ingest, integration

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.430
and all those things Vint was
talking about today so that

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.810
when we go looking for
it, we can find it.

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.610
I'll stop there, thank you.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:42.430
[ Applause ]

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:45.130
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Jim, you're
my most disciplined panelist

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.430
so far, well done.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:47.730
And that was brilliant.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.030
Thank you.

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:53.320
And our last panelist
for this panel is Philip,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:58.070
I can't pronounce your name
you've got too many consonants.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.370
&gt;&gt; PHILIP E. SCHREUR: Schreur.

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:00.670
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Schreur.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:05.390
I've tried, I've practiced and
practiced and completely failed.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.690
So, there you go.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.030
Philip's come all the way from
Stanford to be with us today.

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:12.310
He's the assistance
university librarian there.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:16.160
He's responsible for
technical and access service

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.420
in the library at Stanford.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.570
Which is so crucial to what
we're talking about here.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.720
So, we're really grateful that
he's come all this way to talk.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:29.240
And I'm very interested to see he
has a PhD in medieval music theory.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.090
We're getting quite a lot of
this analogies with the past

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:38.120
to where we are today in terms
of we think we're struggling

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.310
and it is a very different
environment.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:44.390
So, we see the impact of what
we're doing as we do it almost.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.890
But people have struggled
with all sorts of ideas to do

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.120
with knowledge in the past.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:52.310
And so, there's nothing new there.

00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:54.120
It's maybe just scale.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:58.530
But the other thing I
do know about Stanford,

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:00.900
because Mike Keller who's the heal
librarian there is a good friend

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.200
of mine.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.500
And they have done amazing work

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.610
on the semantic web
and digital libraries.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:08.440
I don't know if Philip is
going to talk about that today,

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.490
but they are one of
the leading libraries

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:11.790
in the world in that respect.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:14.470
So, Philip, over to you.

00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:15.770
&gt;&gt; PHILIP E. SCHREUR:
So, thank you very much.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:19.160
I'm here to talk about the topic
today really from the point of view

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.090
of an academic research library.

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:25.450 position:56%
So, the first thing I wanted to say
was that I am very fortunate to work

00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:27.940
for a university librarian
that likes to throw

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.030 position:56%
out almost impossible challenges
with a certain amount of regularity.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:36.240
So, I remember back in the late
nineties when I was the head

00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.070
of the metadata department
at Stanford,

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:42.200
he said could you provide
intellectual access to all

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.540
of the internet and bring
it into our catalog?

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:50.870
So, I have been puzzling over that
for the past, almost 20 years.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.780
And not in particular relation
to that, but I resigned

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.790
that position shortly thereafter.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.350
Although I did come
back to Stanford.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:02.680
More recently we have been
very focused on trying

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.070
to shift the basic technology

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.370
about the way we do our
business towards link data.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:13.090 position:56%
And then in a conversation with Mike
six or seven years ago, he said,

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:17.570 position:56%
once we make this transition I don't
want you to provide access simply

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:21.180
to the resources that the
library traditionally holds,

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.820
I want you to produce
access to all of the data

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.290
that the university generates.

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:29.200
So, another nearly impossible task.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.350
But I think both thoughts
are very pertinent

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.270
to what we are talking about today.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.430
I think for us in the library key

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:39.020
to putting the data work
is discovering the data

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.510
in the first place.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:44.930
So, in my case that would mean
either bringing all of the data

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:47.700
and metadata that's on
the web into our catalog,

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:50.460
which I think is both
impractical and impossible.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.650
Or, it means putting our data out
onto the web, which is something

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:55.760
that we are working on right now.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.310
Or, it means providing some sort
of federated search between what is

00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:03.110
in our catalog and
what is out on the web.

00:36:03.110 --> 00:36:08.140
So, unfortunately, the library
environment is a very closed one

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.440
right now.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.330
It is really focused on metadata;
it's not focused on data.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:17.080
But it's also focused on metadata
primarily in the Marc formats.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:21.580 position:56%
Which were wonderful in their time,
but they were developed in the 1960s

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.780
in order to represent
metadata that was printed

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.970
or typed on library cards.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:30.990
So, when you think about trying
to represent the data on the web,

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:34.400
in the Marc formats, thinking
about them as catalog cards,

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.440
it's not a very successful
transition.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.020
So, we really needed to
move onto something else.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.760
And I think link data
will be that one.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.970
So, as I said for the past number
of years there have been a lot

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:49.760 position:56%
of efforts in libraries to transform
our data into link data to be able

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.790
to get it out onto the web where we
see people are searching for data,

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:58.540 position:56%
to be able to incorporate what we do
with what is out there on the web.

00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.850
Right now, we are focused
on an effort

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:06.910
to change our basic functionality,
the way we create data,

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.100
to create data natively
in RDF instead of focusing

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.050
on creation of Marc and conversion.

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.230
Because we've discovered that
that conversion process is

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:17.120
extremely lossy.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:22.040
Marc was developed trying
to reproduce a catalog card,

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.540
so when you saw the
data on the screen,

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.350
it's as if it were a catalog card.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.600
And there were a lot of
relationships which is left

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.570
up to you in your own
mind to create.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:31.750
It's not coded there in the
data, so when you convert it

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.910
to link data none of those
links are actually there.

00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:40.570
But as I said, it's turning out to
be a very costly transition for us.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:43.860
It's not only a particular
library that needs

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.730
to change the way it works.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:48.860
We are in our own web
of data suppliers.

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.500
We have data suppliers who give
us cataloging that give it to us

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.680
in Marc, we communicate with
other libraries nationally

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.450
and internationally in Marc.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.440
Our ILS system by which we
do things like circulation

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.620
and payments, all the
data is in Marc.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.860
So, all of that needs to change

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.620 position:56%
as an entire ecosystem before we can
successfully make that transition

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.310
and it's going to be a
lengthy and expensive one.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:19.960
As I thought about hoe libraries
need to make use of the data that's

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.150
out on the web, I think one of
the biggest challenges for us is

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:25.590
that the data are so
extremely variable out there.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:30.750
One of the things which gave us
most consternation recently was

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.950
discovering that the
Bulgarian census is now put

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:37.800 position:56%
out as a web document, as opposed
to a traditionally printed document.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.190
So, that caused a lot of problems
for us as far as archiving went.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.040
But again, it's a great example
of a resource on the web,

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.080
which really closely mimics the
traditional library resource.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:51.070
And in those cases, we
would like to bring it in,

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.670
give it our traditional cataloging,
to mix it with the resources

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.140
that it's very closely related to.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.440
So, that is one thing.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.310
But on the other hand,
there's a very small percentage

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.920
of internet resources, which
are really of that type.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:09.040
And so, we are simply
overwhelmed by those numbers.

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:16.390
Our current model of using humans
to provide intellectual access

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:19.950
to individual resources, simply
will not scale to the web,

00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:21.830
it's an impossible situation.

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:27.390 position:56%
So, even if we shift to link data by
which we could incorporate that data

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.530
into the web, we could
never describe the web.

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.540
So, we're still left
with a conundrum.

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:36.900
I think the other thing is
that this symposium really is

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.140
about making the data
work, it really wasn't

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.120
about making the metadata work.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:45.100
Although metadata has been
mentioned a number of times.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.220
So, when I think metadata,
it is a type of data,

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.330
but it's really data
with an ulterior motive.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:55.070
You know it is sneakily trying
to link things together in a way

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.810 position:56%
that you can make them discoverable.

00:39:56.810 --> 00:40:01.330
But often it does it in a
way, it loses some specificity

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:04.720
of description in order to do
that linking across domains.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.540
So, it is a very tricky
concept to be able to work with.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.620
So, I think if we really
are going to try

00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.320
to incorporate the data that's out
on the web with the data that's

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.730
in traditional library resources,
we are going to have to focus

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.400
on a much more automated process

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.050
for providing access
to that information.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:27.430
So, in dealing with sort of
more traditional web resources,

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:31.110
look at things like automated
entity extraction in assignment

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.720
of identifiers and
reconciliation behind the scenes

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.560
to be able to draw things together.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.180
Also, I think we need to look

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.860
at some things automated
semantic analysis of content

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.720
and use a common vocabulary so
that we can draw things together.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:49.110
For about five years I worked at a
publisher called High Wire Press.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:53.430 position:56%
And there we were very interested in
doing the semantic analysis of text.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:55.910
And it ended up at the end
of the five-year period some

00:40:55.910 --> 00:41:00.980
of our major subscribers to the
service liked the semantic analysis

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:04.360
of text better than the human
semantic analysis of the text,

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.570
because they said, well you
know you both make mistakes,

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.800
but at least the machine
makes a consistent mistake.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.130
So, they found it easier
to deal with.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.010
And at least it's high quality.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:17.130
So, just in summary
when I was thinking

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:20.740
about what's really important for
academic libraries from our point

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.370
of view what will be our
greatest challenges in trying

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.140
to make the data from the web work?

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.420
So, the first one is how we select

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.950
which portions of the
web to capture.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.830
So, I know we've talked
about it a lot here.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:40.180
I think it will come down to
either we divvy up the web,

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.070
and decide on certain
parts to collect,

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.360 position:56%
or our collection development
people look at what makes most sense

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.970
for Stanford and decide to focus
on those types of resources.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.740
But then, once that's done,
we really need to be able

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:54.650
to find an automated way of
extracting those resources,

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.370
which really kind of mimic our
more traditional library resources.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:42:00.920
Because we really want to provide
access to them in the way we have

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.140
to be able to integrate those
more easily in our online catalog

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.230
in that traditional sense.

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.150
As I said, for the rest of the
materials, we need to focus

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.910
on that sort of more automated
ways of providing access

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.370
and providing metadata

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.610
through automated entity
extraction and semantic analysis.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:20.500
A huge problem, which we're
only beginning to deal

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.990
with is the assignment
of identifiers

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.390
and their reconciliation.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:26.520
For integration for
discovery purposes

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.180
across the web in the
library catalog.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:34.800 position:56%
We know link data sounds intriguing
and it sounds like a great solution,

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.610
but you know worldwide there
will be many identifiers assigned

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:38.910
for that same entity.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.800
And we need to find a way, and an
automated way of reconciling all

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.810 position:56%
of that otherwise nothing is linked.

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:48.450
And I think the last thing
that we've been puzzling over,

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:50.520
and I really don't
know the answer to.

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.460
We really want to be
able to make sure

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:58.060
that those semantic associations
that we create persist over time.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:00.400
So, we've talked a lot
about preservation here,

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.010
but I think it's a
different concept.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.700
It's persistence.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.000
It's not preservation.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.910 position:56%
And I think it's one of those topics

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:11.790
that we're just really
beginning to struggle with now.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.590
Yep.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:19.170
[ Applause ]

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.470
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: All right.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:21.770
We've got plenty of time.

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:23.070
Well done panel.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.900
And I could sit and listen
to you forever Philip

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.940
because you talk my language

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:32.060
and now I know why I love
working with Stanford Library.

00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:34.240
Because they get the semantics bit.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.480
Yeah? And that's a message
to all librarians here.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.320
At some point, you've got
to deal with that properly.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:45.430
Okay. So, it's hard to see from
here isn't it, where the mics are.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.920
Where are the mics?

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.870
Ah-ha. There's a man
with two mics over there.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:57.830
Okay, who wants to take the
conversation forward then?

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:01.870
You look so tired, some on
this is great stuff here.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.170
Questions, answers.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.980
&gt;&gt; KATY BÖRNER: I've
got a question.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.280
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Oh, let,

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.560
Professor Jain, here
in the front row.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.080
You save it, save it.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.190
What I couldn't see, didn't see it.

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.370
Here's, right?

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:19.330
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: Hello
this is Ramesh Jain.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:24.570
I've been hearing a lot about
data and metadata and when we talk

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:27.700
about metadata, maybe
this is my perception,

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.210
but I am getting impression
that we consider

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:34.760
that it's second class
data, is that right?

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:37.450
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Do you
want to take that first, Phil,

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:38.750
because you brought up metadata.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:40.050
&gt;&gt; PHILIP E. SCHREUR: Right.

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.710
I did. So, I wouldn't
say it's second class.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:45.010
But it certainly is different.

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:49.340
I mean we had a conversation once
with the Stanford history faculty

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:51.700
and it's one of the few times
in my life concerning metadata

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.750
that they truly stunned me, and
I didn't quite know what to say.

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:59.340
So, they were not in
favor of library metadata.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.460
What they said was they're
interested in, they love metadata

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:06.770 position:56%
and that describes their
collection, but they wanted metadata

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.990
that was focused on their
collection, that described it well,

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:12.770
as opposed to having
more generic metadata

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.250
that could link across domains.

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.550
And they found that
not helpful for them.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:19.660
So, and since the whole point of
everything that I do is trying

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.320
to draw things together through
metadata, I was very puzzled

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:26.690
or surprised to hear that there
was a large group of faculty

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.140
which are not necessarily
in favor of it.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.710
So, I certainly wouldn't
say that it's second class,

00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:35.620
but you have to realize that it
does have that ulterior motive

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:40.560
and not everybody is
happy with how it works.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.860
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL:
Go on, Jim, Please.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.660
&gt;&gt; JAMES HENDLER: So, I would throw
in, I think what people miss is

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.280
that metadata has a completely
different purpose than the data.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.080
So, it's not that it's second
class it's that it's different.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.970
In the database community where
you're traditionally looking

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:59.240 position:56%
at what's inside one entity that you
understand very well no matter how

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.800 position:56%
large it is, that notion of metadata

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.680
as a second-class citizen
becomes clear,

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.730
because we know about our data.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:09.280
We're using the same store,
we're doing mining, etcetera.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.090
But when you start to move into
I use the acronym DIVE in one

00:46:13.090 --> 00:46:14.930
of my talks, DIVE into data.

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:19.650
Discovery, integration,
validation, and exploration.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.830
When you want to move into those
things, you know what's out there

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.690
that I can use, how do
I bring it together?

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:30.040
Did the thing that
came out make sense?

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.240
Right? So, again we run
some data miner on something

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.350 position:56%
and it's telling us something that
clearly doesn't pass the sniff test,

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.030
we've got to watch the watchers.

00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:41.020
And then, you know a lot
of the human perception,

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:45.760
you look at the graphs that Katy
was showing, humans are much better

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.350
at looking at those than
machines are still in terms

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:50.710
of understanding whether
they're telling us anything new

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:52.010
and different.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:53.910
And so, those kind of
problems don't live

00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:56.590
in the traditional database box.

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:58.960
In fact, I would argue
for archiving and things

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.830
like that the metadata is
probably more important.

00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:04.090
For example, we're going
to have to do data triage.

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:07.790
Right? There's no way that the
amount of data being produced

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:14.270 position:56%
on a daily basis, when you take open
data, social media data, web data,

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:16.760
changing data can be preserved.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.880
But a lot of the metadata about it.

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.840
So, we could know that
there were articles

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:25.070
about this particular topic being
published at this particular rate

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:28.260
at this particular time, even
if we couldn't keep track,

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:29.560
articles we can probably keep.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:34.000
But a lot of the videos, a lot
of the details of real time,

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.280
when we talk of the internet
of things and sensor data.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:39.200
You know we're not going to be
able to preserve the sensor data.

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.850
We're going to be able to say this
many people were using this kid

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.800
of sensor for these
kind of techniques.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.200 position:56%
And I think, that's to me when the
semantics comes back in as you said.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.310
And that's why so many other parts
of this linking stuff together has

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:57.580
to happen at that stuff
about the data, not the data.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.880
&gt;&gt; LEE RAINIE: Do you know

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.680
and the Dewey Decimal
System speaking of metadata.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.930
Dogs and cats, just to go back to
the pinpoint of this conference.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:08.670
Dogs and cats are archived

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.950
as industrial agricultural
equipment [laughter].

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:12.250
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Really?

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.800
&gt;&gt; LEE RAINIE: Because that's what
they did in the last 19th century.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.590
They worked on farms.

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:19.810
&gt;&gt; JAMES HENDLER: Yeah, so when
I mentioned the temporal stuff I

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:23.020
should have mentioned it
changed over time [laughter].

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.320
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Ah yes,

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.620
we should have Wolfgang naming
here for the temporal stuff.

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.360
We haven't talked about
temporal stuff.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.570 position:56%
I did invite him but he didn't come.

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:33.810
Does anyone in the audience want
to pick up a piece about metadata?

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:36.060
Because I actually think
it's different but as

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:39.210
if not more important
in some circumstances.

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:41.930
Do you want to say anything?

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:44.840
No? Oh, okay.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.140
Well you could [laugther].

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:50.290
Hang on, hang on hold that thought

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:53.320
because of the recording
Jefferson that's all.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.680
&gt;&gt; JEFFERSON BAILEY: I do
think there's recognition

00:48:54.680 --> 00:49:00.270
in the library archives community
that human provided descriptive,

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.690
or technical or administrative
detail will obviously never scale

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.620
to the rate at which digital
collections are being acquired

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:07.920
and ingested.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.930
So, I don't know what the
future is, machine learning,

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.280
automated extraction,
semantic entities,

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.180 position:56%
it will have to be highly automated.

00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:21.770
And anything automated of course
is human created, but there's going

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:25.660
to be all sorts of levels of
mediation that are sort of opaque

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.380
to users and I think that's
something to think about.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.760
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: This
was the point Philip made

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.220
in his talk, this will
have to scale.

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.520
This has to be automated.

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:40.030
&gt;&gt; JAMES HENDLER: So, I'm going
to disagree to a slight extent

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.470
such as I believe the extraction

00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:44.720
and collection will
have to be automated.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:49.360 position:56%
But I think if we're not using
human concepts to organize the data,

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:53.500
then we're not going to have humans
able to find the data, right?

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.630
So, I think again, one of
the things that I believe

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.870
and when I was talking
to Vint before

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:01.160
and he was talking about bottom up.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.430
Well what won't happen is we
won't get a Dewey Decimal system

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:05.620
that designs the whole
world from the top down.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.260
We need something that
can merge bottom up.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:12.310
But a lot of the bridging, a lot
of that semantics is going to have

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:16.640
to come from a human saying, these
are key concepts in a domain.

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:20.360
Now we ca use computers to
extract to those concepts or type.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.460
So, I don't believe that
just clustering and things

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:26.180
like that is going to get
us where we need to go.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:30.340
Assuming it's us as humans
who want to do the research.

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.640
&gt;&gt; PHILIP E. SCHREUR: So, there's
one other thing I wanted to add

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.490
as well, one of the things I
mentioned but we haven't talked

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:38.140
about very much is
that there then needs

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.150
to be a commonly agreed
upon vocabulary

00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:41.890
for pulling those things together.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:45.490
And one of the quotes that somebody
mentioned once which I loved,

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:46.790
and I use it whenever I can.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.600 position:56%
The wonderful thing about ontologies
is that there's so many of them.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.060 position:56%
So, when I was working at High Wire,

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.690
I had extremely the most
bitter fights I ever had were

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:58.170
on vocabulary development
and between groups

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:00.980
like the American Heart
Association, the American Society

00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.640
of Physiologist talking
exactly the same system,

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.340
but they fought bitterly
to have their vocabulary

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.330
and their structure represent
the data, so, the metadata.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:14.660
So, it's one of the big challenges
we have, not only within a country,

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:18.260 position:56%
but across countries to come up with
that vocabulary that can be used.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.910
&gt;&gt; JAMES HENDLER: But imagine doing
the linking thing you're doing

00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:24.030
to data to those vocabularies.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:26.920
So, Tim Berners-Lee and Ora
Lassila, and I wrote an article

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.110
about that 15 years ago
called "The Semantic Web"

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:32.620
and that's really what we were
talking about is that we have

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.750
to link the concept space, right?

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:38.930
So, this group can
represent their data,

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.490
but someone else can help map it

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:43.640
and then we can take those
mappings and map it together.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.220
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Ramesh
wants to come back here.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:48.060
I can't see the people
holding the mics,

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.840
they're hiding behind the pillars.

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.820
Where's the other, ah
can you sort of stand

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:55.420
in my line of sight, so [laugther].

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.550
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: I really
think that metadata is one

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:01.140
of the most misunderstood thing.

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.420
And we started in the term context,

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:08.170
now we just heard the term
ontology and languages.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:11.270 position:56%
The fact is languages always divide.

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:16.300 position:56%
Whether the signals are declaring
original information unifies people.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:22.420
And that's why we got rid of a very
different perspective on metadata.

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.290
And the metadata should
not be considered something

00:52:25.290 --> 00:52:28.260
which is secondary,
and which is qualifying

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.310
and some central piece of data.

00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:32.890
When we talk about books,

00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:35.860
we consider that books
are the primary thing.

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:39.710
Anything associated with that is
going to be the secondary thing.

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:41.320
But those data are gone.

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:45.270
When you look at a photo
and in the next panel,

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:47.250
possibly we talk about that.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:51.510
But what is metadata
and what is data?

00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:53.420 position:56%
I think that distinction disappears.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:53:01.610 position:56%
So, what, how is it that we, I would
like to hear your perspective it's

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:05.510
in the days when all this
different types of data is coming

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:11.400
in a distance, how do we start
really considering what makes the

00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.880
semantics of the data emerge?

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:18.960 position:56%
It's not one data, another metadata,
it's just different extremes

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.420
of data, and there the
semantics is emerging.

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:24.930
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: I
was struck when I look

00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:30.360
at Katy's visualizations,
you're visualizing, well that,

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.360
this is incredibly hard work to
produce those visualizations,

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:36.790
I think because you've got to,

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:39.670
I shouldn't be talking
about this, you should.

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:47.260 position:56%
But it's there that to me what
about them metadata in that process,

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:50.070
does that make any sense to you,
I'm not explaining it very well.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:51.370
&gt;&gt; KATY BÖRNER: So, I don't
think you will like this

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:54.360
but there are datasets where
you could have way more metadata

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.980
than the dataset itself.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.150
Because if you have
multiple insight needs.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:00.870
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL:
He likes that, yeah.

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:04.200
&gt;&gt; KATY BÖRNER: So, every single
insight need will actually require

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.950
potentially a reconceptualization
of what's in that data.

00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:10.610
And depending on how
you represent that data,

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.630
you can run different
types of analysis,

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.980 position:56%
you can get different kinds of maps.

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:18.030
And you get different
types on insights.

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.970
I do agree with Jim
that it is very helpful

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:24.790
if you actually have a
few human curated kind

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:27.640
of data dictionaries
as I would call them.

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:30.680
However, I do also
agree that one scales,

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:33.470
so very soon we will have a
very heterogenous landscape,

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:38.790 position:56%
where you have some human generated
kind of historical data dictionaries

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:41.600
if you envision and the
Dewey Decimal Systems

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.690
and then also organizations.

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:47.330
And at Stanford University
you have NbO which is aligning

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:49.650
like 300 plus different
ontologies just

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:51.740
in the biomedical domain itself.

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:56.500
But then you will have also
may data derived structures

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.330
and you will want to
interlink those.

00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:01.950
You'd want to use the machine
intelligence whenever possible.

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:08.540
But then if you have historically,
or current structures then you want

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:11.020
to interlink it to those
machine generated ones.

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:14.240
And I don't think there
is much work yet on that.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.950 position:56%
Even though they are now programming
languages which give certain task

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:21.800
to machines and certain
tasks to human beings

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:25.710
on mechanical [inaudible] etcetera
and then it goes back onto tasks

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:29.220
that machines are better
in doing, and certain tasks

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:33.200
that the human users
are better in doing.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.900
Realizing that heterogenous
compiling and running

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:41.960
of code will also be visible
in how we deal with data.

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:45.440
So, I see a very heterogenous
future for that.

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:47.410
&gt;&gt; JAMES HENDLER: Yeah, so in those
four or five hours I'm not going

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:52.000
to spend, let me just say that
the notion of metadata is driven

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.540
by the web to smaller
multiple link thinks,

00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:02.680
not these very large catalog
driven very heavy weight metadata.

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.660
So, the traditional notion
of metadata in the library is

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:07.080
like the Dewey Decimal System.

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:12.520
The thing we need for data
is a small set of terms

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:16.350
at a very high level and then sub
communities that can expand them

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:19.560
in their own ways and provide
linking through this graph

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:23.290
and network of this complex
entity and I think when you look

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.120
at that model you can see both
scaling you can see places

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.790
where you can tie machines.

00:56:27.790 --> 00:56:30.350
So, we've been doing that
with extraction and things.

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:33.500
So, again I think it's where
the technology space is starting

00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:37.370
to hit the conceptual
space, but at the moment,

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:39.280
the real problem is no one owns it.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.780
That's what I find the
biggest frustration.

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:43.330
I go to a funding agent and they
all say the same thing to me,

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:47.260
which is that's a great idea
I wish we funded that, right.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.910
And so again, it's very hard.

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.140
It's an infrastructure need.

00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:54.180
It's a library need,
it's an archiving need

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:58.250
and those are very complicated
at the moment to find ways to do

00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:00.980
at the kind of scales we need to do

00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.960
to both really both
understand the web.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:07.330
Wendy and I were 10 years
ago co-authors of an article

00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:11.830
with some other people
including Berners-Lee guy who,

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.610
called "Creating a Science
of the Web" and it's led

00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:16.040
to something with all websites.

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.810
But you know again,
it's studying that kind

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:22.360
of interdisciplinary must
have social science involved.

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:24.560
It must have library
science involved,

00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:29.510
but it also needs the technical
and fundamental engineering skills

00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:32.930
for the web, it's a very complex
space, but you know the fact

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:36.970 position:56%
that you're all here is talking to
the importance of this and the keys.

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:40.830
I promised Wendy I'd
mention websites.

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:44.960
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: You
have two or three times now.

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.720
Anyone want to take
another direction?

00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:49.650
Yes, to my left.

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:55.400
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 1: Hi my name is Baha
Ecminar [assumed spelling] I work

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.460
in the Library of Congress here.

00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:59.680
I wanted to ask you the question

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:05.820
about helping us contextualize
a good and effective role

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:09.300
for the Library of Congress
in the century ahead.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.980
So, in the past, we
have had plenty of data,

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:17.100
but most of it publication
related, manuscript related,

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:18.910
traditional library items.

00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:21.130
We're beginning to get
large amounts of data in,

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:26.960
but we don't always collect it as
data, we collect it as an item,

00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:33.330
or as related to a publication, so
if I can make the question concise,

00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:37.220
what can the Library of
Congress do with its consistent

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:41.130
but very finite set of resources

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:45.400
in the century ahead
to make data valuable?

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.790
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Yeah, I think
everyone will want to answer

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:50.330
that I will talk to it,
but Katy you go first.

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:52.230
&gt;&gt; KATY BÖRNER: So,
I liked Jim's question

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:54.840
about how do you index data.

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.630 position:56%
And one way that you just mentioned
was to connect it to the publication

00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:00.320
in which said dataset was used.

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:04.310
This way you can potentially
even rerun that analysis you get

00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:08.740
to these rerunnable papers
which is what many of us want.

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:12.810
Another way is also to connect the
papers now to software artifacts,

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:15.500
to the outsource, which they
are typically connected to,

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:19.640 position:56%
but now that Orchid is in
existence, try to make people use it

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:22.550
to find carrots for
them to actually use it

00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:24.550
and then you get these
very heterogenous networks

00:59:24.550 --> 00:59:27.420
where you can pull out one
author and all the artifacts he

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:30.570
or she created; be it
datasets or software artifacts,

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:33.950
or papers, just all come with it.

00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:37.260
And I think that will create
much richer search structure

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:40.620
and much richer result sets
when you actually start querying

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.430
those datasets.

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:46.480
And it will really leads
to more reproducibility

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.030
because you know whom to
ask, how to run that tool,

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:53.180
or that workflow etcetera.

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:54.480
&gt;&gt; PHILIP E. SCHREUR: So,

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.330
the one thing I would add
is something the Library

00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:57.630
of Congress is doing now.

00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:59.110
So, I mentioned there
is this transition

00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:03.080
in library metadata
from Marc to link data.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:09.420 position:56%
And the one thing that Elsie has
really led us on is this development

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:13.340
of a new schema called
BIBFRAME in RDF, to be able,

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.520
as something which will better
represent the library data.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:19.420 position:56%
There are a number of schemas out
there, but they really took the lead

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:23.490
in trying to develop this schema
to represent library data.

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:26.460
It eventually will be community
driven, but they really pushed it

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:29.470
to get it going and
that was a great effort.

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:32.110
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Well, yes.

01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:37.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; JAMES HENDLER: So, the only thing
I would throw in is I think the,

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:43.080 position:56%
so the standards that everyone wants
grow from defacto standards of use.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:47.180
And I think this is a place that
has the authority, the power

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:51.680
and the driving need in looking
at archiving the web and things

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.530
like that to be the place that
some of that work could be done.

01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:58.430
And you know, again, I don't know
enough about the organization,

01:00:58.430 --> 01:01:02.700
the internal structures, but I
think things that grow out of here,

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:06.620 position:56%
and that look at those technologies,
look at the vocabularies,

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.650
look at the new things, say,
here's stuff that can be done,

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:15.300 position:56%
would be something that would
attract a lot of attention and grow.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:19.600
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Can I just
add that I think librarians,

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.610
there's always been a lot of
data science in libraries.

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:26.340
I think there's a big
shift for the next century

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:29.160
where if I were the Library of
Congress, I'd be investing a lot

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.880
in data science training
for my staff.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:35.220
And I don't just mean from the
concept of library data science,

01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:38.600
I mean just generally getting to
grips with data science and get

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:43.000
as many people as possible in the
library understanding this world.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.630
Because in the future, libraries
will be data warehouses, largely.

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:52.460
And that, I was running the
place that's what I'd do.

01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:56.360
But I'm not, so.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.140
Is that a hand up there?

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.440
Yes.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.050
&gt;&gt; LIZ MADDEN: I'm Liz Madden
from the Library of Congress

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:07.740
and this is more of a plea from
the bottom up to all of you

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:11.080
who have students in
colleges and things.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.140
I work with the data, the
metadata in particular

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:15.740
and also the regular
data that comes in.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:20.060
And a lot of the interns and things
and the new Library students.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:25.300 position:56%
Along those lines it would be really
helpful for people being taught also

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:29.160
to understand basic concepts
like relational databases.

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.760
Because I think that's what
we see when we get datasets.

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:38.000
I looked at the map of the domains
and I saw how tiny the US was

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.780
and I know that's just
because they use .US

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.640
and that's a database error to me.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:46.450
And so, that kind of concept seems
really basic probably to the people

01:02:46.450 --> 01:02:49.390
in this room, but it's a really
foreign concept to a lot of people

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:52.660
who are studying humanities
and stuff like that.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.960
So.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.260
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL:
That's very interesting.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:57.970
I started teaching relational
databases when I first taught

01:02:57.970 --> 01:03:03.750
as a computer scientist in 1980s
I don't know whenever it was.

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:05.330
It's interesting you
should bring it up now.

01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:07.370
I would widen it beyond relational.

01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:11.190
I think it's about
understanding the world of data.

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.780
No, actually.

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:18.450
No, I would disagree with that.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:19.750
I would disagree with that.

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:21.790
Sorry, Jim you teach databases.

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:23.510
&gt;&gt; JAMES HENDLER: Yeah, I would.

01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:26.300
Well I don't teach databases,

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.800
because of computer science
relational has always been

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.980
with databases, what
I teach is about data.

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:37.420
And I think understanding that
difference that databases are one

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:41.770
of many ways of holding,
thinking about using,

01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:45.220
retrieving, storing, etcetera data.

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.940
That's really the key.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:51.500
And you know again my early work
in AI led to sort of semantic data,

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.250
but then through realization
that it's

01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.670
about describing all
that other stuff.

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:57.930
So even if you're, so the
problem is once you're

01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:02.330 position:56%
into the relational database, you're
forgetting all that outside context.

01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:05.600
But, that said, I think
teaching students about data.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.840
We, at RPI, I'll put in
a plug are actually going

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.260
to start requiring every student.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:13.990
So, not just the computer
scientists,

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:15.970
but every student is
going to have to take data

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:17.910
in tons of courses, right.

01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:21.240
So, we think data is to this
generation what writing was

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.660
to the last one, the
thing they didn't learn

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:24.880
in high school that
they should have.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.900
And we're going to
really push hard on that

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:31.320
across the entire curriculum,
across the entire university.

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.210
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: And
digital literacy generally

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:37.730
for the entire population.

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:40.420
Oh, one over, I think
this is probably going

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:43.640 position:56%
to be our last question so we have a
chance to hand over between panels.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.780
So, yeah. Tell us who you are.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.680
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 2: [Inaudible]
and I'm a student

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.800
from the George Washington
University.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.720
So, I have a question
about as a way to enter

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:58.810
into the largest scale datathon,
people may face an issue how

01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:04.840
to solve the storage problem of
the being or treating and data,

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.320
especially for the metadata
because the already size is large.

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.070
So, when people try
to recover them how

01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:14.780
to solve these problems, thank you.

01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.080
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: Thank you.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.380
Jim, you're nodding.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.680
&gt;&gt; JAMES HENDLER: Yeah,
it's a great question.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.980
In fact, when I was
first asked to be

01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:21.280
on this panel I thought that's
what I was going to talk

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.070
about until I realized I really had
nothing very smart to say about it.

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:26.210
But it's clearly the challenge.

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:32.390 position:56%
And the scale with which our ability
to store data has been growing,

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:37.490
has up until recently been keeping
speed with the increase in data.

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:42.250 position:56%
That, you can look at almost any
company that's publishing those data

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.520
now showing we're heading
for the crossover point.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.570
So, one of the hardest things
I think we're going to have

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:50.950
to learn is how do
we throw away data.

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:54.080
How do we decide what to
collect, what not to collect.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.270
And I don't mean now in the sense
of meaningfulness in the sense

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:01.940
that an archivist thinks about
whether we're going to store these

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:06.160
or those, but really in
the large hadron collider,

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.210 position:56%
it generates so much data that a lot

01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.190
of what the different
sensors do is figure

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:14.230
out which data they can ignore.

01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:17.090
Right? so 90% of what gets
created never gets put

01:06:17.090 --> 01:06:19.510
into the petabyte that
they generate.

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:21.290
And it happens at a very low,

01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:22.810
automated level and
things like that.

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:26.180
I think we're going to have to
start really grappling with some

01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:27.480
of those kinds of issues.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:32.580
So, not just what do we want in
the library, but must we keep

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.880
because there's going
to be a lot we can't.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.480
And I think one of the
reasons people tend

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:43.440
to move toward journal articles,
to books, and even to Twitter is

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.390
because those things tend
to be bounded in such a way

01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:49.560
that we can think about
keeping all or almost all of it.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.470
But when you start moving to you
know every video that was take

01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:56.640
on the web yesterday, right
on anybody's phone yesterday,

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.090
every Vine, every sorry I'm going
to get on my favorite soapbox,

01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:03.730
I'll get off of it, but again,
we're going to have to figure out.

01:07:03.730 --> 01:07:07.250
I mean a lot of that is
crucial, but a lot of it isn't

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:10.060
and in some way those kind

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:13.170
of collection management type
issues are going to be very,

01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:17.490
very crucial to the next
generation of what you call do.

01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:24.970
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: I don't
think storage is the issue,

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:27.660
personally I think.

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.020
I was just looking up
something my colleagues

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.770
in the Optical Research Center
are doing in Southampton,

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.070
where they're predicting,
you too yeah?

01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:38.530 position:56%
They're predicting, you know they've
got a huge store as much data

01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:40.150
as you can possible want.

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:45.170
And so, I think material science is
just, is going to give us solutions

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:48.520
to the, I think the problem is
making the haystack bigger doesn't

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:49.890
enable you to find the needle.

01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:51.700
I mean this is the problem.

01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.820
I think discovery and navigation
is going to be the problem.

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.580
And the question is do
you store everything,

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.330
or what do you decide you know to
throw away, if you're not storing,

01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:05.270
I mean Ted Nelson who started the
whole hypertext thing always argued

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:07.090
you absolutely store everything.

01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:09.960
That's always been his position
and he's never changed it.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.490
And I think that's a
big issue for debate.

01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:15.950
And it's on that the
libraries have got to tackle.

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:20.970
You know they are the first
frontline of this really.

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:27.160
Do you want any final comments
from our fellow panelists?

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.700
People feel, no?

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:33.440
Okay. So, it's a bit, everyone, I
can sense the room is a bit hot,

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.860
so we're going to do a
handover, there's water.

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:38.160
There's coffee.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.510
I'd love there to be tea, I
don't know if there's tea.

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:42.450
It's 3 o'clock, I'm a Brit.

01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:47.580
And there will, we'll just unmic
this panel and mic the next panel

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.760
in just a five-minute break.

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.430
And I'd like to say
thank you very much

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:53.510
for the panelists this afternoon.

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:59.070
[ Applause ]

01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:03.700
This is the final panel
this afternoon.

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:07.820
And it's chaired, I'll let him make
the introduction to the panelists.

01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:11.070
It's chaired by Matt Weber who
it's been my great privilege

01:09:11.070 --> 01:09:13.450
to work with.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:18.670
We have been working on this event
for a year I think, at least.

01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:22.570
And Matt with Jimmy and
Ian organized the datathon,

01:09:22.570 --> 01:09:27.940 position:56%
but also he helped me with David and
Nasha Contractor [assumed spelling]

01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:30.670
who unfortunately couldn't
be with us today

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:31.990
because he had to be
in France, anyway.

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:37.370
No, he has a very genuine reason
for not being able to be here.

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:39.970
But the four of us put
this symposium together.

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:43.170
But it was really Matt
who did all the work.

01:09:43.170 --> 01:09:47.170
Well, together we did it, but Matt
was the person who was there for me

01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:48.870
when we were organizing
this and working

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:50.940
with the Kluge Center
to get this to happen.

01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:55.370
So, Matt, now it's your turn to
chair this panel over to you.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.510
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: Well, thank
you to Wendy for her leadership

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:05.320
in this it's really a privilege to
be here and to have an opportunity

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.620
to chair this closing panel.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.110
I just want to make a few
quick remarks and then get

01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:11.520
to the meat of the conversation.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.670
The title of this panel is
"Saving Media" and I always think

01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:20.030
of news media because that's really
what I study day in, day out.

01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:23.820
And on that topic, I was looking
at Facebook last night and happened

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:26.070
to see a post by one of my
graduate students who was talking

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:29.320
about her 7-year-old daughter
and she was reporting a story

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:32.120
of a conversation she'd had
with her daughter last night.

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.130
And her daughter had said
to her, 'did you know years

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:38.340
and years ago people use to get
their news from papers' [laughter].

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:42.420
And she's reporting the
story back and she said,

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:46.320
'I turned to my daughter and I said
yes, they're called newspapers.'

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.510
And her daughter looked at her
and said, 'were you alive then?'

01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:56.180
[ Laugther ]

01:10:56.180 --> 01:11:00.010
And that's what it's come to folks.

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:04.340 position:56%
But this idea, not that we
necessarily need to have newspapers,

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.230
I'm very split on the idea of
whether we'll have printed papers

01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:08.990
in the next 40, 50 years.

01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:11.280
But that is not the
goal of this panel.

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.730
But this idea that we
need to preserve the media

01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:18.330
and preserve the content that we're
producing today is front and center

01:11:18.330 --> 01:11:20.160
to the discussion that
I'm hoping we're going

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.330
to engage with right now.

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:25.330
In my own research, I
spent a lot of time looking

01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:27.200
at archived digital news media.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.060
And I found that it's
critically important to have rich

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:35.230
and detailed archives of news
and of events that have occurred

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:37.240
across the globe for many,
many different reasons

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.890
and I'll give you just
two really quick examples.

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:44.060
One, is go back to for instance
the events that occurred

01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.990
around Hurricane Katrina.

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:50.680
CNN at the time was online news
source that did quite a bit

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.760
to cover Hurricane Katrina.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.750
And created their own special
archive for Hurricane Katrina

01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:58.090
and you can go to CNN's website
and I believe it's still on there.

01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:59.730
Did not check just
now to see if it is.

01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:03.360
But they have a repository of
Hurricane Katrina news coverage.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.830
And if you go and you
look at that, it's been,

01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:07.330
it's essentially been cleaned up.

01:12:07.330 --> 01:12:10.190
It is not the coverage
that you will find if you

01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:12.300
for instance go to
the internet archive.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.870
And if you go to the
internet archive and look

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:16.920
at the very same coverage from
CNN and actually look at what was

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.290
on the web at the time,
it's a very different story.

01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:22.620 position:56%
And the point being, we need
accurate archives because we do need

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:24.800
to understand actually
what occurred at the time.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:27.900
So, as we start to think about
these issues and importance

01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:32.030
of archiving news media in
the modern landscape of media

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:35.840
and social media, just a couple
thoughts that I'll put out there

01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:38.340 position:56%
as you hear our presentations today.

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.050
Think about this idea of what
is news, and what are media.

01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:42.950
What are we saving?

01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:44.250
What is a journalist?

01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:45.680
Who is reporting on an event?

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.980
Who is reporting on news?

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:48.280
And how do we record that?

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:53.300
These are clearly hard questions
to answer, but these are some

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:55.970
of the challenges that we face in
thinking about saving the media.

01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:58.860
So, with that I'm going to
introduce our first panelist

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:00.940
and then I'm going to take a
seat down here so that I can help

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.730
to keep us on track today.

01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:06.420
And our first panelist is
my colleague Phil Napoli

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.360
from Rutgers University.

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:11.950
Phil is a professor in
journalism in media studies as well

01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:14.020
as the associate dean of
research at the school

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:15.890
of communication and information.

01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:18.530
Beyond being a fantastic colleague

01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:20.750
and someone I have been
fortunate enough to work

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:24.500 position:56%
with for the past couple years, Phil
is leading a new project looking

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:29.080
at local news media and
developing new methods and measures

01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.490
for understanding local
news media coverage.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:32.980
And then, lastly, I will say

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:35.830
that unfortunately Phil is
leaving Rutgers University

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:38.170
and breaking my research heart.

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:39.990
And joining Duke University

01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:42.830
as a James R. Shipley
Chair of Public Policy.

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:44.360 position:56%
He'll be starting there in the fall.

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:46.530
So, with that I'll hand
things over to Phil.

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:47.830
&gt;&gt; PHILIP NAPOLI: All right thanks.

01:13:47.830 --> 01:13:49.160
So, seated I'm good?

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.580
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: What's
your preference?

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:52.880
&gt;&gt; PHILIP NAPOLI: I'm happy to sit.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.660
I don't have any slides
or anything like that.

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.700
Hi everybody.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:03.310
Thanks, Matt, I'm talking today I
guess really as a social scientist,

01:14:03.310 --> 01:14:09.440
as a wannabe user of all of this
archival data that don't yet exist

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.980
to serve all of my needs.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:15.240
And as Matt mentioned I sort of
have interest in the relationship

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.580
between media and public policy.

01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:18.720
And so, I wanted to
kick off really sort

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:20.020
of continuing what you were talking

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:21.830
about which is why
this matters so much.

01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:23.440
Just to give you an example.

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.630
I came here because you know being
here in DC reminded me of something

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:28.660
that happens in this
city every four years.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.960
And I hope this will sort
of illustrate why this is

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.400
such an important area to archive,

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.880
but every four years the Federal
Communications Commission is

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.340
required by Congress to
evaluate the adequacy

01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:42.430
of its media ownership regulations.

01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:44.560
And you're like what's he talking
about why does this matter?

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.920
But this is something I get
involved with every four years

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.590
and for you know quite a while now.

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:52.240 position:56%
And the fascinating part about it is

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.140
that every four years the FCC
commissions a series of studies

01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.320
and the goal of these studies
is to determine whether

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.200
or not these regulations
need to be altered,

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.480
strengthened relaxed etcetera.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:07.950
And every four years most of these
studies say the exact same thing,

01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:12.250 position:56%
they all have a disclaimer that says
something along the lines of yes,

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.550
it would have been nice to
really investigate this question

01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:19.540
in a rigorous way, however,
the data don't exist.

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:22.840
So, you know the FCC is trying
to answer questions like,

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.700
you know what effect
does concentration

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:28.580
of media ownership have on
the diversity of the quality

01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.320
or the quantity of local news.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.550
Is there some relationship between
the characteristics of the owners

01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:35.280
of various news outlets

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.560
and the ideological
orientation of the content?

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.350
And literally every four years they
try to remake the wheel and try

01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:44.630
to come up with studies and
they've never developed any kind

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:47.890
of systematic data archive
to answer these questions.

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:50.070
And every four years the
studies basically say,

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:53.570
yep we're a bad study,
but here it is and go try

01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:56.860
to make decisions based on it.

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:01.280
And to me it just highlights
how important having that sort

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:05.970
of archive of the performance
of our journalistic system,

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:08.570
and especially there was a point
I really want to emphasize today,

01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:12.270
is that this sort of archiving,
and we haven't talked about it much

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:16.940
in this dimension has to
drill down to the local level.

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:18.480
And that's something
that we're dealing

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.520
with now in our current research.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:25.480
So, you know from a lot of this
type of, these types of concerns,

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.970 position:56%
the FCC did something else recently,
they wanted to assess the extent

01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:33.080
to which community's critical
information needs were being met.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.670
I don't know if anyone followed
this, this was a couple years ago,

01:16:35.670 --> 01:16:40.450
and just doing that research was
so politically you know toxic,

01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:43.700
that the research got cancelled
because they were actually going

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.690
to go in and actually
talk to journalists

01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:46.990
about how they do their job.

01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:49.850
But nobody had a problem,
which is kind of interesting,

01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:51.570
with the process, which has
been happening for years,

01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:54.530
of actually studying
journalistic output.

01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:58.620
But once again the data aren't
really there to do that.

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:03.010
So, we've been working on a project
where, we're essentially going

01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:08.450
to gather, with the help of
the Internet Archive and Matt,

01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:12.410
the totality of journalistic output
for a sample of 100 communities

01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:16.790
in the US, for only about 7
days, I should mention that.

01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:21.140
And the idea is whether they
are a television station

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:23.390
or a radio station, or
a hyper local news site

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:29.460 position:56%
that you're web presence represents,
you know some reasonable indicator

01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:32.320
of your commitment to
produce in journalism.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:33.790
And the idea is to start to try

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:36.650
to inform this other very
pressing policy issue today,

01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:39.390
or course which is
essentially what do we do

01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:43.070
about the ongoing crisis
in journalism.

01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:47.740
And how do we inform
efforts to try to address it.

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:50.620
So, there are a number of
foundations, fortunately,

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:55.320
that we have here in the US that
really want to provide assistance

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.360
to keep local journalism robust
in the face of the variety

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:02.880 position:56%
of technological and economic
conditions that are making it a less

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.290
and less viable enterprise.

01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:06.590
But they don't know.

01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:09.270
You know what are the real
contours of this crisis.

01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:13.850
What kind of communities is
the crisis worse versus better?

01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:16.460
What are the conditions
that help us understand

01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:18.500
where this crisis is
really pronounced?

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:22.740 position:56%
So, we're trying to gather that kind
of data essentially on the output

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.330
and the performance
and the infrastructure

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:27.400
of journalism at the local level.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.980 position:56%
And it was interesting as we started

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:33.860
to do this work we realized there
really is no precedent for it.

01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:37.440
You know the archiving
of journalistic content,

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.360
especially at the local level.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:46.210
If you wanted to do a study on
you know local radio's coverage

01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:50.470
of an issue from six months ago,
you'd have basically nothing.

01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:52.210
Local TV same thing.

01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:58.590 position:56%
And again, we know this is the case
when we talked about online content.

01:18:58.590 --> 01:19:01.800
So, this entire media ecosystem,
and we use that term a lot

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.010
in our research now to really try
to understand the interconnections

01:19:05.010 --> 01:19:07.790
between old and new
media, but also recognizing

01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:12.040
that our media have converged
to a sufficient extent now

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:18.280
that you really can use web content
as a window into the totality

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.790
of a community's media ecosystem.

01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:24.170
And so, that's where the archiving

01:19:24.170 --> 01:19:28.650
of this content becomes
so important.

01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:32.520
Because we don't know, you know we
have these broad generalizations

01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:34.470
about what's happening in
journalism, and in fact

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:38.440
but very little of it is
based on actual efforts

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:43.480
to understand the context in which
journalism maybe matters the most,

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.620
which is that local level.

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.540
The community media.

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.820
The context in which
your vote etcetera.

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:55.130
You know when you look at
these issues from a national

01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:57.620
or international level, the same
kinds of problems don't exist.

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:59.640
There are really great archives

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.040
of nightly network newscasts
and things like that.

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:04.010
But if you wanted to get a sense

01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:10.010
of how the local news was covering
something like Katrina, or whether

01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:15.530
or not you know different types of
levels of competition had positive

01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:18.320
or negative effects on
the state of local news.

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:23.320
Answering questions that could
truly guide policies directed

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:26.920
at making sure that we
have a media ecosystem

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.680
that really serves citizens well,
that creates an informed citizenry

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.810
that really, you know enhances
the democratic process.

01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:37.710
We have been flying blind in
that area for a very long time.

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:42.170
And again, that's the irony is
that it's not a web based problem,

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:46.670 position:56%
it's something that's characterized,
all of our electronic media leading

01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:49.860
up to this that you know, it's
still easier to do a study

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:54.270
of news coverage from literally
1940 than it is to do a study

01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:56.890
of news coverage from
you know a year ago.

01:20:56.890 --> 01:21:00.550
Because you know what they did a
great job of archiving newspapers.

01:21:00.550 --> 01:21:02.140
It's all there, but if you want

01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:04.060
to you know really
study the complexities

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:06.880
of today's media ecosystem,
it's challenging.

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.190
And so, that's what's fun
about what we're doing

01:21:10.190 --> 01:21:11.490
with the internet archiving.

01:21:11.490 --> 01:21:12.970 position:56%
And Jefferson is fortunately saddled

01:21:12.970 --> 01:21:15.850
with solving this problem,
even there.

01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:18.910
We handed them a list of URL for
all these local media outlets.

01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:22.180
And they said, jeez, yeah, know
this falls below our radar a lot

01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:24.360
of this stuff, because
it comes and goes too.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:28.940
Local media these days is so,
you know outlets come, they go,

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:30.660
you know they go out of business.

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:33.240
It's a very you know
sort of dynamic space.

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.600
And it's a space, that which
again the audiences for a lot

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.260
of this stuff fall below thresholds
that you might think would matter

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.390
for a sort of large
archiving project.

01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:45.690
But we're trying to drill down to
this local level now, and hope,

01:21:45.690 --> 01:21:49.570
you know, trying with the logic
that whether it's the economy,

01:21:49.570 --> 01:21:51.470
or the environment, or jobs,

01:21:51.470 --> 01:21:55.190
or education that we've always
had these regular indicators,

01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:57.950
these ways we could take the
temperature of how's the economy

01:21:57.950 --> 01:22:00.550
in this state, or how's
the economy in this region.

01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:04.700 position:56%
We've never had that about, you know
hey how's journalism doing here?

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.490
Because journalism whether,
you know all the ways you learn

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:10.690
about the economy,
education, etcetera journalism,

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:12.050
at least traditionally has been,

01:22:12.050 --> 01:22:15.160
maybe it's decreasing extent,
the mechanism for that.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.890
But we have no, we have sort of the
you know thank God for you guys,

01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:22.480 position:56%
you know the state of the news media
that we have sort of broadly right?

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.960
But now, you know can
we drill down deeper?

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.690
And sort of understand
how a community

01:22:28.690 --> 01:22:33.680
in New Jersey's journalism,
you know ecosystem has evolved?

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.980
Is it getting stronger?

01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.280
Is it getting weaker?

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:37.580
And does it need help?

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.890
So, these are the big questions
we're trying to deal with

01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:42.920
and thank God folks
like Matt and Jefferson

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:46.270
and the Internet Archive are
helping develop the tools

01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:48.520
that will allow us to
do this kind of work.

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.050
But again, it's not just you
know historical internet,

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:57.180
it's truly trying to inform policy
that you know that it's that kind

01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.540
of relevance to this kind of work.

01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.840
So, I'll stop there.

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.640
Thanks.

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:07.890
[ Applause ]

01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:09.340
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: All
right thank you Phil.

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.810
Our second panelist is Ramesh Jain,
he's the Donald Bren Professor

01:23:12.810 --> 01:23:16.760 position:56%
in information and computer sciences
at University of California Irvine.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.690
We were fortunate earlier today
to be joined by one of the fathers

01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:21.930
of the internet, and we are
now joined by the father

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.420
of multimedia [laughter].

01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:36.350
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: So,
everybody's awake?

01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:37.650
Looks like that.

01:23:37.650 --> 01:23:42.320
So, what I'm going to do is to
talk about some of the issues

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:46.600
that in my opinion are
burning issues particularly

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.240
when we are talking
about saving the web

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:53.990
and the way information is
nowadays getting created.

01:23:53.990 --> 01:24:02.010
Let me start with one simple chart,
and that is in fact if we think

01:24:02.010 --> 01:24:05.220
about it, this century
is really very different

01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.520
from the last century.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.520
There is a pretty interesting
diagram

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:16.150
that maybe Miguel put last year,
or somebody else put it last year.

01:24:16.150 --> 01:24:19.440
When you look at this diagram,

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.550
this brings in some very
interesting perspective.

01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:26.510
When we start looking at
this diagram what you find is

01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:30.530
that these are the analog
cameras that were being sold.

01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:35.110
And then you suddenly come here
and the world completely changes.

01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:37.720
And when you look at these trends,

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:46.810 position:56%
as you see this trend really started
taking place between 1999 and 2001.

01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:51.100
This is very interesting
and serious implications.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:56.580
Matt told you a story about the
daughter and about then newspaper.

01:24:56.580 --> 01:25:02.010
I had a very similar experience,
not secondhand but firsthand.

01:25:02.010 --> 01:25:06.660
My own granddaughter who
is now about 8 years old.

01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:13.470
Two years ago, she comes to me with
a CD and says she calls me nana,

01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:18.810
she says, 'nana my mother
is not telling me the truth.

01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:22.370
She says that music comes
out of these CDs,' right?

01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:24.770
'Out of this device.'

01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:26.480
And I said, 'yeah that it true.'

01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:28.060
She said, 'no that is not true.

01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:32.760
Music comes out of iPod.'

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:35.780
And that's part of the world
happening, but more interesting

01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:39.560
that that is really
this particular case.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:45.430
When you start looking at the
world, for most of us here,

01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:49.070
and this is very closely related
to what we were talking about data,

01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:51.450
metadata and all these
kinds of things.

01:25:51.450 --> 01:25:59.410
For most of us, until very
recently we tolerated photos,

01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:02.540
we tolerated videos
in our documents.

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:05.840
We still have to pay
extra for color photos

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.030
for getting things printed
and things like that.

01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:13.570
That was the world
that we grew up in.

01:26:13.570 --> 01:26:16.030
That's the world that
people are thinking even

01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:20.940
in this room indirectly or
directly about libraries.

01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:24.630
What is happening is that the
world has changed completely.

01:26:24.630 --> 01:26:28.090
When you start looking at
the world, the type of thing

01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:32.640
that people started doing, the type
of devices that started coming,

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:38.110
the way information started
getting created is very different

01:26:38.110 --> 01:26:43.410
for young generation now, at
our age, we tolerated photos

01:26:43.410 --> 01:26:47.520
and videos in test, reluctantly.

01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.390
For the young generation, they
go to Instagram and Snap Chat.

01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:54.700
Why? They don't want to use text.

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:58.390 position:56%
They tolerate text very reluctantly.

01:26:58.390 --> 01:27:01.880
And that's the world that
we now have to consider.

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.180
That's what is happening.

01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:09.510 position:56%
So, when you start considering this,
it has very serious philosophical

01:27:09.510 --> 01:27:11.250
and long term implications.

01:27:11.250 --> 01:27:15.560
When you think about the world,
and when we present the world,

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:21.490
there are two things that
we use, objects and events.

01:27:21.490 --> 01:27:25.900
Our current thinking, and
dominated by computer scientists,

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:27.930
we deal with the object-oriented
programming,

01:27:27.930 --> 01:27:30.380
we talked about object-oriented
databases

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.380
and all these kind of things.

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:35.360
We were very object-centric.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.070
But in the modern world when we are
dealing with all of these strings

01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:40.660
of data coming in etcetera.

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:43.740
And when we are dealing
with Twitters of the world,

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:49.160
when we are dealing with Facebook,
events are becoming as important,

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:53.020
possibly more important
than object space.

01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.320
What does that mean?

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.230
That means the following thing.

01:27:56.230 --> 01:28:01.100
We have to learn how to represent
events and how to deal with events.

01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:06.380
And when we deal with
events, these famous 5 W

01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:09.040
and 1 H become extremely important.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.490
For events, when you want

01:28:11.490 --> 01:28:15.770
to represent events there are
these six important filters.

01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:25.160
It started from where,
when, what, why, how?

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:30.430
And all this information
none of them is metadata.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:31.730
Everything is data.

01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:38.280
The pictures and the documents they
are the experiential information.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:43.490
The informational component is
in order to structuralize that,

01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:45.800
the information that
you start capturing,

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:47.620
you start putting in information.

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.740
You cannot interpret photos.

01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:51.450
You cannot interpret videos.

01:28:51.450 --> 01:28:52.750
So, what do you do?

01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:54.580
You analyze those,
you use deep learning,

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:58.500
or you use context learning or
whatever to get some information

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.890
that you can use for
indexing purposes

01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:02.990
and you start dealing
with that okay.

01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:04.650
So, that's what you start doing.

01:29:04.650 --> 01:29:08.600
So, when you start looking at these
charts, you start seeing that all

01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:12.910
that information the 5 Ws
and 1 H it starts coming

01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:16.150
in directly from different sources.

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:22.390
And one of your goals becomes how
do we populate on this information.

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:24.420
Okay. Once you do this for event,

01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:26.590
then you have some
structure of events.

01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:30.990 position:56%
Okay. So, you can start representing
all those things completely.

01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:34.420
And once you have done this then
you can very easily start dealing

01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.720
with this.

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:39.090
And in computing term you start
representing this using media this

01:29:39.090 --> 01:29:43.500
on and whatever way you want to
do and you start populating this.

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:49.060
So, for each event you start
creating this kind of a structure.

01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:50.830
Indeed, the structures are good.

01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:53.500
You have the substructures,
you have the super structures,

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:54.800
everything gets linked.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:00.320
Effectively what you start doing
now is, in place of creating a web

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:03.670
of document that you have
created, now you are starting

01:30:03.670 --> 01:30:06.590
to create a web of events.

01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:12.560
You remember we talked about doing
these things very differently.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.580
When you start thinking about
this and when you start thinking

01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:20.520
about doing search, the
way you start searching,

01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:25.020
the way you start navigating
also becomes very different.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:30.060
See, for example, suppose you
are looking at some pictures.

01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:34.190
We are told how do we
search for a picture.

01:30:34.190 --> 01:30:38.410 position:56%
That's where you will start
thinking more about metadata prints.

01:30:38.410 --> 01:30:40.210
If I want to search from a picture,

01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:43.750
I have to go to a steering
wheel of sorts.

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:47.610
We have to get out of that
narrow [inaudible] box.

01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:53.150
We have to get out of that and
we have to have the complete view

01:30:53.150 --> 01:30:56.060
of this space and we
have to start navigating.

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:59.260
So, when you start navigating
this, in the current world then

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:03.000 position:56%
for example, in order to demonstrate
this, there are four components.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:08.340
So, if you start looking for I
want to see all the events related

01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:12.980
to this particular picture, or what
happened in this particular thing,

01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:15.000
oops I'm going the wrong direction.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.730
Okay, it will show me
all those pictures.

01:31:18.730 --> 01:31:20.770
If I want to see at
the same location,

01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:26.390
I want to see the same
images that it resulted,

01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:29.340
or the same person
who is in the picture.

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:32.380
So, this is how we start
navigating these things.

01:31:32.380 --> 01:31:35.850
We are organizing this now
as a different kind of web.

01:31:35.850 --> 01:31:41.020
When we start considering this
and we are about journalism

01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:43.720
and all this kind of thing,

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:47.900
what Twitter does is
it creates a microblog.

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:51.150
What you require really
is a micro report.

01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:55.920
In journalism, the first principles
are you should be objective,

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:59.210
you should try to report as
honestly as possible things.

01:31:59.210 --> 01:32:02.390
Opinions should be
separated from facts.

01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:04.080
That's the first principle.

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.190
The difference between
facts and opinions.

01:32:06.190 --> 01:32:12.030
If you want to capture reports,
then in each report for the event,

01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:14.340
you have to learn how to do that.

01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:17.880
Luckily for us, we can
do that very easily now,

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:22.060
because we have these smartphones.

01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:27.960 position:56%
When I take a picture, my smartphone
is really taking a report.

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:31.970
And in this report, I have
the location, I have the time,

01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:36.100
based on this I can do the
contextual reasoning I know

01:32:36.100 --> 01:32:38.690
and I can show you a
system working on my phone

01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:40.900
where I'm taking each
picture it will tell

01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:43.120
that this is the event
going on here.

01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.950
It becomes a report here,
it will tell me exactly

01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:48.360
which room the particular
thing is going on.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:51.480
It could even tell me that
today's program was available,

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:55.550
who is speaking, and what's
going on in that thing.

01:32:55.550 --> 01:32:58.950
So, your report will be
very, very objective.

01:32:58.950 --> 01:33:02.610
Of course, you can add
your subjective information

01:33:02.610 --> 01:33:04.670
to those things also there.

01:33:04.670 --> 01:33:10.550
So, what we did was to see
an experiment in library.

01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:14.550
Definitely Flickr from
Yahoo announce

01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:19.300
that they will make 100
million photos available

01:33:19.300 --> 01:33:21.430
to people for experiment data.

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:25.930
And these 100 million photos
have some of the contextual data,

01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:27.940
the cloud metadata, they have some

01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:33.270
of the concept [inaudible]
applied and that will be done.

01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:38.330
So, what we did was to run
an experiment we said suppose

01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:40.640
that in the library of
future all these kinds

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:44.890
of reports are available, these
kind of things, can we go and look

01:33:44.890 --> 01:33:49.590
at each photo as a report
or as a micro report

01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:54.420
and can get some interesting
information out of that.

01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:57.150
That experiment we
did learn something.

01:33:57.150 --> 01:34:01.090 position:56%
And I just want to mention that this
is currently doing for Flickr data,

01:34:01.090 --> 01:34:04.310
there's no reason that we
can go and use every picture

01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:05.750
that you are taking in this room

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:09.310
or anywhere else can
become part of that.

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:12.930
So, when you start doing
this something really start

01:34:12.930 --> 01:34:15.060
happening there.

01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.150
Suppose that you want to
find out Olympic games

01:34:17.150 --> 01:34:20.860
and I must say this example was
motivated because I was invited

01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:23.210
by London people here and so on.

01:34:23.210 --> 01:34:28.900
So how do we detect Olympic
games from all these photos?

01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:35.080
So, what you can do is that Olympic
games take place every fourth year.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.600
And for this I define
some particular concepts.

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:41.000
Now, in each picture
I have the concepts.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.190
So, what I start doing is I
got and plot those concepts.

01:34:45.190 --> 01:34:48.750
And this is showing now you
the plots of different things.

01:34:48.750 --> 01:34:53.710
I look at the peaks which are
appearing and I immediately find

01:34:53.710 --> 01:34:56.650
out that in London there
are Olympic games going

01:34:56.650 --> 01:34:58.330
on at this particular time.

01:34:58.330 --> 01:35:02.900 position:56%
And you can see the peaks there that
immediately start showing you there.

01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:06.240
You see a secondary peak, this
was for the [inaudible] Olympics

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:09.580
that were going on immediately
after the Olympics and so on.

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.480
So, without doing anything,

01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:15.390
just from the photos you can just
start getting all this information.

01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:19.190
So, when you start thinking about
reports, when you start thinking

01:35:19.190 --> 01:35:20.820
about in future what kind

01:35:20.820 --> 01:35:23.100
of information we are
going to be archiving.

01:35:23.100 --> 01:35:25.810
Everybody talks about every
fourth year, the election,

01:35:25.810 --> 01:35:28.700
every this game is
going on and that event.

01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:30.000
That's what really happens.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:35.250
For each event you generate
enough experiential data.

01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:39.080
You generate enough
reports related to that.

01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:41.690
And later on you the
make comments about that,

01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:44.480
and all those things
start getting linked.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:49.500
So, the important thing is if you
do not do event based indexing

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:54.300
mechanisms, we will be
creating lot of write only data.

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:56.510
Thank you very much.

01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:59.480
[ Applause ]

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:00.780
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: And
our last speaker

01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:03.660
on this panel is Katrin Weller
who is an information scientist

01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:07.020
and senior researcher at
GESIS Leibniz Institute

01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:09.510
for social sciences
in Cologne, Germany.

01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:13.470
She is also one of the
inaugural digital fellows

01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:16.140
at the Kluge Center here
and was here last year.

01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:21.440
And focuses on the use of social
media as a potential resource

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:24.820
for future historical
perspectives from the viewpoint

01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.910
of computational social science.

01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:30.950
&gt;&gt; KATRIN WELLER: Yes, great.

01:36:33.130 --> 01:36:37.210
Okay. It's such a pleasure
to be here today

01:36:37.210 --> 01:36:39.200
and I'm already quite overwhelmed

01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:42.860
by all the input I got throughout
the day and try to relate to some

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:44.660
of that during my talk now.

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.480
I'm an information scientist.

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.090 position:56%
I did my PhD in information science,

01:36:49.090 --> 01:36:52.120
but I also studied history
in my magister degree.

01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:55.690
So, I also have some experience
in working as a historian

01:36:55.690 --> 01:37:01.000
and doing some archival work and
somehow the internet distracted me

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.470
and I got into information science.

01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:05.380
And I'm so happy that I now can
bring these two perspectives

01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:06.790
together again.

01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:10.550
What I want to highlight
today is the importance

01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:16.710
of also archiving information
about the context of digital media,

01:37:16.710 --> 01:37:23.870
of web data, of online data, in
addition to the technical parts

01:37:23.870 --> 01:37:27.870
that we may be already
archiving in some project

01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:29.880
which we have seen today.

01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:34.590
I'm saying that because
there's quite some resemblance

01:37:34.590 --> 01:37:39.100
of social media data
and prior sources

01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:41.440
that historians used to work with.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:44.800
But there's also some
editions that are new to that

01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:47.780
and that we will keep
track of in order

01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:50.620
to make sense of that later on.

01:37:50.620 --> 01:37:56.560
So, I'm not so much worried
about getting every single piece

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:00.560
of information, collecting every
single tweet archiving every single

01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.050
user interaction that
has been on the web.

01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:07.900
I'm much more worried about if
we lose the important context

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:10.870
about how these types
of media were used.

01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:16.390
How users were actually interacting
through these type of portals.

01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:21.220
I mean if children today don't
believe that a CD can play music,

01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:25.890
of that news can come in form of
paper, how's anyone to believe

01:38:25.890 --> 01:38:29.490
that we use the phone to
take photo and show it

01:38:29.490 --> 01:38:32.180
to someone in like 100 years or so.

01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:34.750
So, we have to capture
these kind of context.

01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:36.840 position:56%
We have to show people how this type

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:40.290
of information was
produced and is being used.

01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:46.280
Historical sources and historical
source criticism as the way

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:50.150
that historians work and
interact with their material,

01:38:50.150 --> 01:38:55.680
often deals with text but not,
like text is not equal text.

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:57.700
So, there's a lot of
different types of text.

01:38:57.700 --> 01:39:00.210
Like we've got diaries.

01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:05.050
We've got newspapers, we've got
official documents like kind

01:39:05.050 --> 01:39:10.680
of notes to the people by a
specific ruler for example.

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:13.500
We also got multimedia content.

01:39:13.500 --> 01:39:19.130
So, in my magister degree thesis
I was studying film propaganda,

01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:21.590
British film propaganda
during the Second World War,

01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:25.230
and so I was watching these
propaganda movies, but I also had

01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:29.220
to study like the circumstances,
under which they were produced.

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:33.550
So, I had to read a lot about
different types of directors,

01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:37.570
about how the funding would
work to produce such a movie,

01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:41.930
how the cinema systems worked, who
could afford buying a cinema ticket

01:39:41.930 --> 01:39:43.320
to see one of these movies.

01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.430
A lot of things like that.

01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:49.020
There's artifacts of
different sorts.

01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:54.050
And, some of these things
directly relate to digital media.

01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:58.160
So, for example we've got war
diaries in forms of blogs.

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:01.060
So people blog about their
experience during war.

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:06.760
We've got like, what used to be
the kind of leaflets displayed

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:10.030
to the people can now
become in form of a Tweet

01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:12.590
by the president for example.

01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:15.850
And we've also got lots and lots

01:40:15.850 --> 01:40:19.010
of eyewitness accounts
in multimedia formats.

01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:25.250
For example Flickr on YouTube and
on other channels, which are added.

01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:26.830
We've got lots of maps,

01:40:26.830 --> 01:40:28.830
we've already seen
pretty examples of maps.

01:40:28.830 --> 01:40:33.530
And we've got maps that track how
users interact, how they behave,

01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:35.940
how they move through space.

01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:39.540
So, lots of new kinds
of data in this regard.

01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:43.810
This is the comment line
from an online newspaper.

01:40:43.810 --> 01:40:48.580
So, we've got news, quite similar
to the news we got on paper.

01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:52.600
Or we've got users directly
sharing it in different platforms.

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.980
Commenting on it on
the news website.

01:40:54.980 --> 01:41:00.270
And finally, we've got people
reporting about news events.

01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:05.290
That is the history of the
Wikipedia article about the landing

01:41:05.290 --> 01:41:07.300
of the plane on the Hudson River,

01:41:07.300 --> 01:41:09.960
and event that was
prominently tweeted

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:13.040
about first before it
entered the traditional news.

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:16.010
And kind of people
also responded to that

01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:17.790
by setting up a Wikipedia article.

01:41:17.790 --> 01:41:21.140
We can see the history
of how that article grew.

01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:22.790
And there's differences
whether you look it

01:41:22.790 --> 01:41:24.740
up in the English Wikipedia version

01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:26.880
or another language
version of course.

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.660
So, lots of different
types of sources.

01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:33.700
Okay, so in traditional
historical studies.

01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:36.050
For example, if you want
to make sense of something

01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:40.290
like that you will have to
know quite a bit about how

01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:42.470
to handle such types of sources.

01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:50.330 position:56%
So, numismatics as the kind of study
of coins, is a field where you have

01:41:50.330 --> 01:41:54.130
to learn about what does a symbol
mean that is displayed on a coin.

01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:57.790
What does it mean if a head is
displayed in a specific way?

01:41:57.790 --> 01:42:00.960
What are the symbols that
may be placed around them?

01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:03.520
Why are they using
specific types of images?

01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:06.400
Why are they writing
specific types of letters?

01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:09.320
There's an entire, you can
kind of spend two semesters

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.740
in university just learning
about how this works.

01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:16.790
Also, how the material was chosen,
how the coins were produced.

01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:19.180
All these kind of things.

01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:21.560
What if our artifact
looks like that?

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:26.150
What do we know about how
something like that was produced?

01:42:26.150 --> 01:42:27.670
What symbols are used here?

01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:31.530
Why is something displayed
in the way it is?

01:42:31.530 --> 01:42:36.380
What does at POTUS
means in this sense?

01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:39.160
We have to know that maybe
this account is moving

01:42:39.160 --> 01:42:40.950
on from one president to the other.

01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:43.550
Maybe it is staying
with one president.

01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:47.650
We have to know how
multimedia is displayed

01:42:47.650 --> 01:42:49.970
in this kind of information.

01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:52.250
What it means to retweet something.

01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:55.260
All this kind of information.

01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:58.940
What if we don't get
this, but only that.

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:02.880
So, what if instead
of the visual display

01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:07.410
of a tweet the only thing that's
being stored is its tweet ID,

01:43:07.410 --> 01:43:11.810
or maybe the JSN file with the
textual information behind it

01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:15.000
but not the visual
information around it.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.990
Does that ring a bell with someone?

01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:22.160
What's this hashtag January 25?

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:27.010
Well you may probably
rather recognize this one.

01:43:27.010 --> 01:43:31.960
So, during the Arab Spring movement
people were quite frequently using

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:36.660
the hashtag Egypt, but only
after like five or six days

01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:39.290
after the events unfolded.

01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:41.560
Prior to that they were
using other hashtags

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.300
like the January 25 hashtag.

01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:51.230
So the context we have to be aware
of is these standards may change.

01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:54.640
If you want to study an event
like the Arab Spring movement

01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:56.590
in the future you will have

01:43:56.590 --> 01:44:00.240
to be aware how people
actually talked about it.

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:06.450 position:56%
What were the key hashtags probably,
or the key references you needed

01:44:06.450 --> 01:44:09.090
in order to take part
of the discussion.

01:44:09.090 --> 01:44:11.990
The same is for user account names.

01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:14.060
So, user account names are changed,

01:44:14.060 --> 01:44:16.310
for example on Twitter
are changing a lot.

01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:20.680
I only studied soccer clubs
in different countries

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:24.060
and already had trouble with these
soccer clubs always changing their

01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:27.940
Twitter handles and really
being in trouble in figuring

01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:31.640
out which was the current official
handle of that soccer club.

01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:34.970
So if you have the same with
eyewitnesses during events

01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:38.970
like that, or with presidents,
or with other actors,

01:44:38.970 --> 01:44:40.370
that's getting really complicated.

01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:43.390
So, you need this kind of context.

01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:46.540
And of course there's lots
and lots of other events.

01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:49.570
And this kind of multiplies.

01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:52.620
We also need context in order

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.790
to understand the evolution
of platforms.

01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:58.010
And I think that's kind
of a thing to start now

01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:59.950
to preserve the evolution

01:44:59.950 --> 01:45:02.030
of different platforms,
how the emerged.

01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:05.040
This is one of the first
drawing of Twitter,

01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:08.510
how it could look like
as a platform.

01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:13.010 position:56%
How many of you remember how Twitter
looked like in 2007 for example,

01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:17.420
or how it changed its
look and feel in 2010.

01:45:17.420 --> 01:45:21.470
It's really difficult to understand
that from our perspective today.

01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:25.960
So, some things we need to
think about today is how can,

01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:31.820
maybe today retrace how
platforms like Twitter evolved.

01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:33.680
One thing you could
look at for example,

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:38.130
these kind of things we have books
telling people how to use Twitter

01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:40.450
which will give you a lot
of screenshots and images,

01:45:40.450 --> 01:45:45.070
which can trace back sort of the
history of Twitter over time.

01:45:45.070 --> 01:45:46.370
You've also got videos.

01:45:46.370 --> 01:45:49.980
People sharing YouTube
videos of how to use Twitter,

01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:52.940
which gives you an idea
of the look and feel.

01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:55.400
But it's something you
really need to look into now,

01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:59.630
in order to understand how it
works and not leave it to the kind

01:45:59.630 --> 01:46:05.900
of people who don't recognize CDs
and newspapers anymore in 50 years.

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.200
The same about users.

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:10.380
So, if you heard about, so Lee
told about the demographics

01:46:10.380 --> 01:46:13.830
of different platforms, and that's
something you really also have

01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:15.130
to keep in mind.

01:46:15.130 --> 01:46:17.740
Who's using these platforms
at different points in time?

01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:20.620
How are these platforms being used?

01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:22.170 position:56%
How many people are actually people?

01:46:22.170 --> 01:46:25.550
Or maybe the ISS Space Station.

01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:30.410
And again, what is being
promoted to the public in terms

01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:34.060
of how you use these things, so
that's even "Facebook and Twitter

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:36.430
for Seniors, and Dummies."

01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:39.490
So, it's kind of quite interesting.

01:46:39.490 --> 01:46:44.290 position:56%
And with that I'd like to close here
and look forward to your questions.

01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:55.090
[ Applause ]

01:46:55.090 --> 01:46:57.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: So, we have plenty
of time for questions I have a list

01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:59.070
that could probably
take a half hour.

01:46:59.070 --> 01:47:02.520
I'm going to take moderator's
privilege and ask just one question

01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:05.930 position:56%
and this actually isn't my question,
this is a question that was emailed

01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:11.190
to me by Edward McCain, who works
on digital journalism preservation

01:47:11.190 --> 01:47:13.320
at the University of Missouri
and couldn't be here today,

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.960
but he said I have a burning
question I have to ask.

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.480
And it's a great one.

01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:20.580
Which is he said to me over
email, what are the ethics

01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:24.160
of news collection, and we could
say more broadly with this panel,

01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:27.820
collecting media around events,
collecting news around events.

01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:31.090
What are the ethics of news
collection without permission?

01:47:31.090 --> 01:47:34.060
Because in none of these cases
were we talking explicitly

01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:37.370
about asking people can we
take your local news site,

01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:40.530
can we take your photos of
yourself at Sydney Harbor.

01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:43.370
So, what are the ethics of
collecting without permission

01:47:43.370 --> 01:47:46.870
and should we or shouldn't
we be doing that?

01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:49.830
&gt;&gt; PHILIP NAPOLI: I, you know
thinking strictly in terms

01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:53.950
of ethics, to me there's
the thornier question goes

01:47:53.950 --> 01:47:55.640
to the issues of legality.

01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:59.870
Because I feel like ethically once
something has been disseminated,

01:47:59.870 --> 01:48:05.820
the act of keeping and analyzing
should almost be implicitly

01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:08.660
permitted by the act
of disseminating.

01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:13.910
But, as long as I can keep going,
you know it's not with the goal

01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:15.600 position:56%
of further commercializing it right?

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:18.550
Again, as someone who's worked
in this space for so long,

01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:21.680
it's been so frustrating to
watch as sort of research

01:48:21.680 --> 01:48:27.100
with a you know legitimate public
interest purpose can be stymied

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:31.270
by denials of access to
content that's already been made

01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:32.680
publicly available.

01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:35.270
That's, so to me it's you know it's
more these issues that have come

01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:38.510
up in the past about issues of
copyright and things like that

01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:41.050
that I actually don't know
the answer t. I just know

01:48:41.050 --> 01:48:44.980
that to me there's the yeah, I
mean from a research standpoint,

01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:46.640
those seem to be the
greater challenges,

01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.040
but you know maybe that's just me
being a totally heartless social

01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:54.190
scientist there, but
I just, I mean ethics,

01:48:54.190 --> 01:48:56.570
I mean you know again you
know naivety, I don't know

01:48:56.570 --> 01:49:02.480 position:56%
but I don't think ethically given
that it's already been disseminated,

01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.040
that if someone wants
to keep it and study it.

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.890
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: What about then,
the photos of myself at an event

01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:10.120
or in from of the Sydney Harbor?

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:15.190
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: Right, I think
it's related two things here.

01:49:15.190 --> 01:49:20.360
Number one is really what the
first issue you are talking

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.090
about is the privacy issue.

01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:26.870 position:56%
Whenever I'm asking somebody whether
I can take your picture or not,

01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:28.590
whether I can do that or not.

01:49:28.590 --> 01:49:30.370
That's more of a privacy issue.

01:49:30.370 --> 01:49:33.550
And when you are in public
spaces, usually it is considered

01:49:33.550 --> 01:49:35.050
that that's a weaker issue.

01:49:35.050 --> 01:49:40.900
Because people are going to
report in the public spaces.

01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:42.490
So, but that's a privacy issue.

01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:46.100
To me, ethic issue is more
in terms or reporting.

01:49:46.100 --> 01:49:47.970
Are you reporting objectively,

01:49:47.970 --> 01:49:50.540
or are you completely
reporting subjectively.

01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:54.260
Now, what is very interesting
is that even using pictures,

01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:56.510
which are considered
normally objective,

01:49:56.510 --> 01:50:00.220
people have used the picture
without giving you the context.

01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:03.040
And then they start
talking about the picture

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:04.840
as if something else had happened.

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.780
And there are lots of things
that you can find on the web,

01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:13.640 position:56%
where they will show that whole
pictures misrepresent the situation.

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:17.480
Unless you have all the
information related to picture,

01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:19.760
which is nowadays very
easily available.

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.360
So, when you take picture
from a smartphone.

01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:23.990
All the things about location,

01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:27.220
time and the in which
context you took the picture,

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:29.550
etcetera is usually available.

01:50:29.550 --> 01:50:34.520
That starts making it a
little bit more objective.

01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.990
So, to me I think the issue
in reporting particularly

01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:44.080 position:56%
with the journalism and particularly
for events is more am I being able

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:50.160
to differentiate between fact and
fiction and am I facts and opinions

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:53.820
and am I representing those
things very correctly or not?

01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:55.420
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: Which
is not easily done.

01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:57.890
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: Which
his not easily done.

01:50:57.890 --> 01:50:59.190
&gt;&gt; KATRIN WELLER: So, back home

01:50:59.190 --> 01:51:01.080
with my colleague Katarina
Cinda-Colanda [assumed spelling].

01:51:01.080 --> 01:51:05.020
We are doing a project where
we're interviewing social media

01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:08.360
researchers, or people
from different disciplines

01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:11.490
who study social media for
different types of purposes.

01:51:11.490 --> 01:51:14.590
And within these qualitative
interviews amongst others we've

01:51:14.590 --> 01:51:17.210
asked them about research ethics,

01:51:17.210 --> 01:51:19.630
what kind of ethical
considerations they have

01:51:19.630 --> 01:51:21.660 position:56%
when working with social media data.

01:51:21.660 --> 01:51:24.560 position:56%
And that's been quite
interesting, because they're really,

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:28.650 position:56%
really different perspective, often
it drills down to privacy questions.

01:51:28.650 --> 01:51:32.440
But you've got people saying,
well it's all public anyway

01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:36.010
so we don't really have
to care about that.

01:51:36.010 --> 01:51:37.310
But we also have these kind

01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:41.340
of people say that's really
a very complicated topic.

01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:44.460
Lots of people may not be aware,
or may not have been aware

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:49.670
of how public things get once
they, for example post a comment

01:51:49.670 --> 01:51:52.420
on the public Facebook page,
and they still feel like being

01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:55.620
in a protected space where only
their friends can see what they

01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:56.920
are doing.

01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:00.770
And of course, it aggregates,
once you work with aggregated data

01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:03.830
and kind of run some sort
of algorithms on them,

01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:06.000
who will for example
then say something

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:11.120
like this person's likely voting
for their party, or likely kind

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:13.400
of being a terrorist, or whatever

01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:16.450
and this implies new
forms of things.

01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:22.480
We also got people who kind of feel
the obligation to share the data

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:25.880 position:56%
because some people want to be read.

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:31.040
So, we also have this affect that
once something got really viral

01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:35.770 position:56%
on the web already, or something can
be attributed to a specific author,

01:52:35.770 --> 01:52:41.320
that you get a kind of feeling
that you have to quote this person.

01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:44.040
So, it's really an untrivial task

01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:46.740
and really something that's
still being very much debated

01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:51.370
in the community of researchers
who work with social media data.

01:52:51.370 --> 01:52:54.600
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: I just want to
add one more thing to what I said,

01:52:54.600 --> 01:53:01.050
this [inaudible] item that some
particular person doesn't want

01:53:01.050 --> 01:53:05.540
in his events, report us to come
and report objectively, okay.

01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:07.090
Now, is it an ethical issue?

01:53:07.090 --> 01:53:08.600
Or what is that?

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:11.720
Because these reporters
are trying to do their job,

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:13.350
they are not being allowed to come

01:53:13.350 --> 01:53:17.470
because somebody's
privacy is being violated.

01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:21.580
Privacy or the perception that
that person wants to prove it.

01:53:21.580 --> 01:53:23.320
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: We're
treading dangerously

01:53:23.320 --> 01:53:24.800
into political territory.

01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:27.910
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: That's why
I'm not mentioning any names.

01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:29.210
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: Without
mentioning names.

01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:31.400
And with that, thank
you for the comments.

01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:32.870
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: But that's
what the question is.

01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:34.170
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: No, I
think it is important.

01:53:34.170 --> 01:53:37.160
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: That is
exactly related to that.

01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.910
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: Well
and then can others step

01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:42.280
in as reporters and
objectively report?

01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:46.470
I think with that we
should open it to questions.

01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:48.770
We've got a couple over here.

01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:53.110
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 3: Clifford
Stultz [assumed spelling]

01:53:53.110 --> 01:53:59.590
who is a political scientist
in the UK did some early work

01:53:59.590 --> 01:54:06.970
on analyzing the causes of the
London riots a couple of years ago

01:54:06.970 --> 01:54:10.800
and he was early, and
he used YouTube reports,

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:13.130
contemporary YouTube
reports that people involved

01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:16.740
in the riots have posted
up onto YouTube.

01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:20.650 position:56%
But he commented on the fact that
he would use these and then a couple

01:54:20.650 --> 01:54:24.130
of days later they would be
taken down because the people

01:54:24.130 --> 01:54:27.830
in question had learned that
the police were using YouTube

01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:30.780
as a source of information
to try to identify people.

01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:35.490
So, perhaps I'd just like to
ask you to reflect on that

01:54:35.490 --> 01:54:39.600
because you talked about privacy,
you talked about copyright.

01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:45.160
And the fact that these
activities are not morally neutral,

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:49.320
either that we are
researching, or archiving,

01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:53.260 position:56%
or undertaking with our smartphones.

01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:59.570
And how you, it's what originally
got me into the topic of archiving,

01:54:59.570 --> 01:55:05.030
social medial, using institutional
suppository technology as a basis

01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:07.870
of doing that for researchers.

01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:12.970
But, there are given the archivists
ethical frameworks are not

01:55:12.970 --> 01:55:15.710
necessarily the same as
researchers' ethical frameworks,

01:55:15.710 --> 01:55:19.970
which are not necessarily the same
as journalists' ethical frameworks,

01:55:19.970 --> 01:55:25.060 position:56%
what do you think something like the
Library of Congress should be doing?

01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:29.150
I just turn it always onto
the Library of congress.

01:55:34.090 --> 01:55:38.390
&gt;&gt; KATRIN WELLER: One rather,
one thought that just came

01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:42.380
up to me was I remember, I
can't give the credentials

01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:45.580
to who is doing that, but
there's a project for example

01:55:45.580 --> 01:55:49.170
on archiving blogs by
Chinese, you know people

01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:51.630
who write blog posts in China.

01:55:51.630 --> 01:55:55.960 position:56%
And they are being archived before
they get censored and thus disappear

01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:58.530
because the Chinese
government takes them off.

01:55:58.530 --> 01:56:01.910
So, there's a deliberate project
on archiving this kind of content,

01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:04.170
which is being at risk
of being censored

01:56:04.170 --> 01:56:07.110
and disappearing forever kind

01:56:07.110 --> 01:56:10.320
of adding another ethical
perspective to that.

01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:14.760
Or feeling obliged to help these
people to keep that stuff public

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:19.570
in some form before
it gets taken down.

01:56:19.570 --> 01:56:25.050
And I think that's part of the
more archiving perspective on that.

01:56:25.050 --> 01:56:30.300 position:56%
When it comes to social media data,
I think you also have to distinguish

01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:35.730 position:56%
between let's say everyday user
accounts and more official accounts,

01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:41.250
like the president, the
press accounts and so on,

01:56:41.250 --> 01:56:45.460
where you have different sets of
ethical considerations to take.

01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:50.500
And one thing I think that
maybe the Library of Congress

01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:54.180
or other institutions involved in
this could start with this kind

01:56:54.180 --> 01:57:00.070 position:56%
of archiving the contents that comes
from official accounts by leaders,

01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:04.550
political leaders, other types of
elites where you can clearly assume

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:06.960
that these people know
what they are doing.

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:08.660
They are doing it for
professional reasons,

01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:11.860
and that kind of is the
first piece of the puzzle

01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:14.650
and understanding the
entire framework.

01:57:14.650 --> 01:57:18.530
But it's again, it's not trivial.

01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:23.170
&gt;&gt; PHILIP NAPOLI: I think,
things start to get muddy here,

01:57:23.170 --> 01:57:27.220
if we're truly focusing on
news media and journalism,

01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:30.400
or more broadly because you know
I'm thinking about something

01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.770
like the right to be
forgotten, right and if you think

01:57:34.770 --> 01:57:37.740
about the layering of ethical
considerations that goes with that.

01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:40.240
There is a news outlet
that presumably went

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:45.960
through the right ethical protocol
involved in reporting a story.

01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:50.630
Now, if that story lives on in
Google's archive link essentially

01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:54.510
and it lives on in this particular
news outlet's content archive

01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:57.830
for longer than the subject likes,
the subject can ask to have it

01:57:57.830 --> 01:58:01.010
of course petition for Google
to remove the link to the story.

01:58:01.010 --> 01:58:05.030
So, there's an interesting, you
know presumably ethically there's a

01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:10.060
reason why the archive of this
story should not be as accessible

01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:12.620
as it currently is
essentially, but yet the right

01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:15.010
to be forgotten has
never yet been extended

01:58:15.010 --> 01:58:18.020
to the original reporting
outlet if I understand it right

01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:22.310 position:56%
that you can't go to the news outlet
and say you have to take this story

01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:26.870
down because I am you know,
I haven't, you know we went

01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:28.770
through various case
studies in one of my classes.

01:58:28.770 --> 01:58:32.370
Well, I haven't you know
beaten my wife in 15 years,

01:58:32.370 --> 01:58:34.680
so how can you still have
this story accessible?

01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.980
I mean that's a real example.

01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:42.180 position:56%
But the fact that nobody is claiming
that that person has a right

01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:44.630
to demand that the news
outlet remove that story

01:58:44.630 --> 01:58:48.900 position:56%
from their archive, but there is
some right that they have for Google

01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:50.600
to not make it easy to find it.

01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:52.760
You know I'm not answering
the question here,

01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:55.460
except sort of again
showing you how these layers

01:58:55.460 --> 01:59:00.570
of etherical considerations that
sort of cascade over each other.

01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:03.820
But yet when you get to these
questions around the issue of yeah,

01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:09.200
you know this was my Facebook page
and all my postings and my comments

01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:11.900
and what right do people have to
store that and make use of it,

01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:15.780
that's I mean to me the level of
overlap is almost minimal there.

01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:17.170
They are very different
kettles of fish.

01:59:17.170 --> 01:59:18.940
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: We may need
Jefferson to come back up and talk

01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:21.670
about legal requests that the
Internet Archive has received.

01:59:21.670 --> 01:59:24.530
Although he's shaking his head no.

01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:28.340
I think we had another
hand directly behind Les.

01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:30.830
&gt;&gt; NICHOLAS HILAGIS: Hi.

01:59:30.830 --> 01:59:32.290
My name is Nicholas
Hilagis [assumed spelling]

01:59:32.290 --> 01:59:37.210
and I'm a research assistant
in Southampton working

01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:38.540
on [inaudible] and a lawyer.

01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:43.890
So, we talked a bit about
the legal aspect of things

01:59:43.890 --> 01:59:46.180
but to me there's also
a research ethics aspect

01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:48.700
which is completely different.

01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:51.570
Archiving even for historical
reasons is going to be mainly used

01:59:51.570 --> 01:59:56.130
for research purposes and in
any university in any study,

01:59:56.130 --> 02:00:01.620 position:56%
in order to get ethical approval,
you need to a, inform your subjects,

02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:03.860
and b, allow them to have the right

02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:06.560
to withdraw their information
at any time.

02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:10.740
So, when notification happens, as I
understand currently in archiving,

02:00:10.740 --> 02:00:15.880
but since we also archive
comments of people that have gone

02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:19.090
to a webpage and they are not even
aware, it's up to the discretion

02:00:19.090 --> 02:00:23.310
of the publisher to notify them,
maybe we should start thinking

02:00:23.310 --> 02:00:29.230 position:56%
about changing archiving practice to
allow compliance on letting subjects

02:00:29.230 --> 02:00:37.090
to withdraw their consent, I would
just like your opinion on that.

02:00:37.090 --> 02:00:38.790
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: I'll make a
quick comment on that which is

02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:41.400
that this is one of the thorny
issues as an academic researcher

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:45.230
that we muddle through with
institutional review boards

02:00:45.230 --> 02:00:51.190
at US institutions, and IRBs
which is what we refer to them as,

02:00:51.190 --> 02:00:53.330
do not know the answer
to this question.

02:00:53.330 --> 02:00:57.510
And in fact in most cases,
don't even want to wade

02:00:57.510 --> 02:01:00.890
into this water right now
because it is such a thorny issue.

02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:04.810
The attitude more or less to date
has been well, the comment is put

02:01:04.810 --> 02:01:07.340
up there, you knew you were
putting it on a public site so,

02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:10.620
we're just going wave our hands,
but I think long term that's going

02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:13.290
to become a more complicated issue.

02:01:13.290 --> 02:01:17.050
So, my short answer is there is
no answer, at least in the US

02:01:17.050 --> 02:01:19.160
at research institutions right now.

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:22.290
But it's important.

02:01:22.290 --> 02:01:24.430
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: This is not an
exact answer to your question

02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:32.680
but in 1994 David Brin wrote a
book called "Transparent Society."

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:37.800
And in that book he argued
that in future there are going

02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:41.980 position:56%
to be censors everywhere which are
going to recall each and everything.

02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:45.130
And he argued that there is
certainly no point discussing

02:01:45.130 --> 02:01:47.060
whether censor should
be put or not put.

02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:52.560
Okay. Because that's going to
happen independent of everything.

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:57.970
What needs to be discussed is
who has what information and how

02:01:57.970 --> 02:01:59.850
that information could be used.

02:01:59.850 --> 02:02:03.520
And then he argued
something very interesting.

02:02:03.520 --> 02:02:10.280
He argued that from the beginning
of technology we always argued

02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:15.150
about the convenience
versus privacy.

02:02:15.150 --> 02:02:18.540
And in the long-term
convenience always won over.

02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:21.620 position:56%
It's starting from use of checkbooks

02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:24.320
to credit cards, to
internet shopping.

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:28.040 position:56%
These are the examples that he used.

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:31.550
So, the point with
respect you are capturing

02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:37.600
where these things are
being put etcetera is going

02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:39.310
to be very difficult to stop those.

02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:41.120 position:56%
Particularly with the kind of camera

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:43.200
and all these things
that are coming in.

02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:48.180
The correct [inaudible]
society will decide is what kind

02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:50.740
of information can
be used ethically,

02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:54.210
legally where it could be
used and things like that.

02:02:54.210 --> 02:02:58.120
And this is really going
to become more important

02:02:58.120 --> 02:03:00.700
and slightly different
context with video devices.

02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:04.500
Because everybody's
collecting this information.

02:03:04.500 --> 02:03:07.580
That information is your
very personal information

02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:11.480
and that's been going to the
cloud and is being collected.

02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:13.190
So, how are you going to use

02:03:13.190 --> 02:03:15.800
that information Google
has access to that.

02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:17.280
So, people aren't thinking
always putting

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:19.490
in the architectures
for those things.

02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:21.080
So.

02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:22.570
&gt;&gt; KATRIN WELLER: Maybe
two additions.

02:03:22.570 --> 02:03:24.540
First of all, I live in a country

02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:27.780
where there actually is
no equivalent of IRBs.

02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:32.820
So, German universities don't
run through that process.

02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:34.960
Yeah.

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:36.890
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: I should
work with you.

02:03:36.890 --> 02:03:39.890
&gt;&gt; KATRIN WELLER: We've got other
legal frameworks to cover that,

02:03:39.890 --> 02:03:44.840
but I mean that's not the standard
that as a researcher you have

02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:50.400
to file something through
an IRB process.

02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:53.810
Well they've got some forms
they have to fill out.

02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:58.800
But it's not an institutionalized
board such as IRB, which is there.

02:03:58.800 --> 02:04:02.520
You have to check some boxes
on a form and that's the case

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:05.860 position:56%
and there are legal restrictions for
what you can do and what you can't.

02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:09.220
But it's working quite different
than in other parts of the world.

02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:14.890
The next thing is that I
don't believe that kind

02:04:14.890 --> 02:04:19.840
of just getting clearance
through IRB solves everything.

02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:25.870 position:56%
Because on the one hand side, that's
again more of a legal issue kind

02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:28.880
of if you just need this in
order to get the allowance

02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:31.680
to continue some processes.

02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:35.830
And if you need someone to sign
kind of an informed consent form

02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:38.830
without really being informed
or understanding what he

02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:41.320
or she is signing up
for in that moment,

02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:43.700
that doesn't really solve the
ethical issue around that.

02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:50.640 position:56%
So, it's, yeah really I join in with
your answer, there's no easy answer.

02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:51.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; PHILIP NAPOLI: I think what
makes it interesting in this context

02:04:51.980 --> 02:04:55.930
at least for the kind of work
we do on new and journalism is

02:04:55.930 --> 02:04:59.570
when it comes to IRB, it's
human subjects, all right

02:04:59.570 --> 02:05:01.530
and this, okay how do we define?

02:05:01.530 --> 02:05:03.020
When are you a human subject?

02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:05.770
To figure is it your digital
expressions online does

02:05:05.770 --> 02:05:08.800
that you know at least in part of
the research we're doing right now,

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:11.300
we're not doing research that
actually reaches the level

02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:12.600
of studying human subjects,

02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:16.010
even though we are producing the
outputs of human effort, right?

02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:20.410
And so, you know what's
the threshold for counting

02:05:20.410 --> 02:05:22.150
as a human subject is
kind of interesting

02:05:22.150 --> 02:05:25.430
when you're studying digital media.

02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:39.450
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 4: Do you think that the
role of libraries might expand to,

02:05:39.450 --> 02:05:44.210
or even if it currently does,
you know providing people

02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:49.360 position:56%
with more digital literacy and kind
of the tools that they need to make,

02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:55.070
to actually do informed consent and
to understand what their content

02:05:55.070 --> 02:05:59.430
that they're generating online
is actually how it's living

02:05:59.430 --> 02:06:02.320
and what it's actually going
to be potentially used for.

02:06:02.320 --> 02:06:05.010
Is that something that you think
libraries should be undertaking,

02:06:05.010 --> 02:06:09.510
like that education, or is it
you know the responsibility

02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:12.120
of the, you know parents?

02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:13.880
Or society in general?

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:18.280
I don't know if you want
to speak to that, but?

02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:19.580
&gt;&gt; KATRIN WELLER: Well,

02:06:19.580 --> 02:06:22.270
I think information literacy
is a very important concept.

02:06:22.270 --> 02:06:25.280
But it also adds another level

02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:28.120
of making everything more
complicated in that sense.

02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:32.630
Because as people get more
literate in using different tools,

02:06:32.630 --> 02:06:36.910
they will put on new practices
of how to use these things.

02:06:36.910 --> 02:06:39.580
So, it may probably turn
to different channels

02:06:39.580 --> 02:06:40.970
for talking to one another.

02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:42.300
So, for example once you figure

02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:45.630
out that Facebook is doing certain
things, you will use what's it

02:06:45.630 --> 02:06:49.370
for a specific task and then
you move on to some other tool.

02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:50.670
And, so on and so forth.

02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:55.250
So, it's really a very
dynamic field.

02:06:55.250 --> 02:06:58.000
It's a moving target
that you try to capture

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.570
and it's constantly involving,

02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:05.450
I'm not sure whether
libraries should be the ones

02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:06.750
to be in that position.

02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:10.910 position:56%
They should be aware of what's going
on, they should be able to take

02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:13.110
up that role when they're
asked for it.

02:07:13.110 --> 02:07:17.360
But they shouldn't be the only ones
who should take care of that role,

02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:21.750 position:56%
who will be responsible for all
this, but I think the entire dynamic

02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:30.060
on the web is like users taking up
practices and establishing forms

02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:32.570
of how to communicate
with each other.

02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:35.800
Platforms changing their
futures according to the users,

02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:39.930
putting on these new practices and
everything goes on, and on, and on.

02:07:39.930 --> 02:07:42.650
And that's really something
we need to be aware of

02:07:42.650 --> 02:07:46.140
and we keep considering
in these kind of efforts.

02:07:46.140 --> 02:07:49.700
&gt;&gt; PHILIP NAPOLI: I mean my
short answer is just going

02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:51.000
to be all of the above.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:52.300
I was waiting for the issue
of digital literacy to come

02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:54.800
up in this conversation
because I would love to know

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:57.590
from a research standpoint
how variations and levels

02:07:57.590 --> 02:08:00.310
of digital literacy
amongst individuals,

02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:03.030
you know to what extent is the
relationship between that even

02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:05.560 position:56%
at the organizational level and
what we might call chilling effects,

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:08.960
right is you know and that how much
does that input what gets produced?

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:10.260
Ultimately then what gets archived.

02:08:10.260 --> 02:08:14.910 position:56%
I mean from a research standpoint,
just we don't know enough there yet.

02:08:14.910 --> 02:08:19.080
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: I think
we have time for one

02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:22.150
or two additional questions.

02:08:22.150 --> 02:08:24.450
One over here.

02:08:28.690 --> 02:08:33.650
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 5: I know that the title
of this panel is Saving Media,

02:08:33.650 --> 02:08:39.280
but my question is about taking
it into the future really

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:44.870
that is not just saving it
historically, but your example

02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:50.410
of an article about somebody that
he beat his wife 15 years ago,

02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:56.640
wouldn't it be nice if, for example
he was, I mean it was proven not

02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:01.750
to be correct, that that particular
article would be annotated

02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:04.770
by the newer information
about the case?

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:10.880
Similarly, we read all kind of
things, vitamin D is good for you

02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:14.450
and then five years later,
don't take it you will die.

02:09:14.450 --> 02:09:19.310
Okay? Now I think that we have
an opportunity in journalism

02:09:19.310 --> 02:09:24.260
and either social media to
be try to do these linking

02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:28.780
to more recent information
on that particular topic.

02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:33.700
In other words, a [inaudible] is
very, very important and we can try

02:09:33.700 --> 02:09:42.320
to use the dynamic web to represent
the current state of knowledge.

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:43.870
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: I like
the question a lot

02:09:43.870 --> 02:09:47.680
because what it is
also emphasizing is

02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:52.410
that in our discussions
today we are not doing,

02:09:52.410 --> 02:09:55.730
we have talked very little
about the importance of time

02:09:55.730 --> 02:09:57.500
and the importance of location.

02:09:57.500 --> 02:10:02.660
And both those things are extremely
important because based on time

02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:06.040
and location you can
decide many of these things.

02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:10.240
And that we are going forward,
you allow all the tools

02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:12.320
that will link all these
things very easily.

02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:14.530
And that's happening increasingly.

02:10:14.530 --> 02:10:19.460
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: I think as well
as we are starting to become better

02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:23.090
at working with the existing
archives that we have.

02:10:23.090 --> 02:10:25.480
For instance, just
reflecting on the datathon

02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:26.810 position:56%
that we held over the past two days.

02:10:26.810 --> 02:10:28.530
As we're learning about
ways that we can work

02:10:28.530 --> 02:10:33.230
with the data I think we will start
to slowly answer these questions.

02:10:33.230 --> 02:10:35.480
By analyzing the past
we'll know more

02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:38.970
about how we can tie together
bits of information in the future

02:10:38.970 --> 02:10:42.590
to create a more coherent
longitudinal archive.

02:10:42.590 --> 02:10:44.720
Personally, as somebody who
researches on news media,

02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:46.710
that's something I would
certainly like to work towards

02:10:46.710 --> 02:10:49.970 position:56%
as we continue tinker with the data.

02:10:55.780 --> 02:10:58.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: So, maybe a two-parter
if I don't get in trouble for that.

02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:02.550
I guess, one I guess to go back
to the ethical considerations,

02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:06.230
I think the concepts of public
and sort of capital being public

02:11:06.230 --> 02:11:08.910
of you know I might be
publicly discussing something

02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:12.470
with a specific community that
I'm involved in, maybe a community

02:11:12.470 --> 02:11:16.300
of researchers, but as soon
as maybe someone studies this

02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:19.290
or a journalist decides to
publish about this, you've now sort

02:11:19.290 --> 02:11:21.460
of raised a profile of what
I was discussing in there,

02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:25.600
I think we're, what are the?

02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:27.640
How do we sort of update
our conceptions of harm?

02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:32.240
Because IRBs and most of the
institutional review boards

02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.880
across the world, they're sort

02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:36.930
of legal frameworks to
protect universities.

02:11:36.930 --> 02:11:39.700
They're not ethics,
necessarily ethics bodies.

02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:43.140
Because you know of
how they were founded.

02:11:43.140 --> 02:11:47.570
So, you know one is how do
we come together to sort

02:11:47.570 --> 02:11:50.360
of update our conceptions
of what does it mean

02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:53.420
to collect someone's geographic
information that's attached

02:11:53.420 --> 02:11:55.930 position:56%
to their photos that they're posting
on Flickr and do this in mass.

02:11:55.930 --> 02:11:59.470 position:56%
Like with our occupy datasets, we
can figure out, in my lab we figured

02:11:59.470 --> 02:12:03.520
out where followers live, you
know where they were protesting,

02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:07.130
we say the use of turning it
on and off as a protest tactic.

02:12:07.130 --> 02:12:10.220
We saw the use of deletion
of the protest tactic.

02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:11.860
So, on one hand we want

02:12:11.860 --> 02:12:15.280
to accurately reflect what was
happening on the other time,

02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:18.200
but that's also what about
the harm that we could cause,

02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:19.800
you know the Oakland
Police Department would

02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:21.690
like to subpoena our
data, they did not,

02:12:21.690 --> 02:12:24.090
but I mean if they could
subpoena our data set.

02:12:24.090 --> 02:12:25.810
They could, you know find
some of the protesters

02:12:25.810 --> 02:12:27.110
that they might like to arrest.

02:12:27.110 --> 02:12:29.530
You know we have how do we
understand those conceptions

02:12:29.530 --> 02:12:30.910
of harm, I guess I'll
stop at that one,

02:12:30.910 --> 02:12:33.510
because that might be big enough.

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:40.210
RAMESH JAIN: To me, and the view

02:12:40.210 --> 02:12:44.430
that we are discussing here
are really very complex.

02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:49.200
We want to understand them
in two different levels.

02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:55.240
Number one is the technical level
and then from the societal level.

02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:58.230
Which is more politics
and ethics related.

02:12:58.230 --> 02:13:02.000
So, in the archiving component.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:05.710
We have to see carefully what
could be done for example lots

02:13:05.710 --> 02:13:11.250
of views today about what
information should be shared,

02:13:11.250 --> 02:13:13.730
what should be discarded.

02:13:13.730 --> 02:13:17.200
So, is it based on the politics
or ethics, or is it based

02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:19.460
on the information content of it?

02:13:19.460 --> 02:13:21.590
We all know that we
do image compression,

02:13:21.590 --> 02:13:23.380
we do video compression.

02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:26.580
Are we going to do the compression
of all the data that's coming

02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:31.020
in based on only that kind
of issue, or we are going

02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:34.060
to start making the decision
based on political ethics.

02:13:34.060 --> 02:13:36.240
These two things should
be kept separate.

02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:38.530
Because the technical
development is going

02:13:38.530 --> 02:13:42.150
to take place based
on what could be done.

02:13:42.150 --> 02:13:46.010
And then we modulate that
by societal standards.

02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:48.380
Because these societal standards.

02:13:48.380 --> 02:13:50.730
Because these societal standards
are going to be governed

02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:54.690
by the current socioeconomic
and political situation.

02:13:54.690 --> 02:14:00.820
Today, what is allowed, tomorrow it
may not be allowed and vice versa.

02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:08.950
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: The technical
objects, the technical system,

02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:13.150 position:56%
then that's forever there and you
can't go oops I want it back, right?

02:14:13.150 --> 02:14:14.450
I mean so?

02:14:14.450 --> 02:14:17.580
&gt;&gt; RAMESH JAIN: Most of
the technical systems

02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:21.040
when they are developed,
then the society decides.

02:14:21.040 --> 02:14:22.950
For example, Facebook, Twitter,

02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:25.610
and all these things
are banned now in China.

02:14:25.610 --> 02:14:30.260
Because the society decided there
that it's not in their interest

02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:33.290
to allow users to use those things.

02:14:33.290 --> 02:14:35.680
But the technology they
have developed based

02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:38.020
on the technical thing,
their own systems

02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:41.640
which are sometimes correctly
used sometimes are being abused

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:44.050
by people in government.

02:14:44.050 --> 02:14:46.660
So, technical issues
and the political

02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:50.130
and social issues are different.

02:14:50.130 --> 02:14:54.160
At least that's how I see it.

02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:55.460
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: Wow.

02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:59.550
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER 6: We disagree,
but respect that.

02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:02.890
&gt;&gt; MATTHEW WEBER: On that
contentious but interesting point,

02:15:02.890 --> 02:15:05.150
I think we may draw a
line and end this panel.

02:15:05.150 --> 02:15:07.510
I want to thank everyone for
joining us up here today.

02:15:07.510 --> 02:15:18.160
[ Applause ]

02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:20.580
Wendy for closing remarks.

02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:26.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; DAME WENDY HALL: So, for
closing remarks, this is where I get

02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:28.290
to say what I want to say.

02:15:28.290 --> 02:15:31.030
All that we've been talking
about today has been driven

02:15:31.030 --> 02:15:34.510
by a revolution that started
when people started talking

02:15:34.510 --> 02:15:37.010
about machines, and computers.

02:15:37.010 --> 02:15:43.200
But in terms of the real impact
on the world, of the internet,

02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:50.440 position:56%
it started with Tim Berners-Lee put
the first website up Christmas 1990.

02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:55.300 position:56%
And in that very short space of time
our world has changed dramatically.

02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:57.810
Lee talked about this on
the panel this morning,

02:15:57.810 --> 02:16:01.930
it's hard to think back in history
what you can retrospectively see

02:16:01.930 --> 02:16:06.070
when things hugely changed,
industrial revolution and things

02:16:06.070 --> 02:16:08.590
like that, and agricultural
revolutions

02:16:08.590 --> 02:16:10.810
and the different you know ways

02:16:10.810 --> 02:16:12.700
of measuring what we
changed in society.

02:16:12.700 --> 02:16:15.930
But this has been something
that's happened in our lifetimes,

02:16:15.930 --> 02:16:21.660
which is probably the first time.

02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:25.610
And, we, as I said this
morning this system

02:16:25.610 --> 02:16:28.860
that underlies is still
very fragile.

02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:33.690
And we the thing we've been talking
about today it's so very, very,

02:16:33.690 --> 02:16:38.420
very complex that it's
almost impossible to grasp.

02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:41.330
What we've done today is
just the tip of the iceberg.

02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:44.590
We could have had days talking
about this and of course

02:16:44.590 --> 02:16:45.890
in the future people will.

02:16:45.890 --> 02:16:51.370
The you know we have when you
think about the, oh, sorry I've got

02:16:51.370 --> 02:16:55.970
to do this so I can see it
here, but when you think

02:16:55.970 --> 02:16:58.590
about the way libraries
have evolved.

02:16:58.590 --> 02:17:00.570
And somebody earlier,
I can't remember,

02:17:00.570 --> 02:17:01.870
it was lovely, was it Vint?

02:17:01.870 --> 02:17:04.680
Talked about the Library
of Alexandra

02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:07.490
and you know way back in history.

02:17:07.490 --> 02:17:14.310
And the big libraries we have today
have been evolving for centuries.

02:17:14.310 --> 02:17:18.880
And the material in them
is centuries old as well

02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.230
as decades old, and
as well as today.

02:17:22.230 --> 02:17:26.160
And the sort of ways that society
has evolved to you know people come

02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:31.860
into reading rooms and there's
these cataloging indexes,

02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:35.680
which the wonderful Dave who
I saw sneak in somewhere.

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:38.180
If you want a good tour,
tour the library talk

02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:40.020
to Dave Brunthin [assumed
spelling] over there.

02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:41.320
Took us around the catalogs,

02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:45.960
there's some wonderful
gems in the catalogs alone.

02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:48.890
These themselves are
amazing artifacts now.

02:17:48.890 --> 02:17:51.650
Right? The catalogs.

02:17:51.650 --> 02:17:54.390
And I've been privileged to be
in this wonderful Kluge Center

02:17:54.390 --> 02:17:55.690
where people come and do research.

02:17:55.690 --> 02:17:58.600
And most people in the Kluge
Center read books and write books.

02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:00.110
I don't do that.

02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:02.870
I network, but there you go.

02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:07.740
The thing is that this has
taken centuries to evolve

02:18:07.740 --> 02:18:09.530
into these types of systems.

02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:13.300 position:56%
And I'm very well aware from my time
on the board of the British Library,

02:18:13.300 --> 02:18:15.820
I was the non-exec directory of
the British Library for eight years

02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:20.030
and then being immersed in this
library for three months how much

02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:23.660
of the library is to
do with this world.

02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:28.090
Right? Because it's only 15
years since the library had

02:18:28.090 --> 02:18:30.460
to start thinking about
the digital world, really.

02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:32.160
That sort of period.

02:18:32.160 --> 02:18:36.090
Most of the staff who work
here, most of the operation

02:18:36.090 --> 02:18:38.540
of the library is to
deal with the old world.

02:18:38.540 --> 02:18:40.940
And that's going to
continue for a long time.

02:18:40.940 --> 02:18:44.850 position:56%
So, there are major issues for
people who manage these organization

02:18:44.850 --> 02:18:47.920
about transitioning
from one to another.

02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:55.380
And the other thing that's
happening is that the,

02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:58.680
as I travel around the world, and
I see and I talk, I mean just,

02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:00.930
well I don't have to travel around
the world, I come to Washington

02:19:00.930 --> 02:19:04.050
and I have talked to many
different archivists.

02:19:04.050 --> 02:19:05.350
They've all been in this room.

02:19:05.350 --> 02:19:06.830
There's the Senate archivist.

02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:10.160
There are people, the National
Archives, the Congress,

02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:13.400
the all the university
archives, the library here.

02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:18.120
Just in this one town, there
are any number of archives

02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:20.840
and there are people
grappling with this issue

02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:22.980
of moving into the digital.

02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:26.020
You then scale that up to all
the libraries in the world

02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:30.170
and then you scale out,
you add in my actual world,

02:19:30.170 --> 02:19:31.770
which is the university,
research labs.

02:19:31.770 --> 02:19:37.820
And we are as much as you are
harvesting stuff off the web all

02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:39.120
the time.

02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:41.990
There's huge amounts of
duplication of effort.

02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:43.790
We're still losing stuff.

02:19:43.790 --> 02:19:45.300
And what we're actually ending

02:19:45.300 --> 02:19:50.910
up with is a very complicated
jigsaw puzzle

02:19:50.910 --> 02:19:53.880
for future historians to sort out.

02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:58.200
Now, Vint talked about this in a
much more eloquent way than I can

02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:03.040
about the complexity of this
amazing thing that we have created.

02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:05.590
I mean Tim Berners-Lee
gave us the protocols,

02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:08.540
but the web was created by us.

02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:09.900
We create this content.

02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:13.530 position:56%
I was struck by a comment from
Abbie when she said, oh she was sort

02:20:13.530 --> 02:20:16.130
of cursing YouTube you know
for it coming into existence.

02:20:16.130 --> 02:20:18.240 position:56%
Why did YouTube come into existence?

02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:19.880
Because all of the
world wants to look

02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:23.370
at cats doing stupid
things on videos, right?

02:20:23.370 --> 02:20:25.670
Who would have predicted?

02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:26.970
But you know?

02:20:26.970 --> 02:20:29.780
YouTube exists because of us.

02:20:29.780 --> 02:20:33.930
No technologist said, you will
put your video on YouTube.

02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:38.020
They provided the infrastructure
and we put our videos on.

02:20:38.020 --> 02:20:40.170
So, now of course it's
become a big business

02:20:40.170 --> 02:20:41.960
and it's completely
changing the world

02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:45.820
of entertainment, advertising,
everything.

02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:49.590
And I mean my mentor sitting
in the front row there,

02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:53.580
Professor Ramesh Jain, who you
know I met at Michigan in '89

02:20:53.580 --> 02:20:56.950
and he was the founding
father of multimedia

02:20:56.950 --> 02:21:01.580
and you know we have been watching
this happen for a long time.

02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:04.330
And as he said in his talk,
it's only today we're beginning

02:21:04.330 --> 02:21:06.940
to realize it isn't just
text we've got to sort,

02:21:06.940 --> 02:21:09.790
it isn't just you know data,
it's all this, well it is data,

02:21:09.790 --> 02:21:11.930
it was the end of it
it's all bits and bytes.

02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:15.520
But it's pictures, it's
videos, it's audio,

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:18.470
it's a huge amount of information.

02:21:18.470 --> 02:21:24.160
And we have invented the technology
to enable us to all of us who are

02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:27.140
on the internet and
have a mobile phone,

02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:30.160
we can all create this
stuff isn't that wonderful?

02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:33.870
You know and that, I mean
what do you think about it?

02:21:33.870 --> 02:21:37.080
During the analogy of the old
days, we wouldn't expect a library

02:21:37.080 --> 02:21:43.180
to have kept every little letter
that was written in America, right?

02:21:43.180 --> 02:21:46.390
You'd expect a library,
a national library

02:21:46.390 --> 02:21:50.060
to store the important letters
that were written in America.

02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:51.870
Not every single personal letter.

02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:56.230
And not every single
personal postcard.

02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:57.830
You don't, some people
collect postcard,

02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:59.330
that's a different madness.

02:21:59.330 --> 02:22:03.860
And where have postcards gone?

02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:05.160
To Twitter.

02:22:05.160 --> 02:22:06.470
I mean you know.

02:22:06.470 --> 02:22:10.440
Largely you don't send a
postcard anymore, you tweet,

02:22:10.440 --> 02:22:13.530
or you Instagram, or you
Snap Chat, or you whatever,

02:22:13.530 --> 02:22:14.850
you put it on your Facebook page.

02:22:14.850 --> 02:22:19.200
We don't have to collect it
all and yet there's a mess.

02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:23.510 position:56%
The mess isn't just what we collect,
it's how we collect it and the fact

02:22:23.510 --> 02:22:29.000
that we currently, everything's
in silos and we've got bits

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.190
of the jigsaw puzzle in silos

02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:33.810
and they're all different
full of standards.

02:22:33.810 --> 02:22:38.690
Right? There's no common way of
these jigsaw pieces being cut.

02:22:38.690 --> 02:22:40.320
So, that they mesh together.

02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:46.230
So, I look back to that
table Vint put up on slide

02:22:46.230 --> 02:22:47.530
with the hieroglyphics on it

02:22:47.530 --> 02:22:50.260
and I think you know how long
it took people to understand

02:22:50.260 --> 02:22:52.590
that Egyptian language and
put the tablets together.

02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:56.290
And as someone else here said,
I can't remember who it was now,

02:22:56.290 --> 02:22:58.330
I think it was the data panel,

02:22:58.330 --> 02:23:01.310
someone said the most
important thing is the context.

02:23:01.310 --> 02:23:04.340
Given the context,
I think it was Vint

02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:06.730
that said it put the
context of the data up.

02:23:06.730 --> 02:23:08.490
It's all about the
semantics of the data.

02:23:08.490 --> 02:23:12.020 position:56%
Because if you don't do that, people
in the future will not be able

02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:13.320
to understand what it was

02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:17.080
about because they won't
understand the world we lived in.

02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:20.110
They won't understand who
Snowden was or, I have no idea

02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:24.290
who that Judge was that
you all doing the thing

02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:31.900
about the court okay,
but the supreme group.

02:23:31.900 --> 02:23:33.280
I don't know who that judge was.

02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:37.640 position:56%
I can look him up on Wikipedia, but
how long is Wikipedia going to last?

02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:40.330
Who's preserving Wikipedia?

02:23:40.330 --> 02:23:44.030
You know? I mean I'm sure
they are, but can we assume

02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:46.480
that the people running
Wikipedia will be in existence

02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:50.870
in 100 years' time or that a
system running Wikipedia will be

02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:52.840
in existence in 100 years' time.

02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:55.290
Certainly, the people
doing it today won't be.

02:23:55.290 --> 02:23:58.650
Now, these are assumptions
we make that just are not,

02:23:58.650 --> 02:24:01.430
that are totally foolish
assumptions to make in this world.

02:24:01.430 --> 02:24:07.050
So, the Library of Congress,
we've you know we've heard

02:24:07.050 --> 02:24:10.950
about the millions of
resources we have now that

02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:12.800
and a huge amount of time.

02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:16.540
Just imagine if a library
ingested those numbers of books

02:24:16.540 --> 02:24:20.000
in 15 years, real books you know.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.550
This is the scale that
they're working at.

02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:26.850
That's a lot of websites.

02:24:26.850 --> 02:24:30.120
Just this library, and that's
replicated all over the world.

02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:33.450
And you know you deliver
an API service.

02:24:33.450 --> 02:24:36.270
How do people find out about that?

02:24:36.270 --> 02:24:39.520 position:56%
And how many people know what an
API is and what they can do with it?

02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:41.190
Right this is the trouble.

02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:44.120
It's the same that's
happened with open data.

02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:47.480
All sorts of people put data bits
out there and nobody uses them

02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:50.000
because they don't
know how to use them.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:53.210
And Jim said to me earlier when we
were sitting listening to someone,

02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:57.100
what we've got to do is write
the tools to enable people,

02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:59.680
just regular people, but
particularly researchers

02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:03.440
who aren't computer programmers
to be able to do things

02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:06.950
with this data and
that means chairing.

02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:09.020
It means doing this as a community

02:25:09.020 --> 02:25:12.140
because you know otherwise we're
just going to waste a lot of time

02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:14.920
and effort or duplicating
and getting nowhere.

02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:18.420
So, we've, I'm going to
tell you a bit in this talk

02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:20.080
about a project we've done.

02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:23.130
This is the website I trust
which you've heard a bit

02:25:23.130 --> 02:25:24.700
about sponsors this project.

02:25:24.700 --> 02:25:29.690
And we've done the building at
Southampton, of a simple tool

02:25:29.690 --> 02:25:32.140
to enable people to find archives.

02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:33.560
Find out what's been archived.

02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:38.040
Because at the moment we
have no clue who's doing what

02:25:38.040 --> 02:25:39.340
around the world.

02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:41.640
We hear about it at symposiums
like this, we hear about it

02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:44.860
in conferences and also
when students do projects.

02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:47.460
Interns come in, PhD students
come in, they do projects.

02:25:47.460 --> 02:25:49.280
They do wonderful things with data.

02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:53.660
They leave and it just goes.

02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:57.700
You know their laptop goes,
the server goes, the URL goes.

02:25:57.700 --> 02:26:00.300
And so, we've been building this
thing called the Web Observatory,

02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:02.110
which I'll explain what
that means in a minute.

02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:09.160
It's all about trying to make
data about archives and data

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:13.510
about research projects that are
being used in research projects,

02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:16.110
the knowledge about that
available to people.

02:26:16.110 --> 02:26:19.760
It's effectively about
creating data catalogs.

02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:22.420
And being able to discover them.

02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:25.320
So, that my Ramain [assumed
spelling] who's sitting

02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:28.600
in the audience somewhere
produced this slide so that instead

02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:32.920
of putting out an API, you
put out some simple metadata,

02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:38.330
which we talked about a lot
on the panel this afternoon.

02:26:38.330 --> 02:26:40.490
We are currently using
shema.org which is a sort

02:26:40.490 --> 02:26:42.960
of watered down version of RDF.

02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:51.140 position:56%
But, at least it's a standard that
we can propose, as you know the idea

02:26:51.140 --> 02:26:55.280
that everybody who's doing work
in this type of work agrees

02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:59.630
to a common description
of the datasets.

02:26:59.630 --> 02:27:03.260
Not, the data, we're not talking
about formats of the data,

02:27:03.260 --> 02:27:05.890
just the descriptions
of the data sets.

02:27:05.890 --> 02:27:08.300
Who owns them, what they're
about, what you can do

02:27:08.300 --> 02:27:09.970
with them, who can access them.

02:27:09.970 --> 02:27:11.840
That sort of level.

02:27:11.840 --> 02:27:15.990
Oh, I'm sorry I knew
I'd confuse you.

02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:18.660
I'm looking here because
I want to be able to read,

02:27:18.660 --> 02:27:19.960
you can't read from there.

02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.140 position:56%
All right so to go back, this is the
web observatory that we're building.

02:27:23.140 --> 02:27:24.900
We're using schema.org.

02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:30.720 position:56%
It's all about metadata, about
datasets, so that everybody can flag

02:27:30.720 --> 02:27:33.210
that they've got some datasets.

02:27:33.210 --> 02:27:36.640
And so, you can put out an API,
absolutely because you want people

02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:39.010
to use that data and
build tools to use it.

02:27:39.010 --> 02:27:42.520
You also put out the
metadata about that dataset.

02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:46.050
And if we all do that in common
standard then wonderful things

02:27:46.050 --> 02:27:47.350
can happen.

02:27:47.350 --> 02:27:49.230
For example, and this is
something that we're just beginning

02:27:49.230 --> 02:27:54.630
to experiment with you can begin to
search across different datasets.

02:27:54.630 --> 02:27:58.850
And here's this is actually it's
a beater, beater, beater thing,

02:27:58.850 --> 02:28:00.880
or maybe alpha minus thing.

02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:02.990
It is a we're just developing it.

02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:09.010
So, it's like a Google for
data, or metadata anyway.

02:28:09.010 --> 02:28:15.380 position:56%
And when Romain did this yesterday,
he typed in pollution, I think Kate,

02:28:15.380 --> 02:28:18.830
we were there in Dunk 'n
Donuts at the time weren't we?

02:28:18.830 --> 02:28:22.050
Oh, there you are right?

02:28:22.050 --> 02:28:27.840
And he typed in pollution and he
gets back from, this is searching

02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:32.230
across all the observatories
that we currently have registered

02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:36.140
in the system for who's got
datasets about pollution.

02:28:36.140 --> 02:28:40.230
It could be a Bolder, it could
Zeke, or it could be Trump,

02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:42.720
it could be whatever you want.

02:28:42.720 --> 02:28:46.530 position:56%
And so, he searched, but you can't
read it but the first one that comes

02:28:46.530 --> 02:28:50.030
up is a dataset from Southampton
and the second two are datasets

02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:51.470
from the Library of Congress.

02:28:51.470 --> 02:28:53.830
Now, you're not actually issuing
this metadata at the moment.

02:28:53.830 --> 02:28:56.730
I hope you will, but
we fudged it for this.

02:28:56.730 --> 02:28:58.030
No, we didn't?

02:28:58.030 --> 02:28:59.330
Oh, it's real.

02:28:59.330 --> 02:29:00.630
It's real.

02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:04.290
It's in the Southampton Observatory
and these are datasets that we use

02:29:04.290 --> 02:29:08.460
for the datathon, but it's
only the metadata, all right,

02:29:08.460 --> 02:29:12.380 position:56%
we haven't sucked the data out, just
the metadata that says the Library

02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:14.060
of Congress has these datasets.

02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:19.330
So, this is, imagine you can go to
something like, well it won't be

02:29:19.330 --> 02:29:20.760
like a Google, because
it won't be as big,

02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:23.650
maybe Google will run the service
at some point in the future.

02:29:23.650 --> 02:29:25.720
The idea is you just,
you're searching

02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:31.240
across the world's
datasets of web archives.

02:29:31.240 --> 02:29:32.810
Just imagine being able to do that.

02:29:32.810 --> 02:29:37.090
So, here's another one where,
oh yeah you highlighted,

02:29:37.090 --> 02:29:38.390
is that the same one,
the pollution one,

02:29:38.390 --> 02:29:42.860
you highlighted Library
of Congress on this one.

02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:46.410
Okay. Now, imagine a
world, where, so here,

02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:50.650
we've typed in the world elections
and in fact it's UK elections.

02:29:50.650 --> 02:29:56.310
And we come up with the dataset
that we are hosting at Southampton

02:29:56.310 --> 02:29:58.790
about last year's UK election.

02:29:58.790 --> 02:30:00.090
We harvested from Twitter.

02:30:00.090 --> 02:30:05.490
And the datathon, the group
that worked on this data,

02:30:05.490 --> 02:30:08.810
and they have the US
election data from the Library

02:30:08.810 --> 02:30:16.100
of Congress they produced a
dataset with the work they've done

02:30:16.100 --> 02:30:20.050
and that dataset is now, well it's
pointed to by the observatory.

02:30:20.050 --> 02:30:25.890
So, here's the metadata about on
there that says, you can't read it

02:30:25.890 --> 02:30:32.120
but it says this is all screenshots
of a live search that says,

02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:35.340
this is the data that was
produced after this datathon.

02:30:35.340 --> 02:30:39.420
And what I want to do is every time
students or anyone does a project

02:30:39.420 --> 02:30:43.690 position:56%
with some of the data from anywhere,
like from the Library of Congress,

02:30:43.690 --> 02:30:45.690
or the British Library,
or Southampton University,

02:30:45.690 --> 02:30:51.510
or George Washington, or Rutgers
University, or RPI University.

02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:54.610
If you're doing something with data
that you got from somewhere else.

02:30:54.610 --> 02:30:57.320
When you produce that data,
you then put the metadata back

02:30:57.320 --> 02:31:00.970
to say what you've done
and where the results are.

02:31:00.970 --> 02:31:05.930
Right? So, you build up a community
of people working in this area

02:31:05.930 --> 02:31:08.530
and we know who's archiving what.

02:31:08.530 --> 02:31:13.760 position:56%
So this, the idea of the
observatory came from the physicists

02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:17.690 position:56%
who are very good at sharing data in
order to interpret what's happening

02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:20.870
out there in the heavens.

02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:24.100
The thing about that is
that's the physical world

02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:27.660
and you don't change it by
observing it, we don't think.

02:31:27.660 --> 02:31:30.320
With the data we're doing,
there are all sorts of issues

02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:36.010
of using data that's about people,
as we have touched on a bit today.

02:31:36.010 --> 02:31:37.310
But the idea is the same.

02:31:37.310 --> 02:31:42.170
It's that as a global community
we've got to share this data

02:31:42.170 --> 02:31:44.710
to enable people to
replicate our experiments

02:31:44.710 --> 02:31:48.990
to reproduce experiments, to
put metadata on top of metadata

02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:54.120
to add some context to the
datasets to help people

02:31:54.120 --> 02:31:55.930
in the future interpret
what's going on.

02:31:55.930 --> 02:31:58.080
So this is about sharing.

02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:01.430
There's a diagram, I think
Romain came up with this as well,

02:32:01.430 --> 02:32:06.010
many years ago now, if that was
the web browser, that was the web

02:32:06.010 --> 02:32:10.490
in 2003 I think, which is often
used to illustrate the connectivity

02:32:10.490 --> 02:32:13.670
of the web, and it's
all about observing it

02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:16.320
and experimenting with
the data on it.

02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:21.410
So, just the Web Observatory, if
those of you who are techy want

02:32:21.410 --> 02:32:26.560 position:56%
to look at websites.org, which is
hosted by the trust and you can look

02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:29.260
at the index of the Web
Observatories that exist

02:32:29.260 --> 02:32:32.240
at the moment and how
you get into being one.

02:32:32.240 --> 02:32:34.380
It's very simple.

02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:39.290
And there's a list of, that's
a screenshot of the list

02:32:39.290 --> 02:32:42.230
of web observatories
that exist at the moment.

02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:45.440
Jim, we need to make yours live
again, I think RPI is the top

02:32:45.440 --> 02:32:47.950
and it needs, the datasets
need to be live again.

02:32:47.950 --> 02:32:50.080
The trouble is if people
don't use this,

02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:55.350
and you don't have someone curating
these datasets, they do stagnate.

02:32:55.350 --> 02:32:56.960
This does need, this
is not something

02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:58.960
that just happens automatically.

02:32:58.960 --> 02:33:05.760
But if you go to for example the
snap group at Stanford, they flag,

02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:08.430
they have, this is an
amazing group up there,

02:33:08.430 --> 02:33:12.550
they flag that they have datasets
they've been collecting for years.

02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:17.260
And flag them here so that
others can see what they've got.

02:33:17.260 --> 02:33:19.920
And we can put them
into the search engine.

02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:26.600
So, hopefully in the
future we're going

02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:28.680
to be creating a distributive
catalog

02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:30.520
across web observatory sites.

02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:33.560
That's the plan, the
common standards.

02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:35.750
The idea is you host your data.

02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:39.230
It's your data and it's
all about providing,

02:33:39.230 --> 02:33:41.610
telling people what
they can do with it.

02:33:41.610 --> 02:33:46.000
You can tell people it's there,
but not allow them to access it,

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.050
you know on the web,
without going through you

02:33:48.050 --> 02:33:50.250
without signing whatever
forms, whatever terms

02:33:50.250 --> 02:33:52.990
and conditions they have to take.

02:33:52.990 --> 02:33:56.770
But it's all about
cataloging what you've got.

02:33:56.770 --> 02:34:01.450
But as a community and not just
as individual websites produced

02:34:01.450 --> 02:34:05.350
by the individual institutions,
that's the difference.

02:34:05.350 --> 02:34:10.720
So, then you have communities based
around different web observatories

02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:13.850
and then linking between.

02:34:13.850 --> 02:34:18.530
This is the Southampton one, and
if you, this is live on the web.

02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:22.670
And if you go into the datasets,
you get lists of datasets,

02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:26.110
and you get actually you get
told, we've got access controls.

02:34:26.110 --> 02:34:28.790
Whether you've got access
or you need permission.

02:34:28.790 --> 02:34:35.420
And if you look at the
apps you get a list of the.

02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:37.750
Now this is the thing that
these take a long time to do.

02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:39.620
This is coming to Katy's
material right?

02:34:39.620 --> 02:34:42.630
All of these apps are
visualizations.

02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:44.490
That's much harder
to share than it is

02:34:44.490 --> 02:34:46.510
to share the metadata
about the datasets.

02:34:46.510 --> 02:34:50.910
And the amount of effort that
goes into building those apps.

02:34:50.910 --> 02:34:53.690
We don't want to be replicating
that all around the world.

02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:57.380 position:56%
We really, really, really need to
share those tools wherever possible,

02:34:57.380 --> 02:35:01.390
if they're open source, or open
access whatever, we really need

02:35:01.390 --> 02:35:02.690
to be able to share them.

02:35:02.690 --> 02:35:06.790 position:56%
And this is about telling people
what you've done with your datasets.

02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:10.260
So, for example, you can't
read it but you can look

02:35:10.260 --> 02:35:12.610
at this, it's all online.

02:35:12.610 --> 02:35:16.950
There's datasets here about
Wikipedia live revisions

02:35:16.950 --> 02:35:19.370
of Wikipedia we have that
constantly running in Southampton,

02:35:19.370 --> 02:35:22.330
we have a screen up with
who's editing Wikipedia

02:35:22.330 --> 02:35:25.530
at that moment in time.

02:35:25.530 --> 02:35:27.930
So you've got streaming data
and then that's all stored

02:35:27.930 --> 02:35:31.390
in the observatory and flagged
and then you get these sort

02:35:31.390 --> 02:35:34.360
of you can actually give people
that, I won't that is a video,

02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:38.480
you can run it as a video and see
who's doing what with Wikipedia.

02:35:38.480 --> 02:35:41.950
And you can get that data, you
can look at it streaming live

02:35:41.950 --> 02:35:43.660
or you can get the
past data as well.

02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:45.730
And of course, the wonderful
thing about Wikipedia

02:35:45.730 --> 02:35:48.010
for researchers is it is all open.

02:35:48.010 --> 02:35:53.670
So, with the idea is we have web
observatories all over the world.

02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:56.090
And they're all linked up
and we have the Southampton,

02:35:56.090 --> 02:36:00.760 position:56%
a couple in the Southampton, RPI, we
just ones being set up in Bangalore,

02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:07.000 position:56%
with a lot of industry data actually
about stuff, telecoms I think.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:10.660
And then there's the new
one in South Australia.

02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:15.150
And the idea is that
libraries have them too

02:36:15.150 --> 02:36:20.060
but actually this is the modern
version of your catalog I think.

02:36:20.060 --> 02:36:25.000
And that's the plea today, is
that we develop common ways

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:28.250
of sharing our catalogs
about our datasets.

02:36:28.250 --> 02:36:32.130
In order to as I said
earlier describe the content

02:36:32.130 --> 02:36:34.600
of the observatories, or what's

02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:38.590
in that datasets, we're
using schema.org.

02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:42.280
This was developed by
Jim and his group at RPI,

02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:45.840
it's in the w3.org list of schemas.

02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:47.910
Anyone can use it.

02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:53.960
And that really is a very
simple just a description

02:36:53.960 --> 02:36:57.880
of what's the name of the project,
what type of data, who owns it,

02:36:57.880 --> 02:36:59.640
what access you can have.

02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:02.360
It's just at that level,
but that is enough

02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:04.510
to enable us to do
initial searching.

02:37:04.510 --> 02:37:07.490
And we can put more and
more descriptors in and then

02:37:07.490 --> 02:37:12.140 position:56%
over time we'll be able to go
semantic, which is what I want to do

02:37:12.140 --> 02:37:16.420
with Stanford, is to link these two
things together, because it's only

02:37:16.420 --> 02:37:20.190
when you really get rich
semantic descriptors

02:37:20.190 --> 02:37:22.470
that wonderful things
begin to happen.

02:37:22.470 --> 02:37:29.580
So, we have a small ambition
here to map the digital universe.

02:37:29.580 --> 02:37:31.690
That may be MP incomplete.

02:37:31.690 --> 02:37:35.570
Anyway, but who knows.

02:37:35.570 --> 02:37:40.530
The idea is to get a better picture

02:37:40.530 --> 02:37:43.510
of the digital universe
than we have today.

02:37:43.510 --> 02:37:48.740
So, less broken jigsaw puzzles and
more bits of the picture emerging.

02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:51.090
And I just want to almost finish.

02:37:51.090 --> 02:37:54.730
This is my last but one slide,
with a video that we produced

02:37:54.730 --> 02:37:57.190
at Southampton, which
may explain some

02:37:57.190 --> 02:37:59.070
of this a bit better than I did.

02:37:59.070 --> 02:38:02.610
And the voice, if you
play it in a minute,

02:38:02.610 --> 02:38:05.020
the voice in this video
is Julian Rhin Tutt.

02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:07.240
We were so lucky to get him

02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:09.190
because they didn't charge us
very much for making the video.

02:38:09.190 --> 02:38:11.350
Julian Rhin Tutt if you
want British television,

02:38:11.350 --> 02:38:15.110
he's always in as a character actor
and he happens to be the brother

02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:16.670
of someone I went to school with.

02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:19.600
But anyway it all links.

02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:21.470
Links. I love links.

02:38:21.470 --> 02:38:25.030
Could you play the video.

02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:29.640
Pages, people, data.

02:38:29.640 --> 02:38:30.940
Lots of data.

02:38:30.940 --> 02:38:36.080
Generated and stored by
people, businesses, communities.

02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:41.150
Imagine a world in
which your data combined

02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:44.210
with other data could
change things dramatically.

02:38:44.210 --> 02:39:11.160
Government, health, education,
the environment, and in business.

02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:17.750
To unlock the potential
of your data,

02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:19.050
we've developed a Web Observatory.

02:39:19.050 --> 02:39:20.570
A system that locates and describes
existing datasets around the world.

02:39:20.570 --> 02:39:21.870
It has common technical
standards, safeguards,

02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:23.170
collection, and analysis tools.

02:39:23.170 --> 02:39:24.470
It allows people to observe the web
and use the intelligence it holds

02:39:24.470 --> 02:39:25.770
to unlock new opportunities.

02:39:25.770 --> 02:39:27.070
You chose how your data
is used and by who.

02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:28.370
Well it's free or has
to be paid for.

02:39:28.370 --> 02:39:29.670
But until you put it out
there, you won't have any idea

02:39:29.670 --> 02:39:30.970
of what it can do, how
it can change the world.

02:39:30.970 --> 02:39:32.270
So, join us we can show you how.

02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:33.570

the potential of data.

[ Applause ]

02:39:41.130 --> 02:39:45.310
I should give credit to Thenasis
Jurapanis [assumed spelling]

02:39:45.310 --> 02:39:47.910
and Joanna Luis for doing that.

02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:50.430
But this is not a commercial
company, right?

02:39:50.430 --> 02:39:53.050
This is just talking
about this project

02:39:53.050 --> 02:39:55.700
which is a community
project, or open source

02:39:55.700 --> 02:39:59.360
and open development tools we hope.

02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:00.900
And we can't do it on our own.

02:40:00.900 --> 02:40:03.470
We need to do it together.

02:40:03.470 --> 02:40:07.520
So, it's a plea for everybody
to put their metadata out there

02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:11.130
in the schema.org format
and tell us they've done it.

02:40:11.130 --> 02:40:14.200
And just to summarize today,
this is my last slide.

02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:17.290 position:56%
The center of what we've been
talking about is this web, internet,

02:40:17.290 --> 02:40:18.590
whatever you want to call it.

02:40:18.590 --> 02:40:21.630
The thing that is incredibly
complex, as Vint said.

02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:23.630
Very, very interconnected.

02:40:23.630 --> 02:40:27.160
As, Ted Nelson who's another
great mentor of mine mad as it,

02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:30.110
oh no get quite mad, but a mentor

02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:34.470
of mine said everything is deeply
intertwingled and boy he said

02:40:34.470 --> 02:40:37.880
that in the seventies and
boy have we proved that.

02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:41.030
You know given, he didn't
quite get Xanadu off the ground

02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:44.710
and he says two cheers to
Tim and the Web, not three,

02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:52.980
but you know the web has shown us a
way to do this and it's the center

02:40:52.980 --> 02:40:57.320
of what we're going and I love
what Vint said the morning,

02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:00.650
the self-archiving web that's
something we really need

02:41:00.650 --> 02:41:01.950
to try to build.

02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:03.340
It's very complicated.

02:41:03.340 --> 02:41:06.310
I love the term digital
vellum, that resonates

02:41:06.310 --> 02:41:08.540
so much in a building like this.

02:41:08.540 --> 02:41:12.940
You know this is really, this
is what the libraries need,

02:41:12.940 --> 02:41:14.240
they need digital vellum.

02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:17.930
And that's what we need
to provide them with.

02:41:17.930 --> 02:41:19.230
All right?

02:41:19.230 --> 02:41:23.220
They can't do it, we the community
have got to do that for them.

02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:26.560
We need to know who's archiving
what, otherwise we get huge amounts

02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:29.500
of replication, duplication,
wasted effort.

02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:34.330
That's where I hope something like
the web observatory will come in.

02:41:34.330 --> 02:41:35.630
And for those of you

02:41:35.630 --> 02:41:37.620
who can understand all
the three letter acronyms,

02:41:37.620 --> 02:41:40.940
the doi stuff is really important
because in the web observatory

02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:42.740
at the moment, we're focusing

02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:45.030
on sharing metadata
and we're using URLs.

02:41:45.030 --> 02:41:48.470
And as Vint said, URLs
are inherently unstable

02:41:48.470 --> 02:41:52.230
because people don't,
people move stuff around.

02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:56.920
And so, the work that Bob Kahns
and CNRI are doing on doing on doi,

02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:01.280 position:56%
as complicated as it feels, you have
to have that sort of system going

02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:05.710
at some point in order
to do the preservation.

02:42:05.710 --> 02:42:07.700
So, on that note, I'm
going to finish.

02:42:07.700 --> 02:42:09.270
I'm going to say thank you.

02:42:09.270 --> 02:42:12.000

going to close.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.300

of this again and reflect.

to remind all of you

02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:20.570
that we did record the
presentations and the will be

up on the Kluge Center website and
the Library of Congress' website,

02:43:24.240 --> 02:43:27.180
might take a couple months
but they will be there.

go back and look at all this again.

to express our gratitude

02:43:45.140 --> 02:43:47.040
And really for serving
as the catalyst

02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:49.330
for this great exchange of ideas.

02:43:49.330 --> 02:43:51.110
And during her tenure here

02:43:51.110 --> 02:43:55.250
at the Kluge Center she has really
generously shared her abundant

02:43:55.250 --> 02:43:58.600
energies, talent and knowledge
throughout the institution

02:43:58.600 --> 02:43:59.900
and across the hill.

02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:02.850
And I want to thank her for truly
embodying the Kluge Center vision.

02:44:02.850 --> 02:44:05.150
Thank you [applause].
