VAN RIPER: Hi, I'm Van Riper,
and I work with our Google

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.790
Developer Groups all
around the world.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.460
Today we're starting our first
ever Google Developers Tech

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.120
Roundup, a monthly show bringing
to you the latest and

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.710
greatest in what's happening
for Google Developers.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.805
I'd also like to introduce my
co-host, Stephanie Liu.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:24.595
STEPHANIE LIU: Hi, everybody.

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:25.310
My name is Stephanie Liu.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.820
I lead the Global Programs team
for developer relations.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.230
I work very closely with Van.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.470
VAN RIPER: And we also have
Adriana Cerundolo.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.260
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Hi, I'm
Adriana, and I am the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.740
Community Manager for the Google
Developer Groups, and I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.880
have the pleasure of working
with Steph and Van also here

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.300
in Mountainview.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.480
VAN RIPER: So today, we're going
to talk a little bit

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.640
about I/O, since that was
recently some of our favorite

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.490
moments and some of
the top news.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.450
We'd also love to hear from
you what you found

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.340
interesting as well.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.050
But I'll start with my favorite

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.660
moment from the keynote.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.920
It was actually before the
keynote even started.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.030
Because of my work with the
community, that really kind of

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.780
gave me chills when I saw 250
plus organizers all stand up

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.640
before the keynote even began,
waving their local banners and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.100
chanting GDG, GDG.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.050
I love the passion of our
developer community, and it

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.310
was great to see that in
action at the keynote.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.570
How about you, Stephanie?

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.180
STEPHANIE LIU: I think my
favorite moment from the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.430
keynote was a mid section.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.410
He was talking about his
sci-fi-- you know, how we're

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.120
living in the future,
his whole "Star

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.040
Trek," sci-fi thing.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.740
So I thought the Google
Now demo was awesome.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.130
Being able to see the thinking,
the principles

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370
behind how we're moving forward
in that space with

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.190
answer, converse, anticipate,
with anticipate being the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.585
really futuristic, we're giving
information before you

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:41.040
even know you want it.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.920
I thought that was awesome.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.900
And as a bonus, when Amit got
up on stage, he said he grew

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.880
up in India.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.130
And all of our Indian GDGs, you
could hear them, they were

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.830
near the front row,
just went crazy.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.100
So I thought that was special.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.180
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Yeah, I'll
have to say for me my favorite

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.130
part was the Maps update.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.550
Because I've always
loved maps.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.200
Ever since I was a kid, I would
have them all over my

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.900
walls and just loved
geography.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.590
So I thought it was great
to see that now we have

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.700
customizable maps.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.880
And it's also that integration
was [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.570
And you can see reviews and
so on all in your map.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.920
And they actually went and did,
and they panned out to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.490
using Google Earth and
up into the universe

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.660
view during the keynote.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.380
And that was the backdrop for
the rest of the segment, and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.130
that was really awesome.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.041
Loved that.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:23.020
VAN RIPER: Yeah, but actually
turning now to more about the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.220
substance of the keynote, the
things that I personally--

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.510
and for developers
in particular--

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.970
for myself, as a long time Java
developer, I was really

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.880
excited by the announcement
of Android Studio.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.030
I can remember when I was a
young developer using early

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.660
access releases [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.810
first IntelliJ IDEA for
Java developers.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.820
And now it's kind of a new world
with Android development

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.730
having the early access preview
releases of Android

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.450
Studio, which is based on the
very solid community edition

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.440
of IntelliJ IDEA.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.090
So now there's a free
environment that's based on

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.480
this environment that is
a pleasure to use.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.860
And even though it's in early
access, I found Android Studio

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.880
already to be a pleasure
to use.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.090
So I encourage you Java
developers to check that out.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.100
What about you, Stephanie?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.480
STEPHANIE LIU: Well, I thought
that some of the kind of news

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.650
that may have been lost in the
shuffle was some of the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.180
sessions that we did on Google's
two languages, which

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.260
are Go and Dart.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.320
And there was a theme, which
was performance.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.400
So for Dart, if I had to
choose a session, I'd

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.940
recommend Web Languages
and VMs, Fast

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.940
Code Always in Fashion.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.310
It's Always in Fashion with
Lars Bak and Kasper Lund.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.530
So there's a cool demo in there,
so look for that, where

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.490
they're zombies.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.940
So you have that.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.300
Just like the performance
enhancements using that single

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.560
instruction multiple data,
which Dart supports.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.780
And for Go, Go 1.1, there was
also a bunch of optimization

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.870
that came out with the .1
release with garbage collector

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.730
stuff, [? mathematician ?]

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.390
and some tweaks to
standard library.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.270
It's compatible with 1.0, and
you'll note, if you upgrade,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.760
you'll probably notice your code
running a little faster.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.235
And if I had to recommend a
talk to watch for that, it

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:07.590
would be Rob Pike's talk about
advanced Go [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.270
currency patterns.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.830
So if you've been hesitant
because the languages are

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.650
still pretty nascent, I'd
recommend you check them out

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.325
because it's fast moving.

00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.140
It's getting more mature.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.270
The teams for Dart and Go are
actually both very responsive.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.150
And it would be like a cool
time to get into it.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.370
My own personal story about Go
is, well, my fiance and I got

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.840
engaged like seven months
ago or six months ago.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.970
The first concession, the
first wedding planning

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.930
concession I made, was to do
our wedding website on App

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.980
Engine Go instead of
App Engine Python.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.077
Because he really loves
Go, and he thinks

00:04:42.077 --> 00:04:43.710
it's a great language.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.240
And so I could see it because
I'm being a good future wife,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.370
compromises.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.720
But also I thought it would
be a great to do Go.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.886
And even though I haven't made
any significant patches yet, I

00:04:55.886 --> 00:04:56.870
still got three months.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.900
So I'm like [INAUDIBLE]
digging into it.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.980
VAN RIPER: And don't forget the
PHP announcement as well.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.800
It may not be a new sexy
language like Dart or Go, but

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.680
I think there's a lot of
developers out there that--

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.460
STEPHANIE LIU: Stately?

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.370
VAN RIPER: There's a lot of
developers out there using PHP

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.790
that were probably very
happy to see that

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.000
announcement as well.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.980
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
It's awesome.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.700
I just want to say I hope that's
the only concession you

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.360
have to make, at least
before your wedding

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.590
starts with the planning.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.057
STEPHANIE LIU: Oh, yeah.

00:05:19.057 --> 00:05:20.460
[INAUDIBLE] hot pink.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.448
Hot pink and purple
as my colors.

00:05:22.448 --> 00:05:22.944
I'm just kidding.

00:05:22.944 --> 00:05:23.440
It's not.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.940
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: I love it.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:24.120
I love it.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.770
It's going to be great.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.910
You're going to look great
in that color.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:26.902
I can just see it.

00:05:26.902 --> 00:05:29.630
Well, I just want to say my
personal favorite update was

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.580
with Apps Script.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.640
I think this is an
important update.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.800
So we already know that you can
use Apps Scripts to extend

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.610
into Google Spreadsheets, and
now you can extend into Docs,

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.700
which I think is really
important because now you can

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.660
use custom menus, dialogs,
and triggers.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.360
This is something that
personally is going to make my

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.100
life much easier, especially
the update with

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.460
Apps Scripts and forms.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.570
So it's going to make those
interactions with form

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.370
submissions that much richer.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.890
And also there's going to be
much more that you can do with

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.380
the form submissions to get
information from when they

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.280
submit and so on.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.270
So it's just going to make all
the work that we do with forms

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.900
and the events just much more
efficient and easier.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.630
So I'm excited about that.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.110
VAN RIPER: So that was just
a few of our favorite

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.150
announcements and technical
components from I/O. I know

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.110
there's a lot more--

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.800
there's way more that was
covered there on Google+ and

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.870
Chrome, and you need to really
check out all the videos from

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.460
I/O. And we'd love to hear from
you what your favorite

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.280
pieces of what you thought the
most significant developer

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.440
announcements were.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.730
Let us know in the comments.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.720
For our next segment, we have
Kim Cameron from the BigQuery

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.210
team joining us.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.270
Kim and Amy Unruh gave a great
talk about the sensors used to

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.440
collect data at Google I/O this
year and how the Google

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.650
Cloud Platform was used to do
cool stuff with the data.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.340
So take it away, Kim.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.330
KIM CAMERON: Hey, everyone.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.120
So you may have heard about the
project called the Data

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.450
Sensing Lab at Google I/O. And
I'm here to talk to you a

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.410
little bit about that.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.920
So first of all, before we get
into what it actually was, how

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.300
did it get started?

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.640
So our colleague Michael
Manoochehri on the BigQuery

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.600
team went to Strata in February,
and he was really

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.265
impressed by a project that the
O'Reilly Data Sensing Lab

00:07:07.265 --> 00:07:08.170
team had set up.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.450
It basically took about 50
sensors, put them all over the

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.560
conference, collected
environmental data, and then

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.250
did cool stuff with it,
visualized it for people.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.320
It was a pretty big success.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.310
And Michael thought, why can't
we do that even bigger.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.540
So he decided to do this at
Google I/O. Instead of 50

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.940
sensors, we did 500 sensors.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.830
And like at Strata,
we set them up all

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.330
over the Moscone Center.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.400
And we wanted to figure out cool
stuff about the data, and

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.450
we wanted to show it to you in
really interesting ways.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.995
So I really encourage all of you
to go to the YouTube talk

00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:44.100
that will be shown at
the end to get full

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.170
details about the project.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.560
There was a lot involved.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.750
I'm going to summarize it
a bit for you right now.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.770
And there were two main
components, the hardware end

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.460
and the software end.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.030
So first off, for the hardware,
we took 500 sensors,

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:57.770
as I've mentioned.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.610
And these were made up
of two main pieces.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.250
First of all, there's an
Arduino board that

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.430
makes up the base.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.830
Arduinos you've probably
heard of.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.610
They're open source
electronic boards.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.180
They're really cheap.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.220
You can get them for
$20 at any Radio

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.390
Shack or other store.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.430
To that, we added a custom
sensor shield.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.950
And the O'Reilly Data Sensing
Lab team ended

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.610
up doing this work.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.950
We partner with them
on this project.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.100
Each sensor shield has some
built-in sensors,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.300
environmental sensors, for
temperature, pressure,

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.200
humidity, and also light.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.080
And then they have the
capability to include three

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.890
additional sensors, specifically
air quality,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.844
pressure, which is-- we had
these mats around Moscone that

00:08:38.844 --> 00:08:41.070
if people stepped on them,
they registered--

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.040
and also RF noise, which
we had tuned to GSM.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.340
And we had about 100 each that
had one of each of the

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.650
optional components, and then
all 500 had the base ones,

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.005
which were, like I mentioned,
temperature and pressure and

00:08:55.005 --> 00:08:56.450
humidity and light.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:58.030
So we set those up
all over Moscone.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.310
And the next issue was, how
would they communicate with

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.410
each other.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.170
So we partnered with Digi
International, who also were

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:05.990
involved at Strata.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.120
And they hooked up
a mesh network.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.090
And this allowed the sensors to
communicate with each other

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.970
over a much greater distance
than if we had set up, say, a

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.800
Wi-Fi network.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.680
So then the software piece
comes into play.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.010
And that's where our team built
the app and figured out

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:23.230
how we were going to work
with this data.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.630
And we used many parts of the
Cloud platform, specifically

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.370
App Engine, BigQuery,
Compute Engine.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.200
We used App Engine Data Store.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.020
Lots of pieces involved.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.860
We wanted to be able to build
an infrastructure without

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.810
doing a lot of the core work
to put the pieces together.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.850
We wanted to be able to take
in the data, analyze it and

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.190
visualize it very simply.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.240
So just to give you a brief
rundown of how we did that.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.480
First of all, we have all these
streams of data coming

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.000
at us from this mesh network.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.580
And we need to be able to put
that somewhere quickly so we

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.310
can keep getting the data.

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.140
So that, we used App Engine.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.310
And we specifically used App
Engine task queues to go off,

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.360
grab the data asynchronously,
and put it into the App Engine

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.760
Data Store, where we could use
Data Store's system to be able

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:17.270
to query things like the most
recent 100 readings for heat

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.330
from all of the sensors,
things like that.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.030
We also used the task queues to
get the data into BigQuery.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.680
And we wanted to do that to be
able to enable more robust

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.640
queries for things like
aggregates, so the sum

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.830
function, for example.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.510
So we had the data in both
of these data sources.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.640
We also used Compute Engine to
do some analysis on the data.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.960
And moving forward, we're hoping
to be able to do even

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.760
more types of analysis.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.360
And we also used some
visualization scripts to be

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.370
able to output things that were
going on in the kiosks

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.060
that were around Moscone.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.540
Specifically, I think we had one
that was showing where the

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.010
most recent pressure was
around the conference.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.790
You could see in front of the
doors there was a lot of

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.570
traffic, at the base
of the escalators.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.950
We even put some sensors in some
interesting places, like

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.890
there was a blimp that
was floating around.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.230
We had a few of the
sensors up there.

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.850
As well as in, there was a car
that you could sit in.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:16.880
We had a pressure mat in there
so you could see how often

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.310
people were getting in
and out of the car.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.410
And so we did this to really
help see more about what was

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.720
going on at Moscone than you
might normally be able to see.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.870
And we think that this opens the
door for doing really cool

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.830
analysis on things like, if
people walk around in a

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.700
certain area, does the air
quality go up or down?

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.010
And actually, we had one
visualization for that, with

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.070
the help of Tableau, who ended
up hooking up some

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.890
visualizations through their
connector to BigQuery.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.260
And we did see a correlation
between number of steps that

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:51.100
people were taking in an area,
and the air quality did

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.810
actually go down, which
was kind of funny.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.220
So this project really helped
us do cool things like that.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.520
And we think in the future
we can do even more.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.630
And to wrap it up, we do
plan on continuing to

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.650
work on this project.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:07.360
We're hoping to do further
installations at other

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.690
conferences or events.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.440
And we are also planning on open
sourcing the project in

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.910
the future, as well as the
dataset is available, the

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:18.950
entire BigQuery dataset.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.680
You can go look at
it yourself.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.050
And all this information is
listed at datasensinglab.com,

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.560
where we're going to have all
of that stuff in the future.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.230
VAN RIPER: So Kim, we have some
of the sensor hardware

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.970
used at Google I/O here
in the studio.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.140
I have one in my hand
right here.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.480
How would developers
get this hardware

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.380
for their own projects?

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.540
KIM CAMERON: So that's a good
question, and actually, at the

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:41.360
conference, that was one of the
main things people were

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.940
asking at the booth.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.780
How do I get this
sensor shield?

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.970
Because obviously you can roll
your own, but they wanted the

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.660
ability to have it now.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.580
And you can actually pre-order
those at the

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.840
datasensinglab.com site.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.600
The O'Reilly Data Sensing Lab
team is planning on making

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.030
those available in the future.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.206
So you can certainly
access those now.

00:12:59.206 --> 00:12:59.560
VAN RIPER: Great.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.960
Well thanks, Kim for
that brief overview

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:02.760
of your full talk.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.510
I hope people go and see the
full talk by Kim and Amy after

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.520
seeing this introduction.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.200
And there will be links to that
video as well as links

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.832
where you can give us feedback
in the notes to this show.

00:13:12.832 --> 00:13:14.830
Well, that was awesome.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.110
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Man, I really
think we better wrap

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.240
this up before the air quality
continues to decrease.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:19.710
VAN RIPER: Sounds good.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.650
Well, I hope you enjoyed this
first edition of the Google

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:23.520
Developers Tech Roundup.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.280
We hope to see you a month from
now for our second show.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.030
In the meantime, if you have
something you'd like us to

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:32.700
share around Google Tech,
use the hashtag #gdtech.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.420
We're going to close with a
little montage of our photos

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.410
of Google Developers in action
from I/O. And again, use the

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.540
#gdtech hashtag to share photos
with us that you'd like

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.880
to see on the next month.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.480
So until next time, take care.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:14:51.480
