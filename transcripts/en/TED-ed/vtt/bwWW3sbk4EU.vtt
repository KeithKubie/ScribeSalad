00:00:06.813 --> 00:00:10.363
It's not hard to imagine a world
where at any given moment,

00:00:10.363 --> 00:00:14.503
you and everyone you know could be
wiped out without warning

00:00:14.503 --> 00:00:17.253
at the push of a button.

00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:21.115
This was the reality for millions
of people during the 45-year period

00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:22.843
after World War II,

00:00:22.843 --> 00:00:25.325
now known as the Cold War.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.974
As the United States and Soviet Union
faced off across the globe,

00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:33.874
each knew that the other had nuclear
weapons capable of destroying it.

00:00:33.874 --> 00:00:37.486
And destruction never loomed closer
than during the 13 days

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:40.215
of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:46.586
In 1961, the U.S. unsuccessfully tried to
overthrow Cuba's new communist government.

00:00:46.586 --> 00:00:49.704
That failed attempt was known
as the Bay of Pigs,

00:00:49.704 --> 00:00:53.495
and it convinced Cuba to seek help
from the U.S.S.R.

00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:57.067
Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev
was happy to comply

00:00:57.067 --> 00:01:00.465
by secretly deploying nuclear
missiles to Cuba,

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:02.004
not only to protect the island,

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:07.485
but to counteract the threat from
U.S. missiles in Italy and Turkey.

00:01:07.485 --> 00:01:10.165
By the time U.S. intelligence 
discovered the plan,

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:14.086
the materials to create the missiles
were already in place.

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:17.985
At an emergency meeting on
October 16, 1962,

00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:21.405
military advisors urged an airstrike
on missile sites

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:24.036
and invasion of the island.

00:01:24.036 --> 00:01:27.495
But President John F. Kennedy chose
a more careful approach.

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:30.546
On October 22, he announced that the
the U.S. Navy

00:01:30.546 --> 00:01:33.995
would intercept all shipments to Cuba.

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:35.427
There was just one problem:

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:39.436
a naval blockade was considered
an act of war.

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:41.986
Although the President called it
a quarantine

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:44.027
that did not block basic necessities,

00:01:44.027 --> 00:01:47.577
the Soviets didn't appreciate 
the distinction.

00:01:47.577 --> 00:01:49.398
In an outraged letter to Kennedy,

00:01:49.398 --> 00:01:53.297
Khrushchev wrote, "The violation 
of freedom to use international waters

00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:56.677
and international airspace
is an act of aggression

00:01:56.677 --> 00:02:02.637
which pushes mankind toward the abyss
of world nuclear missile war."

00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:07.217
Thus ensued the most intense
six days of the Cold War.

00:02:07.217 --> 00:02:09.646
While the U.S. demanded the removal
of the missiles,

00:02:09.646 --> 00:02:13.627
Cuba and the U.S.S.R insisted
they were only defensive.

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:16.758
And as the weapons continued
to be armed,

00:02:16.758 --> 00:02:20.178
the U.S. prepared for a possible invasion.

00:02:20.178 --> 00:02:24.438
On October 27, a spy plane piloted
by Major Rudolph Anderson

00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:27.299
was shot down by a Soviet missile.

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.427
The same day, a nuclear-armed Soviet
submarine was hit by a small-depth charge

00:02:32.427 --> 00:02:36.978
from a U.S. Navy vessel trying
to signal it to come up.

00:02:36.978 --> 00:02:40.308
The commanders on the sub,
too deep to communicate with the surface,

00:02:40.308 --> 00:02:45.759
thought war had begun
and prepared to launch a nuclear torpedo.

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:49.698
That decision had to be made unanimously
by three officers.

00:02:49.698 --> 00:02:53.578
The captain and political officer
both authorized the launch,

00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:58.069
but Vasili Arkhipov, 
second in command, refused.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.771
His decision saved the day
and perhaps the world.

00:03:01.771 --> 00:03:03.950
But the crisis wasn't over.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.610
For the first time in history,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.903
the U.S. Military set itself
to DEFCON 2,

00:03:08.903 --> 00:03:12.839
the defense readiness one step
away from nuclear war.

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.230
With hundreds of nuclear missiles
ready to launch,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.199
the metaphorical Doomsday Clock
stood at one minute to midnight.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.278
But diplomacy carried on.

00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:25.363
In Washington, D.C., Attorney General
Robert Kennedy

00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:29.859
secretly met with Soviet Ambassador
Anatoly Dobrynin.

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.720
After intense negotiation,
they reached the following proposal.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.839
The U.S. would remove their missiles
from Turkey and Italy

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:38.900
and promise to never invade Cuba

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.649
in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal
from Cuba under U.N. inspection.

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:45.637
Once the meeting had concluded,

00:03:45.637 --> 00:03:48.982
Dobrynin cabled Moscow saying 
time is of the essence

00:03:48.982 --> 00:03:51.450
and we shouldn't miss the chance.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.139
And at 9 a.m. the next day,

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.870
a message arrived from Khrushchev

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.851
announcing the Soviet missiles would be
removed from Cuba.

00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:01.240
The crisis was now over.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.107
While criticized at the time by their
respective governments

00:04:04.107 --> 00:04:06.121
for bargaining with the enemy,

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:09.429
contemporary historical analysis
shows great admiration

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:14.051
for Kennedy's and Khrushchev's ability
to diplomatically solve the crisis.

00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:17.251
But the disturbing lesson was that
a slight communication error,

00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:21.901
or split-second decision by a commander,
could have thwarted all their efforts,

00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:27.360
as it nearly did if not for 
Vasili Arkhipov's courageous choice.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.311
The Cuban Missile Crisis revealed just how
fragile human politics are

00:04:31.311 --> 00:04:35.231
compared to the terrifying power
they can unleash.
