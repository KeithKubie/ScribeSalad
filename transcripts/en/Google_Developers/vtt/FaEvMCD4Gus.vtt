[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.930
TODD KERPELMAN: Hello,
and we are live.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.260
And almost on time.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.700
We had to catch the end
of the Giants game.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.330
COLT McANLIS: Congratulations
to the Giants.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.190
Bravo, gentlemen.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.840
TODD KERPELMAN: Nice work.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.510
COLT McANLIS: Nice beard.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm jealous.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.760
TODD KERPELMAN: So welcome to
Google Games Chat, episode

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.660
number six.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.660
I am Todd Kerpelman,
your moderator and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.790
host and cat herder.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:27.770
WOLFF DOBSON: The host
with the most.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.490
TODD KERPELMAN: To my left
is Wolff Dobson.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.850
Doctor Wolff Dobson.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.250
WOLFF DOBSON: Thank you.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.880
TODD KERPELMAN: To my immediate
right we have Colt

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.310
McAnlis, and to his right
we have John McCutchan.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.830
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Hello.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.130
TODD KERPELMAN: So how are
you guys doing today?

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.070
COLT McANLIS: We are doing
very Canadian today.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.840
JOHN McCUTCHAN: It's
very Canadian out.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.225
COLT McANLIS: It is
a little Canadian.

00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:49.260
TODD KERPELMAN: It's a little
Canadian, it's kind of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.140
fall-ish weather.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.170
COLT McANLIS: It's good
caffeination weather.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.170
It's good Seattle weather.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.385
Stay inside, play some video
games, drink some caffeine.

00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:57.510
It's good weather to
watch this show.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.320
WOLFF DOBSON: I was listening
to some Maple Leaf Rag, you

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.255
know, that kind of thing.

00:01:00.255 --> 00:01:00.720
COLT McANLIS: There you go.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.069
I don't know if that's Canadian,
but close enough.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.420
WOLFF DOBSON: It does have
maple leaves in it.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.670
What do you want?

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.120
TODD KERPELMAN: So
let's jump in.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.890
We're going to jump right into
our first tech demo, I guess

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.280
first and only tech demo,
because Wolff couldn't get his

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.920
act together.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.980
And that's going to be--

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.986
WOLFF DOBSON: I love you, man.

00:01:18.986 --> 00:01:21.176
No, really.

00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:22.450
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm kidding.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.056
He really couldn't.

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:26.930
He was drunk!

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.430
COLT McANLIS: He still is.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.930
WOLFF DOBSON: Thank you.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.410
Well, anyway, we launched
version 1.3 of the Hangouts

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.390
API this morning.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.740
TODD KERPELMAN: Actually, all
right, you know what, wait.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.160
We're not going to
jump into techno.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.130
Tell me about--

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.390
what's in version 1.3?

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.580
WOLFF DOBSON: It's actually
a very small update.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.880
It's--

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.970
COLT McANLIS: It just
includes beer.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:46.910
WOLFF DOBSON: No.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.340
We renamed one of the methods
to be more accurate.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.400
But the fun thing that you can
do is if you're working on

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.380
Effects, you can unmirror
your local stream.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.280
So normally when you're like--
especially if you're going

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.570
with text effects, you see it
backwards, because you're

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.560
looking at yourself
in a mirror.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.070
So we've made it so there's
an API method to

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.660
flip it back and forth.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.910
I assume with unmirroring, you
finally have vampires able to

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.590
see themselves in
their Hangout.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.660
TODD KERPELMAN: That's true,
because the mirror rule

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.000
doesn't apply to Hangouts.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.952
They can finally
see themselves.

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:22.685
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, that's
interesting.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:24.610
If you have vampires, and you
put them in Hangouts, do they

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.610
see themselves because it's a
camera and not actually a--

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.270
COLT McANLIS: Wait, are
we talking about

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.890
a traditional vampire?

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.705
WOLFF DOBSON: --but when you
turn on video mirroring, do

00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:29.320
they disappear?

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.060
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.900
COLT McANLIS: So we're in
a different state now.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.870
We're in a different
state now.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.710
The traditional vampire that
bursts into flames in the sun

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.870
is no longer our standard
quota for

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.410
society-accepted vampires.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.240
WOLFF DOBSON: Are you talking
about sparkly vampires?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.800
COLT McANLIS: I'm not
specifying anything.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.460
I'm just saying we have
to update our persona.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.753
The internet didn't exist back
when, you know, van Helsing

00:02:48.753 --> 00:02:49.720
was around.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.110
TODD KERPELMAN: That's true.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.290
Mirrors were really
the only way.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.440
There weren't cameras,
there weren't-- yeah.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.170
Interesting.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.440
WOLFF DOBSON: So do vampires
upload themselves to YouTube

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.700
and look at themselves?

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.900
They don't actually
see themselves--

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.390
TODD KERPELMAN: That's the
only way they can.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.120
You know, we really should save
this discussion for two

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.250
weeks from now, when we're like
in our Halloween episode

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.010
or something.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.890
But so does it actually unmirror
the entire display,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.410
or just the Effects layer?

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.550
WOLFF DOBSON: No, it unmirrors
the entire stream, so that you

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.380
can see yourself.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.050
TODD KERPELMAN: So you get
that weird experience of

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.380
seeing yourself way other people
see you, which is,

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.970
like, totally unsettling.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.470
WOLFF DOBSON: Does my hair
part on that side?

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.410
Whoa.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.910
And your eyes don't look like
they're in the right position.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.135
That's probably true for
me all the time.

00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:31.600
COLT McANLIS: I like how you
complained about your hair.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.340
That's, uh, that's cute.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.780
That's cute, by the way.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.570
TODD KERPELMAN: I host
a demo today, right?

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.110
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Hold on,
let's stay on hair.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.200
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's talk
more about hair.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.390
COLT McANLIS: First World
hair problems.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.880
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.820
So let's move on to the demo.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.800
So John, what do you
have for us today?

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.230
JOHN McCUTCHAN: So today I'm
going to show an update to the

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.950
NaCl acceleration module that
if you happened to catch

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.732
episode two or three--
was it three?

00:03:56.732 --> 00:03:57.535
TODD KERPELMAN: It
was like three.

00:03:57.535 --> 00:03:57.860
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Three.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.860
If you caught it live, which
it never made it up to

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.360
YouTube, you would have seen a
prerecorded sample of this.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.890
But I'm going to show a live
demo of this today.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.480
So what we're looking at here is
the Bullet physics library

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.460
is running in the background
without any display, and I'm

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.779
communicating with it
through JavaScript.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.680
So I have a JavaScript API to
Bullet and I'm drawing and

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.670
doing everything in JavaScript,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.440
which is pretty sweet.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.440
I can even grab a block and pick
it up and move it around

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.150
and smash over this
Jenga pile.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.690
The picking of the objects is
done in JavaScript and the

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.350
actual physical simulation
is done in C.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.330
It's ridiculously fast.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.030
Let me see if I can knock
over this table.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.020
There we go.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.450
So the whole simulation is
taking right now about between

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.820
one and two milliseconds to
simulate over 100 objects,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.520
which is just amazing.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.750
But you get to write your
application in JavaScript.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.060
I'm just using 3.js to
do all the drawing.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.360
TODD KERPELMAN: That
is very cool.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.710
I think we used this analogy
last time, but it's like in

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.200
the old days when the PC
developers, they would write

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.880
all their high-level stuff in C
and then they would go into

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.600
Assembly for all of the really
heavy lifting kinds of things.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.900
This is sort of that same idea
taken up one level higher,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.020
where now you get to--

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.790
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.120
So now you have your low-level
stuff, which in this case is a

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.980
mix of C and Assembly, and you
write all of your high-level

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.740
stuff in JavaScript.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.130
But this demo is available in
the Chrome Web Store, and

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.040
there's actually a mode in it
where you can describe the

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.280
shapes and the initial state of
the scene in a JSON file,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.880
and load it up in the
application and

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.050
watch it play out.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.550
COLT McANLIS: What's really cool
about this, what I like

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.700
about seeing this demo is, we
talk a lot-- or rather there's

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.580
a lot of tension in the Web
community right now about what

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.660
language should be
used on the Web.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.410
You've kind of got different
herds of people all saying

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.995
that A is right and--

00:06:06.995 --> 00:06:07.685
WOLFF DOBSON: You're
calling them sheep?

00:06:07.685 --> 00:06:08.870
Is that what you're saying?

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.750
COLT McANLIS: There's lots
of different words.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.750
So what happens is, this is
really one of the first times

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.020
that we've come to the table
and said, hey, what happens

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.320
when we actually hit
the magic spot?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.410
That it's not just one language,
but we find out how

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.560
to meld the right things of
each language together.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.300
This is still using JavaScript
to render and to manage the

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.950
scene, but the high
computational cost, the

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.610
processing cost, is actually
all being run in

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.430
Native Client in C code.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.040
So we actually have the
ability to have a

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.020
conversation, I believe, which
is that maybe one language

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.950
isn't meant to rule them all.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:38.890
Maybe we can actually
take, from each

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.820
language, the best parts.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.000
And use that to make the Web a
better place, especially when

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.420
you get to see great
stuff like this.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.570
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, what
about debugging all

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.190
these things, though?

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.230
I mean, whenever you--

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.320
I can remember tales of working
in Lua, because you

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.620
could compile it and have it run
on a console, and then you

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.320
discover you're sitting there,
like, writing a Lua debugger

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.160
inside your regular
C debugger.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.200
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Well, so the
nice thing is that Chrome

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.750
ships with a JavaScript
debugger.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:05.960
WOLFF DOBSON: That
is what I was--

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.220
this is the thing.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.550
Like, the reason why you write
in JavaScript is because then

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.422
you get Chrome's awesome
debugger.

00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:14.400
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Yeah, and you
get the profiler, and the

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.360
memory profiler.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.170
WOLFF DOBSON: You just get all
these things that you need

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.812
that makes it easy to develop.

00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:19.230
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Yep.

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:21.860
And the way that the
acceleration models are meant

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.370
to work is, though, somewhat
off-the-shelf.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.950
It's essentially middleware.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.320
So you get a straightforward
JavaScript API, like--

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.880
in the JavaScript code it's
like, Add Event Listeners,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.590
Seen Update, and call this
JavaScript function.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.840
And it takes the transforms
that Bullet computed and

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.290
applies them to all the
objects in the scene.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.570
COLT McANLIS: Which is
really cool, right?

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.410
Especially when we get to
a situation where we--

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.070
because everyone pretty
much includes jQuery.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.270
It'd be great if instead of
including jQuery we just

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:49.005
started including
physics modules.

00:07:49.005 --> 00:07:51.525
JOHN McCUTCHAN: That's exactly
what's happening here.

00:07:51.525 --> 00:07:53.000
WOLFF DOBSON: #include
awesome.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.430
COLT McANLIS: Which is really
kind of nice for the future of

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.140
the Web, and when you think
about Web gaming and where

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.190
this can take it.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.750
You know, HTML5 offers this
great ability to have very

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.020
flexible gameplay, but again may
not give you some of the

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.310
performance in the
areas you need.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.030
And that's where these
NaCl acceleration

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.800
modules fit right in.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.170
TODD KERPELMAN: Very cool.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.620
So now is--

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.340
I don't know much about the
Bullet module besides the fact

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.020
that we've been using it.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.110
Has that been written
in-house?

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.920
Is that written external?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.030
Where'd that come from?

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.070
JOHN McCUTCHAN: So Bullet is an

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.220
open-source physics library.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.810
You can find it on
Google Code.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.130
And what I did was I
wrote two things.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.260
One, I wrote a general-purpose
library that allows you to

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:36.429
glue C to JavaScript by
way of postMessage.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.260
And then I wrote a Bullet
module for that, so that

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.860
implements a few function calls
that you want to send

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.700
from JavaScript into
the C land.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.610
Like, I figure out what object
is under the mouse cursor in

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.480
JavaScript, and then I send over
a message to C that says,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.080
OK, pick this object up now,
and start holding it.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.405
And then when I'm ready to drop
it, I send a message to C

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:01.460
that says, OK, drop this now.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.890
So what you're seeing is
actually a very tight coupling

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:08.270
of back-and-forth chatter
between JavaScript and C, and

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.420
it works really well.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.290
WOLFF DOBSON: How many--

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.373
what's the limit on messages
that you can

00:09:13.373 --> 00:09:15.110
send to the NaCl module?

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.300
JOHN McCUTCHAN: I did a bunch of
benchmarks, and I actually

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.315
have a talk that's available,
that came out today on GDL.

00:09:21.315 --> 00:09:22.950
WOLFF DOBSON: Are you saying
I didn't do my homework?

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.760
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Absolutely.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.670
COLT McANLIS: We
sent it around.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.720
You didn't even Share
it on G+.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.810
Where's the gamedev bro-love?

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.220
JOHN McCUTCHAN: All right.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.280
But quickly, you can send about
400 megabytes per second

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.230
of data, round trip, from JS
to C. And the latency for

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.760
small messages is about
100 microseconds.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.350
COLT McANLIS: So what this
effectively means is, with

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.180
things like NaCl acceleration
modules, you can actually put

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.230
a video decoder in Native
Client, and actually ship all

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.180
the data over to JavaScript.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.250
WOLFF DOBSON: I was going
to say, it sounds like

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.580
programming on the PS2, where
you're streaming your textures

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.890
in as you're playing.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.850
Which is neat, because you can
actually construct the

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.245
textures out of getUserMedia
or something like that, and

00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:00.930
then map them onto it.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:01.840
COLT McANLIS: Especially
think of it this way.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.940
With all the advances we've seen
with archive compression

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.540
modules, like LZHAM and 7Zip and
stuff like that, and with

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.560
the adoption of compressed
texture formats into WebGL,

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.530
you can now actually store your
stuff in hyper-compressed

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.770
data, decompress it using Native
Client and C++ and

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.630
still stream over to WebGL
and use it there.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.850
So really, really exciting.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.150
JOHN McCUTCHAN: So to put that
400 megabytes per second into

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:32.190
perspective, you can do 1024 by
1024, 60 frames per second

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:37.300
of RGBA frames and only
use 200 of it.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.280
WOLFF DOBSON: You're like, "It's
an entire Final Fantasy

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.823
game per second."

00:10:41.823 --> 00:10:42.254
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:10:42.254 --> 00:10:43.550
Yeah.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.810
So the great thing about the
Bullet acceleration model is

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.890
that the actual output that
you send every frame is 64

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.320
bytes per body being
simulated.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.300
But the amount of memory being
touched in the computation

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.670
that's going on inside the
C land is massive.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.640
And then you just send over
64 bytes per body.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.000
And that's all you have to
send over to JavaScript.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.010
COLT McANLIS: This
is good stuff.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.910
Check it out.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.135
It's on the Chrome Web
Store, definitely go

00:11:10.135 --> 00:11:10.970
take a look at it.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.280
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Yeah, there's
a talk, and I have a blog

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.800
post, and this application.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.840
You can go and install this in
the Chrome Web Store and make

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.590
your own domino scene and then
just see it simulate.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.200
TODD KERPELMAN: I hope people do
that, because-- well, one,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.810
I love dominoes, but two,
I love physics games.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.216
The more physics games are
out there, the better.

00:11:30.216 --> 00:11:30.950
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Jenga.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.160
Jen-jen-jenga.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.250
WOLFF DOBSON: Just the Stair
Dismount is my favorite.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.305
Just throwing the poor guy down
the stairs, endlessly.

00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:40.590
You just don't get tired of
it, this is the thing.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.030
I just thought of that now, and
I was like, ah, I gotta go

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.060
install that afterwards.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.930
TODD KERPELMAN: About two
companies ago, I had this

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:49.760
prototype for a game that I
was working on that was

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.510
nothing more than shooting a guy
out of a cannon and just

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.505
watching him hit all these
random obstacles in the world.

00:11:55.505 --> 00:11:56.750
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Wasn't that Pain
for the Playstation 3?

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.800
TODD KERPELMAN: No,
it was not.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.120
This was a 2D kind of thing.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.740
JOHN McCUTCHAN: But
that's essentially

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:01.410
the same game, right?

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.070
Like that, you just set up your
slingshot and you shoot

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.840
the guy into the world
and you see how much

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.640
damage you can do.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.560
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
more or less.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.620
WOLFF DOBSON: That was built
into one of those racing

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.810
games, where they figured out--
they made it so they had

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:15.450
a rag doll guy in the car and
then when he crashed, it would

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.830
basically just eject him.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:17.500
He would just fall out.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.060
And then they realized that was
so much fun, they added

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.540
this entire sub-game where all
you did was crash the car.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:26.500
And they had targets for the
body, so you had to hit at the

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.080
right angle and the right
speed to launch the

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.290
guy into the thing.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:29.730
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.720
You can't ever really
get tired of

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.643
watching rag doll physics.

00:12:34.643 --> 00:12:37.380
All right, so with that,
let's move into our

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.013
Five for Five topic.

00:12:39.013 --> 00:12:42.010
You know what we need is like,
we need a cool little graphic

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.600
intro where we kind of talk
about introducing this.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.506
WOLFF DOBSON: Like, zeeeeow!

00:12:45.506 --> 00:12:48.230
COLT McANLIS: Five for Five!

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.140
WOLFF DOBSON: Five for Five!

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.630
TODD KERPELMAN: Can we-- let
me ask our producer.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:51.830
Can we get on that?

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:52.190
WOLFF DOBSON: Jimmy?

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.810
TODD KERPELMAN: Jimmy says yes,
he's going to build it

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.620
for next time.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.630
That would be great.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.680
COLT McANLIS: Perfect time for
the Halloween episode.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.380
WOLFF DOBSON: [INAUDIBLE],
you're Jimmy.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.290
COLT McANLIS: All statements
by Wolff Dobson are his own

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.930
opinion, and not that of any
organization that he may be

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:08.900
affiliated with at any time.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.420
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
so I've got five topics--

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.120
WOLFF DOBSON: All of my
opinions are cult.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.070
TODD KERPELMAN: And we're going
to talk for five minutes

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.550
and 30 seconds, because we may
need a little more time.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.620
And then when the
timer buzzes--

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.070
COLT McANLIS: What are
we talking about?

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:25.050
TODD KERPELMAN: I don't know.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:25.516
COLT McANLIS: Ready, go!

00:13:25.516 --> 00:13:27.410
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
there's the first question.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.640
There was an article on Kotaku,
I think last week,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.440
that basically argued that
quick saves have ruined

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.680
tension in games.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.160
There's never any
point where--

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.233
WOLFF DOBSON: "Games
are dead!"

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.040
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, games are
dead, or at least tension

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.180
in games are dead, because if
you can quick save every few

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.550
minutes or every few seconds or
every couple of steps, that

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.630
tension is gone.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.210
Do we agree?

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.620
Do we think that we need to
remove quick saves to bring

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.080
tension back into games?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.340
WOLFF DOBSON: You know
what we should do?

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.540
It should punch you in the
stomach every time

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.150
you die in a game.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.600
That's what we should
do to people.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.200
No, for me it's all
about, does this

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.800
game respect my time.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.280
I gave up on Grand Theft Auto
San Andreas near the end,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.880
because they had a mission where
you sat through a long

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.450
cutscene, and then you
parachuted down to a place,

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:17.025
and then you had to kill all
the guys-- this unskippable

00:14:17.025 --> 00:14:19.640
thing where you had to kill all
the guys on the helipad,

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.210
then you had to go from the
helipad down to the thing.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.080
And then finally you get
to the car racing part.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:29.030
And the car racing part was
really slow, clumsy, with

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:33.000
like, tires made out of
petroleum jelly, so you're

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.510
skidding all over the place
trying to chase this guy.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:38.460
Each try took like 11 minutes.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.110
And the problem with that is
that I wasn't getting better

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.810
at driving while I was

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:46.770
practicing that whole sequence.

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.880
I was doing the thing that I
already mastered, which is

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.370
clearing the house full of
guys, shooting guns and

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.240
parachuting, which
wasn't very hard.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.860
And the part that I needed
practice on was the part that

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:02.830
I couldn't practice, and instead
had to pay 11 minutes

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:03.630
every time I wanted to see it.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.190
And that was the end
of the game for me.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.970
When you look at a game like
VVVVVV, it's brutally hard,

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.520
but it lets you keep practicing
the part you need

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.240
to practice, over and
over and over again.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.290
Super Meat Boy, and
things like that.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.980
Those games are incredibly
tense.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:22.180
They're just letting
you focus on the

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:22.920
parts that are important.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.250
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.495
Well, I've gotta bring up Dark
Souls and Demon Souls, which

00:15:27.495 --> 00:15:29.580
are exactly what you described,
and I think that's

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.620
why a lot of people love them.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.210
That's certainly why
I was really

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:33.810
attracted to those games.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.310
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, what skill
are you practicing when you're

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.250
playing Dark Souls?

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.130
What are you mastering when
you're mastering Dark Souls.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:39.680
JOHN McCUTCHAN: You're
mastering the

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.320
combat system, you're--

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.090
WOLFF DOBSON: But you're
not mastering,

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.990
like, a physical thing.

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.960
You're mastering the sort of
long-term economics of

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.360
managing your party.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.780
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Well, there's
no party in the game.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.310
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, whatever.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:53.940
JOHN McCUTCHAN: I think
what you're

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.740
mastering, one, is the combat.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.050
So when you're--

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.670
it's a little bit more
like fencing, though.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:00.610
So it's a little bit more like
OK, I'm just going to get one

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.880
hit in, and then I'm going to
back off and be patient for a

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.985
beat or two, and then come
back in for it again.

00:16:06.985 --> 00:16:09.050
But what makes the game
so interesting

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.320
is that death matters.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.420
And it's funny that we're
talking about quick saving,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.070
because Dark Souls
always saves.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.510
It's saving constantly.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.940
Every minute the game saves.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.770
And you can't go back to a
previous version of the save,

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.900
but it's always being written.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.920
So there's a couple times where
I made a really bad

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.420
mistake and I actually
ran across a room and

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.990
unplugged the PS3.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.090
COLT McANLIS: [LAUGHTER]

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:35.340
JOHN McCUTCHAN: So
that it wouldn't

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.400
write to the save file.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.915
So this is like, the other
way of quick saving.

00:16:40.915 --> 00:16:42.990
Forced quick saves adds
a lot of tension.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.600
WOLFF DOBSON: This is like when
I used to hack games and

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.050
change bits inside it so
it would get easier.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.200
It was like, what I'm actually
learning is how to hack the

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.470
games, and not--

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.530
TODD KERPELMAN: I mean,
that's basically

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.850
saying no quick saves.

00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:57.610
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Well,
it's always saving.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.290
TODD KERPELMAN: It's like the
Iron Man mode in the new XCOM

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:02.252
game, where, yeah, there's--

00:17:02.252 --> 00:17:04.520
it's quick saving without
reloading.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.220
WOLFF DOBSON: See, I still think
this comes down to what

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:06.880
you're mastering, though.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.150
Because when you're playing Dark
Souls, what you're doing

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.650
is getting good at managing this
long sequence of actions

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:14.670
that you have to do.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:16.650
JOHN McCUTCHAN: But that's
exactly what's going on with

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.220
GTA, right?

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:22.030
It is, like, to get from one
point, kind of checkpoint in

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.720
Dark Souls to the next, it's
this long sequence of

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.579
different action moments.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:29.350
WOLFF DOBSON: But are
they really--

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.000
are they completely orthogonal
to each other?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.830
Or are they all related.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.840
So that if you got good at the
first half, you'd be better at

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.160
the second half.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.800
JOHN McCUTCHAN: It's
all combat.

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.490
WOLFF DOBSON: So it's all the
same skill that you're

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:38.000
practicing.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.210
I mean, different guys, but
you're still ultimately

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:42.810
getting your pattern down.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:43.570
JOHN McCUTCHAN: You are
mastering your character and

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.080
their abilities.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.270
WOLFF DOBSON: But this was
my complaint about GTA.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:48.820
It was that you aren't
mastering the--

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.580
TODD KERPELMAN: You just needed
checkpoints after the

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.420
parachuting part, after the
clearing-out-the-guys part.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.240
WOLFF DOBSON: I want the thing
that I'm practicing to be the

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.310
thing that I'm trying
to overcome, not--

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.400
JOHN McCUTCHAN: I've had that
same experience in games,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.830
where there's a sequence of five
totally separate moments,

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:09.140
and I can do four of them, and
the fifth one I just suck at.

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:10.590
And you just do it again
and again and again.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.270
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, and there's
no way to isolate

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.340
that, and like, practice that
muscle until you've got it

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.102
just right.

00:18:18.102 --> 00:18:20.430
And I mean, I think that article
comes down to, yeah,

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.190
terribly implemented save
systems are really

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:25.420
frustrating, or terribly
designed save systems are

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:25.740
frustrating.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.160
MALE SPEAKER: So our YouTubes
have some good feedback.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.420
Two pieces.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.216
One person says they hated it
in Quake that if you did a

00:18:32.216 --> 00:18:35.950
quick save at the wrong time
you'd forever reload and die.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.820
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes, again,
poorly implemented save.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.584
MALE SPEAKER: Someone else
says, quick save was

00:18:39.584 --> 00:18:42.366
practically a must-have feature
in the 90s, and if you

00:18:42.366 --> 00:18:44.620
didn't have it, you
were screwed.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.010
COLT McANLIS: See, so now I'm
going to agree with this.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.320
So here's my thought, is that
quick save has nothing to do

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.280
with the tension of the game.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.950
TODD KERPELMAN: By the way,
thank you, audience, for

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:51.470
contributing.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:52.110
That's awesome.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:53.200
Yaay!

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.300
COLT McANLIS: Thank you.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.450
So, like, Half-Life 2,
you could quick save

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.200
wherever you want.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.530
But that was still a
really tense game.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.620
And to go back to your
point, yes, you are

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.620
trying to master something.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.850
But it allowed you to say,
I will master x at

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.590
a specific y time.

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:09.790
So really the only time it
removes tension is if you're

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:10.930
someone who's obviously

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:12.430
manipulating that to an extreme.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.580
And that person's probably not
caring about tension of the

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.670
environment anyway.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:16.930
They're trying to optimize--

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.450
they're trying to min-max
the system.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:21.380
I got the last word in.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.410
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, you
got the last word in.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.670
Actually, I think that's
probably a good point to move

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.210
on to our next question.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.440
WOLFF DOBSON: Design
good save points.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.000
JOHN McCUTCHAN: But
I totally agree.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.130
Half-Life 2 was a very
tense game for me,

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.570
even with quick save.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:37.750
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, you
didn't abuse it.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.370
COLT McANLIS: The general
thing is, hyperbolic

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.210
statements like "quick saves do
x," I think that's wrong.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.630
I think you have to take a look
at the user and how the

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:44.870
user's experiencing
your content.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:48.120
If the user is going to
manipulate something, that's

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:50.070
how they're trying to experience
your content.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.560
We all can agree that the
original Everquest resulted in

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.600
horrible death penalties.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.740
When you got to level 42 and
you died, you lost a half a

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.400
bar of experience, which took
you two days to get back.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.070
One of the successful things
that modern MMOs do to combat

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.410
that is when you die, you
don't lose experience.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.000
You can kind of see that as a
quick save, but there's still

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.420
tension, there's still something
on the line.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.470
WOLFF DOBSON: You're still
frustrated when you lose.

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.565
And you're knocked out
of the raid, which is

00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:17.820
a bad enough penalty.

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.830
They don't need to also lop
off three days of effort.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.040
COLT McANLIS: Yeah, I'm just
saying that hyperbolic

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.860
statements like what was made
in the article are trying to

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.330
address the wrong thing.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.660
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Are they
trying to get clicks?

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.820
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, the
word linkbait was

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:33.190
going off in my head.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.930
JOHN McCUTCHAN: That
never happens.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.390
WOLFF DOBSON: We totally
fell for it.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.870
TODD KERPELMAN: They got,
like, four extra clicks.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.330
WOLFF DOBSON: Todd's
like, gyawww.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.890
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:43.240
So, HTML5.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.900
I feel like for a long time
game developers have been

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.180
saying, this is going to be the
future of Web games, it's

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.410
the future, it's the future.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.800
I feel like we're--

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.430
from a few years ago, we're now
in the future, and it's

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.260
still kind of off
in the future.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.440
WOLFF DOBSON: Where are
the flying cars?

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.610
Where are the robot butlers?

00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:59.340
What's going on?

00:20:59.340 --> 00:20:59.810
TODD KERPELMAN: Right.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:01.730
We're getting closer to the
self-driving cars, I don't

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.040
know about the flying one.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.530
But I still feel like, if I look
at the most popular games

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.710
on the Web, if I go to
Kongregate and see what's

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.130
driving a lot of the online
games right now, it's still

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.250
primarily Flash.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.780
Some Unity, and you know,
HTML5 is there.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:20.120
But it hasn't becomes the
dominant force yet, in games

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.350
in the browser.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.951
Why not?

00:21:22.951 --> 00:21:23.850
I'm asking you.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:24.730
COLT McANLIS: That's
fine, that's fine.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.500
So I think you bring up a very
good point about sort of,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.070
where is the evolution
of HTML5.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.790
And I want to approach
this from a long

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:32.550
view perspective first.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.170
So first off, when HTML5 was
first announced and what it

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.430
was doing and what it was
capable of, you have to

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:42.490
remember that the browser share
that actually supported

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:43.990
HTML5 was actually pretty low.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.060
And game developers of that time
were very much concerned

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:46.650
about reach.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.590
I mean, we're talking about late
2008, early 2009, when

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:53.540
the big thing to do was to write
a Flash game and put it

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.920
on a social network.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.460
So you were more concerned
with daily active users

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.780
clicking your pink cow than
you were anything else.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.890
So fast-forward to 2012.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.060
We've now got--

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:07.600
the dominant share of users
can run HTML5 games.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.280
The problem now is
that the focus is

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.620
in a different medium.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.400
The focus is in mobile and
what mobile is doing.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.910
We did a great thing for
Google I/O this year.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.490
We actually took some game
developers, or some ex-game

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.830
developers who work at Google,
and we made a game.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.330
We said, let's figure out if
this HTML5 thing is actually

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:24.860
worth the hype.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.840
We made a game called Grits,
which is a top-down 2D

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.750
shooter, and you could actually
just Google for my

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.870
name and the word Grits and
you'll find everything.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.480
But we actually took a look at
it and said, we're ex-game

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:34.950
developers.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.690
Let's approach HTML5 and
figure out if it's

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:37.590
hype or if it's not.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.120
And what we found was this, was
that people approaching

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.090
HTML5 development have
two skewed views.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.360
Number one, they think
it's in a vacuum.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.890
They believe that HTML5
development is its own little

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.240
island and no one's ever
made games before.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.670
Like, the people we talked to
were completely oblivious to

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.880
very good tools, like
TexturePacker or Tiled.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.140
These are staples of 2D
game development.

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.200
The people in the HTML5 world,
or even the Web world, just

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.260
didn't know.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.010
They're coming from the world
where they're expecting this

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:09.160
IDE that Flash has,
and expecting

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.830
something to migrate over.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.200
So that was first an issue, in
sort of educating people that

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.910
hey, listen, it's all data.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.230
If you export a 3D model
from Maya, you

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.480
can load it in WebGL.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.540
It's just data.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.700
The second problem was that
developers were sort of

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:28.650
approaching the HTML5 concept
from a very different

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.570
viewpoint, which was that they
thought it should all be

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.630
integrated and all solve
every problem,

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:34.680
everywhere, at every time.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.760
Which kind of is due to the
hyperbolic nature of the

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.270
statements.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:40.880
But what we've really found is
that HTML5 is a Web language.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.430
It was designed for
the internet.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.910
Believe it or not, it wasn't
actually designed for games.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.620
What we've been able to do is,
because HTML5 is so powerful,

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.890
we've been able to do
gaming experiences.

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.700
Well, this comes to the tier
of like, what the demo John

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.370
showed and everything, which is
that HTML5 is great for a

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.500
tier of experiences.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.200
When you want to move beyond
that tier, you're going to

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.370
quickly run into problems.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.680
And my talk, I talk about
that, I won't go into it

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.750
today, but when you hit that
tier you're going to say, hey,

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.750
you know what, there's certain
things that we just cannot do.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.380
It's like dealing with limited
hardware right?

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.780
You're not going to be able to
render 2.4 million polygons on

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.930
your mobile device today.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:14.980
It just doesn't work.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.080
So it's a tier of
applications.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.650
Once you hit that point, you've
got to move forwards.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.520
So I believe the future of HTML5
is very bright, I'm very

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.930
encouraged about it, but I think
the problem has been

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:24.990
messaging, to this point.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.020
It's been very hyperbolic.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.870
It hasn't been very pragmatic
about what game developers

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:30.980
should actually be doing.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:32.630
So I have I monopolized the
whole five minutes yet?

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.460
TODD KERPELMAN: Not yet.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.160
WOLFF DOBSON: So I was going
to say that I came from a

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.180
background first
of console game

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.350
development, and then Flash.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:45.620
And when I started writing HTML5
games, a little bit like

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.640
what you were talking
about, I felt like--

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:49.890
and, you know, this was
a couple years ago--

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.250
I felt a little bit
lobotomized.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:54.670
Like oh, I don't have all of
these really comfy tools that

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:56.720
I'm used to.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.780
Now I feel a lot more like it's
like LISP, like where I

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.190
fire up the game, I open the
console, and I start typing

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:06.010
stuff in the console.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.960
Like, I'm developing much more
like I developed in grad

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.530
school, when I was working
on AI, than I was

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.810
as a console developer.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.460
Because back when I was working
even on the Dreamcast

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.400
and the Wii, you fire up a
run, and then you go--

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.930
I used to draw on my whiteboard
a lot, because I'd

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.085
wait for two and a half minutes
for it to start, and

00:25:24.085 --> 00:25:25.330
then I'd be able to play it.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.450
And with HTML5, I can sit there
and write code in the

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:33.980
command line as I'm going along,
and that's faster than

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.220
using the IDEs, because I have
such an interactive experience

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:37.810
when I'm coding.

00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:41.630
And I think that's a mode of
coding that people who come

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.680
from C backgrounds aren't
as familiar with.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.710
COLT McANLIS: And so I will
point this out, too.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.640
Probably one of the most
important things I think that

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:51.740
Chrome has done, in being
open source, is

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.130
the auto-update feature.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.890
Again, when we talk about who
has HTML5 support in the

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.440
browser, again, it was very
limited early on.

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.810
Now Chrome's got a fantastic
user base.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.800
A lot of the other browser
vendors have realized that the

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.200
auto-update feature allows you
to kind of keep on the cutting

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.110
edge, and a lot of them have
announced support for

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.730
auto-update.

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.010
Which means that we're going to
have more HTML5 support in

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.620
the future, and that means that
users are all going to

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.640
have HTML5 support.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.100
So now it's a better time than
ever to actually come to the

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.230
table and write an HTML5 game
that gets good reach and has

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.880
good performance.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.650
Now again, here's the
pragmatic statement.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.450
You're still writing on
fragmented hardware.

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:28.070
If you're coming out and you're
actually writing a

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:31.040
WebGL game, your shader may
not run on every device.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.635
So again, it's sort of where
the Web meets hardware.

00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:36.140
And we're seeing that a lot,
again, with these mobile

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.060
devices, where you've got
technology that's supposed to

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:43.500
be homogeneous but hardware
that's heterogeneous.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.800
And we need to kind of come to
the table and say hey, game

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.480
developers have been dealing
with this for a long time.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.510
This is nothing new.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.540
It's just a new language
in a new ecosystem.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:55.280
WOLFF DOBSON: I also think that
Chrome on Android is a

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.530
big step forwards.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:57.750
COLT McANLIS: Absolutely.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:02.020
WOLFF DOBSON: Like, making an
HTML5 game and then trying to

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:07.430
run it really slowly on 2009
mobile browsers was like oh,

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.145
this is terrible.

00:27:08.145 --> 00:27:10.390
Now we get hardware
acceleration, now we get all

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.810
these things that you want.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:17.280
Like a really great JavaScript
compiler, or Runtime.

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.236
These are the tools
that I needed.

00:27:19.236 --> 00:27:20.010
I need.

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:20.610
I need?

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:20.965
I have.

00:27:20.965 --> 00:27:21.670
I have them.

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:22.580
COLT McANLIS: You have, today.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.340
Go use them.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.960
TODD KERPELMAN: So I'm a Flash
developer, I'm a theoretical

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.502
Flash developer, and
I'm saying--

00:27:28.502 --> 00:27:30.560
WOLFF DOBSON: You're a
theoretical Flash developer!

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.340
So, wait, there's so many
ways to parse that.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:35.220
Are you theoretical as in you
don't actually exist, or--

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.310
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's suppose
I'm a Flash developer--

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.850
COLT McANLIS: Where's
the comma?

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:41.990
TODD KERPELMAN: --and I'm
saying, all right, I'm going

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.350
to get into making a game in
HTML5, what do I need to know?

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:46.890
So my tools are different.

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.310
I need to actually go
out and look for--

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:54.400
I can't expect all of them to
be available in my IDE, but

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.690
there are some good ones
out there that I

00:27:55.690 --> 00:27:57.400
should be looking for.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.670
COLT McANLIS: So first off, I
think you should start at the

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:02.050
fact that even Adobe has
started adopting HTML5.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:05.010
I think the newer IDEs they
have actually have either

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:09.080
HTML5 support, and if you don't
want to opt in for that

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.250
tier of support there, there's
also great HTML5 packages out

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.590
there, like EaselJS is a
fantastic one, that will

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:18.510
actually take Flash over to
JavaScript on your behalf.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:20.220
When you get to that sort of
scenario, though, if you

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.560
realize that you don't want to
use the Flash IDE for your

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.010
primary editing environment,
then yeah.

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:25.630
You need to go back and you need
to look at how we've been

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.840
making video games for
the past 30 years.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.940
I mean, how many games
are actually

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.010
built on mobile today?

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.030
What tools are they using?

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.050
A lot of them are 2D.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.510
Maybe you should research
that data.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:35.060
Look for it.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:38.020
I'll tell you, the two main ones
are Tiled, for creating

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.990
world maps and everything,
and the other one is

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.560
TexturePacker.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.610
TexturePacker is fantastic.

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:46.250
It'll create atlases, it'll
minimize your footprint, it'll

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:47.050
increase your speed.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.620
It's a great thing.

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.770
TODD KERPELMAN: So
those two tools.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.680
And start loving the idea
that you can code while

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.520
everything's running.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.685
It's sort of awesome.

00:28:54.685 --> 00:28:57.400
JOHN McCUTCHAN: There was a
really interesting demo that

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.510
someone's put together of that
type of programming working

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.650
with C and C++.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.170
It's called Juce, J U
C E, and I watched a

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.150
YouTube video of it.

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.190
It is very impressive stuff.

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:14.750
I mean, the demo is presenting
like a UI with a button and

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.290
things like that, and they
actually clicked in the

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.360
running application, made the
button bigger, and you saw the

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.785
source code change.

00:29:20.785 --> 00:29:24.610
And it's all using LLVM and
Clang, and it's good stuff.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:25.980
COLT McANLIS: Now, what I'll
say about this, and I know

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.570
we're over time, but I think
it's an important point about

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.830
Web technologies, is we're
actually starting to see a lot

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.130
of people realizing what can
be done in a browser and

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:32.860
trying to bridge it.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.200
Because we have a lot of
developers coming to the

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.010
table, especially from the
traditional industry, who have

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:39.810
a C++ code base with 10
million lines of code.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.180
For them to migrate into the
Web, that may not be easy, if

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.730
they're trying to take
everything to JavaScript.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.010
So we've seen some good stuff
come forward, like the LLVM

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:49.680
compilers that'll take C++ and
convert it to JavaScript.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.720
We've been seeing Native Client

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.750
making some good headway.

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:54.170
We've been seeing Dart doing
great stuff too.

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.850
I think the important thing,
again, is to come back and say

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:58.690
let's talk about user
experience, let's talk about

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.000
data, and let's talk
about where the

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.400
future of the Web is.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.990
Now that we can actually get
to the tip of the iceberg,

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.950
we're seeing the performance
start, we're seeing the user

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:06.800
experiences come through.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.710
Where does that lead us.

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.340
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
moving on to a question that

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.160
has absolutely nothing to do
with games, but I thought I'd

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.410
ask it anyway.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.210
Which is--

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.170
WOLFF DOBSON: Speaking
as a parent.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.480
TODD KERPELMAN: Speaking
as a parent.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:19.760
So--

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.710
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Let me derail
this conversation right now.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:27.710
TODD KERPELMAN: So
I got two kids.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:32.615
I'm going to assume that in
15 to 18 years, they're--

00:30:32.615 --> 00:30:33.220
WOLFF DOBSON: Theoretical
children.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:33.910
TODD KERPELMAN: I've got my
theoretical children.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:34.450
COLT McANLIS: They're
theoretical Flash children.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.475
JOHN McCUTCHAN: I
actually have 37

00:30:35.475 --> 00:30:37.640
theoretical Flash children.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.123
COLT McANLIS: That's
a lot of work.

00:30:39.123 --> 00:30:40.560
JOHN McCUTCHAN: A lot
of theoretical work.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.910
TODD KERPELMAN: I'm putting
money away every paycheck to a

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:47.850
college fund, based on the idea
that at some point in the

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.800
future I'm going to need to
spend an awful lot of money to

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.470
send these kids to college.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.620
At the same time I'm spending,
like, my morning bus ride

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.690
watching Stanford classes
on my computer.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.600
And I'm like hey, wait, I'm
getting this for free, I don't

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.005
need to pay a quarter of a
million dollars or whatever.

00:31:04.005 --> 00:31:05.150
WOLFF DOBSON: Why buy the
cow when you can get

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:05.680
the milk for free?

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.300
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.430
So this is my question.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:13.800
Is the idea of saving for
college kind of weird and

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.520
old-fashioned?

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.760
WOLFF DOBSON: Are you looking
for an excuse to blow your

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.472
kid's college fund?

00:31:17.472 --> 00:31:20.690
I'm looking for an excuse to
blow my kid's college fund and

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.430
go to Hawaii for a year.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.110
So can I justify this?

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.740
WOLFF DOBSON: I think--
so, weirdly, there's

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.700
some data on this.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.100
And there's also some--

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:35.800
and, sadly, I'm not going to
be able to footnote it,

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.190
because I just read some stuff
on the Web once, and it seemed

00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.150
really convincing.

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.900
COLT McANLIS: On, like,
a totally legit site.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.310
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.480
COLT McANLIS: Seems
legit, bro.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.560
COLT McANLIS: There's
theoretical footnotes.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:53.050
No, there's some data on this,
and there's also interesting

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:53.990
things where it's like, we have

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.890
all these tools available.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.980
Like you can go buy a laptop for
$300, and you're connected

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.060
to the Web, and you can do
all these amazing things.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:01.960
You can watch these
Standford courses.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.850
TODD KERPELMAN: Coursera,
yeah.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:03.880
WOLFF DOBSON: You can
do all these things.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.410
And I think those are going to
be really powerful for certain

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.920
kinds of applications.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.610
There's very little evidence
that when you cut people loose

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:19.810
with like, a calculus textbook
and some video recordings of

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.830
calculus, that they come
out learning calculus

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.090
on the other side.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.000
Programming is a different
thing, because it's such an

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.190
interactive--

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:29.360
online programming courses
make tons of sense to me,

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.830
because it's like yeah,
this is how we all

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.670
learned how to program.

00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:35.720
Just sort of keep fiddling
with it until it works.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.291
Calculus doesn't lend itself
to that very much.

00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:40.270
It's not that you can't.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.640
It just happens very rarely, as
compared to people teaching

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.470
themselves to program,
learning to program.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:48.440
So some of that is, programming
is a kind of thing

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.350
that is easy to teach
yourself.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:55.530
And calculus or sociology,
possibly not.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:56.990
The other thing has to do
with-- there's lots of

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.240
educational theory on this.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.860
When you're in a room with a
bunch of people who are all

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:02.700
trying to do calculus, you're
all helping each other and

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:05.580
you're all focusing each other
on the same thing.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.300
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Hangouts.

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.980
WOLFF DOBSON: This
is the thing.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:10.290
You know, a year ago--

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:11.920
COLT McANLIS: I don't think he
was going that direction, but

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.840
I think you just made him
go that direction.

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.880
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, there's
actually a term for it.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.640
It's called the zone of
proximal development.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.440
Like, when we're all in a room
together, we create a zone.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.160
It's actually a very confusing
paper in Polish, but it's--

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.350
I think it's Polish.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.910
Vygotsky is the guy.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.816
COLT McANLIS: Seems legit.

00:33:27.816 --> 00:33:29.270
WOLFF DOBSON: That I actually
can footnote.

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.270
The zone of proximal development
is a real

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:32.010
educational theory.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:32.760
COLT McANLIS: Seems legit.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.990
WOLFF DOBSON: But it really is,
like, when people get in a

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:36.340
room together, they teach
you their stuff.

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.040
And gaming is like this too.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.240
When you're sitting there trying
to figure out how to

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:46.880
optimize your whatever, your
Street Fighter combos, it

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.570
really helps to have somebody
else in the room with you.

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.300
And you're all thinking about
it at the same time.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.510
No, give me the controller,
let me try it.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:52.450
No, give me the controller,
let me try it.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:53.690
Like, this kind of stuff.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:55.640
So I think to the degree that
we can create online

00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.340
communities that create the
zone, so to speak, that's

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.970
going to be an interesting
torque on this.

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:07.150
But the other thing is there
was the study that came out

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:09.110
recently that was saying
that if you--

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:14.440
the money you spend on college,
if you're taking out

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.620
loans, the amount of money you
make, the extra money that you

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.159
make for having a college
degree, does not necessarily

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:22.330
pay back the loans.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.300
Depending on the size of the
loans that you take.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.790
Like, if you borrow completely
to get your college education.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:32.480
But if your parents are paying
for it, it's an awesome deal.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.570
And part of that is because
you're not paying-- the

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:35.510
interest is very different.

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:40.420
But that's more economics
theory than game theory.

00:34:43.857 --> 00:34:45.210
TODD KERPELMAN: What
do you think, John?

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.409
JOHN McCUTCHAN: I think
you move to Canada.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.389
WOLFF DOBSON: I was about
to say, you're Canadian.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.530
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Or any other
country where higher education

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:57.780
is not something that is
equivalent to buying a house.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.540
And then your child's education
fund could be very

00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:06.260
small, relatively speaking,
and it'll be all right.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.040
I mean, by the time I
was done with grad

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.630
school I had made money.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:14.310
TODD KERPELMAN: Wow,
I cannot say that.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:15.960
JOHN McCUTCHAN: You get--

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.250
I mean, you start to get
paid to do research.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:23.040
WOLFF DOBSON: I wouldn't call
the stipend I was getting in

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.200
grad school--

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.680
we called it a pittance.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.050
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Sure, and it
was, but it offset the four

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.040
years of undergrad.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.600
For me, as a Canadian.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.190
WOLFF DOBSON: Not for me.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:35.730
But I went to private school,
so it was crazy.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.720
JOHN McCUTCHAN: We don't
really have that.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.390
TODD KERPELMAN: So
do we have three

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:41.040
comments from the others?

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.250
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Not
as a parent.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:43.112
MALE SPEAKER: So, Todd!

00:35:43.112 --> 00:35:45.170
We have another question
which is on-topic.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.370
TODD KERPELMAN: Oh, a
question on-topic.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.590
MALE SPEAKER: The question is,
and this goes to anyone, what

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.322
free frameworks would
you recommend?

00:35:51.322 --> 00:35:53.030
Now, free, not three.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:54.150
Free.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:56.030
WOLFF DOBSON: Frameworks
for HTML5 development?

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.360
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.650
WOLFF DOBSON: EaselJS.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:35:59.600
It's part of the--

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.890
I think it's CreativeJS?

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:03.450
It's got TweenJS, it's
got all this stuff.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:06.480
If you know a little Flash, or
even a lot of Flash, you'll

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.510
feel very much at
home in Easel.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:13.900
It's not quite Flash, because
containers can't also be

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:20.350
rendered objects, but it is a
retained mode, 2D, Z-sorted

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:21.560
graphics system.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:26.410
So you'll get going really
fast if you use Easel.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:27.600
COLT McANLIS: I highly
recommend

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.070
checking out ImpactJS.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:33.170
I had never written a JavaScript
application before,

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.630
and I started with ImpactJS.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.850
And it taught me a lot about the
language, and about how to

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.700
manipulate the language and
create object inheritance.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.070
And plus it's got a built-in
level editor inside of it, so

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.600
I highly recommend
starting there.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.210
JOHN McCUTCHAN: I'm going
to say skip JS and

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:49.340
head straight to Dart.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:49.990
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, look at you.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.190
Are there good--

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.410
COLT McANLIS: You've got a
free application, right?

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:53.070
WOLFF DOBSON: Are there tools?

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:54.930
Are there game-making tools?

00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:57.060
JOHN McCUTCHAN: There's no
game-making tools yet.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:59.820
But there's quite a few
libraries, a few of which I've

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.550
written, and there's some other
people who are really

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.750
interested in Dart for games,
and there's a bit of a

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:05.390
community going.

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:09.380
There's a Dart gamedev list that
you can-- or Google Group

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.980
discussion list that
you can join.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.276
COLT McANLIS: Dart's really
exciting for games.

00:37:13.276 --> 00:37:14.210
It has some really cool stuff.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:15.490
WOLFF DOBSON: One of the things
that's great about

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:18.940
programming in Flash is that
you have object types, and

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.590
things like this.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:20.180
COLT McANLIS: Object
inheritance.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.530
JOHN McCUTCHAN: A type
system, imagine.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.300
WOLFF DOBSON: And strongly,
or optionally

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.020
strongly typed functions.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.500
COLT McANLIS: I love
the concept of

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.790
optionally strongly typed.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.490
Kinda forget about it.

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:31.070
WOLFF DOBSON: Optionally
strong.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.530
It's like theoretically Flash.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:35.520
TODD KERPELMAN: As not just a
theoretical Flash developer,

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.860
as a former Flash developer,
I really like Dart.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.470
I was like, this feels
very comfortable.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.170
JOHN McCUTCHAN: I was looking at
a comparison of Dart syntax

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.640
to ActionScript, which--

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:46.620
I know nothing about
ActionScript, but I was kind

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.330
of like, after looking at side
by side for all of the

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:51.760
language construct, I'm like,
ah, I know ActionScript.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:55.560
I've got it.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.530
TODD KERPELMAN: I feel like Dart
is kind of the best parts

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:58.660
of both languages.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.305
JOHN McCUTCHAN: There's parts
of many languages, yeah.

00:38:00.305 --> 00:38:02.070
WOLFF DOBSON: There are some
beautifully crazy things you

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:05.060
can do in JavaScript that you
can't do in ActionScript, but.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.740
COLT McANLIS: So I want to
say this real quick, too.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.640
The funny thing is we're all
talking about language here,

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:12.020
and the thing I was trying to
get at at the beginning is

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:13.790
that we should do everything
we can to try to make sure

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.120
that language isn't a barrier.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.470
And so if you're one of the
developers out there who also

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.850
feel this way, I highly
recommend checking out a new

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.880
language called Haxe, H A X E.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.270
The interesting thing about Haxe
is it's sort of designed

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.700
as this meta-level language,
that you program in it and it

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:33.590
actually creates output code
that is JavaScript or C++ or

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.270
ActionScript or Dart.

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:36.930
The really interesting thing
is, when you talk about

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:39.490
investment over time as a
developer, as a programmer you

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.000
care about how you're building
your libraries.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.180
And if you develop it with
Haxe, you're kind of

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.290
future-proofing how you're
moving forward, because at

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.910
bare minimum you could do a
source-to-source translation

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.020
from Haxe to C++ and then move
the direction you need to.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:52.830
Again, not perfect, but--

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.470
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm still going to
harp on debugging, though.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:56.180
Is it easy to debug Haxe?

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.240
COLT McANLIS: So I make no
statements about that.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.940
Just as an option that they
do have support with Flash

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:03.980
developed, and it is out there,
and it is open-source,

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.890
and it is free.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.600
JOHN McCUTCHAN: I mean, most
debuggers have some concept of

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.830
a source map.

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.820
Chrome's debugger has it.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:16.300
GDB, if you emit the correct
DWARF data into your ELF, will

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.440
be able to correctly--

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.060
WOLFF DOBSON: What are you
emitting into an elf?

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.650
COLT McANLIS: That's the topic
of our next show, Emitting

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:23.380
Dwarfs into Elves.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.715
WOLFF DOBSON: No, sadly,
I know what

00:39:24.715 --> 00:39:26.840
you're talking about.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.230
I spent a long time
managing my ELF.

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.630
COLT McANLIS: Did we have
another question on

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:31.280
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.050
WOLFF DOBSON: No,
one last thing.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:37.990
3JS, if you're looking for a
retained-mode 3D option, 3JS

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.650
is pretty cool.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:41.100
Is there something more--

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:48.710
sort of has a bigger
pipeline than 3JS?

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:50.990
Like, 3JS is great, because it
is this retained-mode thing.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.350
But does, like--

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:55.250
from Maya to something
to something

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.670
to rendering framework?

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:59.270
COLT McANLIS: Not that I've
really found, besides the

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.240
Flash route.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.650
A lot of people really haven't
embraced 3D on the Web.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.460
I think 3JS is really the
only example of it.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.680
And again, Web developers
typically don't approach

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.730
things from the concept of "it's
just data." Traditional

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:12.940
game developers, console game
developers, PC game

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.680
developers, they just view it as
a bunch of bytes that they

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.220
transform and they
move around.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.610
And so the pipeline is sort
of secondary to them.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:19.460
The data gets into memory.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.240
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, but if
you're really making big

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:26.400
games, you need to get
all the data from--

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.920
somebody makes Maya, there's a
pipeline, it gets checked in,

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.490
it gets versioned in your
source control--

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.350
JOHN McCUTCHAN: My favorite
answer to this question is

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.440
this library called Assimp.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.950
The asset importer library.

00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:39.250
And this will take--

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.860
TODD KERPELMAN: They
need a better name.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.850
JOHN McCUTCHAN: It's
an awesome name.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:43.920
It's such a good library, too.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:50.080
It will take any model format,
including animation, and load

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.100
it into well-defined,
well-structured C data

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.190
structures.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:58.230
And I used this library to
generate all of the assets for

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.240
both of my engines, and I just
have a different exporter.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.420
But the nice thing is it will
load anything that you throw

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.500
at it, and then you can
just extract the

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.960
vertices and the indices.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:11.750
And it'll do post-processing,
where it'll clean up the mesh

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.220
or regenerate normals,
generate tangents.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.090
COLT McANLIS: So if you're
looking to do 3D on the Web,

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:18.370
definitely check out Assimp.

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:20.290
Definitely look at 3JS.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.450
JOHN McCUTCHAN: It's not an
off-the-shelf solution, but

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:23.990
it'll allow you to write
an exporter.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:25.180
COLT McANLIS: You know what,
that-- most of game

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.940
development is smoke, mirrors,
duct tape and bubble gum, so--

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:28.730
JOHN McCUTCHAN: So true.

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.170
COLT McANLIS: --so that's
completely fine.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:36.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Also, Mr.doob,
he's the, uh.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:37.470
JOHN McCUTCHAN: He wrote 3JS.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:38.500
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah,
he wrote 3JS.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:43.220
And he's on Google+,
you can follow him.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.000
MALE SPEAKER: Speaking of
Google+, a question for you,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.242
Wolff, from the crowd.

00:41:46.242 --> 00:41:48.086
This is from typebox76.

00:41:48.086 --> 00:41:50.884
He says, what do you think of
the integration of Google

00:41:50.884 --> 00:41:53.874
apps, including Google+, into
multiplayer browser games to

00:41:53.874 --> 00:41:57.360
include player interaction.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.070
COLT McANLIS: I'm interested
in this myself.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:01.270
MALE SPEAKER: Or MMORTS.

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:02.430
WOLFF DOBSON: MMORTS.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.930
COLT McANLIS: Whoa,
whoa, wait.

00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:08.390
First off, MMORTS, you're
swingin' big, playa.

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:12.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, that
is a big question.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:15.100
Obviously I'm a big
fan of Hangouts.

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.380
TODD KERPELMAN: You don't say.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.700
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, it's true.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.470
It's true.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.880
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Hangouts?

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.926
I've never heard of them.

00:42:19.926 --> 00:42:21.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah,
they're neat, you

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:22.350
should try them sometime.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:22.810
COLT McANLIS: Tell me more.

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:23.742
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Now?

00:42:23.742 --> 00:42:27.770
COLT McANLIS: If I call now,
do I also get the blender?

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.240
WOLFF DOBSON: No, blender is
a different, that's a 3D--

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.530
COLT McANLIS: Yes, that is in
the 3D modeling package.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.780
Also free and open-source.

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.830
WOLFF DOBSON: There's
a lot-- that's

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.400
an interesting question.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.830
It's something that
I'm interested in.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:46.760
I know with Google+, obviously,
one of the things

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.430
that seems small, but it's kind
of big, is that you can

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:56.190
actually use sign-in with Google
to authenticate people,

00:42:56.190 --> 00:43:00.930
which means that you aren't
inventing another login form

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:04.780
for your game site,
which is awesome.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.810
Let me see here, what
else can you do?

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.290
Google+ in particular.

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:13.450
Hangouts, obviously you can
embed your entire game inside

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:17.420
Hangouts, assuming that it runs
in a Web page someplace.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.970
Which means that everyone
can see it.

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:24.840
Even if you're not running the
game inside a Hangout, you can

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.740
actually screenshare from
Hangouts to share your window,

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.920
your browser window or whatever,
and actually show

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.230
like, look, this is what
I'm seeing right now.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:37.940
There's some lag there, but
it's still a great way.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:42.270
In fact, when we played
Warlight in Hangouts,

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.850
sometimes is people were having
trouble understanding

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.650
the game, I'd just screenshare
my map and be like, see, what

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:48.880
I'm doing is I'm clicking here
and I'm attacking these guys,

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.890
and I have these guys here.

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:53.310
It's actually an amazing tool,
and if you think back to the

00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.570
conversations that you used to
have with people, like when

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.670
you were playing Age of Empires
or StarCraft 2, and

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:02.240
you were like, look what
I see, look what I see!

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.660
And you can't, because you're
separated by 200 miles, and

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:07.520
you're trying to, like,
"No, over to the--

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.140
no, next to the thing!"

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:12.140
There was actually, when I was
playing a long time ago, when

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.010
I worked at Southern Graphics
and Doom came out, I remember

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:17.040
sitting back-to-back with
somebody and we were playing

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.100
co-op Doom.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.040
I was like hey, you gotta
come look at the map.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.990
And he was like OK, and there
was this long pause.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:26.070
"Dude, look at the map."
And he's like, what?

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.505
I'm looking at the map on my
screen, and I take the map

00:44:27.505 --> 00:44:30.290
down, and I see his character
running around me.

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:32.280
And he's like, so is there a
key I press, or something?

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.650
And I reach to his chair
and pull it around,

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:35.540
and he's like, oh!

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.750
I didn't think of that.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:38.350
But with Hangouts, you
can actually do it.

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.910
You can actually do this Share
moment, and I think that's

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:42.830
very interesting.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:44.010
TODD KERPELMAN: You
know what I want?

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:48.510
When I start a raid in an MMO,
I want that to post to my

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:52.420
guild people's circle, post
something in my stream that

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.470
says, Todd is in a raid.

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:54.200
Why don't you join him?

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.460
COLT McANLIS: Click the
link, go to game.

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:58.370
WOLFF DOBSON: If you were in a
Hangout, you can certainly

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.650
name your Hangout
Raid Hangout.

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.300
And then it will appear in your
stream as "Raid Hangout.

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:07.871
You better join me." And then
you can turn on your

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:08.100
screenshare.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.730
I've actually never tried
screensharing a raid.

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:11.410
That would be--

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.460
I'm not sure how that would
work, or if that would work.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:15.710
Somebody try that and
get back to me.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.510
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Homework
for the audience.

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:22.370
TODD KERPELMAN: I'll start a
10-person raid, do it in a

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:23.670
Hangout, see what happens.

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:24.095
COLT McANLIS: Booyeah.

00:45:24.095 --> 00:45:25.550
TODD KERPELMAN: Can
you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:27.280
All right.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:27.940
Do we have time?

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.890
We got time.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:30.860
We got time for one
more question.

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.212
And we're going to
stop our-- reset.

00:45:33.212 --> 00:45:35.540
JOHN McCUTCHAN: What about
what we're playing?

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.200
TODD KERPELMAN: All right,
that's good.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.980
That will be a good
last question.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.720
And we don't even need the timer
for that, because that's

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.755
always fun.

00:45:41.755 --> 00:45:43.210
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Jimmy will
just cut us off.

00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:46.280
TODD KERPELMAN: He'll do the
fadeout music, or whatever.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.400
We'll save these other questions
for next time.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.840
John, what are you playing?

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:54.050
JOHN McCUTCHAN: FTL, Faster Than
Light, which is awesome

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:59.010
roguelike-like, as the creators
like to put it.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:04.220
So it's somewhat, I guess, like
Firefly, where you are a

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.585
random gang of criminals
on a ship, and--

00:46:07.585 --> 00:46:09.220
WOLFF DOBSON: So it's
like my real life.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:12.270
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Yeah,
it's a typical day.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.200
It starts off and it says,
you're carrying some really

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:16.930
important documents and the
rebels are after you.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:23.480
And you have to leap, using your
FTL engine, from planet

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:26.490
to planet, from left to
right on this map.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:31.750
And every time you leap, some
text-based adventure happens,

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:35.350
where it says, OK, you've--
one time I met a cult, and

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.900
it's like, do you want
to look into the Eye?

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.640
And I'm like, sure.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.100
And then boom, one of my
characters is gone.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:44.830
Just disappears,
and that's it.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.890
And then you leap to the next
planet and there's a rebel

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.870
ship there and you have
to fight them.

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.410
And that's when it becomes
almost exactly like an episode

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.610
of Star Trek The Next
Generation, because you're

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.480
managing your crew by clicking
on them and telling them like,

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.750
hey, you, go to the
engine room and

00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:59.930
you repair the engine.

00:46:59.930 --> 00:47:01.840
You, go to the shields place
and you repair the shields.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.390
You, stay here.

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.970
And you start charging up your
weapons, bringing your shields

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.670
up, and you have to manage your
power levels and reroute

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:12.630
power to the subsystem that
needs it the most.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.680
And you're taking out the
enemies, and you can even

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.980
eventually buy a teleporter
where you could teleport from

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.050
your ship to the enemy ship and
then fight hand to hand.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.860
But you have to be careful not
to blow up the enemy ship

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:29.110
while your guys are on it,
because death actually matters

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.810
in this game.

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:31.780
TODD KERPELMAN: No
quick saves?

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.990
WOLFF DOBSON: Star
Trek 3, here.

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.925
JOHN McCUTCHAN: There's
no saves.

00:47:33.925 --> 00:47:35.170
WOLFF DOBSON: What is the
computer's voice saying?

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:39.260
Three, two, get off it,
get off the ship.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.620
JOHN McCUTCHAN: It's
a lot of fun.

00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:42.620
TODD KERPELMAN: So now wasn't
this a-- am I correct in that

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.500
this was a Kickstarter
project originally?

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.660
JOHN McCUTCHAN: I think
it was, actually.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.570
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, if I recall
correctly, they were

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:49.020
building it for a while and then
they Kickstarted it to

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.820
get to the end of it.

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.800
COLT McANLIS: Where do
you get the game now?

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.010
JOHN McCUTCHAN: ftlgame.com,
I guess.

00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.750
COLT McANLIS: Is it on Steam?

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:57.990
JOHN McCUTCHAN: It's on Steam,
and you can Google it.

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:59.950
You'll find it.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.270
TODD KERPELMAN: Google
it, huh?

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.230
WOLFF DOBSON: What
is this thing?

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.490
COLT McANLIS: I'm playing
a great game

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.830
called Arcane Legends.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.690
The guys over at Spacetime
Studios actually hooked me up

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.260
with a secret code that allowed
me to get a preview of

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.330
the game, and I've been
playing it all week.

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:16.170
And it's fantastic.

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:20.820
It's a great MMO that runs on
your phone as well as in the

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.290
browser, running with
Native Client.

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.160
So it's really cool to be able
to actually pick up my phone

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.880
to play the game and then sit at
my desk and play the game,

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.700
too, and be able to play against
the guy next to me

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.430
who's on his device.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:31.320
So really cool.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.810
They got a great visual
art look, great new

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:34.920
dynamic with the game.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:38.870
The monetization really feels
paced instead of-- like, most

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:41.870
micro-transaction stuff you feel
like things are removed

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:43.990
from you that keep you from
having a good time.

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:45.390
No, this game's got it right.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:46.730
WOLFF DOBSON: All that's removed
from you in this game

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:48.190
is your money, is that
what you're saying?

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.920
COLT McANLIS: Yeah,
pretty much.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:50.090
I'm a super big fan
of this game.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:50.740
I think it's fantastic.

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.580
I cannot wait for
it to launch.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:54.850
So Spacetime Studios, you
guys gotta hit that.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:55.630
TODD KERPELMAN: I
saw the trailer.

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:56.430
Cute puppy.

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.890
COLT McANLIS: Yeah.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:59.640
Yeah, the pet mechanic is
really cool, actually.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.060
It kind of walks that line
between Torchlight and a pet

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.490
for, like, an MMO.

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:08.770
So mad loot drops as you're
playing the game, and your pet

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.220
will run around and pick
it up for you.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:16.030
But it also doubles as a tank,
or it'll actually fight with

00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:18.690
you, but won't split your EXP,
which is really cool.

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:19.810
So it's kind of nice.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.640
You have this really interesting
Tamagotchi

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.440
dynamic with it.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.930
You've got to keep it happy and
feed it, but then it also

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:27.990
levels and you can
buy stuff for it.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:29.180
Really, really nice.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:30.470
They found the middle
of the road.

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:31.960
Nothing feels too extreme.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.320
It feels like a really
good, clean game.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:34.910
I'm excited.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.080
I can't wait for it to ship.

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.580
TODD KERPELMAN: I was going to
say, if I want to play it now,

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:38.180
is there anything I can do?

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.910
COLT McANLIS: You have to email
me, and I'll email the

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.160
guys over at Spacetime.

00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:43.990
TODD KERPELMAN: Our
audience too?

00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:45.420
Should we tell everyone
to email Colt?

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:47.290
COLT McANLIS: I think you should
email Spacetime Studios

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:49.680
and say how excited you are
about the game, and maybe

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.130
they'll put you on the beta.

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:52.725
Don't hold me to that.

00:49:52.725 --> 00:49:55.330
But yeah, it's a great game.

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:58.270
TODD KERPELMAN: I have had very
little time to play games

00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:59.480
the last couple weeks.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.515
I've got my family in town now,
and apparently I can't

00:50:02.515 --> 00:50:05.200
ignore them and go off into
the office and play games.

00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:08.710
So a little bit of Skyrim,
because that's going to be my

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:11.430
answer for the next year
until I complete it.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:12.440
But that's been it.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.360
I'm hoping to get back into some
more gaming in the next

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.460
couple weeks.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:18.540
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm
the same way.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.950
I've been cranking on stuff, so
I haven't had much chance

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.520
to play things.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.910
Still playing SteamBirds.

00:50:26.910 --> 00:50:29.300
I got hooked on that, and
now I'm hooked on

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.700
getting all the stars.

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.960
Because the thing with
SteamBirds is it's like, you

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.950
go in and you're like, oh, I got
the bad guys, that's fine.

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:36.860
And it's like, "No stars.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:40.290
Keep your planes healthier."
And you're like, OK.

00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.200
Then you go back and then
you're like ohh,

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.250
I almost got it!

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:44.200
OK, I understand now.

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.780
And I began seeing how the game
fit together and I was

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:50.640
like oh, actually this
is very clever.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.270
I got hooked on it.

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:53.580
But honestly, not much gaming.

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.550
Too much building.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:55.860
JOHN McCUTCHAN: What
is that on?

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.020
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm playing
it on my Nexus 7.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.210
You can get it on Android.

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:01.270
I think you can look
for it on the Web.

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:05.070
But honestly, the Nexus 7
experience has been-- again, I

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:07.720
go and I get a sandwich and
I'm sitting in the cafe

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.130
dripping barbecue sauce
on my Nexus 7.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:11.340
JOHN McCUTCHAN: Barbecue
sauce-proof.

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.820
You can actually put it in 100
meters of barbecue sauce.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:15.120
COLT McANLIS: True.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.690
We tried it.

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:17.420
JOHN McCUTCHAN: And
it still works.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.710
COLT McANLIS: We'll have
the video next episode.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:21.530
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, the Nexus 7
has been a really fun gaming

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:22.990
device for me.

00:51:22.990 --> 00:51:24.560
I see you're checking out
SteamBirds there.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.524
TODD KERPELMAN: I was.

00:51:25.524 --> 00:51:27.940
I was like, let me see what
it's available on.

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.790
So I think you and I clearly
need to play more games.

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.530
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm going to play
some games this weekend,

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:31.800
and I will get back to you.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.700
TODD KERPELMAN: It's sort of
embarrassing that we're in the

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:34.850
Google Games Chat, and--

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:36.230
COLT McANLIS: Well, we'll
shift, we'll shift.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.760
You guys have been working, so
you'll play games for the next

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.530
two weeks and we'll
actually do work.

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:41.810
And then shift again.

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.430
It's just the ebb and flow
of the universe.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:45.560
WOLFF DOBSON: It's
like job-sharing.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.670
COLT McANLIS: We're outsourcing
the gameplay.

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:49.440
TODD KERPELMAN: Put that on
my goals for the quarter.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.130
Play more games.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:51.460
All right.

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.630
Well, I think that is it.

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.510
We're just about out of time.

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:56.190
We'd like to thank everybody
for joining

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:57.775
us and asking questions.

00:51:57.775 --> 00:51:58.730
COLT McANLIS: We love
having questions.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:59.320
TODD KERPELMAN: That was nice.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.570
It was like we had a little
conversation with you.

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:02.630
COLT McANLIS: Big round
of applause for Jimmy.

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:03.970
Everybody give it
up for Jimmy.

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:08.380
And is Jimmy going
to fade us out?

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:09.630
All right, Jimmy's going
to fade us out.

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:10.230
Bye, everybody!

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:37.000
