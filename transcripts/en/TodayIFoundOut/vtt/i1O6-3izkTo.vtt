Do Sharks Really Not Like How Humans Taste?

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.550
The idea of sharks not liking the taste of
humans has been around for at least a half

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.289
a century, with the first account of this
notion (that we could find) appearing in a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.250
Sep. 2, 1968 edition of The Evening Independent
in an article titled “Expert Says Sharks

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.740
Dislike Human Taste”.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.320
In it, the associate curator of vertebrate
paleontology at the Los Angeles County Museum

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.980
of Natural History, Dr Shelton Applegate,
noted that it was his opinion that swimmers

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.180
generally survived shark attacks because “Most
of them [sharks] after they take the first

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.780
bite, find they don’t like the taste and
spit it out.”

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.120
(In another article in this same edition of
this newspaper, it notes that one Dr John

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.041
Tracy had recently come up with a revolutionary
treatment for any disease that can’t be

00:00:55.041 --> 00:01:00.720
cured by traditional means- beating it out
of the patient, in a process he called “impact

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.030
therapy”- literally striking the patient
repeatedly with a twenty pound sandbag until

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.030
they feel better…)

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.509
But do sharks really not like the taste of
humans?

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:13.909
First, a couple caveats- there are hundreds
of different types of sharks, only a handful

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.310
of which have ever been known to bite a human.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.710
On top of that, accurately determining why
a specific shark, or any animal, does something

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.080
can at times be incredibly difficult and the
general view from experts on the subject can

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.719
change over time, as has happened concerning
this very question.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.909
That said, why certain sharks attack humans
has been very closely looked at over the last

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.020
century and, as a result of this accumulation
of data, scientists today who study the creatures

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.569
think they have a fairly good handle on why
sharks don’t usually eat people, at least

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.299
in the general case.

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.590
With those caveats out of the way- when talking
about the typical sharks people think of when

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.100
discussing shark attacks (e.g.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.710
Great White’s and Tiger sharks), in a sense,
yes, sharks do not like the way humans “taste”,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.679
but you’ll get a false impression if you
stop reading here, because we’re not talking

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.610
about the flavour of humans per se and sharks
also seem to be weighing the risk vs. reward

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.610
on this one.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.290
You see, sharks are perfectly happy to eat
red meat and in a pinch have no qualms about

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.620
chowing down on you.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.440
But they are also seemingly well aware of
the fact that the composition of the human

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.620
body isn’t an ideal food source for them
and also aren’t keen on the fact that, when

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.200
bitten, humans have a tendency to fight back
around a very sensitive and vulnerable region

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.690
of said shark’s body.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.650
So why do sharks bite humans in the first
place then?

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.970
First, to dispel one of many shark myths out
there, sharks do not bite humans because they

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.480
mistake us for pinnipeds (sea lions or seals)
or any of their other preferred food sources.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.640
We know this because a shark’s behaviour
when it is attacking, for instance, a seal,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.940
is very different than the typical behavior
seen when they bite humans.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.780
As the director of ReefQuest Center for Shark
Research, R. Aidan Martin, notes,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.150
I spent five years in South Africa and observed
over 1,000 predatory attacks on sea lions

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.650
by great whites.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.780
The sharks would rocket to the surface and
pulverize their prey with incredible force.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.260
In contrast, he notes that when sharks bite
humans, they generally approach with “leisurely

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.060
or undramatic behavior.”

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.040
Further, sharks are very intelligent and have
extremely acute senses, including incredibly

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.040
sharp vision and sense of smell (Lemon sharks
can even detect tuna oil at a concentration

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.400
of just one part per 25 million), as well
as good hearing; they can also detect bioelectrical

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.000
fields and minute changes in water pressure.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.890
Beyond that humans don’t really look like
pinnipeds, neither visually nor likely from

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.660
a bioelectrical standpoint, it is noted that
sharks respond very strongly to the smell

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.490
of things like pinnipeds and fish, but not
at all to the general smell of humans.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.030
Add it all up, and it is generally thought
very unlikely that a shark would mistake a

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.210
human for a seal as is the common trope, and
the evidence of how they approach us lends

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.160
credence to this notion.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.569
This brings us to the real reason sharks bite
humans- curiosity.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.900
When sharks encounter an unfamiliar creature
that might be a potential food source, they’ll

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.970
sometimes be inclined to investigate more
closely.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.630
But as shark biologist Dr Erich Ritter notes,
“The unknown is always potentially dangerous

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.340
and – even for the shark – harbors a certain
risk.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.930
Approaching or biting the unknown object is
thus an exception and not the rule!”

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.900
When sharks do feel curious enough to approach
and bite, the aforementioned shark expert

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.470
R. Aidan Martin adds: “When great whites
bite something unfamiliar to them, whether

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.230
a person or a crab pot, they’re looking
for tactile evidence about what it is.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.490
A great white uses its teeth the way humans
use their hands.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.100
In a living shark, every tooth has ten to
fifteen degrees of flex,” which, beyond

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.560
taste and the smell of subsequent blood, is
another way the sharks can study a creature

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.820
by biting it.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.740
So when investigating a human, it’s generally
the case that the shark will approach cautiously,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.750
rather than the way they attack prey they’re
familiar with.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.040
If you seem like you’re trying to flee from
them, they may be inclined to approach more

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.040
aggressively.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.840
Otherwise, if you just sit there or don’t
seem like you’re going to attack them as

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.040
they approach, for instance if you don’t
see them coming (which may well be what they’re

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.900
going for), they might go in for a nibble
to get a better sense of your body and if

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.830
it might be a good food source for them, as
well as see what you’ll do in response to

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.830
the bite.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.150
(Unfortunately, even a quick nibble from a
large shark can be life threatening, accounting

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.860
for most of the deaths we humans suffer at
the hands of sharks, rather than them purposefully

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.370
chowing down.)

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.660
Back to the idea that sharks don’t like
the taste of humans.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.669
As mentioned, this idea has been around since
at least the mid-20th century, but as experts

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.690
such as Dr Daniel Bucher of Southern Cross
University note, there is really very little

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.180
evidence that the reason sharks don’t eat
humans is because of our taste, in terms of

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.180
flavour, at least.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.440
To quote him, “Normally [sharks] eat fish,
but they don’t mind red meat if they can

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.480
get it.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.740
Seals have very red meat (like humans) from
oxygen binding proteins in the blood and sharks

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.150
eat seals”.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.131
While sharks do have taste buds that tell
them a lot about the composition of the thing

00:06:18.131 --> 00:06:22.720
it’s tasting, distinct “flavour” does
not seem to be a major factor that impacts

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.970
whether a shark will eat something or not.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.260
For many types of sharks, the evidence at
hand seems to indicate that their taste buds

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.570
more function as a sort of binary “eat”,
which generally is a “yes” as far as the

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.230
taste buds are concerned if the thing is determined
to be made from meat, or “no” if it’s

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.071
not, explaining why sharks can happily eat
carrion and rotting flesh if they’re particularly

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:45.071
hungry.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:49.350
In fact, “the garbage cans of the sea”
better known as Tiger sharks go even further

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.139
and really don’t seem to have much in the
way of any sort of taste filter when it comes

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.270
to eating things.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.580
For instance, Tiger sharks have been found
with things like suits of armor, fur coats

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.160
and live hand grenades in their stomachs.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.169
But we said at the beginning of all this that
“in a sense” sharks don’t like the taste

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:11.260
of humans, so what sense were we referring
if they aren’t too particular on the flavour

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.260
of something?

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.700
As alluded to, sharks don’t like the way
many humans are built and it often requires

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.190
a nibble for them to determine this fact.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.110
Many of the things sharks normally eat are
extremely high in fat; fat contains a little

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.530
more than twice the calories per gram than
muscle.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.330
Humans are (often) relatively bony, particularly
in the legs and arms.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:36.190
This isn’t ideal for the shark as they have
a quite slow digestive system, which is further

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.580
slowed by the presence of all our many thick
bones.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.320
Since sharks need a lot of calories to maintain
proper body function, spending a few days

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.190
digesting a human instead of eating something
much more calorie dense isn’t ideal.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:53.800
That said, sans having other high fat food
sources available, humans, particularly those

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.710
of us who decided to eat the entire six pack
box of ice cream sandwiches last night (don’t

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:03.400
judge me), still make an OK meal for certain
types of sharks, and in the extreme case some

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.900
of us even make an excellent meal, though
perhaps not the humans you’d generally find

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.610
bobbing up and down on a surfboard in the
ocean.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.479
But given options, and if they’re not too
hungry at the time, the sharks that are capable

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:19.790
of chowing down on something the size of a
human prefer a nice tasty high fat meal like

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.310
a seal or tuna.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.040
This brings us to the second factor in why
sharks don’t seem to like to eat humans;

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.340
this one having nothing to do with nutrition-
they’re afraid.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.890
Despite their fearsome reputation and status
as apex predators, sharks don’t generally

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.810
like eating things that put up a fight.

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:40.260
Particularly when talking about creatures
the shark isn’t terribly familiar with and

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.111
that are determined to have sub-optimal nutritional
value, when said animals fight back, there

00:08:45.111 --> 00:08:49.320
is a good chance the shark will be scared
away if it’s not too hungry.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.080
From there, it’s interesting to note that
where you are in the world actually may affect

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.649
what the shark does next.

00:08:54.649 --> 00:08:58.980
Great White sharks in California have been
observed to strike potentially dangerous prey

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.779
and then, if the shark determines said creature
is still an OK food source and it managed

00:09:03.779 --> 00:09:07.890
to wound it before fleeing, it may watch at
a safe distance to see if the animal will

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.510
die from its wounds, making it an easier snack.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.960
This same behavior has not been widely observed
in many other regions, like South Africa,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.770
where if a Great White has decided to actually
eat something, it will simply ferociously

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.839
chow down on its prey, as previously noted.

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:27.370
So to sum up, a human’s (generally) low
fat content and the fact that we are an unknown,

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.670
potentially dangerous, creature that is putting
up a fight, including being fully capable

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:36.980
of gouging out the shark’s sensitive eyes
as we beat on their faces (which is the recommended

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.620
way to fend off an attacking shark, though
if possible using an object, rather than hands

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.710
and feet), makes sharks hesitant to do more
than just investigate us as a potential food

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.830
source, rather than actually deciding to make
us one.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.290
We’re simply not worth the risk given the
poor reward.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.950
So while it’s not true that the types of
sharks that occasionally nibble on humans

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.480
don’t like the taste of us, in terms of
flavour, it is in a sense true that they don’t

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.010
like the taste of us in terms of composition.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.240
And as afraid of sharks as humans often are,
all evidence indicates the feeling is mutual.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.590
(Perhaps for good reason: only about a dozen
people per year are killed by sharks vs. approximately

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:21.660
20-30 million sharks per year killed by humans

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.420
Another shark related myth is that they don’t
get cancer.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.790
In fact, recent studies investigating this
idea have shown that sharks do get cancer

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.339
on occasion, though how frequently isn’t
yet clear.

00:10:32.339 --> 00:10:37.070
According to studies to date, they do have
relatively low susceptibility to cancer compared

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.880
to many other animals, but at this point the
number of studies done and cases looked at

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.360
are so low that this may well simply be an
artifact of not having a broad enough sample

00:10:46.360 --> 00:11:03.380
size to work with.
