00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.240
(piano music)

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:12.338
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.338 --> 00:00:14.755
Bi-pedal, naked, large brain.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.738
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:25.155
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.224 --> 00:00:29.556
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:31.723
Yet, filled with optimism.

00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:35.012
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.012 --> 00:00:37.635
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.635 --> 00:00:39.718
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:43.739
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.739
of the past.

00:00:46.607 --> 00:00:50.231
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:54.398
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.294 --> 00:00:58.975
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.975 --> 00:01:00.642
of humans, like you.

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:18.102
(upbeat music)

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:37.349
- Welcome, everybody, to
the CARTA Open Symposium,

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.164
Public Symposium, on Awareness of Death

00:01:39.164 --> 00:01:41.048
and Personal Mortality,

00:01:41.048 --> 00:01:44.804
and its implications for anthropogeny.

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:47.804
I'm Rusty Gage, and I'm one of your,

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.013
one of the co-organizers
of CARTA, in general.

00:01:55.345 --> 00:01:58.928
CARTA is founded on
these basic principles,

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:04.429
of what are the oldest
questions regarding humans.

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.015
Who are we?

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:07.929
What are we doing here?

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.805
Where did we come from?

00:02:09.805 --> 00:02:11.341
How did we get here?

00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:13.114
And, where are we going?

00:02:13.114 --> 00:02:15.653
Most of these questions
are not really tractable

00:02:15.653 --> 00:02:18.238
in modern scientific sense of things.

00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:20.172
We focus in on a couple of them

00:02:20.172 --> 00:02:24.703
that we believe resonate with
multi-disciplinary approach

00:02:24.703 --> 00:02:26.599
to understanding.

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.659
So, where do we come from?

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.033
And, how did we get here?

00:02:31.033 --> 00:02:34.615
The term that we've used
to coin our interest

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:38.347
is anthropogeny, or explaining
the origin of humans.

00:02:38.347 --> 00:02:42.797
And it is currently defined in
the Oxford English Dictionary

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:45.458
as the investigation of
the origins of humans.

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:48.125
But the term harks back to 1839,

00:02:49.918 --> 00:02:51.458
and Hooper's Medical Dictionary

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:54.708
and the study of the generation of man.

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:58.438
A little bit about our organization.

00:02:58.438 --> 00:02:59.820
CARTA stands for the

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.558
Center for Academic Research
and Training in Anthropogeny.

00:03:04.558 --> 00:03:07.766
As I said, I'm one of three co-directors.

00:03:07.766 --> 00:03:11.433
Ajit Varki at the School
of Medicine at UCSD

00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:14.500
and Margaret Schoeninger, who's the past

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.000
Chair of Anthropology at USCD.

00:03:17.932 --> 00:03:20.160
Importantly, Pascal Gagneux
is our Associate Professor

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.685
in Pathology, he's also
the Associate Director.

00:03:24.685 --> 00:03:27.258
We have a fabulous staff
that's been working with us

00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:31.708
for many years to make this
whole process run smoothly.

00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:35.875
Most importantly, Linda Nelson,
Ingrid Bernischke-Perkins,

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.189
Kate Kaya, Vishu Nandigam and Jesse Robie,

00:03:44.396 --> 00:03:46.782
who's been helpful, all
of them have been helpful

00:03:46.782 --> 00:03:48.115
in so many ways.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.552
The fun thing about this meeting,

00:03:51.552 --> 00:03:55.314
and this approach to
understanding the origins of man

00:03:55.314 --> 00:03:59.397
are that, it's a
cross-disciplinary organization.

00:04:00.544 --> 00:04:02.349
And many of you that have
attended our conferences

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.272
in the past have seen
that we blend humanities,

00:04:05.272 --> 00:04:08.892
biological sciences, engineering,
physical and chemical

00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:12.038
sciences, as well as the social sciences,

00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:16.108
together to answer some of
these important questions.

00:04:16.108 --> 00:04:19.929
Our mission, that we've sort of come to,

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:22.488
after having been involved in
lots of other organizations

00:04:22.488 --> 00:04:26.358
in the past, is to use
all the, is this set

00:04:26.358 --> 00:04:29.110
of mission statements
that we put together,

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.229
that we hope you'll appreciate.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.392
So we use all rational
and ethical approaches

00:04:33.392 --> 00:04:37.003
to seek all verifiable facts
from all relevant disciplines

00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:41.170
to explore and explain the
origins of the human phenomenon.

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:46.676
While minimizing complex
organizational structures

00:04:46.676 --> 00:04:49.411
and hierarchies, and avoiding
unnecessary paperwork

00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:50.953
and bureaucracy.

00:04:50.953 --> 00:04:53.226
(laughter)

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:54.914
So, many of you, I see, can appreciate

00:04:54.914 --> 00:04:56.089
the importance of that.

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:58.127
And in the process, we
hope to raise awareness

00:04:58.127 --> 00:05:00.346
and understanding of the
study of human origins

00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:01.649
within the academic communities,

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:03.487
but at the public at large.

00:05:03.487 --> 00:05:06.160
And that's what these
afternoon talks on Friday

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.910
are meant to achieve.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.485
We want a special thanks to the G. Harold

00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:15.344
and Leila Mathers Charitable Foundation

00:05:15.344 --> 00:05:16.843
in New York.

00:05:16.843 --> 00:05:20.926
The current Executive
Director is Howard Chester.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.875
This organization has, for
many years, been the major

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.620
benefactor for this meeting.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.925
And we are deeply indebted
to their commitment.

00:05:30.925 --> 00:05:32.522
We'd also like to give a special thanks

00:05:32.522 --> 00:05:36.391
to Annette Merle-Smith,
who's with us today.

00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:38.266
Raise your hand, please.

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:39.381
(laughter)

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.890
For her support of the
Graduate Specialization

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.870
in Anthropogeny.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.396
Which some of you are
aware of, but it's really

00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:47.123
a terrific program we support
this cross-disciplinary

00:05:47.123 --> 00:05:51.147
research for the students in the program.

00:05:51.147 --> 00:05:54.897
We have a new fund, a
Memorial Symposium Fund

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.893
that we've begun, on
honor of Jim Handelman

00:05:58.893 --> 00:06:01.375
who passed away recently.

00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:05.042
And the plan is to endow
this in the future.

00:06:07.651 --> 00:06:11.558
And already we have a good list of people

00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:14.148
that have appreciated these
symposiums over the years

00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:15.997
that have donated to this.

00:06:15.997 --> 00:06:17.679
And we're looking for more.

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:21.396
On a broader scale, we
would like to thank,

00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:23.609
or on a more micro-scale,
we'd like to thank the sponsor

00:06:23.609 --> 00:06:27.595
of today's symposium for
closed caption on YouTube,

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:31.989
and this is Sue Rosner, Eli
Shefter and Elizabeth Lancaster.

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:35.716
We do have a donor list
of people that are,

00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:38.672
in general, supporting CARTA,
not just the symposium,

00:06:38.672 --> 00:06:41.081
but many of the other
things we try to achieve.

00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:43.296
And I'm just throwing up their names here.

00:06:43.296 --> 00:06:47.849
But we're happy to say
that the list is growing.

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.919
And I'll leave these up just for a moment.

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.320
You can become a member and
supporter of CARTA today.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.378
And we'll use your support
to support the symposium

00:06:58.378 --> 00:07:02.128
and other activities in
this nonprofit group.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:07.532
Finally, I'd like to
thank those that do such

00:07:07.532 --> 00:07:10.199
a wonderful job here at UCSD-TV.

00:07:11.422 --> 00:07:15.419
These lectures will be recorded
and made available online.

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.013
So if you didn't get
everything that you wanted to

00:07:18.013 --> 00:07:19.701
get out of these, you can watch them again

00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:21.635
and get more out of them.

00:07:21.635 --> 00:07:26.620
So, Rich Wargo, Matt Alioto,
Marci Bretts and Jacob Parker.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.047
And here at the Salk, we want to thank

00:07:29.047 --> 00:07:31.069
our ever-present Kent Schnoeker,

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:33.898
who's back up there running everything.

00:07:33.898 --> 00:07:36.319
And finally, give a
round of applause to Ed

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:38.205
for his wonderful piano.

00:07:38.205 --> 00:07:40.455
(applause)

00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:47.443
(upbeat music)
