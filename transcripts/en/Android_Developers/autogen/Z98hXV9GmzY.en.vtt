00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:01.859
 Development of applications for Android 

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:04.441
 Is an exciting opportunity to change the world. 

00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.740
 I'll let you know about the process of starting with Android 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.230
 Using Android Studio 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.010
 With some professional tips 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 Based on the experiences of a truly emerging Android company. 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.740
 Before we even install Android Studio 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.554
 You should start thinking about the application you plan to build. 

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:21.420
 Start by thinking about challenges 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.290
 That you and your friends and family face. 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.135
 Can you build an application that can resolve one of these problems? 

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:28.340
 Let's look at the company's emerging team 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.890
 We see where their thoughts come from. 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.970
 Is there anyone inside? Open. 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.250
 Faster. 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.390
 open it. 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.470
 Put something out there. 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.520
 I just kick it open, come on. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.180
 Well, this was unexpected. 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.630
 what the hell? 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.930
 What is going on? 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.900
 Zombie. It must have been zombie. 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.259
 I do not know how, but I bet that bald guy is somewhat responsible. 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:04.379
 Of course. 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.462
 I solved the problem using Android Nomicon 

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:07.990
 Suddenly this is my mistake. 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.580
 How will we survive in a zombie-dominated world? 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.590
 We are not trained! 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.590
 It's not like we can go to Google Play 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.895
 And download an application. 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.770
 <i>Information # 1: Solve a real problem</i> 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.320
 Such as our start-up company startup team have a problem you must solve. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 So it is time to start development. 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.880
 First verify that you have version 7 or later 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.250
 From the Java Development Kit 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.725
 Open a terminal window or command prompt 

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:35.149
 And type java-version. 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.600
 I'm doing this on a Mac, but it should look very similar 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.065
 On Linux or Windows. 

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:41.490
 The version number of Java appears after one. 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.610
 So you can see here. 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.610
 JDK version 8 is installed for me. 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.860
 If you see an error or the version is below 7 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.170
 You will need to download and install JDK. 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.140
 From this download page, find the Java platform Standard Edition. 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.440
 Choose Download, and then choose the appropriate set for your operating system. 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.810
 I am on Mac so I will accept the license agreement. 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.220
 And download the Mac OSX x64 installer from the Java SE Development Kit. 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.199
 Once downloaded, find the file 

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.680
 Then click it twice to start the installation process. 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.700
 Once it is complete, return to your terminal 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.650
 And make sure they are installed correctly. 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.740
 You are now ready to install Android Studio. 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.730
 We'll start by going to the Android Studio home page. 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.321
 On developer.android.com/sdk. 

00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:25.820
 There is a big button at the top 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.730
 Download Android Studio. 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.980
 Click it. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.382
 Read now carefully the terms and conditions. 

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:34.310
 Select the check box to confirm that it is read and approved. 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.560
 Then click the Download Android Studio button 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.056
 To start data transfer. 

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:39.610
 The file is too large, 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.050
 While waiting for completion, 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.110
 You have a great chance to start thinking about the APIs 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.850
 Which you will use to build the application that will solve your problem. 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.230
 At this early time of the product life cycle 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.560
 It is useful to explore some of the options available 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.555
 Using new versions or even early beta versions 

00:02:54.555 --> 00:02:56.194
 Of the Android platform. 

00:02:56.554 --> 00:02:58.140
 Look here for the new APIs available 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.110
 Available from Android version Marshmallow. 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.070
 Let us take a look at our emerging company team 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.826
 While exploring possible possibilities for its application. 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.000
 - Ian. - What is our situation? 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.030
 How are you doing? 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.670
 I'm really glad we took this Dual Boot Chromebook 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.170
 On our exit. 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.742
 Google has a set of APIs for site services and maps. 

00:03:16.082 --> 00:03:17.745
 What do you think of the Fitness API? 

00:03:17.745 --> 00:03:19.691
 We need to make sure it works with Android Wear. 

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:21.030
 Focus! 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.160
 Zombie! 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.370
 Is there an API to kill zombies or protect against it or the like? 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.090
 GPS applications are very popular now. 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.690
 I can not find anything here 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.000
 Check your Android Zed version preview. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.400
 - What? - Android Zed, Preview. 

00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:38.915
 - What? G. 

00:03:38.915 --> 00:03:41.157
 G, as in the word زيتون. 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.520
 O Australians! 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.690
 Hey Americans! 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.130
 Ah yes. there he is. 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.080
 So there is a way the zombie user is in the frame now. 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.379
 It's nice to have this in the support library. 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.169
 <i>Information # 2: Use the support library</i> 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.550
 As the download is complete, you're ready to install Android Studio. 

00:03:57.964 --> 00:04:00.620
 If you're using a Mac system like me, double-click the file to open it. 

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:04.255
 Then drag the Android icon to Applications. 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.130
 Click the icon twice to launch Android Studio. 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.150
 for the first time. 

00:04:14.457 --> 00:04:16.540
 If you're on Windows, double-click the download 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.840
 Will be installed 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.041
 Similar to what I will show here on Mac 

00:04:21.291 --> 00:04:24.190
 We'll then set a standard installation for Android Studio. 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.050
 Press Finish to complete the installation 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.130
 This will start downloading two to three gigabytes 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.960
 Includes the Android SDK. 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.610
 This will take some time, so the opportunity to take a break, 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.000
 Making a cup of tea, 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.924
 Think of things as how to invest your app. 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.610
 What do you see about investment? 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.310
 I feel that billing in the app will be great 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.270
 For all additional skills and defenses 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.380
 But the subscription will be very fixed. 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.730
 Maybe we can try both ways. 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.220
 To see which one will be more effective. 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.691
 That's true. This is a good Idea. 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.810
 Should we worry about performance now? 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.559
 I mean if you are being stalked by a zombie 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:59.410
 We must be responsive. Right? 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.469
 Right. 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.690
 So it is clear in our application that we can not use any eNoms 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.359
 I do not know. Is this a risk of early improvement? 

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:06.900
 Listen now. We talked-- 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.025
 Okay. 

00:05:08.556 --> 00:05:09.688
 Download finished. 

00:05:10.997 --> 00:05:13.387
 <i>Information # 3: Downloads take a long time</i> 

00:05:13.387 --> 00:05:15.490
 <i>Information # 4: Proactive improvements are not premature</i> 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.260
 <i>Information # 5: Do not forget the zombie</i> 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.248
 Well, the download is complete. 

00:05:20.248 --> 00:05:22.598
 Click Finish and the download has been done. 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.250
 You are now ready to start programming 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.940
 We will start creating a new Hello World project 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.150
 You can build it. 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.980
 Keep in mind that Android Studio 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.160
 It is constantly updated and improved. 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.990
 As a result, track the process of your edition 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.600
 It may look a bit different from what I see on the screen. 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.150
 do not worry. 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.000
 Options displayed in the general flow 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.820
 Should be very similar. 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.750
 Start by choosing Start a new Android Studio project. 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.910
 Give it a name and enter a domain. 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.850
 These two will be used together to form the name of your application package. 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.840
 The package names must be unique. 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.590
 So you'd prefer to have a domain and you can use it here. 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.070
 Even if you do not own one, 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.960
 Try to identify something that is unlikely to conflict with another developer. 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.740
 I own a domain, so I'll enter it here. 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.540
 It suits me to use the default project location. 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.040
 To continue, click Next 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.870
 We can now identify the devices we plan to target with our app. 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.170
 Ultimately, we want to make our app available 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.040
 In all possible model factors. 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.030
 But for our first applications 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.130
 Let's keep it simple and target only phones and tablets. 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.810
 Then we can determine the minimum SDK we intend to support. 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.400
 Selecting the Minimum SDK allows you to choose the level of your app 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.940
 In terms of support for earlier versions. 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.460
 Low value makes your app available to a number of devices. 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.390
 But in return it requires more work 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.230
 To ensure compatibility with devices 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.570
 Which may not support all added features 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.170
 In newer Android versions. 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.680
 You can check to see the ratio of Android devices 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.280
 That works on every operating system version 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.380
 By clicking on this help link. 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.990
 When we shot this video in October 2015 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.670
 Our support allowed even Android 4.0 or Ice Cream Sandwich 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.880
 Access to about 90% of the devices. 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.360
 You will now be asked to select a new activity 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.430
 Or type a UI screen to add to your project. 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.300
 Let's start, we'll select an empty activity. 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.330
 Give it a name and address. 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.960
 Other files and planning and existing resources 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.865
 You will be automatically generated. 

00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:19.540
 You can keep your default names. 

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.410
 Then click Finish. 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.140
 Check out some tips and wait for your new project. 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.640
 This may take some time the first time you run it. 

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.808
 So we have prepared one in advance. 

00:07:31.358 --> 00:07:33.977
 Your Hello World application is now operational 

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:35.820
 You can see it working on the emulator 

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.120
 By pressing the green Run button like this 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.685
 And choose the emulator. 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.880
 But it's more fun running it on a real Android device. 

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.000
 Enable USB debugging by going to Settings 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.570
 Get down to About Phone. 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.810
 Then scroll down, and press the building number seven times. 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.980
 This will enable developer options. 

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.330
 Go back. 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.250
 Select developer options, and enable USB debugging from there. 

00:08:04.076 --> 00:08:05.320
 If you are running Windows, 

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.617
 You'll also need to download a driver for your phone. 

00:08:07.617 --> 00:08:10.437
 You can find the necessary drivers and installation instructions 

00:08:10.437 --> 00:08:11.810
 Here on the Android developer site 

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.060
 On developer.android.com/tools/extra/oem-usb 

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:18.940
 Now connect your phone to your computer, 

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.310
 If prompted, choose Allow errors to be corrected via USB. 

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.450
 Click the Run button in Android Studio 

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.500
 But this time select your real device. 

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.620
 Congratulations. 

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.120
 You are running your first app on a real phone. 

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.980
 Then you're ready to start building a real application, 

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.020
 Unlike this example, you need a lot of time 

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.570
 In a pleasant, responsive and user-friendly experience. 

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.539
 On this occasion, to see what news our company's emerging team. 

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.870
 I ran the app, however, how do I know if it works? 

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.070
 It does not work. 

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.440
 Have you enabled real-time location settings? 

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.040
 Moment, is that the brain icon or the celery stick? 

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.090
 The celery oud. 

00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.793
 Then pass down, and press the version number seven times. 

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.660
 Do you understand any of this, Joanna? 

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.630
 I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you, my friends. 

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.760
 I decided to join a different startup company named Meatr 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.740
 It will link the zombie with two human hosts 

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.330
 Their arrival is achieved by tasty fresh minds on demand. 

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.620
 So it would be great. 

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.276
 But with you right, I probably have to go from here. 

00:09:18.126 --> 00:09:19.606
 Good luck guys. 

00:09:19.606 --> 00:09:21.856

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.812
 She could have left the shelf. 

00:09:27.812 --> 00:09:31.710
 <i>Information # 7: Take the shelf with you always</i> 

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.040
 Unfortunately for our brave young team, 

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.480
 They were late in marketing. 

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.280
 And have experienced some serious problems in their design of the user experience. 

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.400
 You can avoid errors using our resources 

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.240
 To learn how to build and design wonderful Android applications. 

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.747
 good luck. 

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.570
 Meatr delivery. 

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:52.710
 Hi. 

00:09:53.028 --> 00:09:54.384
 Hello guys. 

00:09:54.744 --> 00:09:56.101
 How are you doing? 

00:09:56.561 --> 00:09:59.470
 Do you know, Colt, we absolutely used eNom to get to the market faster. 

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.470
