00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.020
With a rarified (or super thin) atmosphere
looking at the stars from Mars must be incredible!

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.460
But at night on Mars, there's also another
source of light ... the atmosphere of the

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:17.210
Red Planet is literally glowing!

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.040
Howdy glow worms, this is DNews, and I'm Trace.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.970
Nightglow is the tendency for the atmosphere
of a planet to glow in complete absence of

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.230
external light.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.140
This bizarre effect was spotted in mid-2016
by MAVEN.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.559
The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN
mission was sent to orbit Mars to ascertain

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.879
how Mars was stripped of its ancient atmosphere.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.810
But, while analyzing ultraviolet pictures
scientists spotted this nightglow in the swirling

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.610
high-altitude air of our rust-colored neighbor…

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.309
Okay first, MAVEN has found that the sun's
constant barrage of energy from it's nuclear

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.699
reactions have slowly stripped the atmosphere
of the planet to it's current level, 100 to

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.410
150 times thinner than our on Earth.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.350
That same stripping of the atmosphere is causing
the nightglow that MAVEN spotted!

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.220
When ultraviolet light from the sun hits the
"leading edge" of the planet the energy in

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.110
the particles break down carbon dioxide, nitrogen
and oxygen which are all floating around in

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.430
the Martian sky.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.430
This is called photodissociation.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.240
The now-broken-up particles, are then carried
on high altitude winds all around the planet.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.650
Once they reach the nightside of Mars (away
from UV light), those free nitrogen and oxygen

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.190
atoms interact -- combining to form nitric
oxide between 60 and 100 kilometers above

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.880
the dusty surface [. When they do that, they
release energy, causing this nightglow!

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.930
It's basically the same idea used for glow-in-the-dark
toys or glowsticks!

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.910
Scientists are excited because it's very difficult
to map the movement of the Martian atmosphere!

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.990
Taking "pictures" of this glow can help scientists
determine what's happening down there throughout

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.220
the Mars year.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.720
They can see how air moves in different Mars
seasons, better understand the planet's cloud

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.640
formations, and thanks to ozone formation,
find water molecules.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.900
To be honest, nightglow is completely normal,
and Mars isn't the only planet that has it…

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.060
it's been seen on Venus, and a little planet
you may have heard of, Eeeahhrth?!

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.380
Just like on Mars, Earth's nightglow is caused
by chemical reactions in the upper atmosphere,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.890
between 85 and 95 kilometers up.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.070
And just like on Mars this glow is very faint;
NASA's Earth Observatory says the glow on

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.440
our planet is about a billionth as bright
as sunlight.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.490
So, it's very hard to see, but it's not invisible.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.220
A 2005 study in Astroparticle Physics found
about 564 photons per meter squared, per second,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.540
over the Mediterranean Sea.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.230
And, if you were on the International Space
Station looking sideways at the atmosphere

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.810
you can see a faint glow… that's Earth's
nightglow!

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.090
We know a bit more about our own nightglow
-- for example, just like on Mars, the solar

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.700
wind photo dissociates molecules in our upper
atmosphere, and when they recombine they release

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.610
energy as green, blue, yellow, and red light:
oxygen glows green or blue, sodium yellowish,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.910
and hydroxls, or OH molecules glow red.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.390
Science is beautiful, ain't it?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.390
Nightglow is just another byproduct of the
sun's neverending assault on our atmosphere,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.650
and the atmosphere of other planets in our
solar system.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.640
What a warm nuclear ball of awesome.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.840
Worried that the constant barrage of solar
energy is actually going to steal our atmosphere?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.120
Can we run out of oxygen!?

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.680
Check out this video with my girl Julia for
more on that.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.790
And what is your favorite science topic?

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:22.790
Space?

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.790
Environment?

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.790
Animals? Physics?!

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.790
Tell us in the comments.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.790
