00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.676
Okay, those are the formulas.
You will get all of those on

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:29.153
the test, plus a couple more
that I will give you today.

00:00:29.153 --> 00:00:33.734
Those will be the basic
formulas of the Laplace

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:37.518
transform.
If I think you need anything

00:00:37.518 --> 00:00:42.000
else, I'll give you other stuff,
too.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.221
So, I'm going to leave those on
the board all period.

00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:51.092
The basic test for today is to
see how Laplace transforms are

00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:54.907
used to solve linear
differential equations with

00:00:54.907 --> 00:00:57.992
constant coefficients.
Now, to do that,

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:02.295
we're going to have to take the
Laplace transform of a

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:06.121
derivative.
And, in order to make sense of

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:09.092
that procedure,
we're going to have to ask,

00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:12.557
I apologize in advance,
but a slightly theoretical

00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:15.882
question, namely,
we have to have some guarantee

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:19.772
in advance that the Laplace
transform is going to exist.

00:01:19.772 --> 00:01:23.308
Now, how could the Laplace
transform fail to exist?

00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:26.703
Can't I always calculate this?
And the answer is,

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:30.946
no, you can't always calculate
it because this is an improper

00:01:30.946 --> 00:01:33.705
integral.
I'm integrating all the way up

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:38.019
to infinity, and you know that
improper integrals don't always

00:01:38.019 --> 00:01:42.416
converge.
You know, if the integrand for

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:46.684
example just didn't have the
exponential factor there,

00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:50.550
were simply t dt,
that it might look like it made

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.852
sense, but that integral doesn't
converge.

00:01:53.852 --> 00:01:56.107
And, anyway,
it has no value.

00:01:56.107 --> 00:02:00.375
So, I need conditions in
advance, which guarantee that

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:04.000
the Laplace transforms will
exist.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.586
Only under those circumstances
will the formulas make any

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:09.508
sense.
Now, there is a standard

00:02:09.508 --> 00:02:13.287
condition that's in your book.
But, I didn't get a chance to

00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:16.745
talk about it last time.
So, I thought I'd better spent

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:20.204
the first few minutes today
talking about the condition

00:02:20.204 --> 00:02:23.983
because it's what we're going to
need in order to be able to

00:02:23.983 --> 00:02:27.634
solve differential equations.
The condition that makes the

00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:31.349
Laplace transform definitely
exist for a function is that f

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.000
of t shouldn't grow too
rapidly.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.458
It can grow rapidly.
It can grow because the e to

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.628
the minus s t is
pulling it down,

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:45.590
trying hard to pull it down to
zero to make the integral

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.896
converge.
All we have to do is to

00:02:47.896 --> 00:02:52.074
guarantee that it doesn't grow
so rapidly that the e to the

00:02:52.074 --> 00:02:54.812
minus s t is powerless to pull
it down.

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:58.270
Now, the condition is it's
what's called a growth

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.209
condition.
These are very important in

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.746
applications,
and unfortunately,

00:03:04.746 --> 00:03:09.411
it's always taught in 18.01,
but it's not always taught in

00:03:09.411 --> 00:03:13.340
high school calculus.
And, it's a question of how

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.286
fast the function is allowed to
grow.

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:20.132
And, the condition is
universally said this way,

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:24.879
should be of exponential type.
So, what I'm defining is the

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:29.790
phrase "exponential type." I'll
put it in quotation marks for

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.646
that reason.
What does this mean?

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.939
It's a condition,
a growth condition on a

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:40.068
function, says how fast it can
get big.

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:44.925
It says that f of t in
size, since f of t might get

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:48.383
negatively very large,
and that would hurt,

00:03:48.383 --> 00:03:52.335
make the integral hard to
converge, not likely to

00:03:52.335 --> 00:03:54.969
converge, use the absolute
value.

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.757
In other words,
I don't care if f of t is going

00:03:58.757 --> 00:04:02.708
up or going down very low.
Whichever way it goes,

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:06.907
its size should not be bigger
than a rapidly growing

00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:10.283
exponential.
And, here's a rapidly growing

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:14.702
exponential.
c is some positive constant,

00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:18.167
for some positive constant c
and some positive constant k.

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:20.841
And, this should be true for
all values of t.

00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:22.969
All t greater than or equal to
zero.

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.556
I don't have to worry about
negative values of t because the

00:04:26.556 --> 00:04:28.501
integral doesn't care about
them.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm only doing the integration
as t runs from zero to infinity.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.238
In other words,
f of t could have been

00:04:38.238 --> 00:04:44.729
an extremely wild function,
sewn a lot of oats or whatever

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.106
functions do for negative values
of t, and we don't care.

00:04:51.106 --> 00:04:57.256
It's only what's happening from
now from time zero onto

00:04:57.256 --> 00:05:01.241
infinity.
As long as it behaves now,

00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:05.000
from now on,
it's okay.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.926
All right, so,
the way it should behave is by

00:05:07.926 --> 00:05:11.518
being an exponential type.
Now, to try to give you some

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:14.445
feeling for what this means,
these functions,

00:05:14.445 --> 00:05:16.840
for example, if k is 100,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.166
do you have any idea what the
plot of e to the 100t

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:23.093
looks like?
It goes straight up.

00:05:23.093 --> 00:05:26.618
On every computer you try to
plot it on, e to the 100t

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:29.611
goes like that
unless, of course,

00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:32.671
you make the scale t equals
zero to, over here,

00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:37.168
is one millionth.
Well, even that won't do.

00:05:37.168 --> 00:05:41.853
Okay, so these functions really
can grow quite rapidly.

00:05:41.853 --> 00:05:46.710
Let's take an example and see
what's of exponential type,

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.180
and then perhaps even more
interestingly,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.824
what isn't.
The function sine t,

00:05:53.824 --> 00:05:57.207
is that of exponential type?
Well, sure.

00:05:57.207 --> 00:06:01.891
Its absolute value is always
less than or equal to one.

00:06:01.891 --> 00:06:06.489
So, it's also this paradigm.
If I take c equal to one,

00:06:06.489 --> 00:06:11.000
and what should I take k to be?
Zero.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.829
Take k to be zero,
c equals one,

00:06:13.829 --> 00:06:18.392
and in fact sine t
plays that condition.

00:06:18.392 --> 00:06:23.321
Here's one that's more
interesting, t to the n.

00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:26.880
Think of t to the 100th power.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.353
Is that smaller than some
exponential with maybe a

00:06:31.353 --> 00:06:35.733
constant out front?
Well, t to the 100th power

00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:37.866
goes straight up,
also.

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:41.600
Well, we feel that if we make
the exponential big enough,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.133
maybe it will win out.
In fact, you don't have to make

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:48.466
the exponential big.
k equals one is good

00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:49.933
enough.
In other words,

00:06:49.933 --> 00:06:53.866
I don't have to put absolute
value signs around the t to the

00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:57.399
n because I'm only
thinking about t as being a

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.000
positive number,
anyway.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.908
I say that that's less than or
equal to some constant M,

00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:10.083
positive constant M times e to
the t will be good

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:14.099
enough for some M and all t.
Now, why is that?

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:17.401
Why is that?
The way to think of that,

00:07:17.401 --> 00:07:22.577
so, what this proves is that,
therefore, t to the n

00:07:22.577 --> 00:07:27.039
is of exponential type,
which we could have guessed

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:31.858
because after all we were able
to calculate its Laplace

00:07:31.858 --> 00:07:36.199
transform.
Now, just because you can

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:41.741
calculate the Laplace transform
doesn't mean it's of exponential

00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:46.404
type, but in practical matters,
it almost always does.

00:07:46.404 --> 00:07:50.363
So, t to the n is of
exponential type.

00:07:50.363 --> 00:07:55.026
How do you prove that?
Well, the weighted secret is to

00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:59.777
look at t to the n divided by e
to the t.

00:07:59.777 --> 00:08:04.000
In other words,
look at the quotient.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.161
What I'd like to argue is that
this is bounded by some number,

00:08:11.161 --> 00:08:15.975
capital M.
That's the question I'm asking.

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:21.611
Now, why is this so?
Well, I think I can convince

00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:26.542
you of it without having to work
very hard.

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:33.000
What does the graph of this
function look like?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.587
It starts here,
so I'm graphing this function,

00:08:37.587 --> 00:08:41.156
this ratio.
When t is equal to zero,

00:08:41.156 --> 00:08:45.132
its value is zero,
right, because of the

00:08:45.132 --> 00:08:48.700
numerator.
What happens as t goes to

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.759
infinity?
What happens to this?

00:08:51.759 --> 00:08:54.511
What does it approach?
Zero.

00:08:54.511 --> 00:08:56.347
And, why?
By L'Hop.

00:08:56.347 --> 00:09:01.036
By L'Hopital's rule.
Just keep differentiating,

00:09:01.036 --> 00:09:06.746
reapply the rule over and over,
keep differentiating it n

00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:12.863
times, and finally you'll have
won the numerator down to t to

00:09:12.863 --> 00:09:17.247
the zero,
which isn't doing anything

00:09:17.247 --> 00:09:21.610
much.
And, the denominator,

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.061
no matter how many times you
differentiate it,

00:09:25.061 --> 00:09:27.745
it's still t,
to the t all the time.

00:09:27.745 --> 00:09:32.423
So, by using Lopital's rule n
times, you change the top to one

00:09:32.423 --> 00:09:36.487
or n factorial,
actually; the bottom stays e to

00:09:36.487 --> 00:09:39.171
the t,
and the ratio clearly

00:09:39.171 --> 00:09:41.472
approaches zero,
and therefore,

00:09:41.472 --> 00:09:45.000
it approached zero to start
with.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.176
So, I don't know what this
function's doing in between.

00:09:48.176 --> 00:09:51.470
It's a positive function.
It's continuous because the top

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.705
and bottom are continuous,
and the bottom is never zero.

00:09:54.705 --> 00:09:58.294
So, it's a continuous function
which starts out at zero and is

00:09:58.294 --> 00:10:01.470
positive, and as t goes to
infinity, it gets closer and

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.058
closer to the t-axis,
again.

00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:06.000
Well, what does t to the n
do?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.823
It might wave around.
It doesn't actually.

00:10:10.823 --> 00:10:15.764
But, the point is,
because it's continuous,

00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:19.058
starts at zero,
ends at zero,

00:10:19.058 --> 00:10:23.764
it's bounded.
It has a maximum somewhere.

00:10:23.764 --> 00:10:30.000
And, that maximum is M.
So, it has a maximum.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.552
All you have to know is where
it starts, and where it ends up,

00:10:34.552 --> 00:10:37.014
and the fact that it's
continuous.

00:10:37.014 --> 00:10:39.776
That guarantees that it has a
maximum.

00:10:39.776 --> 00:10:43.656
So, it is less than some
maximum, and that shows that

00:10:43.656 --> 00:10:46.641
it's of exponential type.
Now, of course,

00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:50.746
before you get the idea that
everything's of exponential

00:10:50.746 --> 00:10:54.776
type, let's see what isn't.
I'll give you two functions

00:10:54.776 --> 00:11:00.000
that are not of exponential
type, for different reasons.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.357
One over t is not of
exponential type.

00:11:03.357 --> 00:11:06.642
Well, of course,
it's not defined that t equals

00:11:06.642 --> 00:11:08.714
zero. But, you know,

00:11:08.714 --> 00:11:12.642
it's okay for an integral not
to be defined at one point

00:11:12.642 --> 00:11:16.642
because you're measuring an
area, and when you measure an

00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:20.857
area, what happened to one point
doesn't really matter much.

00:11:20.857 --> 00:11:24.571
That's not the thing.
What's wrong with one over t is

00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:28.571
that the integral doesn't
converge at zero times one over

00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:32.158
t dt.
That integral,

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:36.297
when t is near zero,
this is approximately equal to

00:11:36.297 --> 00:11:38.284
one, right?
If t is zero,

00:11:38.284 --> 00:11:41.512
this is one.
So, it's like the function,

00:11:41.512 --> 00:11:46.561
integral from zero to infinity
of one over t,

00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:50.451
near zero it's close to,

00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:54.590
it's like the integral from
zero to someplace of no

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.239
importance, dt over t.

00:11:57.239 --> 00:12:01.957
But, this does not converge.
This is like log t,

00:12:01.957 --> 00:12:08.000
and log zero is minus infinity.
So, it doesn't converge.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.619
So, one over t is not
of exponential type.

00:12:11.619 --> 00:12:14.812
So, what's the Laplace
transform of one over t?

00:12:14.812 --> 00:12:17.367
It doesn't have a Laplace

00:12:17.367 --> 00:12:20.064
transform.
Well, what if I put t equals

00:12:20.064 --> 00:12:23.683
negative n?
What about t to the minus one?

00:12:23.683 --> 00:12:26.238
Well, that only works for

00:12:26.238 --> 00:12:30.000
positive integers,
not negative integers.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.255
Okay, so it's not of
exponential type.

00:12:33.255 --> 00:12:37.742
However, that's because it
never really gets started

00:12:37.742 --> 00:12:40.821
properly.
It's more fun to look at a

00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:45.309
function which is not of
exponential type because it

00:12:45.309 --> 00:12:49.004
grows too fast.
Now, what's a function that

00:12:49.004 --> 00:12:54.283
grows faster that it grows so
rapidly that you can't find any

00:12:54.283 --> 00:12:58.506
function e to the k t
which bounds it?

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:03.345
A function which grows too
rapidly, a simple one is e to

00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:07.920
the t squared,
grows too rapidly to be of

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:13.576
exponential type.
And, the argument is simple.

00:13:13.576 --> 00:13:17.163
No matter what you propose,
it's always,

00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:22.683
for the K, no matter how big a
number, use Avogadro's number,

00:13:22.683 --> 00:13:27.559
use anything you want.
Ultimately, this is going to be

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:32.895
bigger than k t no matter how
big k is, no matter how big k

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:36.139
is.
When is this going to happen?

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:40.641
This will happen if t squared
is bigger than k t.

00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:43.740
In other words,
as soon as t becomes bigger

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.798
than k, you might have to wait
quite a while for that to

00:13:47.798 --> 00:13:52.300
happen, but, as soon as t gets
bigger than 10 to the 10 to the

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.916
23,
this e to the t squared will be

00:13:55.916 --> 00:14:00.491
bigger than e to the 10 to the
10 to the 23 times t.

00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:04.327
So, e to the t squared,

00:14:04.327 --> 00:14:07.646
it's a simple
function, a simple elementary

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:10.000
function.
It grows so rapidly it doesn't

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.198
have a Laplace transform.
Okay, so how are we going to

00:14:13.198 --> 00:14:16.939
solve differential equations if
e to the t squared?

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:19.896
I won't give you any.
And, the reason I won't give

00:14:19.896 --> 00:14:22.974
you any: because I never saw one
occur in real life.

00:14:22.974 --> 00:14:25.448
Nature, like sines,
cosines, exponentials,

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:28.224
are fine, I've never seen a
physical, you know,

00:14:28.224 --> 00:14:31.663
this is just my ignorance.
But, I've never seen a physical

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:35.525
problem that involved a function
growing as rapidly as e to the t

00:14:35.525 --> 00:14:40.377
squared.
That may be just my ignorance.

00:14:40.377 --> 00:14:44.972
But, I do know the Laplace
transform won't be used to solve

00:14:44.972 --> 00:14:48.775
differential equations involving
such a function.

00:14:48.775 --> 00:14:52.500
How about e to the minus t
squared?

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.827
That's different.
It looks almost the same,

00:14:55.827 --> 00:14:58.838
but e to the minus t squared
does this.

00:14:58.838 --> 00:15:02.008
It's very well-behaved.
That's the curve,

00:15:02.008 --> 00:15:04.860
of course, that you're all
afraid of.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.478
Don't panic.
Okay.

00:15:07.478 --> 00:15:13.314
So, I'd like to explain to you
now how differential equations,

00:15:13.314 --> 00:15:17.141
maybe I should save-- I'll tell
you what.

00:15:17.141 --> 00:15:20.969
We need more formulas.
So, I'll put them,

00:15:20.969 --> 00:15:24.796
why don't I save this board,
and instead,

00:15:24.796 --> 00:15:30.632
I'll describe to you the basic
way Laplace transforms are used

00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:35.703
to solve differential equations,
what are they called,

00:15:35.703 --> 00:15:39.643
a paradigm.
I'll show you the paradigm,

00:15:39.643 --> 00:15:43.050
and then we'll fill in the
holes so you have some overall

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.519
view of how the procedure goes,
and then you'll understand

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.709
where the various pieces fit
into it.

00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:51.387
I think you'll understand it
better that way.

00:15:51.387 --> 00:15:54.125
So, what do we do?
Start with the differential

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:55.647
equation.
But, right away,

00:15:55.647 --> 00:15:58.567
there's a fundamental
difference between what the

00:15:58.567 --> 00:16:01.671
Laplace transform does,
and what we've been doing up

00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:04.592
until now, namely,
what you have to start with is

00:16:04.592 --> 00:16:08.000
not merely the differential
equation.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.139
Let's say we have linear with
constant coefficients.

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:16.765
It's almost never used to solve
any other type of problem.

00:16:16.765 --> 00:16:20.823
And, let's take second order so
I don't have to do,

00:16:20.823 --> 00:16:25.368
because that's the kind we've
been working with all term.

00:16:25.368 --> 00:16:28.371
But, it's allowed to be
inhomogeneous,

00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:32.428
so, f of t.
Let's call the something else,

00:16:32.428 --> 00:16:36.000
another letter,
h of t.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.751
I'll want f of t for
the function I'm taking the

00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:42.162
Laplace transform of.
All right, now,

00:16:42.162 --> 00:16:45.913
the difference is that up to
now, you know techniques for

00:16:45.913 --> 00:16:50.000
solving this just as it stands.
The Laplace transform does not

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.813
know how to solve this just
doesn't stands.

00:16:52.813 --> 00:16:56.564
The Laplace transform must have
an initial value problem.

00:16:56.564 --> 00:16:59.177
In other words,
you must supply from the

00:16:59.177 --> 00:17:04.000
beginning the initial conditions
that the y is to satisfy.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.537
Now, I don't want to say any
specific numbers,

00:17:06.537 --> 00:17:08.963
so I'll use generic numbers.
Well, but look,

00:17:08.963 --> 00:17:12.177
what do we do if we get a
problem and there are no initial

00:17:12.177 --> 00:17:15.618
conditions; does that mean we
can't use the Laplace transform?

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:18.720
No, of course you can use it.
But, you will just have to

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.427
assume the initial conditions
are on the numbers.

00:17:21.427 --> 00:17:24.811
You'll say it but the initial
conditions be y sub zero

00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:26.954
and y zero prime,
or whatever,

00:17:26.954 --> 00:17:30.000
a and b, whatever you want to
call it.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.030
And now, the answer,
then, will involve the a and

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.732
the b or the y zero and the y
zero prime.

00:17:38.732 --> 00:17:42.343
But, you must,
at least, give lip service to

00:17:42.343 --> 00:17:46.709
the initial conditions,
whereas before we didn't have

00:17:46.709 --> 00:17:50.236
to do that.
Now, depending on your point of

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:54.099
view, that's a grave defect,
or it is, so what?

00:17:54.099 --> 00:17:57.206
Let's adopt the so what point
of view.

00:17:57.206 --> 00:18:03.000
So, there's our problem.
It's an initial value problem.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.590
How is it solved by the Laplace
transform?

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.064
Well, the idea is you take the
Laplace transform of this

00:18:09.064 --> 00:18:12.097
differential equation and the
initial conditions.

00:18:12.097 --> 00:18:15.003
So, I'm going to explain to you
how to do that.

00:18:15.003 --> 00:18:17.657
Not right now,
because we're going to need,

00:18:17.657 --> 00:18:20.436
first, the Laplace transform of
a derivative,

00:18:20.436 --> 00:18:23.279
the formula for that.
You don't know that yet.

00:18:23.279 --> 00:18:26.564
But when you do know it,
you will be able to take the

00:18:26.564 --> 00:18:29.471
Laplace transform of the initial
value problem.

00:18:29.471 --> 00:18:32.819
So, I'll put the little l here,
and what comes out is,

00:18:32.819 --> 00:18:36.104
well, y of t is the
solution to the original

00:18:36.104 --> 00:18:39.867
problem.
If y of t is the

00:18:39.867 --> 00:18:43.975
function which satisfies that
equation and these initial

00:18:43.975 --> 00:18:48.082
conditions, its Laplace
transform, let's call it capital

00:18:48.082 --> 00:18:52.639
Y, that's our standard notation,
but it's going to be of a new

00:18:52.639 --> 00:18:55.551
variable, s.
So, when I take the Laplace

00:18:55.551 --> 00:18:59.585
transform of the differential
equation with the initial

00:18:59.585 --> 00:19:04.215
conditions, what comes out is an
algebraic-- the emphasis is on

00:19:04.215 --> 00:19:08.248
algebraic: no derivatives,
no transcendental functions,

00:19:08.248 --> 00:19:11.236
nothing like that,
an algebraic equation,

00:19:11.236 --> 00:19:14.000
m Y of s.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.371
And, now what?
Well, now, in the domain of s,

00:19:25.371 --> 00:19:28.589
it's easy to solve this
algebraic equation.

00:19:28.589 --> 00:19:33.416
Not all algebraic equations are
easy to solve for the capital Y.

00:19:33.416 --> 00:19:37.860
But, the ones you will get will
always be, not because I am

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:42.074
making life easy for you,
but that's the way the Laplace

00:19:42.074 --> 00:19:45.445
transform works.
So, you will solve it for Y.

00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:49.353
And, the answer will always
come out to be Y equals,

00:19:49.353 --> 00:19:52.801
Y of s equals some
rational function,

00:19:52.801 --> 00:19:57.552
some quotient of polynomials in
s, a polynomial in s divided by

00:19:57.552 --> 00:20:01.000
some other polynomial in s.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.501
And, now what?
Well, this is the Laplace

00:20:12.501 --> 00:20:17.260
transform of the answer.
This is the Laplace transform

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:20.312
of the solution we are looking
for.

00:20:20.312 --> 00:20:25.520
So, the final step is to go
backwards by taking the inverse

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.278
Laplace transform of this guy.
And, what will you get?

00:20:30.278 --> 00:20:35.845
Well, you will get y equals the
y of t that we are

00:20:35.845 --> 00:20:39.992
looking for.
It's really a wildly improbable

00:20:39.992 --> 00:20:41.599
procedure.
In other words,

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:45.071
instead of going from here to
here, you have to imagine

00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:48.607
there's a mountain here.
And, the only way to get around

00:20:48.607 --> 00:20:51.821
it is to go, first,
here, and then cross the stream

00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:54.457
here, and then go back up,
and go back up.

00:20:54.457 --> 00:20:58.121
It looks like a senseless
procedure, what do they call it,

00:20:58.121 --> 00:21:01.849
going around Robin Hood's barn,
it was called when I was a,

00:21:01.849 --> 00:21:05.000
I don't know why it's called
that.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.901
But that's what we used to call
it; not Laplace transform.

00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:14.802
That was just a generic thing
when you had to do something

00:21:14.802 --> 00:21:18.070
like this.
But, the answer is that it's

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:23.143
hard to go from here to here,
but trivial to go from here to

00:21:23.143 --> 00:21:25.722
here.
This solution step is the

00:21:25.722 --> 00:21:29.334
easiest step of all.
This is not very hard.

00:21:29.334 --> 00:21:33.413
It's easy, in fact.
This is easy and

00:21:33.413 --> 00:21:36.239
straightforward.
This is trivial,

00:21:36.239 --> 00:21:38.536
essentially,
yeah, trivial.

00:21:38.536 --> 00:21:41.274
But, this step is the hard
step.

00:21:41.274 --> 00:21:45.425
This is where you have to use
partial fractions,

00:21:45.425 --> 00:21:50.725
look up things in the table to
get back there so that most of

00:21:50.725 --> 00:21:55.583
the work of the procedure isn't
going from here to here.

00:21:55.583 --> 00:22:00.000
Going from here to there is a
breeze.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.312
Okay, now, in order to
implement this,

00:22:02.312 --> 00:22:05.812
what is it we have to do?
Well, the basic thing is I have

00:22:05.812 --> 00:22:08.625
to explain to you,
you already know at least a

00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:12.312
little bit, a reasonable amount
of technique for taking that

00:22:12.312 --> 00:22:16.187
step if you went to recitation
yesterday and practiced a little

00:22:16.187 --> 00:22:17.937
bit.
This part, I assure you,

00:22:17.937 --> 00:22:20.312
is nothing.
So, all I have to do now is

00:22:20.312 --> 00:22:23.687
explain to you how to take the
Laplace transform of the

00:22:23.687 --> 00:22:26.500
differential equation.
And, that really means,

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:31.000
how do you take the Laplace
transform of a derivative?

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.387
So, that's our problem.
What I want to form,

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:39.775
in other words,
is a formula for the Laplace

00:22:39.775 --> 00:22:43.346
transform f prime of t.

00:22:43.346 --> 00:22:48.551
Now, in terms of what?
Well, since f is an arbitrary

00:22:48.551 --> 00:22:54.877
function, the only thing I could
hope for is somehow to express

00:22:54.877 --> 00:23:00.387
the Laplace transform of the
derivative in terms of the

00:23:00.387 --> 00:23:06.000
Laplace transform of the
original function.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.046
So, that's what I'm aiming for.
Okay, where are we going to

00:23:10.046 --> 00:23:12.558
start?
Well, starting is easy because

00:23:12.558 --> 00:23:15.558
we know nothing.
If you don't know anything,

00:23:15.558 --> 00:23:18.976
then there's no place to start
but the definition.

00:23:18.976 --> 00:23:22.744
Since I know nothing whatever
about the function f of t,

00:23:22.744 --> 00:23:26.581
and I want to
calculate the Laplace transform,

00:23:26.581 --> 00:23:30.000
I'd better start with the
definition.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.078
Whatever this is,
it's the integral from zero to

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:37.139
infinity of e to the minus s t
times f prime of t dt.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.362
Now, what am I looking for?
I'm looking for somehow to

00:23:43.362 --> 00:23:47.227
transform this so that what
appears here is not 

00:23:47.227 --> 00:23:50.829
f prime of t, which I'm 
clueless about, but f of t

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:54.497
because if this were f of t,
this expression would be the

00:23:54.497 --> 00:23:56.986
Laplace transform of f of t.

00:23:56.986 --> 00:24:02.105
And, I'm assuming I know that.
So, the question is how do I

00:24:02.105 --> 00:24:05.939
take this and somehow do
something clever to it that

00:24:05.939 --> 00:24:10.000
turns this into f of t
instead of f prime of t?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.082
Now, to first the question that

00:24:13.082 --> 00:24:16.917
way, I hope I would get 100%
response on what to do.

00:24:16.917 --> 00:24:20.000
But, I'll go for 1%.
So, what should I do?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.984
I want to change that, so that
instead of f prime of t,

00:24:23.984 --> 00:24:27.593
f of t
appears there instead.

00:24:27.593 --> 00:24:31.564
What should I do?
Integrate by parts,

00:24:31.564 --> 00:24:35.762
the most fundamental procedure
in advanced analysis.

00:24:35.762 --> 00:24:39.549
Everything important and
interesting depends on

00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:43.501
integration by parts.
And, when you consider that

00:24:43.501 --> 00:24:48.523
integration by parts is nothing
more than just the formula for

00:24:48.523 --> 00:24:53.133
the derivative of a product read
backwards, it's amazing.

00:24:53.133 --> 00:24:56.508
It never fails to amaze me,
but it's okay.

00:24:56.508 --> 00:24:59.472
That's what mathematics are so
great.

00:24:59.472 --> 00:25:04.000
Okay, so let's use integration
by parts.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.852
Integration by parts:
okay, so, we have to decide,

00:25:06.852 --> 00:25:10.228
of course, there's no doubt
that this is the factor we want

00:25:10.228 --> 00:25:12.440
to integrate,
which means we have to be

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.536
willing to differentiate this
factor.

00:25:14.536 --> 00:25:17.446
But that will be okay because
it looks practically,

00:25:17.446 --> 00:25:20.357
like any exponential,
it looks practically the same

00:25:20.357 --> 00:25:23.442
after you've differentiated it.
So, let's do the work.

00:25:23.442 --> 00:25:26.120
First step is you don't do the
differentiation.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.496
You only do the integration.
So, the first step is e to the

00:25:29.496 --> 00:25:34.152
negative s t.
And, the integral of f prime of

00:25:34.152 --> 00:25:36.583
t is just f of t.

00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:40.333
And, that's to be evaluated
between the limits zero and

00:25:40.333 --> 00:25:42.069
infinity.
And then, minus,

00:25:42.069 --> 00:25:45.750
again, before you forget it,
put down that minus sign.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.916
The integral between the limits
of what you get by doing both

00:25:49.916 --> 00:25:52.902
operations, both the
differentiation and the

00:25:52.902 --> 00:25:55.888
integration.
So, the differentiation will be

00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:59.569
by using the chain rule.
Remember, I'm differentiating

00:25:59.569 --> 00:26:03.876
with respect to t.
The variable is t here,

00:26:03.876 --> 00:26:06.160
not s.
s is just a parameter.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.505
It's just a constant,
a variable constant,

00:26:09.505 --> 00:26:13.176
if you get my meaning.
That's not an oxymoron.

00:26:13.176 --> 00:26:16.847
A variable constant:
a parameter is a variable

00:26:16.847 --> 00:26:21.905
constant, variable because you
can manipulate the little slider

00:26:21.905 --> 00:26:24.678
and make a change its value,
right?

00:26:24.678 --> 00:26:28.349
That's why it's variable.
It's not a variable.

00:26:28.349 --> 00:26:33.000
It's variable,
if you get the distinction.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.902
Okay, well, I mean,
it becomes a variable

00:26:35.902 --> 00:26:37.716
[LAUGHTER].
But right now,

00:26:37.716 --> 00:26:41.344
it's not a variable.
It's just sitting there in the

00:26:41.344 --> 00:26:43.013
integral.
All right, so,

00:26:43.013 --> 00:26:47.222
minus s, e to the negative s t,
f of t dt.

00:26:47.222 --> 00:26:49.181
Now, this part's easy.

00:26:49.181 --> 00:26:52.083
The interesting thing is this
expression.

00:26:52.083 --> 00:26:56.292
So, and the most interesting
thing is I have to evaluate it

00:26:56.292 --> 00:26:58.251
at infinity.
Now, of course,

00:26:58.251 --> 00:27:01.371
that means take the limit as
you go towards,

00:27:01.371 --> 00:27:07.058
as you let t goes to infinity.
Now, so what I'm interested in

00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:10.213
knowing is what's the limit of
that expression?

00:27:10.213 --> 00:27:13.986
I'll write it as f of t divided
by e to the s t.

00:27:13.986 --> 00:27:16.319
Remember, s is a positive

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:18.240
number.
s t goes to infinity,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.258
and I want to know what the
limit of that is.

00:27:21.258 --> 00:27:25.443
Well, the limit is what it is.
But really, if that limit isn't

00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:29.422
zero, I'm in deep trouble since
the whole process is out of

00:27:29.422 --> 00:27:33.376
control.
What will make that limit zero?

00:27:33.376 --> 00:27:37.823
Well, that f of t
should not grow faster than e to

00:27:37.823 --> 00:27:41.349
the s t if s is a big
enough number.

00:27:41.349 --> 00:27:45.336
And now, that's just what will
happen if f of t is of

00:27:45.336 --> 00:27:48.863
exponential type.
It's for this step right here

00:27:48.863 --> 00:27:53.539
that is the most crucial place
at which we need to know that f

00:27:53.539 --> 00:27:57.986
of t is of exponential type.
So, that limit is zero since f

00:27:57.986 --> 00:28:01.283
of t is of exponential type,
in other words,

00:28:01.283 --> 00:28:04.579
that the value,
the absolute value of f of t,

00:28:04.579 --> 00:28:09.180
becomes less than,
let's say, put in the c if you

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:13.166
want, but it's not very
important, c e to the k t

00:28:13.166 --> 00:28:18.029
efor all values of t.
And, therefore,

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:22.350
this will go to zero as soon as
s becomes bigger than that k.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:23.791
In other words,

00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:27.633
if f of t isn't
growing any faster than e to the

00:28:27.633 --> 00:28:30.720
k t ,
then as soon as s is a number,

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.601
that parameter has the value
bigger than k,

00:28:33.601 --> 00:28:37.443
this ratio is going to go to
zero because the denominator

00:28:37.443 --> 00:28:41.490
will always be bigger than the
numerator, and getting bigger

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:45.393
faster.
So, this goes to zero if s is

00:28:45.393 --> 00:28:48.941
bigger than k.
At the upper limit,

00:28:48.941 --> 00:28:52.985
therefore, this is zero.
Again, assuming that s is

00:28:52.985 --> 00:28:57.029
bigger than that k,
the k of the exponential type,

00:28:57.029 --> 00:29:01.959
how about at the lower limit?
We're used to seeing zero

00:29:01.959 --> 00:29:04.937
there, but we're not going to
get zero.

00:29:04.937 --> 00:29:09.718
If I plug in t equals zero,
this factor becomes one.

00:29:09.718 --> 00:29:13.559
And, what happens to that one?
f of zero.

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:18.340
You mean, I'm going to have to
know what f of zero is before I

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:22.181
can take the Laplace transform
of this derivative?

00:29:22.181 --> 00:29:26.021
The answer is yes,
and that's why you have to have

00:29:26.021 --> 00:29:30.806
an initial value problem.
You have to know in advance

00:29:30.806 --> 00:29:34.822
what the value of the function
that you are looking for is at

00:29:34.822 --> 00:29:37.432
zero because it enters into the
formula.

00:29:37.432 --> 00:29:40.978
I didn't make up these rules;
I'm just following them.

00:29:40.978 --> 00:29:43.990
So, what's the rest?
The two negatives cancel,

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.202
and you get plus s.
It's just a parameter,

00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:49.611
so I can pull it out of the
integral.

00:29:49.611 --> 00:29:53.158
I'm integrating with respect to
t, and what's left is,

00:29:53.158 --> 00:29:56.370
well, what is left?
If I take out minus s,

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.449
combine it there,
I get what's left is just the

00:29:59.449 --> 00:30:04.000
Laplace transform of the
function I started with.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.303
So, it's F of s.
And, that's the magic formula

00:30:10.303 --> 00:30:15.322
for the Laplace transform of the
derivative.

00:30:15.322 --> 00:30:20.459
So, it's worth putting up on
our little list.

00:30:20.459 --> 00:30:26.879
So, f prime of t,
assuming it's of exponential

00:30:26.879 --> 00:30:31.548
type, has as its Laplace
transform, well,

00:30:31.548 --> 00:30:35.960
what is it?
Let's put down the major part

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:39.543
of it is s times whatever the
Laplace transform of the

00:30:39.543 --> 00:30:41.841
original function,
F of t,

00:30:41.841 --> 00:30:44.207
was.
So, I take the original Laplace

00:30:44.207 --> 00:30:46.505
transform.
When I multiply it by s,

00:30:46.505 --> 00:30:49.277
that corresponds to taking the
derivative.

00:30:49.277 --> 00:30:51.981
But there's also that little
extra piece.

00:30:51.981 --> 00:30:55.969
I must know the value of the
starting value of the function.

00:30:55.969 --> 00:31:00.093
This is the formula you'll used
to take a Laplace transform of

00:31:00.093 --> 00:31:05.025
the differential equation.
Now, but you see I'm not done

00:31:05.025 --> 00:31:09.357
yet because that will take care
of the term a y prime.

00:31:09.357 --> 00:31:13.339
But, I don't know what the
Laplace transform of the second

00:31:13.339 --> 00:31:16.483
derivative is.
Okay, so, we need a formula for

00:31:16.483 --> 00:31:20.534
the Laplace transform of a
second derivative as well as the

00:31:20.534 --> 00:31:23.119
first.
Now, the hack method is to say,

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:25.984
secondary, all right.
I've got to do this.

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:29.546
I'll second derivative here,
second derivative here,

00:31:29.546 --> 00:31:33.039
what do I do with that?
Ah-ha, I integrate by parts

00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.926
twice.
Yes, you can do that.

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:40.205
But that's a hack method.
And, of course,

00:31:40.205 --> 00:31:45.205
I know you're too smart to do
that.

00:31:45.205 --> 00:31:53.882
What you would do instead is--
How are we going to fill that

00:31:53.882 --> 00:31:58.441
in?
Well, a second derivative is

00:31:58.441 --> 00:32:07.572
also a first derivative.
A second derivative is the

00:32:07.572 --> 00:32:14.608
first derivative of the first
derivative.

00:32:14.608 --> 00:32:22.874
Okay, now, we'll just call this
glop, something.

00:32:22.874 --> 00:32:31.140
So, it's glop prime.
What is the formula for the

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:39.391
Laplace transform of glop prime?
It is, well,

00:32:39.391 --> 00:32:43.913
I have my formula.
It is the glop prime.

00:32:43.913 --> 00:32:50.753
The formula for it is s times
the Laplace transform of glop,

00:32:50.753 --> 00:32:55.043
okay, glop.
Well, glop is f prime of t.

00:32:55.043 --> 00:32:58.173
I'm not done yet,

00:32:58.173 --> 00:33:05.014
minus glop evaluated at zero.
What's glop evaluated at zero?

00:33:05.014 --> 00:33:10.000
Well, f prime of zero.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.009
Now, I don't want the formula
in that form,

00:33:13.009 --> 00:33:17.093
but I have to have it in that
form because I know what the

00:33:17.093 --> 00:33:20.389
Laplace transform of f prime of
t is.

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:24.043
I just calculated that.
So, this is equal to s times

00:33:24.043 --> 00:33:28.485
the Laplace transform of f prime
of t, which is s times F of s,

00:33:28.485 --> 00:33:31.566
capital F of s,
minus f of zero.

00:33:31.566 --> 00:33:34.761
All that bracket stuff

00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:38.846
corresponds to this guy.
And, don't forget the stuff

00:33:38.846 --> 00:33:42.209
that's tagging along,
minus f prime of zero.

00:33:42.209 --> 00:33:45.573
And now, put that all together.

00:33:45.573 --> 00:33:49.577
What is it going to be?
Well, there's the principal

00:33:49.577 --> 00:33:54.222
term which consists of s squared
multiplied by F of s.

00:33:54.222 --> 00:33:56.945
That's the main part of it.

00:33:56.945 --> 00:34:00.549
And, the rest is the sort of
fellow travelers.

00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:04.313
So, we have minus s times f of
zero,

00:34:04.313 --> 00:34:10.000
little term tagging along.
This is a constant times s.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.273
And then, we've got another
one, still another constant.

00:34:14.273 --> 00:34:18.391
So, what we have is to
calculate the Laplace transform

00:34:18.391 --> 00:34:22.587
of the second derivative,
I need to know both f of zero

00:34:22.587 --> 00:34:27.094
and f prime of zero,
exactly the initial

00:34:27.094 --> 00:34:31.601
conditions that the problem was
given for the initial value

00:34:31.601 --> 00:34:33.739
problem.
But, notice,

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:37.315
there's a principal part of it.
That's the s squared F of s.

00:34:37.315 --> 00:34:39.472
That's the guts of it,

00:34:39.472 --> 00:34:41.136
so to speak.
The rest of it,

00:34:41.136 --> 00:34:44.589
you know, you might hope that
these two numbers are zero.

00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:47.424
It could happen,
and often it is made to happen

00:34:47.424 --> 00:34:51.061
and problems to simplify them.
And I case, you don't have to

00:34:51.061 --> 00:34:54.020
worry; they're not there.
But, if they are there,

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.979
you must put them in or you get
the wrong answer.

00:34:56.979 --> 00:35:00.000
So, that's the list of
formulas.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.754
So, those formulas on the top
board and these two extra ones,

00:35:06.754 --> 00:35:12.947
those are the things you will
be working with on Friday.

00:35:12.947 --> 00:35:17.788
But I stress,
the Laplace transform won't be

00:35:17.788 --> 00:35:22.629
a big part of the exam.
The exam, of course,

00:35:22.629 --> 00:35:27.245
doesn't exist,
let's say a maximum of 20%,

00:35:27.245 --> 00:35:29.721
maybe 15.
I don't know,

00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:37.126
give or take a few points.
Yeah, what's a point or two?

00:35:37.126 --> 00:35:41.258
Okay, let's solve,
yeah, we have time.

00:35:41.258 --> 00:35:44.720
We have time to solve a
problem.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:49.857
Let's solve a problem.
See, I can't touch that.

00:35:49.857 --> 00:35:56.000
It's untouchable.
Okay, this, we've got to keep.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Problem? Okay.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.719
Okay, now you know how to solve
this problem by operators.

00:36:43.719 --> 00:36:47.777
Let me just briefly remind you
of the basic steps.

00:36:47.777 --> 00:36:50.509
You have to do two separate
tasks.

00:36:50.509 --> 00:36:54.484
You have to first solve the
homogeneous equation,

00:36:54.484 --> 00:36:58.375
putting a zero there.
That's the first thing you

00:36:58.375 --> 00:37:00.528
learned to do.
That's easy.

00:37:00.528 --> 00:37:05.000
You could almost do that in
your head now.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.427
You get the characteristic
polynomial, get its roots,

00:37:08.427 --> 00:37:11.920
get the two functions,
e to the t and e to the

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.952
negative t,
which are the solutions.

00:37:14.952 --> 00:37:18.115
You make up c1 times one,
and c2 times the other.

00:37:18.115 --> 00:37:21.279
That's the complementary
function that solves the

00:37:21.279 --> 00:37:24.377
homogeneous problem.
And then you have to find a

00:37:24.377 --> 00:37:27.606
particular solution.
Can you see what would happen

00:37:27.606 --> 00:37:30.375
if you try to find the
particular solution?

00:37:30.375 --> 00:37:34.000
The number here is negative
one, right?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.639
Negative one is a root of the
characteristic polynomial,

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:40.220
so you've got to use that extra
formula.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.735
It's okay.
That's why I gave it to you.

00:37:42.735 --> 00:37:46.375
You've used the exponential
input theorem with the extra

00:37:46.375 --> 00:37:48.360
formula.
Then, you will get the

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.602
particular solution.
And now, you have to make the

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:54.580
general solution.
The particular solution plus

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:58.419
the complementary function,
and now you are ready to put in

00:37:58.419 --> 00:38:02.130
the initial conditions.
At the very end,

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.097
when you've got the whole
general solution,

00:38:05.097 --> 00:38:07.993
now you put in,
not before, you put in the

00:38:07.993 --> 00:38:11.101
initial conditions.
You have to calculate the

00:38:11.101 --> 00:38:14.209
derivative of that thing and
substitute this.

00:38:14.209 --> 00:38:17.247
You take it as it stands to
substitute this.

00:38:17.247 --> 00:38:21.061
You get a pair of simultaneous
equations for c1 and c2.

00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:22.615
You solve them:
answer.

00:38:22.615 --> 00:38:26.289
It's a rather elaborate
procedure, which has at least

00:38:26.289 --> 00:38:29.256
three or four separate steps,
all of which,

00:38:29.256 --> 00:38:33.000
of course, must be done
correctly.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.075
Now, the Laplace transform,
instead, feeds the entire

00:38:37.075 --> 00:38:40.367
problem into the Laplace
transform machine.

00:38:40.367 --> 00:38:44.835
You follow that little blue
pattern, and you come out with

00:38:44.835 --> 00:38:47.578
the answer.
So, let's do the Laplace

00:38:47.578 --> 00:38:51.027
transform way.
Okay, so, the first step is to

00:38:51.027 --> 00:38:55.024
say, if here's my unknown
function, y of t,

00:38:55.024 --> 00:38:58.394
it obeys this law,
and here are its starting

00:38:58.394 --> 00:39:03.902
values, a bit of its derivative.
What I'm going to take is the

00:39:03.902 --> 00:39:06.133
Laplace transform of this
equation.

00:39:06.133 --> 00:39:09.151
In other words,
I'll take the Laplace transform

00:39:09.151 --> 00:39:11.251
of this side,
and this side also.

00:39:11.251 --> 00:39:15.056
And, they must be equal because
if they were equal to start

00:39:15.056 --> 00:39:18.337
with, the Laplace transforms
also have to be equal.

00:39:18.337 --> 00:39:22.142
Okay, so let's take the Laplace
transform of this equation.

00:39:22.142 --> 00:39:25.357
Okay, first ID the Laplace
transform of the second

00:39:25.357 --> 00:39:27.719
derivative.
Okay, that's going to be,

00:39:27.719 --> 00:39:31.000
don't forget the principal
terms.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.111
There is some people who get so
hypnotized by this.

00:39:34.111 --> 00:39:36.351
I just know I'm going to forget
this.

00:39:36.351 --> 00:39:38.778
So, they read it.
Then they forget this.

00:39:38.778 --> 00:39:41.766
But that's everything.
That's the important part.

00:39:41.766 --> 00:39:44.566
Okay, so it's s times,
I'm calling the Laplace

00:39:44.566 --> 00:39:48.051
transform not capital F but
capital Y because my original

00:39:48.051 --> 00:39:51.723
function is called little y.
So, it's s squared Y.

00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:54.896
It's Y of s,
but I'm not going to put that,

00:39:54.896 --> 00:39:58.133
the of s in because it just
makes the thing look more

00:39:58.133 --> 00:40:02.167
complicated.
And now, before you forget,

00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:06.824
you have to put in the rest.
So, minus s times the value at

00:40:06.824 --> 00:40:10.116
zero, which is one,
minus the value of the

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:12.364
derivative.
But, that's zero.

00:40:12.364 --> 00:40:15.094
So, this is not too hard a
problem.

00:40:15.094 --> 00:40:19.992
So, minus s minus zero,
so I don't have to put that

00:40:19.992 --> 00:40:22.401
in.
So, all this is the Laplace

00:40:22.401 --> 00:40:25.291
transform of y double prime.

00:40:25.291 --> 00:40:29.386
And now, minus the Laplace
transform of y,

00:40:29.386 --> 00:40:35.268
well, that's just capital Y.
What's that equal to?

00:40:35.268 --> 00:40:40.019
The Laplace transform of the
right-hand side.

00:40:40.019 --> 00:40:45.527
Okay, look up the formula.
It is e to the negative t,

00:40:45.527 --> 00:40:51.791
a is minus one,
so, it's one over s minus minus

00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:57.623
one;
so, it is s plus one.

00:40:57.623 --> 00:41:02.232
This is that.
Okay, the next thing we have to

00:41:02.232 --> 00:41:05.473
do is solve for Y.
That doesn't look too hard.

00:41:05.473 --> 00:41:08.641
Solve it for y.
Okay, the best thing to do is

00:41:08.641 --> 00:41:11.810
put s squared,
group all the Y terms together

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:14.979
unless you're really quite a
good calculator.

00:41:14.979 --> 00:41:17.500
Maybe make one extra line out
of it.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.388
Yeah, definitely do this.
And then, the extra garbage I

00:41:21.388 --> 00:41:25.061
refer to as the garbage,
this stuff, and this stuff,

00:41:25.061 --> 00:41:28.662
the stuff, the linear
polynomials which are tagging

00:41:28.662 --> 00:41:32.911
along move to the right-hand
side because they don't involve

00:41:32.911 --> 00:41:37.298
capital Y.
So, this we will move to the

00:41:37.298 --> 00:41:40.501
other side.
And so, that's equal to (one

00:41:40.501 --> 00:41:44.195
over (s plus one)) plus s.

00:41:44.195 --> 00:41:48.218
Now, you have a basic choice.
About half the time,

00:41:48.218 --> 00:41:51.421
it's a good idea to combine
these terms.

00:41:51.421 --> 00:41:56.183
The other half of the time,
it's not a good idea to combine

00:41:56.183 --> 00:41:59.549
those terms.
So, how do we know whether to

00:41:59.549 --> 00:42:03.818
do it or not to do it?
Experience, which you will get

00:42:03.818 --> 00:42:06.282
by solving many,
many problems.

00:42:06.282 --> 00:42:11.044
Okay, I'm going to combine them
because I think it's a good

00:42:11.044 --> 00:42:15.608
thing to do here.
So, what is that?

00:42:15.608 --> 00:42:20.148
That's s squared plus s plus
one.

00:42:20.148 --> 00:42:25.445
So, it's s squared plus s plus
one divided by s plus one,

00:42:25.445 --> 00:42:28.756
okay?
I'm still not done because now

00:42:28.756 --> 00:42:31.121
we have to know,
what's Y?

00:42:31.121 --> 00:42:35.000
All right, now we have to
think.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.101
What we're going to do is get Y
in this form.

00:42:38.101 --> 00:42:42.402
But, I want it in the form in
which it's most suited for using

00:42:42.402 --> 00:42:44.728
partial fractions.
In other words,

00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:48.605
I want the denominator as
factored as I possibly can be.

00:42:48.605 --> 00:42:52.624
Okay, well, the numerator is
going to be just what it was.

00:42:52.624 --> 00:42:55.020
How should I write the
denominator?

00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:59.180
Well, the denominator is going
to have the factor s plus one

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:04.462
in it from here.
But after I divide through,

00:43:04.462 --> 00:43:09.568
the other factor will be s
squared minus one,

00:43:09.568 --> 00:43:12.759
right?
But, s squared minus one is s

00:43:12.759 --> 00:43:17.775
minus one times s plus one.

00:43:17.775 --> 00:43:23.246
So, I have to divide this by s
squared minus one.

00:43:23.246 --> 00:43:27.896
Factored, it's this.
So, the end result is there are

00:43:27.896 --> 00:43:32.000
two of these and one of the
other.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.886
And now, it's ready to be used.
It's better to be a partial

00:43:36.886 --> 00:43:40.172
fraction.
So, the final step is to use a

00:43:40.172 --> 00:43:44.807
partial fraction's decomposition
on this so that you can

00:43:44.807 --> 00:43:48.093
calculate its inverse Laplace
transform.

00:43:48.093 --> 00:43:51.968
So, let's do that.
Okay, (s squared plus s plus

00:43:51.968 --> 00:43:56.687
one) divided by that thing,
(s plus one) squared times (s

00:43:56.687 --> 00:44:01.995
minus one) equals s plus

00:44:01.995 --> 00:44:07.303
one squared plus s
plus one plus s minus one.

00:44:07.303 --> 00:44:12.253
In the top will be constants,

00:44:12.253 --> 00:44:15.516
just constants.
Let's do it this way first,

00:44:15.516 --> 00:44:18.935
and I'll say at the very end,
something else.

00:44:18.935 --> 00:44:21.422
Maybe now.
Many of you are upset.

00:44:21.422 --> 00:44:25.462
Some of you are upset.
I know this for a fact because

00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:28.881
in high school,
or wherever you learned to do

00:44:28.881 --> 00:44:33.000
this before, there weren't two
terms here.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.861
There was just one term,
s plus one squared.

00:44:36.861 --> 00:44:39.146
If you do it that way,

00:44:39.146 --> 00:44:42.377
then it's all right.
Then, it's all right,

00:44:42.377 --> 00:44:45.372
but I don't recommend it.
In that case,

00:44:45.372 --> 00:44:48.209
the numerators will not be
constants.

00:44:48.209 --> 00:44:52.070
But, if you just have that,
then because this is a

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:54.750
quadratic polynomial all by
itself.

00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:59.163
You've got to have a linear
polynomial, a s plus b

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:02.000
in the top, see?

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.599
So, you must have a s plus b
here,

00:45:04.599 --> 00:45:08.086
as I'm sure you remember if
that's the way you learned to do

00:45:08.086 --> 00:45:09.445
it. But, to do cover-up,

00:45:09.445 --> 00:45:12.459
the best way as much as
possible to separate out the

00:45:12.459 --> 00:45:14.349
terms.
If this were a cubic term,

00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:16.831
God forbid, s plus one cubed,

00:45:16.831 --> 00:45:20.022
then you'd have to have s plus
one cubed,

00:45:20.022 --> 00:45:23.213
s plus one squared.

00:45:23.213 --> 00:45:26.345
Okay, I won't give you anything
bigger than quadratic.

00:45:26.345 --> 00:45:29.376
[LAUGHTER]
You can trust me.

00:45:29.376 --> 00:45:33.423
Okay, now, what can we find by
the cover up method?

00:45:33.423 --> 00:45:37.309
Well, surely this.
Cover up the s minus one,

00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:42.328
put s equals one,
and I get three divided by two

00:45:42.328 --> 00:45:45.890
squared, four.
So, this is three quarters.

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.238
Now, in this,

00:45:48.238 --> 00:45:52.852
you can always find the highest
power by cover-up because,

00:45:52.852 --> 00:45:56.333
cover it up,
put s equals negative one,

00:45:56.333 --> 00:46:02.000
and you get one minus one
plus one.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.585
So, one up there,
negative one here makes

00:46:04.585 --> 00:46:07.752
negative two here.
So, one over negative two.

00:46:07.752 --> 00:46:09.562
So, it's minus one half.

00:46:09.562 --> 00:46:12.083
Now, this you cannot determine

00:46:12.083 --> 00:46:16.026
by cover-up because you'd want
to cover-up just one of these s

00:46:16.026 --> 00:46:19.452
plus ones.
But then you can't put s equals

00:46:19.452 --> 00:46:22.555
negative one because
you get infinity.

00:46:22.555 --> 00:46:24.752
You get zero there,
makes infinity.

00:46:24.752 --> 00:46:27.467
So, this must be determined
some other way,

00:46:27.467 --> 00:46:29.730
either by undetermined
coefficients,

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.961
or if you've just got one
thing, for heaven's sake,

00:46:32.961 --> 00:46:37.878
just make a substitution.
See, this is supposed to be

00:46:37.878 --> 00:46:40.313
true.
This is an algebraic identity,

00:46:40.313 --> 00:46:43.791
true for all values of the
variable, and therefore,

00:46:43.791 --> 00:46:47.130
it ought to be true when s
equals zero,

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:48.660
for instance.
Why zero?

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.095
Well, because I haven't used it
yet.

00:46:51.095 --> 00:46:53.599
I used negative one and
positive one,

00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:56.591
but I didn't use zero.
Okay, let's use zero.

00:46:56.591 --> 00:47:00.000
Put s equals zero.
What do we get?

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.377
Well, on the left-hand side,
I get one divided by one

00:47:03.377 --> 00:47:06.560
squared, negative.
So, I get minus one on the left

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:09.418
hand side equals,
what do I get on the right?

00:47:09.418 --> 00:47:12.861
Put s equals zero,
you get negative one half.

00:47:12.861 --> 00:47:15.264
Well, this is the number I'm

00:47:15.264 --> 00:47:18.188
trying to find.
So, let's write that simply as

00:47:18.188 --> 00:47:21.890
plus c, putting s equals zero.
s equals zero here gives me

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:23.969
negative three quarters.

00:47:23.969 --> 00:47:26.307
Okay, what's c?
This is minus a half,

00:47:26.307 --> 00:47:29.620
minus three quarters,
is minus five quarters.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:32.088
Put it on the other side,

00:47:32.088 --> 00:47:35.986
minus one plus five quarters is
plus one quarter.

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:39.987
So, c equals one quarter.

00:47:39.987 --> 00:47:42.439
And now, we are ready to do the

00:47:42.439 --> 00:47:44.759
final step.
Take the inverse Laplace

00:47:44.759 --> 00:47:47.475
transform.
You see what I said when I said

00:47:47.475 --> 00:47:49.993
that all the work is in this
last step?

00:47:49.993 --> 00:47:53.638
Just look how much of the work,
how much of the board is

00:47:53.638 --> 00:47:57.481
devoted to the first two steps,
and how much is going to be

00:47:57.481 --> 00:48:01.811
devoted to the last step?
Okay, so we get e to the

00:48:01.811 --> 00:48:05.811
inverse Laplace transform.
Well, the first term is the

00:48:05.811 --> 00:48:08.301
hardest.
Let's let that go for the

00:48:08.301 --> 00:48:10.867
moment.
So, I leave a space for it,

00:48:10.867 --> 00:48:13.358
and then we will have one
quarter.

00:48:13.358 --> 00:48:16.679
Well, one over s plus one is,

00:48:16.679 --> 00:48:19.320
that's just the exponential
formula.

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:24.000
One over s plus one would be e
to the negative t,e to the minus

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.075
one times t.
So, it's one quarter e to the

00:48:28.075 --> 00:48:32.000
minus one times t.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.929
And, how about the next thing
would be three quarters times,

00:48:36.929 --> 00:48:41.442
well, here it's negative one,
so that's e to the plus t.

00:48:41.442 --> 00:48:44.700
Notice how those signs work.

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:49.714
And, that just leaves us the
Laplace transform of this thing.

00:48:49.714 --> 00:48:54.226
Now, you look at it and you
say, this Laplace transform

00:48:54.226 --> 00:48:58.320
happened in two steps.
I took something and I got,

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:03.000
essentially,
one over s squared.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.007
And then, I changed s to s plus
one.

00:49:08.007 --> 00:49:13.112
All right, what gives one over
s squared?

00:49:13.112 --> 00:49:18.119
The Laplace transform of what
is one over s squared?

00:49:18.119 --> 00:49:23.029
t, you say to yourself,
one over s to some power is

00:49:23.029 --> 00:49:28.232
essentially some power of t.
And then, you look at the

00:49:28.232 --> 00:49:31.975
formula.
Notice at the top is one

00:49:31.975 --> 00:49:34.773
factorial, which is one,
of course.

00:49:34.773 --> 00:49:39.299
Okay, now, then how do I
convert this to one over s plus

00:49:39.299 --> 00:49:44.072
one squared?
That's the exponential shift

00:49:44.072 --> 00:49:47.034
formula.
If you know what the Laplace

00:49:47.034 --> 00:49:51.972
transform, so the first formula
in the middle of the board on

00:49:51.972 --> 00:49:54.605
the top, there,
if you know what,

00:49:54.605 --> 00:49:58.967
change s to s plus one,
corresponds to

00:49:58.967 --> 00:50:03.000
multiplying by e to the t.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.479
So, it is t times e to the
negative t.

00:50:06.479 --> 00:50:08.636
Sorry, that corresponds to
this.

00:50:08.636 --> 00:50:11.490
So, this is the exponential
shift formula.

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:15.596
If t goes to one over s squared,
then t e to the

00:50:15.596 --> 00:50:20.049
minus t goes to one
over s plus one squared.

00:50:20.049 --> 00:50:22.624
Okay, but there's a constant

00:50:22.624 --> 00:50:25.408
out front.
So, it's minus one half t e to

00:50:25.408 --> 00:50:27.635
the negative t.

00:50:27.635 --> 00:50:30.488
Now, tell me,
what parts of this solution,

00:50:30.488 --> 00:50:32.993
oh boy, we're over time.
But, notice,

00:50:32.993 --> 00:50:36.612
this is what would have been
the particular solution,

00:50:36.612 --> 00:50:39.257
(y)p before,
and this is the stuff that

00:50:39.257 --> 00:50:42.875
occurs in the complementary
function, but already the

00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:49.000
appropriate constants have been
supplied for the coefficients.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.004
You don't have to calculate
them separately.

00:50:52.004 --> 00:50:54.170
They were built into the
method.

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:57.103
Okay, good luck on Friday,
and see you there.
