EUGENIA ROCHE: Hi.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.000
My name is a Eugenia Roche.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.840
I am coming on seven years next
Monday, March 17 at Google.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.800
I am an account manager on our
sales side of the business.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.410
I work on AdWords.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.120
I work in media
and entertainment.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.510
And I primarily work
with publishing clients.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.600
So the scope of our
publishing clients

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.240
is everything from books
to magazines to, right now,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.230
some pure play digital
players in the digital space.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.040
Prior to coming to Google,
I worked at Conde Nast.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.060
I was there for about
2 and 1/2 years.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.650
I also spent some time
interning there and also worked

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.660
at a brokerage firm
on Wall Street.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.370
The majority of
my time, actually,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.270
though-- when I was thinking
about it, in my young adult

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.370
life-- was actually and has
been working with publishers,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.310
even though I work at Google.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.460
I have two kids, ages
four and almost six,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.940
three step kids--
12, 17, and 19.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.580
In addition to a full time
job, I facilitate a program

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.650
through our G2G
People Dev program

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.690
called Foundations
of Leadership.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.260
G2G is an abbreviation
for, "Googler to Googler."

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.010
It's a program which enables
Googlers to teach, share,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.270
and learn from one another.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.530
We have traditional programs
like Foundations of Leadership,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.880
which I will talk about in
greater detail, Managing

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.990
Your Energy, Presenting
With Charisma.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.620
We have programs like
Teach Your Own Stuff.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.600
So if you are an
expert in martial arts,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.440
you can create a program and
come and teach it to your peers

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.650
here at Google.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.330
We also have Engineering,
taught by engineers.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.580
And we have language programs.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.470
So there's quite a bit
of Google to Googler

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.080
knowledge that's shared
through this G2G program.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.410
I took Foundations of
Leadership in 2011.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.340
And I was inspired
to take the program

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.370
after I'd come back
from maternity leave.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.660
I had been out on my
second maternity leave.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.560
I came back.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.840
And change is constant
at this company.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.930
And I came back.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.560
I had a new team lead.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.160
I was on a new team.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.940
And though I was
working with publishers,

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.850
they threw in some
cable folks who

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.290
kept talking to me about GRPs.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.630
I had no idea what
they talking about.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.210
The nice thing is that some
of these cable companies,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.840
like Nat Geo, fortunately
had magazines.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.350
So I still understood
how to speak their speak.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.100
So the Foundations
of Leadership program

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.390
is a five week,
self-paced course.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.910
And it provided a fair
amount of opportunity

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.790
for me to reflect on where
I was, where I wanted to be,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.330
what was I looking for.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.700
And it allowed me
to take some control

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.100
over a lot of the
changes that felt

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.440
like were just pushed on me.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.040
So I have since, though, taken
on an additional leadership

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.560
role in facilitating the course.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.790
And I've been doing that
for the last two years.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.405
When the opportunity arose,
I raised my hand and said,

00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:11.780
it's something
I'd love to learn.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.340
I would love to be able to help
other Googlers who were once

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.980
in my position get through
that change and that tough time

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.970
and not feel like they suffered
because they didn't have

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.460
the facilities or the
resources to take advantage

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.760
of turning that around.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.030
Facilitation and
just being a part

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.230
of this program has enabled
me to develop confidence

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.140
in the classroom.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.840
I have also developed a
tremendous amount of confidence

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.510
in meetings.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.920
So in my real job, I was
recently at a meeting

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.590
at Time Inc. I had 10
executives in the room.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.580
It was a
three-hour-long meeting.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.870
95% of the content was delivered
and presented by myself

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.700
and put together that way.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.690
And I really think FLT--
Foundations of Leadership--

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.060
was a critical
foundation, so to speak,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.860
of being able to do that.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.214
So as I noted, I'm
on M&amp;E, which stands

00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:08.380
for media and entertainment.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.200
And we work with publishers.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.120
I love books.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.360
I love to learn.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.320
I was a double major--
English and Political

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.459
Science-- at Lehigh University.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.029
Anyone from Lehigh?

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.170
Good engineering school.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.850
I was not an engineer.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.230
[LAUGHS] So I love to read.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.940
I love to learn.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.440
I was a double major.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.620
I read a lot.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.170
And as I've told you about my
background, my current story,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.280
my reading time
these days is finite.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.240
I have to be selective.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.010
So the books up
here are from one

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.390
of our partners, Random House.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.580
So I read, "Fifty
Shades," so that I

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.310
get the pop culture side of me.

00:04:44.776 --> 00:04:46.400
Because I'm in my
mid 30s, I'm starting

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.640
to feel a little
bit out of the loop.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.790
"Gone Girl"-- a bunch
of gals in my team,

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.920
we did this for
a team book club.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.270
Eric Schmidt, "The New
Digital Age"-- yes, I

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.890
am trying to read it.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.330
And, "The Parent
Backpack," I recently read.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.520
It was my daughter
started kindergarten.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.420
And I had no idea.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.330
I have five kids, but I
didn't know what I need to do,

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.650
what my role as a parent
should and would look like.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.480
And then, "The
Berenstain Bears."

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.740
So as you can imagine,
because I have little kids,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.120
I spend probably
more of my evenings

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.430
reading to them than to myself.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.430
And actually, last month was
the Race To Read program.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.890
Being competitive, I thought,
why read one book at night?

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.880
Let's read four.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.750
So we read a lot.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.160
And, "The Berenstain
Bears," are in the lineup

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.450
almost all the time.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.910
And earlier this
week-- actually,

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.120
as I was preparing
for today, we were

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.230
reading, "The Berenstain
Bears and the Truth."

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.140
So I don't know how many
of you recently read it.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.102
Maybe you need to be
reminded about what happens.

00:05:51.102 --> 00:05:52.310
The picture gives a lot away.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.640
But the kids are home.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.980
And it was good for my kids.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.580
The kids were home, bored,
looking for something to do.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.855
They play soccer.

00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:01.520
Oops, they knock over a lamp.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.200
Well, just like any kid,
they see Mama coming home.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.640
And they think, we
have to cover it up.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.640
So they cover it up.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.250
And they tell a lie.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.520
And that lie really takes shape
in a larger than anticipated

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.390
way.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.170
And Momma, being Momma,
gets upset with the kids.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.320
And she tells them, I'm not
even upset the you lied--

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.090
or that the lamp broke, rather.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.490
Because the lamp can be
put back together again.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.020
We can buy a new lamp.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.960
I'm upset because you lied.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.660
And my bears, whom
I've always trusted,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.930
didn't tell me the truth.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.680
And the bottom line is that kids
will be kids and things happen.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.249
But in the end,
trust is something

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:43.040
that you can't put back
together again very

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.760
easily once it's broke it.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.140
So I'm currently
facilitating-- just

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.590
wrapped up a five-week class.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.560
And the week prior, we had
talked about teaming and trust,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.700
and how trust is the foundation
of any successful team

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.510
and any successful
relationship, for that matter.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.999
So here I am reading
about bears to my kids

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:05.040
and thinking about trust.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.770
And I think Jan and
Stan Berenstain,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.170
just like we at Google, knew
that leadership can be taught.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.190
So here, Ben Franklin
says, "Being ignorant

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.320
is not so much a shame, as
being unwilling to learn."

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.070
But it really starts with the
ability and the willingness

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.640
here at Google to learn.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.300
Adult learning, as
you can imagine,

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.720
is very different than
academic learning.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.020
Participants at this
company are hand raisers.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.860
Foundations of Leadership
fills up in less than a day.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.280
That is how much people
want to learn here.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.230
Programs are constantly
being developed.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.589
And our programs
are not mandatory.

00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:42.380
They're researched.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.046
They're crafted.

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:44.890
There's a lot of
thought put into them.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.380
They're designed to
educate and inspire.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.650
And thinking about
crisis response,

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:55.300
our products are meant to
connect users to information,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.350
right?

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.030
And Google-- Google
it, did you Google it?

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.520
It's now a word, right?

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.220
In common language.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.200
And frankly, a lot of our
publishers whom I work with

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.520
are a critical part
of that ecosystem.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.600
Because without content,
without information,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.760
you wouldn't have
access to any of that.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.795
So think about how you obtain
knowledge and information.

00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:19.340
It's through
resources and channels

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.700
that connect you to it.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.890
And it's a fundamental
part of our democracy.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.470
So what I love about Google to
Google programs and Foundations

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.500
of Leadership is
that we are further

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.190
shaping the learning and
development of Googlers,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.940
because we are connecting
our peers to content

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.090
about leadership.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.760
I personally am continuing
to aid in their development

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.559
and working with them
on a program that

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:46.260
allows them to tap into
experience and relationships

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.915
and bring that to the workplace.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.790
So what is leadership?

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.430
How many people
in this room think

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.462
that you have to be a manager to
be in a position of leadership.

00:09:00.462 --> 00:09:02.450
I know I heard that
question before,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.150
which was, how do
you manage your team?

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.650
Right?

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.520
So we just assume
because someone's here

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.200
talking about something, we're
in a position of management.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.050
Or maybe management was just
misplaced for leadership.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.820
So I love that the class
actually does just that.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.650
We try to break down the
wall between leadership

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.650
and management.

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.600
Sure, some leaders are managers.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.170
But the first
thing to understand

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.290
is that an organization,
especially a company

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:32.260
like Google, we need both
managers and leaders.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.710
And they're not the same.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.660
In times of war,
think about crisis.

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.540
You really need leaders.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:42.360
In times of peace,
you need managers.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.250
Both have a place.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.009
So we go back to the
fundamentals at Google, here.

00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:51.800
And we think about
Foundation of Leadership

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.250
just in a very basic sense.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:55.660
So what is leadership?

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.800
Why is it different
than management?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.540
Can you be a leader
and not a manager?

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.340
And the answer is absolutely.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:07.672
Through a self-guided
process of understanding,

00:10:07.672 --> 00:10:09.880
you can discover that we're
not actually even talking

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.380
about traditional leadership.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.230
Has anyone recently
read, "The Times"?

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.490
There was an article about
getting hired at Google.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.440
I know you're not
being recruited.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.530
And our VP of HR, Laszlo
Bock, actually said,

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.590
we're not talking about
traditional leadership.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.190
We're not talking about being
the president of the chess club

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.060
or vice president of sales.

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.660
We're talking about
emergent leadership,

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.730
leadership like when
faced with a crisis

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:38.050
or you're the leader of
a team, what do you do?

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.280
Do you step in and
lead and take action?

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.760
And then at times when it's
appropriate to step back,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:43.905
do you do just that?

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.670
Leadership requires
an understanding

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.980
of your values, your beliefs,
having a biased action,

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.630
and taking initiative.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.876
So the last class,
I asked the group

00:11:00.876 --> 00:11:02.250
in one of our
debrief sessions, I

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.100
said, can someone
give me an example

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.760
of taking initiative recently?

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.925
And it was like crickets.

00:11:07.925 --> 00:11:10.020
It often is at the
opening of the class.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.241
No one wants to share.

00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:13.240
And so finally, one of
the gals raised her hand.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.830
And she said, I gave
up on a project.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.230
Now, you're thinking,
why is that initiative

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.770
and why is that taking
leadership, right?

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.210
What the truth was is that
it was taking up time.

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:25.530
It was taking up resources.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.450
It wasn't going in the same
direction as other priorities.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.560
It just simply was a waste
of her personal resources.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.489
But letting it go
felt really good.

00:11:36.489 --> 00:11:38.530
And she was willing to
share that with the group.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.540
And I was actually
struck by the fact

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.760
that, wow, that
was a big admission

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.280
for you, or for anyone
for that matter.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.360
And the truth is leadership
requires initiative.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.770
It requires optimism,
and requires

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.410
a fair amount of failure.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:58.450
So there are a lot of
examples of leaders in history

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.000
who have failed and
continued to succeed.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.690
But I think the most salient
example for this room

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.360
is Steve Jobs.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.090
Steve Jobs was the
best at failing.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.260
He got fired from
his own company.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:15.770
You could not pick
up an editorial piece

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.900
when he passed away that did
not highlight his failure as

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.700
much as his success.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:26.410
But his failure led him
to his next journey.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.530
And he even credits
that time in his life

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.010
as the most creative
period for him

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.330
because he was
forced to let it go.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.160
So think different.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.870
That's what Apple asks us to do.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.020
When I first came to Google,
one of the first questions

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.210
I got was, how well do
you deal with change?

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.780
And I was single.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.070
I didn't have kids.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.380
I thought, yeah.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.800
I can deal with change.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.430
Bring it on.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:56.900
I worked at Conde
Nast, which was

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.880
a company that constantly
underwent change.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.980
I started in January.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.440
By March, I had a new publisher.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.260
By June, I had a new role.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.830
Change was constant.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.220
It was often in
the form of a memo.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.850
But it was somewhat refreshing.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.412
It always felt like, OK, so
something's going to happen.

00:13:15.412 --> 00:13:17.370
That means that we're
moving in some direction.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.810
There's some upside to this.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.890
We're trying to think different.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.100
And then in the summer
of 2006, our publisher

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.090
at the time-- who I
still am friends with.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:31.390
And I think he's a tremendous
leader and manager.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.090
He bought into our
offsite, our sales meeting,

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:38.600
one of his managers, someone
from the leadership, Mitch Fox.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.010
And he came in and
delivered this discussion,

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:46.650
this talk about our business
and the future of our business.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.900
Now, it's 2006.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.430
We're pitching a program as
part of our marketing project,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:55.267
Snap, Save, Send.

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:56.850
You snapped a picture
in the magazine.

00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.450
You saved it.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.340
And you sent it.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:02.070
That was revolutionary.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.750
It was interesting
how at that time

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.310
we thought we knew
that mobile was next.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.280
But we didn't even
really have the foresight

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.760
to see where it was going today.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.100
But Mitch did.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.460
And he challenged us
to think different,

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.102
to act as leaders
of our business,

00:14:17.102 --> 00:14:18.060
and to think different.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.110
He actually was
telling us something

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.730
that was going to
change our lives.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:29.050
And he closed with the
1984 Mac commercial.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.269
So just by a show of
hands, anyone ever see it?

00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:32.935
Do you even know what
I'm talking about?

00:14:32.935 --> 00:14:33.960
All right, cool.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.110
A few people do.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.820
I was five in '84.

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.224
So I hadn't seen it.

00:14:39.224 --> 00:14:40.640
But I'm going to
share it with you

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:44.800
at this time for those
who have not seen it.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.730
LEADER: "Today we celebrate
the first glorious anniversary

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.700
of the Information
Purification Directives.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.917
We have created
for the first time

00:14:57.917 --> 00:15:02.125
in all history a garden
of pure ideology,

00:15:02.125 --> 00:15:05.095
where each worker
may bloom, secure

00:15:05.095 --> 00:15:09.550
from the pests of any
contradictory thoughts.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.015
Our Unification of

00:15:13.015 --> 00:15:16.480
a weapon than any
fleet or army on Earth.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.915
"We are one people with one
whim, one resolve, one case.

And we will bury them
with their own confusion.

We shall prevail." [EXPLOSION]

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.434
EUGENIA ROCHE: Give me a minute.

00:15:57.434 --> 00:16:00.296
Whoops.

00:16:00.296 --> 00:16:02.520
Return to full screen.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.600
There we go.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.550
All righty.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.710
So I admittedly was like
those guys in the front row.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.430
Like, oh my god.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.910
I had never seen
a video like that.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.485
I had actually
never seen some one

00:16:13.485 --> 00:16:18.299
in the leadership at Conde
Nast come and talk to us.

00:16:18.299 --> 00:16:19.840
It was always, like
I said, literally

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.620
delivered-- any change,
any inspirations

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.480
was in a memo, an email.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.110
And I was totally taken aback.

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:28.460
I actually was inspired.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:34.400
And I remembered thinking
that, although this company is

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.960
changing on the inside,
it doesn't actually

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.390
feel like our
business is changing

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.610
as quickly on the outside.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:47.360
It never left me that we
should think different

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.490
and that change in
a company is good.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.230
Without changing,
you actually have

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:54.100
to question the status quo.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.880
So that was summer of '06.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.680
I came and joined
Google in March of '07.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.250
I was inspired to take change.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.760
That leader, Mitch Fox,
he left in early '08.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.280
And fortunately
for the two of us,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.240
we left before the
economic downturn in 2009.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.010
At that time I was actually
their account manager.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:16.180
So it was interesting to be here
on the other side of things.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.800
And the company
was finally forced

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.040
to change on the outside.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.730
It was no longer focused
on changing on the inside,

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.339
but actually changing
the direction

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.460
of their business
on the outside.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.860
And we're at a time
of incredible change.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:31.640
All the publishers
whom I'm working with,

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.490
they are trying
to do new things.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.620
They are innovating.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.050
What they were doing
yesterday is old.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.080
And that's why the notion of
leadership is so important.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.790
It's having a
solid understanding

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.260
of these principles that
has allowed me, personally,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.230
to embrace changes.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.280
Because if you
remember, I was going

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.030
through a tremendous
change when I finally

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.802
decided to take
Foundations of Leadership.

00:17:55.802 --> 00:17:57.260
And it's particularly
at times when

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.970
things feel upside down
that these leadership

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.660
principles make the most sense.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:06.620
So a new baby, a new
team, a new project--

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:08.620
it's having trust
in those around me,

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.850
my family, the leadership
here, and my colleagues, that

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.430
is fundamental.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.420
With change comes an
opportunity to learn again.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.340
And just this
quarter, I was tasked

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.650
with doing just that when I
was facilitating Foundations

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.110
of Leadership again.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:31.260
And the program decided
to change the content

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.960
and asked if I
wanted to pilot it.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.200
And because I was,
I guess, maybe one

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.010
of the more senior facilitators,
and I said sure, let's do it.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:40.410
And I knew that I was
taking some risks.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.940
I knew that I could fail.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.530
I knew that when the
Googlers, who are opinionated,

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.390
give that feedback, it
may reflect really poorly

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.770
against me.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.090
But I knew that if we didn't
try to change the program

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.215
and if we didn't try to
determine whether there was

00:18:55.215 --> 00:18:57.490
a better way, we
would never know.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.110
So being a part of that
change is uncomfortable.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.410
It's scary.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.080
But it's what we
do here at Google.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.780
So leadership for me at
Google is biased action.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.800
It's being open to change.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.460
I agree with Laszlo.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.070
It's knowing when to
take the lead, when

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.070
to seek and ask for support.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.900
That's important.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.510
Asking for help is an
important part of leadership.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.550
And doing so
throughout each step,

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.350
it's humility, the
willingness to learn,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:31.560
and the challenging
yourself to think different.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.300
So I have two things in closing.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.510
One-- it's a quick exercise.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.166
And we do this in
Foundations of Leadership.

00:19:38.166 --> 00:19:39.540
So I want you to
close your eyes.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:40.540
Look at the ceiling.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.670
Look down, left,
right, what have you.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.900
And just take a minute and think
about a leader in your life.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.590
How many people thought
of a business leader?

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.144
No hands, nice.

00:19:59.144 --> 00:19:59.685
A politician?

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.270
A family member?

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.035
A teacher or coach?

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.120
A community leader?

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.320
Research shows that
when we are asked

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:23.090
who the most influential
leaders are in our life,

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.260
generally respondents
will answer predominantly

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.790
that family members, teachers,
and coaches are the most

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.220
influential.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.780
Leadership is personal.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.730
There is no definition
of leadership.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.020
There is no right answer.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.530
There are leaders around us
who are doing every day things.

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:43.720
People who are trying
to change systems,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:51.830
change ways things are
done, create something new,

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.350
and these leaders are
just like you and me.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.910
Because the best leaders
are the best learners.

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:06.390
Yes, leadership can be taught
to those who want to learn.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.360
And we all have the
ability to lead.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.490
So I will close
with a little video

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:16.240
around leadership at Google and
what it looks like for others,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:16.750
as well.

00:21:33.164 --> 00:21:34.580
FEMALE SPEAKER 1:
Leadership to me

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:38.550
is doing something
that you know is write,

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.749
even when others aren't as sure.

00:21:41.749 --> 00:21:43.290
FEMALE SPEAKER 2:
So leadership to me

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.250
is three things-- communicating
effectively, building

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.970
relationships, and
making decisions.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:53.000
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Aligning your
passions with the right people

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.660
and finding a purpose together.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.240
FEMALE SPEAKER 4:
Leadership at Google to me

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.970
is about having the
passion and the courage

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:07.063
to make a difference for the
things that you believe in.

00:22:07.063 --> 00:22:10.556
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:58.486
EUGENIA ROCHE: Thank you.

00:22:58.486 --> 00:23:01.402
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:06.264 --> 00:23:07.555
'Happy to answer any questions.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.340
ANNA: Hi.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.070
My name is Anna.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:21.210
And I wanted to ask--
so in technology

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:26.180
it's really hard not to
only be a woman, because

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.860
of the percentage, but
also, like one of the ladies

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.810
were talking how they come from
not a traditional background--

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:41.940
so how do you
approach this better

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:49.330
when you have a room full of
very opinionated developers

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:53.710
and you're trying to not only
convince them to do something,

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.880
but convince them to do
something they don't really

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.379
want?

00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.350
Or--

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.933
EUGENIA ROCHE: That's
a good question.

00:24:00.933 --> 00:24:03.140
ANNA: --like something
different, something new.

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.014
EUGENIA ROCHE: So can
you give me an example?

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.320
ANNA: OK.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:17.860
So if the company is very
backend developer-driven,

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.210
like a very traditional
approach, I'd say,

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.890
where developers
just have one role,

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:30.229
getting them to think different
sometimes is a challenge.

00:24:30.229 --> 00:24:32.270
Trying a different approach
might be a challenge.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.570
And being the only--
not necessarily leader,

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:41.152
but trying to lead this
effort can be a challenge.

00:24:41.152 --> 00:24:42.080
EUGENIA ROCHE: Got it.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:48.360
So that's where the biased
action thing, I think,

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.290
makes the most sense.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.430
Or at least I had a personal
experience where-- so I

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:55.100
used to work on the
traditional side of ads

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.280
and worked at Conde Nast.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.770
In fact, when I was leaving,
in HR they said to me,

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.520
what are you going to
go do, sell AdWords?

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.890
Like it was the
lowest-brow thing

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:07.340
I could possibly be doing,
leaving this glamorous magazine

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.930
to go here.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.410
And so now I'm here a
few years down the road.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.210
And Conde Nast is my client.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.700
And I keep going in with
different team members who

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.884
want to sell them
a YouTube masthead.

00:25:17.884 --> 00:25:19.550
And every time I'm
going in with my head

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.490
down because that's not
what they want to buy.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.460
That's not what
they're interested in.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.290
They're looking for a solution
to a business problem.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.680
And we're not helping them.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.470
So I actually did
something for my team.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:37.450
I created a How Do Magazine
Publishers Make Money 101.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.320
And I had my teammates,
after the fact, say to me,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.530
oh my god, I had no idea.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.570
They are now one of
our biggest clients

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.150
because we finally understood.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:50.470
And my teammates who
actually pitch ideas to them

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.960
finally understood we have to
tap into what their business

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.560
problems are and solve them.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.010
So I can't really speak from
an engineering perspective.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.500
But I would say if you can
find a business problem

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.767
and attempt to address it
in a way that solves it,

00:26:05.767 --> 00:26:07.600
I think you're in a
better place than trying

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.965
to push against something
that's unwilling to change.

00:26:16.316 --> 00:26:17.940
AUDIENCE: Hello I'm
[? Elaina ?] Berry.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.690
EUGENIA ROCHE: Hi.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.860
AUDIENCE: I'll be your
second question, I guess.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:26.290
So I deeply believe
in vulnerability

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:30.880
as being a core
exhibit of leadership.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.670
And so I wonder if you
share that believe at Google

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.300
and whether you actively
train people on it

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.516
and you really push forward.

00:26:38.516 --> 00:26:39.890
Do you look for
it in interviews?

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:43.450
Do you build that
culture around it?

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.380
Just a question.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.780
EUGENIA ROCHE: Yeah.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.820
So actually going back
to, "The Berenstain Bears

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.472
and the Truth," because that
was the Monday-- so my class

00:26:51.472 --> 00:26:52.180
is on Wednesdays.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.319
So I had Wednesday.

00:26:53.319 --> 00:26:55.860
And then came Sunday or Monday,
we were reading, "The Truth."

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.420
And, "Trust," was
around teamwork

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.600
and how do you build trust.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.860
And the bottom line
is you want to build

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:06.640
vulnerability-based trust.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.620
If you want to look
up Patrick Lencioni,

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.310
we use a lot of his content.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.520
He'd come to Google.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.829
And so we had a video.

00:27:14.829 --> 00:27:15.870
We had taped it one time.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.200
And Googlers watch it.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.770
But it's about being butt naked
and being completely honest.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.710
We do a lot of things at
Google to develop trust.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.570
We have opportunities
for Googlers

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.500
to have lunch with one another,
team events, off-sites.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.790
So trust is really important.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:36.980
Because everything we
do is usually on a team.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.750
Even if you are the
manager of a team,

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.680
you're probably part
of a bigger team.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.310
So teams are really,
really important here.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.700
And the bottom line is you
can't have an effective team

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.420
if no one trusts one another.

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.550
And you need that
vulnerability-based trust.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:28:00.182
I'm curious how you assess
the impact of the trainings.

00:28:00.182 --> 00:28:01.640
EUGENIA ROCHE: How
do I asses that?

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:10.150
So feedback is asked for.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.220
So I personally
get a score in it.

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:14.890
I can't remember--
I saw this once,

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.470
but there's something
like, teachers

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.270
take credit for
students who do well.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.210
And there's some
psychology behind it.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:28.420
But I honestly have seen people
in my class who have gone on

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.380
to do really incredible things.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.940
I know Jackie Brown is here.

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.190
She's a lead recruiter.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:35.890
She runs yoga.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:37.100
I see her all the time.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.980
Her name is always out
there doing these classes.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.970
And I want to say she's probably
been doing it before FLT.

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.670
But I really started
seeing her-- and even

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.420
people I know say, oh, you're
going to Jackie's class.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.340
So I think it's
assessed in part by how

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.574
we see people move on
and do other things.

00:28:56.574 --> 00:28:57.740
Again, they're hand raisers.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.670
So people who come into these
programs are already in a place

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.997
where they're looking to
be an agent of change.

00:29:02.997 --> 00:29:04.580
Or they're looking
to take initiative.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.660
They just need someone to
push them over the edge.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.243
And they just need
the core principles

00:29:08.243 --> 00:29:12.350
to help guide them
in that direction.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.640
So it's not uncommon
to see people suddenly

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.660
on a promotion path or suddenly
be taking on a new project.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.160
And the last quarter
of the content

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.840
I've piloted, one
of the things we did

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.020
was we tasked the group
with certain priorities

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.020
that we've identified
in the company

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.240
and asked them to lead and be
an agent of change against them.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.910
One of the participants
in the class

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.250
is actually moving forward
with that on an internal thing

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.894
that we have around Google Gist.

00:29:39.894 --> 00:29:41.310
And she said, I
don't know if it's

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.790
the intersection of the
program or my interest,

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:47.610
but it made me want to do it.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.110
PATRICE CAROL: Hi,
I'm Patrice Carol.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.560
EUGENIA ROCHE: Hi.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.130
PATRICE CAROL: So
my question was--

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:57.280
I've seen a lot of
culturally instilled problems

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.590
in women, for instance--
I mean problems

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.660
that women face
in their attitude.

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.770
For instance, seeing multiple
friends and coworkers

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.015
work really hard for an extra
year and be in frustration

00:30:08.015 --> 00:30:09.390
rather than ask
for the promotion

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.150
or raise that a male counterpart
would have probably asked

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:13.070
for earlier.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:17.050
So I was wondering if you
see any pitfalls and setbacks

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:21.400
to leadership that women in
particular face and what advice

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.882
you give them in your class?

00:30:23.882 --> 00:30:25.590
EUGENIA ROCHE: So
that's a good question.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.260
That's something
I struggle with.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:30.290
The last two days I was
traveling with my stepdaughter

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.380
to visit colleges.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.730
And when reflecting on
where she's going to go,

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.370
one of her decisions
may be to a school

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:37.530
that wasn't an original choice.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.140
Because she said,
well, I didn't think

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.306
I was going to get in there.

00:30:40.306 --> 00:30:41.047
And I said, why.

00:30:41.047 --> 00:30:43.130
She didn't think she was
going to get in anywhere.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.420
Right?

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.880
And that's the way women think.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.790
And I'm trying to get
her to stop doing that.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.960
This last class of
Foundations of Leadership

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.580
was pretty well balanced.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.480
The last few
quarters, I noticed,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.870
it was really heavy in men.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.970
And I don't know why.

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.120
But I will say
that Google is very

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.790
conscientious around trying to
flip that around on its head.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:11.390
We have a large percentage
of women in the company.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.750
We devote a lot of
time and attention

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:16.660
around building our women.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.850
Because they
shouldn't be just left

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:23.030
in the sidelines while their
men counterparts take off.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.100
We're a growing company.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.242
So there are growing pains.

00:31:25.242 --> 00:31:27.700
But it is certainly something
that we're trying to address.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.740
And I think in part
that's why I like

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.270
being a part of this program
and being part of the G2G.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.620
Because I can help
shape that further.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.510
But also standing up there
and saying, but I'm a woman,

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.090
and I'm going to take on
this challenge, hopefully

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.965
will motivate others.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.490
Yeah, so that's the bottom line.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.520
It's not something
that's overlooked.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.061
I could put it that way.

00:31:55.061 --> 00:31:56.102
PATRICE CAROL: Thank you.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.260
AUDIENCE: So I actually had a
very similar question to that.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.770
It just has a slightly
different bend to it.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.111
I was wondering, there do seem
to be pretty big differences

00:32:07.111 --> 00:32:08.735
between the way guys
traditionally lead

00:32:08.735 --> 00:32:10.290
and the way girls
traditionally lead.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.380
And I was wondering,
you were giving

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:14.950
examples of all of these
different types of leadership.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.070
How do you make that
apparent to a company?

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.770
It's not as easy
as saying, I was

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.300
president of the chess club.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.490
I'm a good leader.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.440
I was wondering, with these
new sorts of leaderships where

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.050
you don't have to necessarily
be a manager, how do you still

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.732
convey that to people, that
you have leadership skills?

00:32:29.732 --> 00:32:31.440
It's just a different
type of leadership.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.227
It might be a quieter
type of leadership.

00:32:34.227 --> 00:32:35.810
EUGENIA ROCHE: That's
a good question.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.840
That's something I
think Laszlo should

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.450
have been asked as a
follow up in, "The Times."

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.190
Because frankly, I don't know.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.494
When our leadership
is up here saying,

00:32:46.494 --> 00:32:48.160
well, we're looking
for these qualities.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.659
I don't actually
know if all the way

00:32:49.659 --> 00:32:51.900
down here, on a
day to day level,

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.020
on the ground level,
how that's assessed.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.280
I can say in terms of our
performance management,

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.140
at least on the sales
side, they recently

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.804
changed it so that you're
going to be evaluated more

00:33:02.804 --> 00:33:04.220
around your
performance the things

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.160
that you're doing, as
opposed to your peers.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.170
And I really wanted
something like that.

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.170
Because there are things
that I'm doing my peers

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.050
are not doing.

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.060
But yet my job
function is the thing

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:17.560
that I keep getting assessed
against them around.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:18.960
And we're not the same.

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.900
So the company is
trying to change

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.960
and trying to identify areas
where people are speaking up,

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.960
where they are
taking initiative.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.940
Frankly, I wouldn't
be here if I didn't

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:32.730
keep coming to different
things and saying, I do FLT,

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:35.180
and I'm passionate about this.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.020
In part, it's because you have
to just keep putting yourself

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.950
out there and raising your hand.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.570
And there are women that
will overshadow you.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:45.402
Forget the men.

00:33:45.402 --> 00:33:47.110
There are a lot of
women in this company.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:49.040
Really, I think--
I could be wrong,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.415
but I think there are more
women here than there are men.

00:33:51.415 --> 00:33:56.210
At least that feels
like the way things are.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.170
And we should support
one another, too.

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:01.740
So keep that in mind when
you think about women.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.890
Because I think sometimes
women are not always

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.800
the best supporters
of one another.

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:10.360
Any other questions?

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.460
Yeah?

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.690
MALE SPEAKER: Last one.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.979
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:34:14.979 --> 00:34:19.500
I'm just curious, because I
come from a military background,

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.267
I work for the government.

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:22.850
I love everything
you're talking about

00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:25.850
and all the initiatives
you're taking on

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.420
and the leadership
courses and everything.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.239
I'm wondering if in private
industry and here in Google

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:35.630
you find the same type of
resistance I, personally,

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:41.000
or we find in a more traditional
environment like the military

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.912
and government.

00:34:41.912 --> 00:34:43.870
EUGENIA ROCHE: So can
you define, "resistance,"

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.009
just so I understand.

00:34:45.009 --> 00:34:47.550
AUDIENCE: Well, like when you're
creating all these programs,

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:53.770
like the G2G or when you're
offering the leadership course.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:55.549
Was it just as
easy as saying, oh,

00:34:55.549 --> 00:34:56.840
here is this leadership course.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.760
And everybody goes,
yes, I want it.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:04.050
Or do they openly
encourage this type of--

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.762
EUGENIA ROCHE: Openly
encourage, absolutely.

00:35:06.762 --> 00:35:08.720
Like I said, there is
the Teach Your Own Stuff.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.590
So if you have a skill
or trade or something

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:11.910
you want to share with
others-- literally,

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.220
there are knitting clubs.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.990
There is someone who
can teach martial arts.

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.710
I have a girlfriend--
who is now facilitating,

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:22.200
but she was once in my class--
she goes to a writing club.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.680
It's taught by someone else
who has a writing background.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.526
So if you can get people
to-- again, I was out

00:35:29.526 --> 00:35:31.150
visiting colleges--
if you have an idea

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:33.233
and you can get enough
people to be invested in it

00:35:33.233 --> 00:35:36.730
or join you or do it, you
can find support and a way

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:37.320
to promote it.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:42.140
So G2G is the avenue
to do just that.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:44.320
And really, no
idea is a bad idea.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.920
It's just making sure
that you get your idea out

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.867
there in front of others.

00:35:48.867 --> 00:35:49.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.550
EUGENIA ROCHE: All right.
