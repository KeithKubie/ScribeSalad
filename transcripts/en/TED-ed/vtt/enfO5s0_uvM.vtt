00:00:20.096 --> 00:00:25.864
(Stories from the Sea: How Life Came to Land)

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:34.930
Life for my kind wasn't always this way.

00:00:38.197 --> 00:00:42.614
There was a time when no animals lived on land.

00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:49.312
All life was in the ocean.

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:54.780
The ocean's where all of us animals got our start,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.147
more than half a billion years ago,

00:01:00.213 --> 00:01:07.563
This is where all animal body types -- or phyla, as scientists call them -- first evolved.

00:01:17.963 --> 00:01:21.297
You know, there are more than 30 animal phyla,

00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:28.198
but only a handful of major ones had what it took to do something completely daring:

00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:33.698
step out of the ocean, and on to dry land.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.663
So, which of these land-dwelling phyla first invaded the land?

00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:56.330
Was it me and my mollusc friends, with our amazing mantles and single foot?

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:09.198
Perhaps the chordate crowd, with their notochords, segmented muscles and big bony skeletons.

00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:21.863
Or maybe those lowly annelid worms, with their powerful ringed bodies.

00:02:29.347 --> 00:02:37.898
Or did the Arthropods first make landfall, with their little flexible suits of armor -- their exoskeleton?

00:02:40.613 --> 00:02:44.997
Ah, yes. The arthropods.

00:02:46.113 --> 00:02:51.163
From crustaceans to millipedes, spiders to insects,

00:02:51.163 --> 00:02:56.612
the arthropods outnumber all animals on land.

00:03:02.463 --> 00:03:05.864
So what's their secret?

00:03:05.864 --> 00:03:13.248
Their exoskeleton is key, but here's the real kicker: jointed appendages.

00:03:13.248 --> 00:03:16.963
They're like little living Swiss army knives:

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:24.097
antennae, multiple mouth parts, an obscene number of legs, if you ask me.

00:03:25.846 --> 00:03:29.148
There's one group of arthropods -- the insects --

00:03:29.148 --> 00:03:32.346
that really rule the land.

00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:38.829
Three body parts, six legs, and an annoying tendency to take over.

00:03:43.913 --> 00:03:49.448
Sure, they have to molt to grow, but that doesn't seem to pose a problem.

00:03:49.747 --> 00:03:55.648
The insects even invented the first wings, and conquered the skies.

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.680
Ah, well. So what if arthropods were the first to reach land

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.913
and invent flight, a hundred million years before the rest of us?

00:04:07.446 --> 00:04:10.330
So what if they pollinate crops around the world,

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.963
and make up 75% of all land animal species?

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:20.562
And that for every single human, there's 200 million of them?

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.463
Sure, those leggy arthropods may still be in the lead when it comes to conquering land,

00:04:27.463 --> 00:04:30.963
but we still rule in the sea.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.480
There are more species of molluscs in the ocean than any other animal phylum.

00:04:47.482 --> 00:04:51.598
We're just getting started up here on land.

00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:59.964
Besides, the seas are rising. Just give us some time.

00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:05.263
Who knows who'll end up ruling this ocean planet?
