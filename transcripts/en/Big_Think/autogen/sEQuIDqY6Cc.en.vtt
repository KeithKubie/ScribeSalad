well religion is an interesting topic

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100
well religion is an interesting topic
 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.900
well religion is an interesting topic
because religion is universal all human

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910
because religion is universal all human
 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.400
because religion is universal all human
societies believe in the supernatural

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410
societies believe in the supernatural
 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.370
societies believe in the supernatural
all human societies have a village in

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
all human societies have a village in
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.350
all human societies have a village in
one way or another which for the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360
one way or another which for the

biologists must mean that religion has

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
biologists must mean that religion has
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.220
biologists must mean that religion has
some advantages offer some advantages to

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
some advantages offer some advantages to
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.380
some advantages offer some advantages to
a society otherwise we wouldn't have

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
a society otherwise we wouldn't have
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.240
a society otherwise we wouldn't have
that strong tendency to develop it and

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
that strong tendency to develop it and
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.250
that strong tendency to develop it and
so for me that's actually a far more

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260
so for me that's actually a far more
 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.410
so for me that's actually a far more
interesting question of whether God

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
interesting question of whether God
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.630
interesting question of whether God
exists or doesn't doesn't exist that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
exists or doesn't doesn't exist that
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640
exists or doesn't doesn't exist that
sort of questions I cannot answer but

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
sort of questions I cannot answer but
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.339
sort of questions I cannot answer but
the question of why we have religions is

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
the question of why we have religions is
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.040
the question of why we have religions is
an interesting question and my view is

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
an interesting question and my view is
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.319
an interesting question and my view is
that morality our human morality is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
that morality our human morality is
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.900
that morality our human morality is
older than religion so instead of seeing

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
older than religion so instead of seeing
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180
older than religion so instead of seeing
morality comes from God or religion gave

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
morality comes from God or religion gave
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.670
morality comes from God or religion gave
us morality for me that's a big no-no

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
us morality for me that's a big no-no
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.619
us morality for me that's a big no-no
our current religions are just two or

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
our current religions are just two or
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.150
our current religions are just two or
three thousand years old which is very

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
three thousand years old which is very
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790
three thousand years old which is very
young and our species is much older and

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800
young and our species is much older and
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.319
young and our species is much older and
I cannot imagine that for example a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329
I cannot imagine that for example a
 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.029
I cannot imagine that for example a
hundred thousand years or two hundred

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039
hundred thousand years or two hundred
 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.850
hundred thousand years or two hundred
thousand years our ancestors did not

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
thousand years our ancestors did not
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500
thousand years our ancestors did not
have some type of morality of course

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
have some type of morality of course
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240
have some type of morality of course
they had rules about how you should

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
they had rules about how you should
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.950
they had rules about how you should
behave what is fair what is unfair

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960
behave what is fair what is unfair
 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.939
behave what is fair what is unfair
caring for others all of these

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
caring for others all of these
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.010
caring for others all of these
tendencies we're in place already so

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
tendencies we're in place already so
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.620
tendencies we're in place already so
they had a moral system and then at some

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
they had a moral system and then at some
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.100
they had a moral system and then at some
point we develop these present-day

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110
point we develop these present-day
 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.450
point we develop these present-day
religions which I think we're sort of

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
religions which I think we're sort of
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.370
religions which I think we're sort of
tacked on to the morality that we had

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
tacked on to the morality that we had
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.830
tacked on to the morality that we had
and maybe they serve to codify codify

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
and maybe they serve to codify codify
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.499
and maybe they serve to codify codify
them or to enforce them or to steer

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
them or to enforce them or to steer
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.570
them or to enforce them or to steer
morality in a particular direction that

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
morality in a particular direction that
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.960
morality in a particular direction that
we prefer and so religion comes in for

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
we prefer and so religion comes in for
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.080
we prefer and so religion comes in for
me secondarily I'm struggling with

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090
me secondarily I'm struggling with
 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.090
me secondarily I'm struggling with
whether we need religion so personally I

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
whether we need religion so personally I
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460
whether we need religion so personally I
think we can be moral without religion

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
think we can be moral without religion
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319
think we can be moral without religion
because we probably had morality long

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
because we probably had morality long
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.620
because we probably had morality long
before the current religions came along

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630
before the current religions came along
 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.120
before the current religions came along
so I think we can be moral without

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
so I think we can be moral without
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.530
so I think we can be moral without
religion but in large-scale societies

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540
religion but in large-scale societies
 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.090
religion but in large-scale societies
where we we are not all keeping an eye

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100
where we we are not all keeping an eye
 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.039
where we we are not all keeping an eye
on each other because we don't in

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
on each other because we don't in
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.780
on each other because we don't in
societies with a thousand people or

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
societies with a thousand people or
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.550
societies with a thousand people or
several thousands or millions of people

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
several thousands or millions of people
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.710
several thousands or millions of people
we cannot all keep an eye on each other

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
we cannot all keep an eye on each other
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.240
we cannot all keep an eye on each other
and that's maybe why we installed

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
and that's maybe why we installed
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.450
and that's maybe why we installed
religions in these large-scale societies

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460
religions in these large-scale societies
 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.310
religions in these large-scale societies
where a God kept watch over everybody

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
where a God kept watch over everybody
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.859
where a God kept watch over everybody
and then the question becomes is this

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
and then the question becomes is this
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.350
and then the question becomes is this
really needed now in northern Europe I'm

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
really needed now in northern Europe I'm
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.479
really needed now in northern Europe I'm
from the Netherlands that is basically

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
from the Netherlands that is basically
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.279
from the Netherlands that is basically
an experiment going on in Northern

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
an experiment going on in Northern
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.619
an experiment going on in Northern
Europe the majority of people are not

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629
Europe the majority of people are not
 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.460
Europe the majority of people are not
religious and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
religious and
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.720
religious and
when you when you ask them they say

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
when you when you ask them they say
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.030
when you when you ask them they say
they're non-believers and they still

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
they're non-believers and they still
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.680
they're non-believers and they still
have a moral Society as far as I can

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
have a moral Society as far as I can
 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.290
have a moral Society as far as I can
tell and so there is a sort of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300
tell and so there is a sort of
 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.930
tell and so there is a sort of
experiment going on there can we set up

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940
experiment going on there can we set up
 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.420
experiment going on there can we set up
a society where religion is not dominant

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
a society where religion is not dominant
 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.550
a society where religion is not dominant
at least it may be present but is not

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
at least it may be present but is not
 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.100
at least it may be present but is not
dominant anymore that is still a moral

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
dominant anymore that is still a moral
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.650
dominant anymore that is still a moral
society and until now I think that

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660
society and until now I think that
 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.780
society and until now I think that
experiment is going pretty well and so

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
experiment is going pretty well and so
 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.660
experiment is going pretty well and so
I'm optimistic that religion is not

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
I'm optimistic that religion is not
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.760
I'm optimistic that religion is not
strictly needed but but I cannot be a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770
strictly needed but but I cannot be a
 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.710
strictly needed but but I cannot be a
hundred percent sure because we've never

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
hundred percent sure because we've never
 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.810
hundred percent sure because we've never
really tried there is no human society

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820
really tried there is no human society
 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.670
really tried there is no human society
where religion is totally absent so we

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680
where religion is totally absent so we
 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.110
where religion is totally absent so we
will really have never tried this

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
will really have never tried this
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.510
will really have never tried this
experiment
