00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.920
Eastern Philosophy has always had a very similar
goal to Western philosophy: that of making

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.060
us wiser, less agitated, more thoughtful and
readier to appreciate our lives. However,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.160
the way it has gone about this has been intriguingly
different. In the East, Philosophy has taught

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.050
its lessons via tea drinking ceremonies, walks
in bamboo forests, contemplations of rivers

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.430
and ritualised flower arranging sessions.
Here are a few ideas to offer us the distinctive

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:41.650
wisdom of a continent and enrich our notions
of what philosophy might really be. ONE: Life

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.299
is suffering The first and central ‘noble
truth’ of the Buddha is that life is unavoidably

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:53.369
about misery. The Buddha continually seeks
to adjust our expectations so we will know

00:00:53.369 --> 00:01:00.049
what to expect: sex will disappoint us, youth
will disappear, money won’t spare us pain.

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.010
For the Buddha, the wise person should take
care to grow completely at home with the ordinary

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.660
shambles of existence. They should understand
that they are living on a dunghill. When baseness

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.680
and malice rear their heads, as they will,
it should be against a backdrop of fully vanquished

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.820
hope, so there will be no sense of having
been unfairly let down and one’s credulity

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.820
betrayed. That said, the Buddha was often
surprisingly cheerful and generally sported

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.280
an inviting, warm smile. This was because
anything nice, sweet or amusing that came

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.909
his way was immediately experienced as a bonus;
a deeply gratifying addition to his original

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.770
bleak premises. By keeping the dark backdrop
of life always in mind, he sharpened his appreciation

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.950
of whatever stood out against it. He teaches
us the art of cheerful despair. TWO: Mettā

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.750
(pali): Benevolence Mettā is a word which,
in the Indian language of Pali, means benevolence,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.090
kindness or tenderness. It is one of the most
important ideas in Buddhism. Buddhism recommends

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.810
a daily ritual meditation to foster this attitude
(what is known as mettā bhāvanā). The meditation

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.950
begins with a call to think very carefully
every morning of a particular individual with

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.480
whom one tends to get irritated or to whom
one feels aggressive or cold and – in place

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.921
of one’s normal hostile impulses – to
rehearse kindly messages like ‘I hope you

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:35.920
will find peace’ or ‘I wish you to be
free from suffering’. This practice can

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.780
be extended outwards ultimately to include
pretty much everyone on earth. The background

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.230
assumption is that our feelings towards people
are not fixed and unalterable, but are open

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.440
to deliberate change and improvement, with
the right goad. Compassion is a learnable

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.750
skill – and we need to direct it as much
towards those we love as those we are tempted

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.720
to dismiss and detest. THREE: Guanyin Guanyin
is a saintly female figure in East Asian Buddhism

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.319
strongly associated with mercy, compassion
and kindness. She occupies a similar role

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.210
within Buddhism as the Virgin Mary within
Catholicism. There are shrines and temples

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.460
to her all over China; one, in the province
of Hainan, has a 108 metre statue of her (it’s

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.980
the fourth largest statue anywhere in the
world). Guanyin’s popularity speaks of the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:35.260
extent to which the needs of childhood endure
within us. She is, in the noblest sense, ‘mummy’.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.210
Across China, adults allow themselves to be
weak in her presence. Her gaze has a habit

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.930
of making people cry – for the moment one
breaks down isn’t so much when things are

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.290
hard as when one finally encounters kindness
and a chance to admit to sorrows one has been

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.709
harbouring in silence for too long. Guanyin
doesn’t judge. She understands that you

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.710
are tired, that you have been betrayed, that
things aren’t easy, that you are fed up:

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.630
she has a measure of the difficulties involved
in trying to lead a remotely adequate adult

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:15.459
life. FOUR: Wu Wei (Chinese): Not making an
Effort Wu Wei is a (Chinese) term at the heart

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.150
of the philosophy of Daoism. It is first described
in the Tao Te Ching, written by the sage Lao

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.770
Tzu in the 6th century BC. Wu Wei means ‘not
making an effort’, going with the flow,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.840
but it doesn’t in any way imply laziness
or sloth. It suggests rather an intentional

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.279
surrender of the will based on a wise recognition
of the need, at points, to accede to, rather

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:46.180
than protest against, the demands of reality.
As Lao Tzu puts it, to be wise is to have

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.509
learnt how one must sometimes ‘surrender
to the whole universe’. Reason allows us

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:57.029
to calculate when our wishes are in irrevocable
conflict with reality, and then bids us to

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:03.599
submit ourselves willingly, rather than angrily
or bitterly, to necessities. We may be powerless

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:09.300
to alter certain events but, for Lao Tzu,
we remain free to choose our attitude towards

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.279
them, and it is in an unprotesting acceptance
of what is truly necessary that we find the

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:24.509
distinctive serenity and freedom characteristic
of a Daoist. FIVE: Bamboo as Wisdom East Asia

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.919
has been called the Bamboo Civilization, not
merely because bamboo has been widely used

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.189
in daily life, but also because its symbolic
qualities have been described and celebrated

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:41.289
for hundreds of years in the philosophy of
Daoism. Bamboo is, surprisingly, classified

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:47.680
as a grass rather than a tree, yet it is tall
and strong enough to create groves and forests.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.960
Unlike a tree trunk, the stems of bamboo are
hollow, but its inner emptiness is a source

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.460
of its vigour. It bends in storms, sometimes
almost to the ground, but then springs back

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:05.509
resiliently. We should, says Lao Tzu, ‘become
as bamboo is.’ The greatest painter of bamboo

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:10.460
was the Daoist poet, artist and philosopher
Zheng Xie of the Qing Dynasty. Zheng Xie is

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.509
said to have painted eight hundred pictures
of bamboo forests and saw in them a perfect

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:21.259
model of how a wise person might behave. Beside
one pen and ink drawing of bamboo, he wrote

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:27.089
in elegant script: ‘Hold fast to the mountain,
take root in a broken-up bluff, grow stronger

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:32.599
after tribulations, and withstand the buffeting
wind from all directions’. It was a message

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:41.419
addressed to bamboo but meant, of course,
for all of us. SIX: Kintsugi Since the 16th

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.779
century, Zen Buddhist philosophy in Japan
has been alive to the particular beauty and

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:52.949
wisdom of things which have been repaired.
Kintsugi is a compound of two ideas: ‘Kin’

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:59.419
meaning, in Japanese, ‘golden’ and ‘tsugi’
meaning ‘joinery’. In Zen aesthetics,

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.240
the broken pieces of an accidentally-smashed
pot should never just be tossed away, they

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.240
should be carefully picked up, reassembled
and then glued together with lacquer inflected

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.560
with a luxuriant gold powder. There should
be no attempt to disguise the damage, the

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.520
point is to render the fault-lines beautiful
and strong. The precious veins of gold are

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.309
there to emphasise that breaks have a rich
merit all of their own. It’s a profoundly

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:30.849
poignant idea because we are all in some way
broken creatures. It’s not shameful to need

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:36.899
repair; a mended bowl is a symbol of hope
that we too can be put together again and

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.800
still be loved despite our evident flaws.
