00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.720
Gravity affects us in ways we didn’t expect.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.550
We know this by observing frogs.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.430
That’s right, frogs.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.430
Hi all.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.800
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News, and I wanted to chat a little about

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.640
a frog named Xenopus Laevis and a force called
gravity.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.249
The Xenopus is also known at the African clawed
frog and biologists have been astonished by

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.800
how big its cells are.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.579
On average, animal cells on Earth are around
10 microns wide, but the Xenopus cells are

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.970
much, much larger.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.050
If a human cell was the size of a house, a
Xenopus cell would be the size of the Empire

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.080
State Building!

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.150
Why is there such a wild size difference?

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.420
In a new study published in Nature Cell Biology,
researchers studied the architecture of the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.190
cells found inside Xenopus eggs.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.330
These huge cells are markedly different from
human cells in that they contain many membrane-less

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.370
compartments inside the nucleus.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.640
These compartments are liquid-like drops filled
with RNA and proteins known as “nuclear

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.640
bodies.”

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.470
In human cells, these nuclear bodies are supported
by membranes that provide structure, preventing

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.100
them from turning to mush.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.520
But with few membranes to support the nuclear
bodies inside Xenopus cells, why doesn’t

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.939
gravity take over, causing all the stuff inside
the nucleus to sink to the bottom?

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.610
There must be something countering this gravitational
effect.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.130
After injecting a magnetized microscopic bead
into one of the cells, the researchers were

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.280
able to exert a magnetic field on that bead
and observe how it moved.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.479
They found that the bead (and nuclear bodies)
were being held in place by a web of proteins

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.250
known as an “actin mesh”.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.869
When the magnetic field was switched off,
the bead returned to its original position

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.320
as if it were embedded inside a cube of Jello.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.599
As a space scientist I’ve always been fascinated
by how the space environment can impact biology

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.210
-- simply removing the force of gravity in
experiments on the International Space

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.329
Station has led to breakthroughs in medicine,
cell growth and developments in new therapies

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.380
for disease.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.630
But as demonstrated by this little frog, Nature
has a few tricks up its sleeve to mimic a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.759
gravity-less environment inside the Xenopus
cells, thereby boosting its size, making it

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.549
more durable and more adept at supporting
life.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.429
Wouldn’t it be cool if we could develop
this microscopic mesh for industrial purposes,

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.009
maybe it would make a good shock absorber?

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.009
Who knows!

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.630
What do you think we could learn from this
fascinating research?
