HOST: Hi everybody.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you for joining
us in our--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.280
oh.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.590
Thank you.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.420
Thank you.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.100
Not your first cooking
demo here.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.580
But the first one since
I've been here in the

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.270
last couple of months.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.730
So thank you guys for coming
out and joining us.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.870
I'm super excited about our
guest Jason Neroni, our

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.470
neighbor from Superba Snack
Bar just down the street.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.610
If you guys haven't got a chance
to stop in, I think

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.960
after you taste this gnocchi
today, you're definitely going

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.930
to be going down there
to check it out.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.400
Jason has been all over
the place, literally.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.920
And I'm not going read
you the laundry list.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.240
But we can name Alice Waters
and Chez Panisse.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.060
He's been to El Bulli.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.600
He spent many years with Alan
Ducasse all over the world.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.770
Paris, Morocco, and parts
unknown, most likely.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.010
He was part of the
opening team for

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.370
Spago with Chef Hefner.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.960
And he has taken all that
knowledge and all his travels,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.386
brought it to our neighborhood,
and brought it

00:00:50.386 --> 00:00:52.590
to you here, today, at Google.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.710
So, without any further ado,
Chef Jason Neroni of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.230
Superba Snack Bar.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.820
JASON NERONI: Hi, guys.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.040
How are you?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.180
Thanks for coming.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.530
This demo won't be too long.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.115
I know some of you either have
to go back to work and/or have

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:13.010
a lunch at the restaurant
at noon.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.660
So this is a little preview
introduction.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.120
Some of you have not
been to Superba.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.010
We're right up the street
between Fifth and Sixth.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.870
At Dimic--

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.040
5 and 1/2 whatever you
want to call it.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.840
We are a pasteria, first and
foremost, with snacks as well.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.020
We make all of our pastas
in-house, as well as

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.620
everything else.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.280
Salumi.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.890
We go to the farmers'
market probably

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.190
about five days a week.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.800
We are very local, very
fresh, very seasonal.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.410
Menu changes all the time.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.970
Quite literally, like, five or
six things this week, with

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.190
more coming.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.855
We always look for whatever's
available.

00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:54.990
And whatever's not goes away.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.460
Today I'm doing a
gnocchi dish.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.970
A lot of people look at a
gnocchi, and they're like, oh,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.540
it's so tedious.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.240
It's really hard.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.680
Oh my god.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.200
I can't make it.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.930
They go and they buy this stuff
at the stores that's

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.740
like rubber band balls that
you boil in water.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.810
But I'll show you today, it's a
very, very simple, very easy

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.230
process to get through
with this.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.820
It's probably no more than
four ingredients, and

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.055
shouldn't take you more than
an hour to put together, if

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:24.340
you ever have the time.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.740
So what you always want
to start off with

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.050
is some russet potatoes.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.190
You can always make a
fair amount of this.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.590
And you can freeze it.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.150
Put it bags.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.380
It will hold for at
least a week.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.640
Smaller ones I like to use.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.470
Not the larger ones, if you
guys ever do do that.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.260
Because the larger tend to
overcook on the outsides,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.760
versus the smaller ones, which
you get a perfectly

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.080
consistency all the
way through.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.470
The smaller ones are usually
younger, which means there's

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.050
more moisture content in them,
which is better for what we're

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.620
looking for for we
roll these out.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.880
So we bake them on
a bed of salt--

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.430
kosher salt, more
specifically--

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.510
to draw out the moisture.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.890
Moisture and gnocchi are good
and bad in two different ways.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.360
We're adding flour for
binding, and eggs.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.100
But too much moisture will
give you a gummy dough.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.630
You cook these potatoes
at about 350 to 400,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.510
depending on your oven.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.150
We do it with a fan on.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.990
Some of you probably have
dry ovens at home.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.120
It just depends.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.410
Convection is the one,
specifically,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.280
that I'm talking about.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.610
It makes the potatoes cook
faster and more even.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.710
You want to cook them not like
you would make a baked potato.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.450
You cook them so that they're
just barely falling out.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.680
You don't want potato skins
that you're going to stuff

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.470
later with cheddar cheese
and bacon bits.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.140
You can always save them
for that if you want.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.340
Just so that they're
nice and soft.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.510
You can always re-use use
the salt as well.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.370
And this takes about 45 minutes
to an hour at maximum,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.620
like I said.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.570
Gloves, I would say, are
appropriate, unless you like

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:10.820
burning your hands.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.510
If you do not have one of these
amazing machines in

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.350
front of me, which are called
potato ricers, you could

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:19.399
always buy--

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.019
you've probably seen it
at the stores before.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.660
You can put the potatoes in.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.160
Your mom probably used it a
couple of times to make the

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.090
mashed potatoes when
you were a kid.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.720
That will work just as fine.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.380
I wouldn't suggest using
anything else because you

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.870
won't obtain the light,
fluffiness and airiness that

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.780
you're trying to attain
in order to make this.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.780
I've seen gnocchi
made a million

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.660
different ways in the world.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.970
Most specifically, when I
learned to make it in Italy,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.200
the woman who showed me boiled
her potatoes to hell.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.440
Peeled them, put them in a pot,
and then mashed them down

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.310
into almost a paste.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.110
And then added flour to them
until they became these fairly

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.910
light, surprisingly
enough, balls.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.350
Working in a restaurant
environment and looking for

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.130
consistency, I found this
to be the best way.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.370
Each chef, though, will always
tell you, there's a million

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.940
different ways to Sunday
to make them, though.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.640
My personal opinion is the
best way is this way.

00:05:20.997 --> 00:05:22.247
Almost done.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.550
So this makes about--

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.900
as you see my demo tray up
here-- it makes about this

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.530
much each time.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.680
Which is enough to feed
about a family of 10.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.600
So that's about 20 potatoes.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.170
You can cut this in
half by about 10.

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.890
I try not to make it much
smaller than that, because the

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.720
density and the amount of
egg you put into it.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.140
Once you have that out, this
should be nice and fluffy.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.810
Also, to test if they're
actually cooked all the way

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.700
through, just stick a fork in
it, just like the old saying

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.610
goes, if you're not sure.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.310
Again, you don't want to
cook them too much.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.120
And then I just like to put my
hands in them, aerate them a

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.820
little bit.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.030
You don't want to mix these
when they're too hot.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.040
Otherwise, they become
very gummy.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.685
So I just try to--

00:06:33.685 --> 00:06:35.777
AUDIENCE: If we don't have
something like that, what

00:06:35.777 --> 00:06:37.410
about a food processor?

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.110
JASON NERONI: Food processor
will not work.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.740
It will activate the
starch in there.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.520
You just basically want to break
the potatoes apart to

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.550
aerate them, so that the flour
will actually bind to the rice

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.330
bits that come off of it.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.180
Like I say, you can buy a $10
potato ricer, probably at

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:03.880
Surface or Sur La Table,
or one of those places.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.780
That would be my highest
suggestion.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.470
They have smaller versions of
this that you can find.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:13.680
But these are about
$100 at a store.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.600
For that professional chef at
home, I highly suggest.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.090
All right so these are cooled
off a fair amount.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:33.050
Two eggs, one of which you need
the whole and the other

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.300
one you need just the yolk.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.635
Salt.

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:49.620
Be generous.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.570
Those goes your caloric intake
for the day, I know.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.780
And about two cups of flour.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.380
Now, people always say, oh,
well, it's a recipe.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.160
It should always be the same.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.580
It's not.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.990
It's never the same.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.860
It's close, but it's never
exactly the same.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.820
Potatoes have different starch
contents, different water

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.500
contents, it's about two cups.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.340
Could be less.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.240
Could be more.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.070
So the best way to do this
is to start with less.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.220
I know that my hand holds about
a cup of flour, after

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.550
making this recipe about
50 million times.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.510
And again, if you ever go to
the store and you buy these

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.225
things, this is two
cups right here.

00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:30.840
When I do it at the restaurant,
I measure out

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.440
exactly two cups.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.050
And I would say 95% of
the time, it works.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.000
Now, when you do it, you don't
want to push down and crush

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.250
the potatoes.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.460
The idea is--

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.760
I'll give you guys
a little example.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.460
I'm pushing my fingers
into it like this.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.480
It's just barely pushing them
into each other, but you're

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.030
not forcing the situation.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.260
You're giving it a light toss.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.630
And you'll start to see
it slowly start to

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.880
come together in lumps.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.180
Once you see that, then
you can start

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:12.000
to push them together.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.285
And they start to bind
together other.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.410
Now there should be moisture
there, but they

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.230
should not be wet.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.540
That's the most important
part.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.770
So the best way I always like
to try to do it, I take my

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:26.450
hand off and I feel it.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.470
If anybody wants to actually
stand up and feel what it

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:31.860
might actually feel like, I
invite you to come try that

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.310
right now, before
I roll it out.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:37.480
Anybody want to feel them?

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.260
Now like I said, that
was two cups.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:40.720
And I'm going to--

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
eat this afterwards.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.780
JASON NERONI: That's OK.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.605
We're going to cook them.

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:45.855
Feel it.

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:51.040
AUDIENCE: So that's
about right?

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.180
JASON NERONI: What I always say,
it should sound like a

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.430
basketball.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.900
It should have a little bit of
an echo to it for density.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.720
But feeling this right now,
it's still a little wet.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.680
I can feel it.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.860
There's too much moisture
on here.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.980
I need to have a little
more binding to it.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.780
So again, we're going to put
a little bit more flour.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.570
I'm going to push my fingers
into it like so.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.800
Again, I'm not overly
mashing them.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.750
Fold them on top.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.640
It's all about folding.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.420
Just like if you're
making bread.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.350
You're just folding.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.600
Not rushing the situation.

00:10:26.906 --> 00:10:29.900
AUDIENCE: It's two cups,
so about how much egg?

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.560
JASON NERONI: For this?

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.630
This was about 20 potatoes.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.070
So you could about one cup.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.620
So about one cup per
10 potatoes.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:43.810
One egg per 10 potatoes.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.600
You don't want to--

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.235
I've seen recipes with
too many eggs.

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:52.990
The egg is acting just as a
vessel, as an emulsifier.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.350
You don't need too much.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.210
It's more about potato than
it is about the flour.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:04.890
Generously and liberally
flour your surface.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.900
At point, you probably want
to get rid of your gloves.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:15.940
There's your dough.

00:11:18.465 --> 00:11:19.715
Ah, yes.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.290
Can everybody see it?

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.310
I know the people over there
can't see it too well, but--

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.190
I cover it with just
a bit more flour.

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.286
Now--

00:11:37.286 --> 00:11:39.480
yes.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.495
I like to cover them so that
they don't dry out, and keep

00:11:43.495 --> 00:11:45.020
it like that while I
roll out the dough.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.120
That way they don't dry out.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.580
They still say nice and warm.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.480
They're still pliable.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.680
They don't cool off too much.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.550
Because if they get too
cold, then they

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.800
start to break apart.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.950
If they're too hot, they
start to break apart.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.890
What you're really looking for,
specifically, is a medium

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.360
temperature.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.610
Slightly warm.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.620
I always say to my cooks,
never break off more

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.140
than you can chew.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:09.380
Specifically when you
break this off.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.180
Because you don't need to be
like a Food Network show.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.540
You don't have to have the
gnocchi from here there.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:18.550
You just want to have
a little amount.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:24.500
Now when it comes to rolling,
what you're basically doing is

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.190
crimping these potatoes down.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.650
You push them together
in such a fashion.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.530
If you guys have ever made
cookie dough, you might

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.090
understand what I'm
talking about.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.450
You're just crimping them
down, and slowly--

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.520
You're basically letting
the potato do all

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.670
the work for you.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.040
Like any good cooking equipment,
or any good thing

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.310
in cooking, the product should
do the work for you.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.630
Especially if you're working
with a good product.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.770
Like good pizza ovens or
good pasta machines.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.790
So once you have it out--

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.920
again, like I said you don't
have to bite off more

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.170
than you can chew.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.840
You have a nice little dough
ball right there.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.610
Take your knife.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.820
I always say to measure about
half a thumb in length.

00:13:34.404 --> 00:13:36.180
And yes, you have
to go that fast.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.250
There are different ways
people do these.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.610
You've probably seen in
a million restaurants.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.660
We do it at our restaurant
as well.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.800
You can do this with
any at-home--

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.070
we call them the
sauce catcher.

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.300
This is why you're in
a restaurant, like,

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.780
why do they do that?

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.400
When you see them go like this,
and they have the little

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.205
indentations on the
back of them.

00:13:58.205 --> 00:14:00.930
It's because when you toss them
in the sauce, you want

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.752
the sauce and everything to
catch on to the pasta.

00:14:03.752 --> 00:14:05.610
The Italians do that more
than the French.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.340
I don't know why.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.380
I find most French people
like to do that.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.250
Preferential treatment.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.050
You can also put dimples
in them, as so.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.930
All the way down.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.760
And that's also a good way of
sauce catching if you don't

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.740
feel comfortable enough with
rolling them off the back of a

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.000
fork or the front of a fork.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.160
I'm going to put these up here
for you guys to try.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:36.220
Or to feel, at least, when
you have a hot moment.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.310
That's pretty much
that part of it.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:44.520
Through the magic of TV, once
you've blanched your gnocchi,

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.560
which only takes about 30
seconds-- since we are a

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.470
little technically challenged
on the set of Google today--

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.355
you'll come up with these
beautiful gnocchi, watch I'll

00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:53.360
also let you feel as well.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.070
So you can see the difference
between those and those.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:59.320
OK?

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.680
We're going to make a very
simple sauce for this.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.610
A stale pot of water.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.480
There's this really amazing
book called "The French

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.370
Laundry Cookbook" where he
has a great section.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.200
And it's called big-pot
blanching.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.230
The bigger the pot, the better
for the smaller amount,

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.520
specifically with your green
vegetables and types of pasta.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.980
Because basically what
you're doing is

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.280
stopping the cooking process.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.190
And it's just sitting in tepid
water absorbing water, versus

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.210
cooking at a proper
temperature.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.770
We like to say sometimes,
salty as the sea in our

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:37.740
blanching water and
our cooking pasta.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.250
Because you're infusing the salt
directly into it as well.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.280
Just a little bit of butter.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.220
Just a little bit.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.430
I think you guys are going to
be ordering salads today at

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.880
the restaurant.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.790
A little bit of water, just for
emulsification purposes.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.090
Protein and the fat, as
you cook them down,

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.130
will start to emulsify.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.370
Once I blanch my gnocchi in the
restaurant, I never put it

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.540
back into the water.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.860
We definitely cook it directly
in the sauce specifically.

00:16:21.122 --> 00:16:23.560
AUDIENCE: After you blanch,
how long can it sit out?

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:29.470
JASON NERONI: You can hold these
for about a week in a

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.855
nice, dark, cool place.

00:16:35.598 --> 00:16:36.990
AUDIENCE: Did you not
refrigerate it?

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:37.340
JASON NERONI: No.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.230
Definitely refrigerate it.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:39.390
Sorry.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:41.070
I left that part out.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.600
Under a counter somewhere
in your house.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.840
Tepid 80 degrees would
be really amazing.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.700
Yes, refrigeration.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.500
A great trick, too, you can
learn is that, when you pull

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.190
them out of your blanching
water, make sure you drain off

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.530
the water all the way.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.410
As you'll see, there's
absolutely no water that comes

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.380
off of them.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.450
Because the water tends to leech
out a little bit more on

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:03.980
the bottom here.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.609
Which means your gnocchi will
tend to just sit in a pool of

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:08.609
water, which is not
good for them.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:10.230
They'll just continue
to absorb water.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.720
And they'll just become mushy.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.790
I like to take them out.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:14.250
I put them in a draining pan.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.520
I let them drain completely,
completely, completely, for a

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.190
couple of minutes, until all
the water you can tell is

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:19.890
completely dropped off.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.713
And then we add the
olive oil to them.

00:17:21.713 --> 00:17:23.510
Toss them in the olive oil.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.030
That way, that prevents
sticking.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.030
There's always going to be a
little bit of residual starch.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.050
That what's going to
keep them together.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.690
But you can see, these have been
together for, now, since

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.340
yesterday morning.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.660
You just give them a little bit
of move, and they start to

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.910
break apart.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:41.790
I've lost many, many batches
of gnocchi by people not

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.210
putting oil.

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.140
And you go to move it, and you
just turn it into a whole mush

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:46.880
of potatoes.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.870
And then you can pull out your
Cuisinart and turn them into

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.120
mashed potatoes.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.480
I'll add the cheese.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.930
And, like I said, just a
little bit of cheese.

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.390
And you're making what's
called a liaison.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.170
Which is basically an
emulsification of a sauce.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:14.043
Here we just have cheese,
water, and butter.

00:18:14.043 --> 00:18:15.310
AUDIENCE: How much?

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.354
JASON NERONI: A good handful.

00:18:17.354 --> 00:18:18.330
AUDIENCE: What kind?

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:18.460
JASON NERONI: Oh.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.662
Parmesan.

00:18:19.662 --> 00:18:20.060
Sorry.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.750
Parmesan or Reggiano,
two years aged is

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.362
traditionally the best.

00:18:25.362 --> 00:18:27.310
At least, we use.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.290
Accept no imitations.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.540
A little bit of salt.

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:35.180
We like fresh pepper.

00:18:51.738 --> 00:18:53.226
Put a couple more.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.790
And I expect you to be able to
toss them like that, too.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.070
OK?

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.546
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:21.720
JASON NERONI: So these
are pretty much done.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.310
A little bit of parsley
for a little bit of

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.560
fresh herb at the end.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.070
You guys want to try it?

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.950
No.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.390
And that's it.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:51.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.140
JASON NERONI: I'll make another
batch for those who

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.390
want seconds.
