00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is velocity.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We said before the ball goes up, up, up, up and then stops for a brief instant.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Stopping means at this point in the trajectory, the velocity is equal to 0.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That's a trick we're going to have to use pretty frequently

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
when we're solving these sorts of problems.
