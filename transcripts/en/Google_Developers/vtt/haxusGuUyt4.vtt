00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.500
Hello.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.570
My name is Kathy
Pham, and I am here

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.690
to tell you about
my story, "Falling

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.280
in Love with Computer Science."

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.200
It all started in high school.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.220
I didn't know what
programming was.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.540
I had no idea what
computer science was,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.960
but I had a great
geometry teacher

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.830
who decided to bring programming
to our school that year.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.750
Thanks, Mrs. Strife.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.040
She came up to me
and basically asked

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.900
if I wanted to
take a programming

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.420
class my senior year.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.530
And I figured, oh a computer
class-- easy thing to do.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.250
I will just cruise on
by, have one easy class

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.810
for my senior year
before graduation.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.170
It wasn't super easy,
but it turned out

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.310
I completely loved programming.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.200
I loved building a
program to write up

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.490
a receipt where I
entered information

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.200
like apples and
oranges and tax rate,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.470
and it printed out a receipt
that is completely customized

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.530
to what I want it to be.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.121
And from that
moment, I knew there

00:00:57.121 --> 00:00:58.870
was something about
this programming thing

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.360
that I really enjoyed.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.790
So when I went to college
next year at Georgia Tech,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.940
I had to pick a major.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.295
I had no idea what I
should do and figured,

00:01:07.295 --> 00:01:10.110
you know what, I'll just
pick computer science

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.980
and I can always
change it later.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.910
Turns out I really, really
enjoyed my first year.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.170
The class is in Scheme,
similar to Pascal.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.180
No one had heard
of Scheme either,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.600
and it was just this language
with lots of parentheses.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.040
I loved it, nonetheless.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.120
I loved the way it made
me think logically,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.870
and I just loved
writing functions

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.970
that can do what I told it to.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.980
So then I continued to really
fall in love with the College

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.270
of Computing at Georgia Tech.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.090
I loved staying up
studying late at night.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780
I became a student
ambassador for Google

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.830
and brought pizza to all
of our study sessions.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.930
I loved my professors, advisors,
the classes and really just

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.950
had a great time.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.710
But it wasn't always easy.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.990
I had a really hard
time my freshman year.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.560
I put up a PuTTy screen
here because I remember

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.440
a moment when during class
the teaching assistant taught

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.630
us to go home and log into one
of the College of Computing

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.130
servers.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.046
I didn't really know
what a server was, didn't

00:02:13.046 --> 00:02:14.280
know what a terminal was.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.770
I just had no idea what
he was talking about

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.950
and just remember thinking,
oh, man, this isn't for me.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.490
And I had a great TA
that had me install PuTTy

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.130
and showed me how to
SSH into a terminal,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.410
and it was great after that.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.950
But that really drove me to be
a teaching assistant, as well,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.070
so I could help other
freshman students

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.690
who came to the College of
Computing a little confused

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.340
like I was.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.230
So that was also a lot of fun.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.680
After that during my
time at Georgia Tech,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.230
I explored lots of
different things.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.699
I knew I was interested in
health care to the point

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.990
where I actually was taking
pre-med classes-- thought I

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.550
might want to go to med school.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.410
And I thought, well, you know
I should explore everything

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.930
and had a research assistantship
at a microarray bioinformatics

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.680
lab at Georgia Tech.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.350
And I fell in love
with the idea of using

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.590
data and bioinformatics to do
something good for the world.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.040
So that led to an
internship at Google.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.100
I interviewed for
a summer internship

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.450
as an associate product
manager at Google.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.930
One of my interviewers
had asked,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.890
tell me just something that
isn't really on your resume

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.524
that you just really care about.

00:03:23.524 --> 00:03:24.940
So I started talking
about my love

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.750
for health care, that
I had done some work

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.751
in this microarray lab,
really liked bioinformatics.

00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:32.750
I didn't think it had
anything to do with Google

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.030
because Google did search
and maps and email.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.040
And turns out they were looking
for someone for Google Health

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.140
that summer.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.210
So I spent the summer
with some of these interns

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.840
here and really absolutely
loved learning more

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.250
about computer science
and data and just learning

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.640
how it all can tie
together in health care.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.690
So I loved computer
science so much

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.300
that I decided to stay
for a master's program.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.350
I flew over to Paris, France.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.200
And I had a great excuse to tell
my mom I was doing something

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.770
with my life but really go live
and enjoy my time in France

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.230
while getting a
computer science degree.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.880
The university was actually
in this beautiful city

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.740
called Metz, a little
outside of Paris.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.720
And I had my computer
science program

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.960
jointly with Supelec,
a French university.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.400
I learned conversational
French, learned to absolutely

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.990
love and embrace the
French culture and food,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.280
met some wonderful
friends, and also

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.335
had an internship at INRIA,
a French research institute.

00:04:38.335 --> 00:04:40.620
So I had a wonderful time there.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.880
Near the end of my time
as a graduate student,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.820
I had an opportunity
to participate

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.920
in the Microsoft Imagine Cup.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.390
That's basically the World Cup.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.150
But instead of for
soccer, it's for nerds.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.430
And it's held in a
different city every year.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.630
I found a partner to enter
with me into this competition,

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.030
and we actually ended
up with the first place

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.470
in the Microsoft Imagine Cup and
had a wonderful time building

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.820
a tool to address one of the
United Nations Millennium

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.420
Development Goals.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.880
So after I graduated, I
had to figure out something

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.400
to do with my life
in the real world.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.710
I got a wonderful
opportunity to go live along

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.290
the Space Coast of Florida
and work at Harris Healthcare

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.540
Solutions, finding
ways to use software

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.820
to find solutions for some
of the hospital problems

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:30.490
that we have today.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.850
And what that also meant
was that I saw many rocket

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.690
launches, I learned
to surf, and I

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.330
got to live along the
Space Coast of Melbourne

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.570
and just really enjoy
wonderful, beachy lifestyle.

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.810
But I missed the big city.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.780
So I had an opportunity then
to become a business consultant

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.030
for IBM, building and
testing data warehouses

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.720
for hospital clients around the
country in many cool cities.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.910
One of my fondest
memories while I did this

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.290
was when I ran my first
ever half marathon.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.590
I trained for my first
ever half marathon

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.190
with my team that was in
Nashville with me at the time

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.170
while I was living in Orlando.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.620
So I had a lot of fun times
flying around with IBM.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.450
However, it wasn't
always fun times.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.080
There were times
when I was delayed,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.680
late nights on Thursdays.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.240
This is a photo of when I was
snowed in in Roanoke, Virginia

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.170
one time.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.580
And I really just
missed my family

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.560
after flying around for so long.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.300
So I found a new role.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.930
At that time, Google was
hiring for a data analyst role.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.150
So I came back to Google.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.260
So I'm currently a data analyst
for our staffing and hiring

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.837
and all the people data.

00:06:39.837 --> 00:06:41.670
But before I actually
could start at Google,

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:44.630
my mom was diagnosed
with leukemia.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.510
And I never thought
that everything

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.680
I had learned with computer
science, with health care,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.560
with program management, with
consulting, with learning

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.241
to just fly around on
last minute's notice

00:06:58.241 --> 00:07:00.740
would really prepare me for one
the important roles I'd ever

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.930
have in my life.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.060
And that was be a patient
advocate for my mom

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.150
during her battle with leukemia.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.160
She was diagnosed last
year in August 2013,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.760
and I'm happy to
say that she had

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.690
her last round of chemo
on October 6-- one year

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.500
and two months after diagnosis.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.530
Hurray!

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.030
So that gives me time
to go back to Google

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.880
and continue my love affair
with computer science,

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.380
focusing on data.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.150
I also do things like Girls Who
Code on the side and support

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.400
our K through 12
initiatives, in addition

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.230
to working with our business
intelligence community

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.950
here at Google.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.100
So what's really
started out as a chance

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.920
encounter in high school has
turned into many academic,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.710
personal, and professional
adventures of computer science

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.320
I don't know what
the future holds,

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.290
but I'm excited to
continue this adventure.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.750
And I hope that your passions
and love for whatever field

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.120
you decide to join-- and
maybe it is one related

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.780
to science, technology,
engineering, or math--

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.280
will take you on many
great adventures as well.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.020
Thank you.
