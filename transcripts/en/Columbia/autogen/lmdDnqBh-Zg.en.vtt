00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 align:start position:0%
recycled because we can make more of it
 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.909 align:start position:0%

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
because it's essentially solar and
 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
because it's essentially solar and

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 align:start position:0%
organic in its in its orientation
 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.590 align:start position:0%
organic in its in its orientation
so<00:04:27.410><c> that's</c><00:04:27.590><c> material</c><00:04:28.190><c> intensity</c><00:04:28.669><c> the</c><00:04:29.210><c> second</c>

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
so that's material intensity the second
 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.110 align:start position:0%
so that's material intensity the second
area<00:04:29.840><c> is</c><00:04:30.020><c> energy</c><00:04:30.710><c> intensity</c><00:04:31.310><c> and</c><00:04:31.490><c> this</c><00:04:31.940><c> is</c>

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
area is energy intensity and this is
 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.050 align:start position:0%
area is energy intensity and this is

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 align:start position:0%
expressed as BTUs per unit it's a
 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.089 align:start position:0%
expressed as BTUs per unit it's a
