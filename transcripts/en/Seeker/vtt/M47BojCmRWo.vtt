00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.130
I still remember it…

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.330
I dipped the tines of a fork into the chocolate
mousse.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.160
A tiny bit of the dessert hung from the ends
of my utensil, only a few millimeters, but

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.460
I put it in my mouth and BANG.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.460
The flavor!

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.460
The richness!

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.360
I'll never forget that moment, and now science
knows why!

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.840
Hey, sweeties.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.339
A 2013 survey of eating behavior found snacks
are contributing more and more to the American

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:24.339
diet.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.599
But, a 2014 study in Hepatology found snacking
on high-fat and high-sugar foods in-between

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.320
meals contributes to obesity and fatty liver!

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.960
Eating three meals a day has roots back to
ancient Greece -- and snacking between those

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.930
meals can be unhealthy, especially when people
completely forget about their meals in the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.300
first place.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.270
"How could you forget a meal," you cry!

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.270
Simple.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.270
You're eating wrong.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.790
When we eat certain things or in certain ways,
our brains create 'food memories,' which live

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.850
in our episodic memory.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.760
Episodic memory is part of long-term memory
storage, part of the everyday autobiography

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.110
of our lives.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.230
Episodic memories can be recalled at will,
and are things like your wedding day and where

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.869
you were on 9/11, or maybe that great joke
you shared with your roommate in college,

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.920
a car crash, or when you climbed that mountain,
bungee jumped, or your first kiss!

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.740
According to a new study in the journal Hippocampus,
eating sweet foods triggers that episodic

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.740
memory; and let me tell you, that chocolate
mousse was a moment!

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.040
The researchers believe episodic memory could
be used to control eating habits, because

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.569
when people eat absentmindedly, while watching
TV or reading, they don't form food memories,

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:37.889
and we eat more than we should, or eat more
often -- or we snack between meals.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:43.689
A study in PLOS One from 2012 describes why
this is: feeling hungry isn't just physical,

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.020
it's also mental!

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.429
They wanted to see if our perception of how
much we ate changes how we feel about when

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:50.709
we eat again!

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:51.709
Their study showed people

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:58.549
specific amounts of soup 300 mL or 500mL and
then, while they ate, covertly sucked soup

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.479
out of the participants bowls, or added some
in!

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.100
Basically, people who thought they ate 500mL
(but actually ate less) still felt fuller!

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.000
Whereas those who thought they'd eaten 300mL
(but had actually eaten more) got hungry more

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
quickly.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.440
We humans are big dumb animals, aren't we!

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.300
Our perceptions and our episodic 'food memories'
have a huge impact on how and when we eat

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.200
and how hungry we feel.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.860
So when you say, "no thanks, I had a big breakfast"
according to these researchers from Hippocampus,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.830
you are actually recalling your last episodic
'food memory' and determining if you're hungry!

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.900
Why do sweets trigger this?

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.500
I'm no evolutionary psychologist, but I'd
guess it has something to do with finding

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.980
sugar in a natural environment being a rarity
-- similarly to our affinity for salts and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:46.980
fats.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.950
So if creating a solid memory of a meal, will
help us eat LESS, should we just eat a sweet

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.990
and remember we ate?

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.290
Not necessarily.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.250
The researchers are using this as a platform
for further research on episodic memory and

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.020
proteins, fats and carbohydrates.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.900
If you're looking for guidance while they
complete their research, simply be mindful

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.550
of your eating habits.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.270
Research from 2011 in the journal Appetite
found, when people were offered cookies, those

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.100
who were asked to think about the flavor,
texture and smell of their food ate fewer

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.190
than those who were reading, and way less
than those who were watching television.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.190
And when offered more later, the television
group ate more than the group who were asked

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.820
to consider their meals.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.640
Nailing it home even more, the lead researcher
on this study added the example of amnesic

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.640
patients.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.800
They can't remember what they've just eaten,
so if you bring them more food "they will

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.800
keep on eating!"

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.310
So, perhaps the key to forming a 'food memory'
is to pay attention while eating, so you form

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.400
solid "food memories."

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.200
Then you'll feel fuller, eat less and manage
a healthy diet.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:57.120
And maybe end your meal with a tiny little
sweet.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:05.240
Just 
a little one.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.650
Maybe.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.270
What's your favorite dessert?

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.040
Tell me in the comments.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.569
I love pecan pie.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.569
It's…

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.572
OMG so good.
