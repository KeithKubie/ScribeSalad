00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.410
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.640
&gt;&gt; Next we have Tahir Hemphill,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.830
an award-winning multimedia
artist working in the areas

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.080
of interdisciplinary collaboration,
thought, and research.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.260
He's planned business strategy
in the entertainment, advertising

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.190
and non-profit industries.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.180
He also produces art and
media arts education programs

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.970
and manages the Rap Research Lab.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.350
He's going to share a story about
how visualizing rap lyrics helps

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.240
to teach data literacy
to high school students.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.540
Tahir, you're up.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.370
&gt;&gt; Tahir Hemphill: My
name is Tahir Hemphill.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.800
I am a artist, educator,
radical archivist,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.840
and a creative technologist.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.050
And I'm going to talk about my
projects at the Rap Research Lab.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.560
My practice investigates
the role that systems play

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.800
in a generational form,
and also the role

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.270
that collaborative
knowledge production plays

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.990
in the resilience of communities.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.800
So the slides that I'm going to go

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.480
through today will fit
in those two areas.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.500
So the system that I developed --

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.010
the one system that I
developed is the Rap Almanac.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.970
And it's an online
searchable database,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.060 position:56%
and it contains the natural language
processing of tons of hip-hop songs.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.310
Right now, there are about 25,
30 artists, about a quarter

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.170 position:56%
of a million songs, and this is some

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.280
of the data analytics
associated with the songs.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.340
So in a database, we have artist
name, song title, the album title,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.240
geo location -- everything
is geo-tagged --

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.080
and has release dates
for all of the songs.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.600
And some of the syntax analysis
is the word count, reading level,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.150
rhyme density, and this rhyme
analysis that will tell you

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.620
if what you're reading
is a perfect rhyme.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.000
And also it tells you where the
rhymes fit within the lines.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.010
And the sentiment analysis
covers sentiment,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.710
keywords, people, and places.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.890
And this is what a search
in the database looks like.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.230
In this case, the user
typed in "power."

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.410
And then you get back this wall of
data -- song title, album title.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.140
And then you can add these
advanced search options.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.870
In this case, they're
adding sentiment and people,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.250
syllables per word,
and redoing the search.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.370
And he most exciting
part about this, well,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.910
besides the YouTube view is the
fact that you can press a button

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.630
and get a machine-readable output
and a human readable output.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.930
So you can export to
CSV and export to JSON.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.330
And it took a long time
to get to that point.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:16.020
It seems really small but I was
ecstatic when we got to that point.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.720
So, what the database gives us is
a new context for hip-hop, right.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.510
So there's content,
there's a location tagged

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.870
to the content, and there's a time.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.710 position:56%
So for every utterance in hip-hop
there's a time and a place on earth.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.420
You can do, in that example,
the search for "power,"

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.960
and find every rapper
that rapped about power,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.170
where in the world they rapped
about power, when they rapped

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.410
about power, and the context.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.190
So it's a big data rap project.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:52.350 position:56%
So I'm going to go through a few
slides of examples of visualization.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.690
So one of the first things I
did immediately was to just

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.530 position:56%
to dump all of this in Google Earth.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.150
And what you're looking at is,

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.430
or what you just saw was
Staten Island rappers.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.250
And now you're looking at Brooklyn
rappers, and then Queens rappers.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.320
So the project maps the geography
of the language of hip-hop.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.530
So you can find out how slang
travels, where slang originates,

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.200
how it travels, how each region
influences other regions.

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.630
And that can be done for slang,
that can be done for politics,

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.840
that can be done for
many other things.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.110
Another data vis, early
data vis that I worked on,

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.790
looked at champagne-brand mentions
in hip-hop from 1980 to 2010.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.120
And of course, it's like
it's quaint, it's funny.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.090
Like, you know, there's -- we
all have an image of rappers

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.760
and champagne use, right?

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.440 position:56%
But if you also look at -- that
image that we get from music videos.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.450
But if you also look at champagne
as a aspirational product and times

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:14.530
for champagne use that are tied
to expressions of celebration

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:22.290
or expressions of wealth or the
fact that you want to pretend

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.700
like you have wealth,
then you can dig deeper

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.090
into the cultural meanings
of champagne and rap.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:38.520
This is a network graph that I
made that looks at contemporary

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.280
and modern painters that
are mentioned in rap.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.040
And Jean-Michel Basquiat
became really popular recently

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.930
and it's called Picasso Baby.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.750
And again it shows these
connections, this different context

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:01.820
between rap lyrics and culture.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.880
And a recent -- well, a project

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.860
that I made last year
is called Spotify City,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.630
and it deals with virtuality.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:17.070 position:56%
So I had a residency at Spotify, and
what I did was look at the content

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.900
of the streams as a representation
of a listener's aspirations

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:28.360
and desires as revealed through
the music that they listen to.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.720
So the idea is that if
you're driving to work,

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.810
on your way to work, you're
probably not listening

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.000
to song about being at work.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.690
You're listening to a song about
being somewhere else at work,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:49.250
and how do we extract that
virtuality from streams?

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.710
This is a light pen drawing made

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:59.370
from a 20-foot-tall
industrial robot.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.610
So using the semantic analysis,
I extracted the locations

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.690
that are mentioned in 12
rappers' bodies of work,

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.410
from their first song to their
last song, and through --

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.380
I think it was like a 14-step
process, sent these codes

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.150
to a robot arm and put a light
pen in a robot arm's hand

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.410
and had the robot arm trace
the locations around the globe.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.240
In this case, it's Kanye West.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.390
This is a digital model of the
same thing that we are developing

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.210
into a VR educational piece.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:46.670
So the green paths are the
paths that the rappers --

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.800
the green paths are the
paths that the rap travels.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.880
And I wasn't satisfied with
just two-dimensional --

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.630
or I wasn't satisfied with
two-dimensional representations,

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:11.140
so I'm also producing data
sculpture of this work.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.840
And this is the suite
of all 12 rappers.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.180
And a lot of this work
is going to be exhibited.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.820
I'm having a solo show
at CCA in September.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.120
Everyone here is invited too.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.880
And I'm going to present this work.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.040
So the project visualizes hip-hop
lyrics as a cultural indicator.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:37.270
I mean, you can imagine overlaying
data sets, health data sets,

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:42.350 position:56%
crime statistic data sets, education
data sets down to a county level,

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.070
and overlaying those
with this data set.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:52.040
And this is data prahn [phonetic].

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.600
This is the analysis of --

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.940 position:56%
the semantic analysis of Drake's
entire body of work being processed.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.940
Cool, but data needs memory, right?

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:14.370
It's nice to have -- it's nice
to have pages and pages of data,

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.280
you know, whether it's machine
readable or human readable,

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.320
but in order to tell
a story with data,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:26.040
you kind of need an experience
tied to it to bring it to life.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.330
And it was this question
or these types of questions

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.520
that made me start
the Rap Research Lab.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.500
And especially like this question:
should a culture own its own data?

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.780
Like, who is responsible
for protecting this data?

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:44.200
Who is responsible for telling
the stories about this data?

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.360
Who is responsible for
checking the stories told

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.320
about this cultural data?

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.960
And even when technological
development advances its workers

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.520
into exciting new spaces of
creative inquiry, the opportunity

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.290
to challenge traditional modes
of hierarchy is often missed.

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.490
And most of the time, if there's
a new space open in science,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.260
we bring our same biases to these
open spaces; instead of trying

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.030
to do something new or
imagining something new,

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:17.750
we just [inaudible] our
old self to the new spaces.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.090
So in the age of big
data, normative narratives

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.340
around hip-hop reproduce
stereotypes.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.750
And also that -- for me that
also extends to the singularity

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.240
and artificial intelligence.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.500
Like, you know, the singularity
in a way is a colonizing process.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:44.110
It ignores what happens on
the sides and just focuses

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:48.010
on what works for the system.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:54.060 position:56%
So I founded the Rap Research Lab
to have a space and to invite people

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.220
to talk about these questions,
explore these questions

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.140
and grapple with these questions.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.500
And the Rap Research Lab is
a creative technology studio,

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.900
and we explore rap as a cultural
indicator through educational,

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.400
editorial, and creative
interrogations.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.470
I'm going to read a bit.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:16.130
We are a team of researchers,
radical educators, technologists,

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.990
and artists who use rap
as text through which

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.640
to better understand
popular and youth culture.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.200
We explore questions of social
justice and facilitate resilience

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.890
through community data projects.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:34.030
And we design projects and ask
questions both collaboratively

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.340
and individually that
challenge notions of ownership

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.880
and agency in these spaces.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.810
So just a few axioms,
rules off the top

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.600
that we believe at
the Rap Research Lab.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.870
One is rap is the most influential
global and youth art form, period.

00:11:54.870 --> 00:12:01.830
According to a Spotify analysis
of 20 billion streamed songs back

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:07.840 position:56%
in 2015, rap is the most popular,
most listened to genre in the world.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.660
According to a recent study,
rap is more popular than rock,

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.230
but we already knew that.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.870
I mean, rap has more words.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:24.580
Another axiom is hip-hop
isn't rap, graffiti, deejaying

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.620
and breakdancing; hip-hop
created rap, graffiti,

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.170
deejaying and breakdancing.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.210
So in the beginning
there was a deejay.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.510
There were no hip-hop records.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:39.500
So Kool Herc playing in
1973 in the Bronx, you know,

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.830
that's cited as the
first hip-hop party.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.150
There were no rap records.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.960
There were no hip-hop records.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.520
There were soul records,
there were funk records,

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.370
there were blues records,
there were rock records.

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.430
But what was hip-hop was the
way he played those records.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:57.190
So hip-hop is a framework,
and the framework

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.830
in which he played those records.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.480
And this is a quote from my
colleague David Goldberg.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.890
This framework is helpful.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.170
In a fragmented world, hip-hop
is an effective approach

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:14.900
to problem-solving, especially
when your future depends on rising

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.490
from the ruins of inherited
mistakes.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:23.850
So because of this
framework, we decided to teach.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:30.800
And this is a map of our
curriculum and our lesson plans.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:36.770
And we start with an
introduction, you know,

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:40.620
the history of the technology,
the history of the culture.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.340
And then we teach the students
how to roadmap their research.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.610
So we teach them how
to ask questions,

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.780
how to formulate good
research questions.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.770 position:56%
And then we have a content coding
exercise where we do closed readings

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.710 position:56%
of the lyrics and content code them.

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.010
This is analog.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.310
We also have a digital version.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.300
And then we teach the students how

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.020
to conduct a search,
how to use the tools.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.980
And then we deal with data bias,

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.060
like their own implicit
bias and then external bias.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.900
So how did they collect the data?

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.200
What did they leave out?

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.520
What was left out in
the initial process

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.970
of the data that they collected?

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.030
And how things fall
off along the way.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:35.980
And then we have some mapping
lessons and visualization lessons.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.420
So I'm going to read it again.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:46.200
So the methodologies in this
framework, we invite participants

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:50.060
to engage critically with
cultural research, data collection,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.660
data ethics, implicit bias, data
bias, and storytelling, right?

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.960
And these are the elements

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.370 position:56%
that ultimately empower the critical
thinking and decision making

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.590
that leads a citizen
to become more capable

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.000
of establishing informed positions.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.730 position:56%
This outcome not only influences
behavioral change but is a precursor

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.260
to developing and deploying
a healthy democracy,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.440
especially in this post-truth era.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:22.550
So we're dealing with data
literacy, media literacy,

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:28.980
and actually listening to
rap and having fun doing it.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:34.710
I'm making this sound so
boring, but it's really cool.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:42.340
So this is -- so the next three
slides, so in terms of development

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:46.790
and process, we piloted a few
years ago, then we scaled up.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:52.340
I invited teachers to
produce the curriculum with me

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:56.110
and then a third phase
was the spread.

00:15:56.110 --> 00:16:01.910
So this is my one-room school
house in the Bronx, South Bronx.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:09.750
And down on the bottom right, this
is a design sprint that we have

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:15.450
where we invited educators
in to test our curriculum.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:20.940 position:56%
And on the top right is actually the
graduation day where I invited some

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.580 position:56%
of my colleagues in the art and
tech world to come and give critique

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.750
and support to the students.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:33.570
Top left, that's a picture
of me waxing poetic.

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:38.020
And on the bottom left is one
of our content coding exercises

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.740
where we ask the students to
identify in this case five themes

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.370
that they think they'll
find in the music.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.410
In this case, it was body
sexuality, and then achievements,

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.020
and then relationships,
love, family,

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.650
and then conflict,
and origins, politics.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.170
And then we give them text and
then we ask them to content code.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:06.180
So every time they see one of these
themes, they tag it in the text.

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:14.360
And that's the analog process that
helps build algorithmic thinking.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.810
And then it's also modeled
in a digital process.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:19.110
And this is the scale.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.780
This is when we scaled up.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:27.420
And these are some of the
workshops we did in collaboration

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:30.400
with the Parks Department,
Eye Beam and Hive,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.120
Mozilla and Creative Capital.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.250 position:56%
And then the last phase that we just
finished last year was the spread

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.180
where we took our curriculum

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.430
and we trained New York City
Parks Department educators

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:46.200
to implement our curriculum in
ten locations, in five boroughs,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.970
for nine months around
New York City.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.320
And it was a trip.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:58.690
It was a trip to see students study
me and my process on their screen.

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.160 position:56%
But it was exciting to see that this
process could be spread and scaled

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.830
so I wouldn't have to
be the only one standing

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.180
in front of the classroom.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.800
And these are some of the
-- I'm going to look at two,

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.250
show you two student projects.

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:17.260
So we have a student research page.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:20.580
And one student, Gabriel, he
was interested in doing research

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.950
on the N word in hip-hop,
in all of hip-hop.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.330
And he quickly realized
that that was too much data

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.410
for him to process, right?

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.580
So he was kind of bummed
out, and I was like,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.370
"So what do you want to do?"

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.170
Then he realized in his research
that there was one artist

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:42.440
that had a song where he mentions
the N word like almost 200 times.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:48.790
So he decides to focus on that
artist and content code all

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:58.790 position:56%
of his songs through a lens of this
dictionary of slang that gives seven

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:02.400
or eight -- that gives eight
meanings of the N word.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.000 position:56%
So what you're seeing is a digital
content coding project from Gabriel.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.240
So these are the songs on his
dropdown menu, and on the right,

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.240
these are the different
descriptions.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.900
So a close friend, the black
experience, just a generic term,

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.600
someone's lover, someone
that's rebellious,

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.940
something that's disrespectful,
something that's negative,

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:30.670
and also just a filler, just to,
you know, to fill sonic space.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:35.530
This is the project by Emmanuel who
was reading some of the articles

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:42.190
about rappers and raps that would
be used as testimony in court.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.970
And he wanted to investigate
the differences, or whether

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:48.340
or not there was a difference
between crimes that were rapped

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.080
about and actually crimes
that were happening.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.490
So this is a map that he made.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:20:01.770
And you can see that there's -- I
mean, correlation and cause aren't,

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:09.770
you know, aren't tied,
but there's a difference.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.610
So when crime is down
basically crime raps are high.

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:20.290
And I'm going to close with
this one quote by DJ Premier,

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.230
and he's talking about producing
Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt album,

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.530
his first album.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.400 position:56%
And he says basically one thing he
loves about hip-hop is that you have

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.550
to understand how to listen to it.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.000
Just because Jay-Z is speaking

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.750
in English doesn't mean you
understand what he's saying.

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:42.230 position:56%
And that's the reason for the Rap
Research Lab, to do a deep dive into

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:48.790
and decoding the most
popular art form in the world.

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.590
Thank you.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.040
