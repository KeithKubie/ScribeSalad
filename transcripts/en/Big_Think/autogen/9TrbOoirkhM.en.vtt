this interesting puzzle much more shows
up for us then just what projects into

this and you take one of my fries and

this and you take one of my fries and
 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.690
this and you take one of my fries and
when I turn around I probably won't

when I turn around I probably won't
 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.610
when I turn around I probably won't
notice that anything is missing I don't

I didn't have that kind of a detailed

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450
I didn't have that kind of a detailed

I didn't have that kind of a detailed
internal representation of the plate

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610
internal representation of the plate
 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.880
internal representation of the plate
such that I can compare how the plate

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890
such that I can compare how the plate
 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.380
such that I can compare how the plate
looked before I turned away and how it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390
looked before I turned away and how it
 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.910
looked before I turned away and how it
looked when I turned back and notice a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920
looked when I turned back and notice a
 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.220
looked when I turned back and notice a
discrepancy but that's how our

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230
discrepancy but that's how our
 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.290
discrepancy but that's how our
experience is in general we find

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300
experience is in general we find
 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.940
experience is in general we find
