00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.099
Method acting isn’t a new technique, but
the idea of living the life of a character

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.680
in order to give an honest performance has
only gotten more popular in the last few decades.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.920
Some actors can take the technique a bit too
far, however, pushing the limits of both themselves

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.349
and those around them.

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.510
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Actors Who Almost
Went Crazy in Their Roles.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.250
Heath Ledger
Few actors have immersed themselves in a role

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.030
quite like Ledger did when he was tapped to
play Batman’s arch-nemesis, the Joker, back

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.030
in 2006.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.870
The actor locked himself away in a London
hotel room for a month, keeping a diary and

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.620
experimenting with various voices and mannerisms
until he’d come up with his ideal vision

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.809
of the character.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.829
The result was one of the greatest villainous
performances of all time, one that earned

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.389
him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2009.

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:54.129
Tragically, Ledger never got to see his work
on the big screen, dying of an accidental

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.149
prescription drug overdose the year prior.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.499
Rumors that the role drove him to suicide
or that he couldn’t leave the part behind

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:04.850
are probably exaggerating, but his last role
will always have movie fans talking.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.420
Robert De Niro
De Niro’s well-known for paying a dentist

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.130
several thousands of dollars to grind his
teeth down in order to pull off the look of

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.370
the psychotic Max Cady (Kay-dee), but he took
the role much further than that.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.920
The tattoos that the two-time Academy Award
winner sports in the film were made with vegetable

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.310
dyes, which take months to fade, and he’d
spent a similar amount of time reading up

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.320
on and studying the behavior of sex offenders.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.179
De Niro’s performance reportedly creeped
out Martin Scorsese as much as it did moviegoers,

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.530
and the actor would jokingly leave voice messages
as Cady on his director’s machine just to

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.549
freak him out.

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.630
Maybe he wasn’t quite as deranged as he
seemed.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.931
Nicolas Cage
Cage has made a career out of playing outlandish,

00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:41.931
over-the-top characters.

00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:46.079
From Vampire’s Kiss to Ghost Rider, Cage
has never shied away from his unofficial title

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.880
as the craziest actor in Hollywood.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.850
For his role as a disfigured Vietnam veteran
in the 1984 drama, Birdy, Cage had four of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.650
his teeth pulled just to add an extra dimension
to the part.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.740
He then shocked the film’s crew by wearing
his character’s facial bandages (on and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.700
off set) for five weeks straight.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.969
Whether you choose to acknowledge his insane
talent or if you’ve simply dismissed him

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.140
as a loon, there’s no denying Cage’s place
as one of the most fearlessly dedicated thespians

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.920
in the industry.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.430
Joaquin Phoenix
Back in 2008, when this two-time Academy Award

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.129
nominee announced that he was quitting acting
to pursue a career as a hip-hop artist, most

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.660
assumed it was a hoax.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.720
After roughly a year and a half of bizarre
behavior and public appearances resulted in

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.349
this 2010 mockumentary, which was later confirmed
to be a hoax.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.580
After the film received a decidedly mixed
critical reaction, Phoenix took a break from

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.580
the acting game.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.540
He’s since returned from his self-imposed
hiatus to earn a third Academy Award nomination

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.330
for his phenomenal work in The Master, so
it’s safe to say he’s now firmly back

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.330
on track.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.510
Kate Winslet
One of the most extraordinary talents working

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.300
today, Winslet holds the distinction as the
youngest actor or actress in history to be

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.500
nominated for six Academy Awards.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.239
Her first (and only) win came for her role
as a former Nazi concentration camp guard

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.350
in this 2008 drama, a performance that apparently
took a significant toll on the actress.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.650
She’s said that it took months for her to
fully break free of the part, equating leaving

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.349
the character behind to escaping a serious
car accident.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.760
Thankfully, Winslet has seemingly moved on
in the years since, and she continues to be

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.510
one of the top actresses in Hollywood.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.310
Adrien Brody
The 6’5 Brody slimmed all the way down to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.500
130 pounds to pull off the emaciated look
of a Holocaust survivor in Roman Polanski’s

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.530
historical drama.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.430
He’s since said that the genuine desperation
that comes from starvation was something he

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.150
couldn’t fake, and at times he found himself
wondering if he was going to be able to escape

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.689
the role with his sanity.

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.420
It reportedly took the actor over a year and
a half to settle back into his normal life.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.750
Considering that the role resulted in Brody
becoming the youngest actor to ever notch

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.709
a Best Actor Oscar win, we’d say it was
worth it.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.329
Jamie Dornan
Before Dornan gained worldwide fame for his

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.120
leading role in the 50 Shades of Grey adaptation,
he was starring as the “Belfast Strangler”

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.870
in this BBC series opposite X-Files star Gillian
Anderson.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.489
In order to help get himself in the mindset
of a serial killer, the 33 year old actor

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.469
confessed to following a woman off the train
and pursuing her (from a distance) for several

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:07.469
blocks.

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:11.370
He probably should have kept that information
to himself.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.940
Shia LaBeouf
LaBeouf’s made every effort to move on to

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.780
more serious roles since his days of palling
around with Optimus Prime and Bumblebee in

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.040
the Transformers franchise.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.410
He’s become a very serious method actor,
known for going to various extremes for his

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.320
movies, and his supporting role in David Ayer’s
WWII film was no different.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.780
He told an interviewer that he pulled his
own tooth and slashed his own face with a

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.810
knife for a more realistic look before revealing
that he hadn’t bathed in months and that

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.190
he’d “spent days watching horses die.”

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:47.320
Even for LaBeouf, that’s pretty out there.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.910
Jared Leto
The Clown Prince of Crime is not a role that

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.660
can be taken lightly, and Leto may have taken
his preparation for the part even further

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.660
than Ledger did.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.920
The 43 year old’s decision to stay in character
in between takes isn’t all that out of the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.120
ordinary, but his gift-giving habits certainly
were.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.670
He sent his fellow cast members a series of
bizarre presents, including a box of bullets

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.660
for co-star Will Smith and a live rat for
Margot Robbie.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.650
He even sent the entire cast a video of him
in character alongside a dead pig.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.290
Apparently method gift-giving is a thing nowadays.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.540
Daniel Day-Lewis
Of all the method actors working today, Daniel

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.500
Day-Lewis may be the name most associated
with the technique; no one embodies a character

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.080
quite like him.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.910
From his work in My Left Foot (a film in which
he broke two of his ribs because he refused

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.190
to cease his character’s hunched-over posture)
to the six months he spent alone in the wilderness

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.120
preparing for The Last of the Mohicans, Day-Lewis
dedicates his entire life to every role he

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.120
takes on.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.890
But his three Academy Awards paint a very
clear picture; he’s clearly doing something

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.890
right.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.000
What’s your favorite example of an actor
pushing himself to the limit?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.020
Is method acting the only true way to embody
a character?
