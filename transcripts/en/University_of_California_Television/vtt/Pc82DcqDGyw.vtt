00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:08.494
(lively piano music)

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.392
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.392 --> 00:00:13.715
Bipedal.

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:14.940
Naked.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.107
Large-brained.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:21.696
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:25.935
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:29.283
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:31.366
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.593 --> 00:00:34.093
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.952 --> 00:00:37.544
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:39.627
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.808
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:44.975
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:50.248
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:53.289
to exchange insights on who we are,

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.956
and how we got here.

00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:58.058
An exploration made possible

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.225
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:17.891
(uptempo music)

00:01:20.624 --> 00:01:23.207
(upbeat music)

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:37.356
- My lab is primarily interested in

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:40.004
understanding some of the
molecular and cellular basis

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.136
for the development of the cortex.

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:44.962
But unlike some of the previous speakers,

00:01:44.962 --> 00:01:49.768
we're focusing on the development
of neuronal connectivity

00:01:49.768 --> 00:01:54.043
and how circuits assemble
basically in the developing brain.

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:57.173
And so, I'm gonna move
fast on the introduction

00:01:57.173 --> 00:02:00.800
because I think you've heard a lot about

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.655
the general interest of
understanding what makes us human

00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:07.206
and in particular, what makes
our brain human-specific.

00:02:07.206 --> 00:02:09.066
Another way to phrase that question

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:11.403
as you heard before is to ask,

00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:13.692
what happened to our
genome since we diverged

00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:18.224
from our common ancestor more
than seven, 10 millions years,

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:19.564
there's actually debate about

00:02:19.564 --> 00:02:22.878
that exact time for divergence

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:24.785
from our common ancestor.

00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:26.386
So, to the first question,

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:28.474
what makes our brain human-specific?

00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:30.737
You have heard a lot today about

00:02:30.737 --> 00:02:33.729
the possibility that what makes our brain

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:37.564
different from our most
common living relatives

00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:38.755
like chimps and bonobos,

00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:42.597
or to other higher mammals,
would be brain size

00:02:42.597 --> 00:02:45.090
or at least the size of the cortex

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.117
relative to the rest of the brain.

00:02:47.117 --> 00:02:49.285
I would argue that despite the
fact that that's the question

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:51.158
that most people are interested in,

00:02:51.158 --> 00:02:55.004
it cannot be the entire
answer for a simple reason.

00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:58.569
Which is that if you look
at brain size expansion

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.661
including increases in neocortical size,

00:03:02.661 --> 00:03:05.515
many mammals have succeeded at this

00:03:05.515 --> 00:03:09.083
without any real gain
in cognitive abilities.

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:13.917
In fact, brain size is best
correlated to body size

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:15.722
not to cognitive abilities, right?

00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:19.247
So, brain size and neocortex expansion

00:03:19.247 --> 00:03:22.156
were probably an important
step during evolution

00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:25.284
and it happened many times
during mammalian evolution

00:03:25.284 --> 00:03:28.171
but it can't be the only explanation for

00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:29.482
what makes our brain human-specific,

00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:33.232
at least in emergence
of cognitive abilities.

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.689
Many are open remaining possibilities,

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.901
neuronal composition, right?

00:03:38.901 --> 00:03:41.815
That the type of neurons that are produced

00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:44.745
that Rick and others have
talked about earlier.

00:03:44.745 --> 00:03:47.151
Circuit connectivity, the
total number of synapses

00:03:47.151 --> 00:03:50.151
made between neurons are things that

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.909
will influence circuit function

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.637
and probably cognitive abilities.

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:57.877
Something that very few
people have talked about,

00:03:57.877 --> 00:04:01.421
non-neuronal cells, astrocytes, microglia.

00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:03.011
There's actually some very recent evidence

00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:05.437
suggesting that differences in composition

00:04:05.437 --> 00:04:07.847
or total number of non-neuronal cells

00:04:07.847 --> 00:04:10.388
might be different between human

00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:12.177
and non-human primate.

00:04:12.177 --> 00:04:13.923
So today I'm gonna try to convince you

00:04:13.923 --> 00:04:16.624
that we have evidence,
probably the first evidence

00:04:16.624 --> 00:04:20.248
suggesting that a specific
gene duplication event

00:04:20.248 --> 00:04:23.290
has pretty significantly changed

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.566
both the number of synapses
made between neurons,

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.390
and we think actually affects

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.930
circuit connectivity and circuit function.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.619
So, how did we get
interested in this question?

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:34.565
We got interested in this question

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:36.875
based on the work of
several groups including

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:41.198
a beautiful work from Evan
Eichler that you'll hear about

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:43.610
just after me so I'm not
gonna bore you with details

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.661
about what Evan did.

00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:49.626
But back in early 2000s
work from Jim Sikela

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:52.709
and then refined and expanded by Evan

00:04:53.769 --> 00:04:56.946
identified gene duplication events

00:04:56.946 --> 00:04:59.322
that are specific to the human lineage.

00:04:59.322 --> 00:05:02.562
Gene duplications, new gene
copies that are not present

00:05:02.562 --> 00:05:05.603
in any other non-human primates
or in any other mammals.

00:05:05.603 --> 00:05:08.520
So essentially what Evan has shown,

00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:12.544
shown here on this graph.

00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:16.157
So what Evan has shown is that

00:05:16.157 --> 00:05:18.886
in humans you have a whole list of gene,

00:05:18.886 --> 00:05:21.522
about 30 genes that have
extra copies essentially.

00:05:21.522 --> 00:05:24.346
Those copies are specific to humans,

00:05:24.346 --> 00:05:27.508
they're not found in non-human primates.

00:05:27.508 --> 00:05:31.062
And unfortunately or fortunately for us,

00:05:31.062 --> 00:05:33.615
most of those genes have
completely unknown function.

00:05:33.615 --> 00:05:34.921
That's not entirely true.

00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:36.582
There is one gene in that list,

00:05:36.582 --> 00:05:38.945
SMN1 which is the gene that's mutated

00:05:38.945 --> 00:05:41.069
in spinal muscular atrophy.

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.059
Turns out that humans and humans only

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:44.390
have an extra copy of this

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.929
and it's actually
absolutely fascinating work

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:48.716
that's been done on this.

00:05:48.716 --> 00:05:52.529
There's a drug treatment that
just emerged very recently

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.951
actually taking advantage
of the second copy,

00:05:54.951 --> 00:05:56.691
the human specific copy of SMN1.

00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:58.790
If you're interested I
can tell you more about.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.847
But for the vast majority,
all the other genes

00:06:00.847 --> 00:06:02.459
have largely unknown function.

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:06.096
And so, except that around the time when

00:06:06.096 --> 00:06:08.496
this first work was published,

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:10.855
there was one gene in that list,

00:06:10.855 --> 00:06:12.438
SRGAP2 listed here,

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:15.799
that we were probably the only lab working

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:16.979
on this gene at that time.

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.717
And we had some interesting data

00:06:19.717 --> 00:06:21.849
suggesting that this gene was actually

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.119
playing important functions

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:25.141
during brain development,

00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:27.820
at least the ancestral copy of this gene.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.852
But when Jim Sikela and Evan
Eichler published these results

00:06:30.852 --> 00:06:32.662
were struck by the fact that there are

00:06:32.662 --> 00:06:34.606
human-specific copies of this gene.

00:06:34.606 --> 00:06:37.971
And so, we embarked on
trying to characterize

00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:42.138
what those human-specific
duplications of SRGAP2 do.

00:06:43.002 --> 00:06:44.693
So as a paradigm basically

00:06:44.693 --> 00:06:47.500
many questions arise from
from this observation

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.234
that there are human specific
gene duplicates for those.

00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:52.924
The first one is which of those genes

00:06:52.924 --> 00:06:55.674
are expressed in the human brain?

00:06:56.902 --> 00:06:58.694
Second question is what is the function of

00:06:58.694 --> 00:07:00.151
the ancestral copy of these genes?

00:07:00.151 --> 00:07:01.420
I mentioned most of those genes

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.998
have completely unknown function
during brain development

00:07:03.998 --> 00:07:05.880
so we had to start with this.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.537
And the third question
that's truly interesting is,

00:07:08.537 --> 00:07:11.200
is the function of the
human specific paralogs

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.890
related to the function
of the ancestral copy?

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.911
Or are those new copies basically

00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:19.810
acquiring some completely
independent function,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.423
some completely new functions

00:07:21.423 --> 00:07:24.426
independent of the function
of the ancestral copy, right?

00:07:24.426 --> 00:07:26.928
Both scenarios could be true.

00:07:26.928 --> 00:07:29.892
So I'm gonna summarize here essentially

00:07:29.892 --> 00:07:32.998
about 11 years of work from my lab,

00:07:32.998 --> 00:07:34.821
from multiple people in my lab.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.333
And then during the rest of the talk

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:40.482
I'm gonna unpack and
tell you a bit more about

00:07:40.482 --> 00:07:43.250
how we got to those conclusions.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.642
So essentially SRGAP2A
is an adapter protein

00:07:46.642 --> 00:07:48.478
containing three functional domains.

00:07:48.478 --> 00:07:50.251
This bottom end which is essentially

00:07:50.251 --> 00:07:52.102
a homodimerization motif.

00:07:52.102 --> 00:07:54.408
A central domain called the RapGAP domain.

00:07:54.408 --> 00:07:58.556
It's a domain that inactivates
small GTPas called Rac1.

00:07:58.556 --> 00:08:00.305
And an SH3 domain that's essentially

00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:03.472
a protein-protein interaction motif.

00:08:03.472 --> 00:08:06.535
All mammals from rodents
to non-human primates

00:08:06.535 --> 00:08:09.467
and humans have this gene.

00:08:09.467 --> 00:08:11.476
It's expressed, it's highly
expressed in the brain,

00:08:11.476 --> 00:08:14.697
it's expressed largely in only in neurons

00:08:14.697 --> 00:08:15.877
and as I'll show you later on,

00:08:15.877 --> 00:08:18.917
it's actually very unreached at synapses.

00:08:18.917 --> 00:08:20.300
But it turns out that about

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.598
two to four million years ago,

00:08:22.598 --> 00:08:26.375
two gene duplication events at least

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:30.375
made this new copy that's
human-specific emerge,

00:08:31.954 --> 00:08:34.602
that we had to call SRGAP2C.

00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:38.228
And Evan will probably tell
you a bit more about that.

00:08:38.228 --> 00:08:41.657
And so, this coding sequence
is truncated actually,

00:08:41.657 --> 00:08:43.130
it doesn't express the
full-length protein.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.034
It's truncated, it expresses
90% of this bottom end

00:08:47.034 --> 00:08:49.966
which remains able to
bind to the ancestral copy

00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:52.835
and largely inhibit its function, okay?

00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:55.848
So its main function, so it turns out that

00:08:55.848 --> 00:08:57.710
we get essentially the same phenotype

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.294
when we inactivate the SRGAP2A

00:09:00.294 --> 00:09:03.316
or when we induce the
expression of this gene, okay?

00:09:03.316 --> 00:09:06.771
And the phenotypes, we
get our delayed excitatory

00:09:06.771 --> 00:09:09.062
and inhibitory synaptic maturation,

00:09:09.062 --> 00:09:11.736
this phenomenon called neoteny,

00:09:11.736 --> 00:09:13.484
which is essentially defined by

00:09:13.484 --> 00:09:15.297
retention of immature features

00:09:15.297 --> 00:09:19.321
for longer periods of
time during development.

00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:21.679
We get increased density of both

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:23.919
excitatory and inhibitory synapses.

00:09:23.919 --> 00:09:28.761
And finally, we get increased
cortical connectivity.

00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:31.276
This is largely unpublished,

00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:33.989
probably won't have time to
tell you much about this.

00:09:33.989 --> 00:09:36.105
So, how did we reach these conclusions?

00:09:36.105 --> 00:09:40.197
So the first thing that we
did a long time ago in 2009,

00:09:40.197 --> 00:09:42.905
we published expression pattern for SRGAP2

00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:46.335
and this very simple
observation that the protein

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:49.674
in mouse cortex is expressed
actually peaks at P1

00:09:49.674 --> 00:09:52.373
but is expressed largely at postnatal time

00:09:52.373 --> 00:09:56.639
when between, during the first
two weeks of postnatal life

00:09:56.639 --> 00:10:01.191
when the animals are basically
forming a lot of synapses.

00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:04.016
And so, when this very talented postdoc,

00:10:04.016 --> 00:10:06.157
Cecile Charrier, joined the lab,

00:10:06.157 --> 00:10:09.146
she discovered that in fact SRGAP2 protein

00:10:09.146 --> 00:10:10.970
is very unreached at synapses.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.994
This is high-resolution images

00:10:12.994 --> 00:10:15.398
of individual synapses in mouse neurons

00:10:15.398 --> 00:10:17.378
and I hope you can
appreciate the fact that

00:10:17.378 --> 00:10:20.725
essentially there is very
little SRGAP2 in small synapses

00:10:20.725 --> 00:10:24.532
and lots of SRGAP2
protein in large synapses.

00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:26.673
Those synapses here are visualized,

00:10:26.673 --> 00:10:28.499
those excitatory synapses are visualized

00:10:28.499 --> 00:10:31.086
by this protein Homer1.

00:10:31.086 --> 00:10:32.538
And it turns out that at that time

00:10:32.538 --> 00:10:34.679
we didn't know but in
fact those two proteins

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:36.429
in function interact.

00:10:38.243 --> 00:10:42.410
So, what is SRGAP2 function
in synaptic development?

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:46.145
So, neurons are absolutely amazing cells

00:10:46.145 --> 00:10:47.703
if you think about it, right?

00:10:47.703 --> 00:10:50.027
Those cells are gigantic.

00:10:50.027 --> 00:10:52.267
A fibroblast that people
have talked about before

00:10:52.267 --> 00:10:54.905
would be the size of this
cell body here, right?

00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:56.731
So they're gigantic cells

00:10:56.731 --> 00:11:00.773
and a graduate student
in the lab, Dan Iascone,

00:11:00.773 --> 00:11:04.610
has developed some new
methodology to actually

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.219
at single cell resolution in vivo

00:11:07.219 --> 00:11:09.812
visualize the presence and the topography

00:11:09.812 --> 00:11:12.817
of all synapses, excitatory
and inhibitory synapses,

00:11:12.817 --> 00:11:15.295
made into a single neuron, okay?

00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:18.585
And so, this allows us to understand both

00:11:18.585 --> 00:11:21.681
to have very quantitative ideas of

00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:23.709
where synapses are localized in neurons,

00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:25.247
how many they form,

00:11:25.247 --> 00:11:27.569
and you know, for a
typical neuron like this,

00:11:27.569 --> 00:11:30.606
this layer two, three pyramidal
neurons in the mouse forms

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:35.495
somewhere between 4,000 and
6,000 excitatory synapses.

00:11:35.495 --> 00:11:36.964
And somewhere between 1,000

00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:39.847
and 1,500 inhibitory synapses, right?

00:11:39.847 --> 00:11:43.626
So, staggering numbers
for just a single cell.

00:11:43.626 --> 00:11:45.684
And so, if you zoom up on those

00:11:45.684 --> 00:11:47.008
green dots that you see here,

00:11:47.008 --> 00:11:49.256
those are individual
spines, dendritic spines.

00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:53.354
I'm gonna talk a lot about
those in the rest of the talk.

00:11:53.354 --> 00:11:56.633
Those protrusions, those micron,

00:11:56.633 --> 00:11:59.251
the scale is a one micron here.

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:00.824
They're tiny protrusions.

00:12:00.824 --> 00:12:03.353
They essentially constitutes
individual synapses,

00:12:03.353 --> 00:12:06.910
if you look at an EM picture
of a single spine like this,

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.273
these protrusions, this
is the site basically.

00:12:09.273 --> 00:12:11.485
A single spine constitute
a single synapse,

00:12:11.485 --> 00:12:14.803
it's the postsynaptic receiving
end basically of a synapse

00:12:14.803 --> 00:12:16.744
so this is an axon with those

00:12:16.744 --> 00:12:18.922
neurotransmitter-filled vesicles here

00:12:18.922 --> 00:12:21.817
that release neurotransmitter
in the synaptic cleft,

00:12:21.817 --> 00:12:25.275
that then activates
postsynaptic receptors here.

00:12:25.275 --> 00:12:27.699
So, essentially those
synapses are the basis

00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:29.732
for neuronal communications, right?

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:33.653
And decades of work by hundreds of labs

00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:37.038
have identified essentially
a zoo of proteins,

00:12:37.038 --> 00:12:38.644
hundreds of proteins that are localized

00:12:38.644 --> 00:12:40.583
pre and postsynaptically here.

00:12:40.583 --> 00:12:42.203
The dendritic spines.

00:12:42.203 --> 00:12:45.178
Those proteins, the main
job of those proteins

00:12:45.178 --> 00:12:47.799
including this Homer/Shank
interacting proteins,

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:49.393
I'm gonna tell you in a second,

00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:52.074
is to basically create
a very complex scaffold

00:12:52.074 --> 00:12:55.700
to anchor and stabilize the
neurotransmitter receptors here

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.975
that sense neurotransmitter release here.

00:12:58.975 --> 00:13:02.591
And so, we discovered that SRGAP2 look

00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:05.939
is actually directly
interacting with Homer here,

00:13:05.939 --> 00:13:09.165
and in fact I'll show you later on

00:13:09.165 --> 00:13:13.465
SRGAP2 seems to control
the scaffolding properties

00:13:13.465 --> 00:13:17.337
of those proteins and controls
the rate of accumulation

00:13:17.337 --> 00:13:19.899
of those neurotransmitter receptors

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.585
such as AMPA receptors during development.

00:13:22.585 --> 00:13:24.479
So how did we discover this?

00:13:24.479 --> 00:13:26.486
Takayuki Sassa, the first postdoc

00:13:26.486 --> 00:13:28.467
who was involved in this
project started by making

00:13:28.467 --> 00:13:31.699
a knockout for SRGAP2A for
the ancestral copy in mice.

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:35.217
So, we made this knockout in order to ask

00:13:35.217 --> 00:13:37.591
what happens when we delete this gene?

00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:40.408
And the main thing that happens
when you delete this gene

00:13:40.408 --> 00:13:44.027
is essentially that if
you look at those spines,

00:13:44.027 --> 00:13:46.173
the size of the spines I forgot to mention

00:13:46.173 --> 00:13:48.471
is proportional to how mature it is,

00:13:48.471 --> 00:13:50.951
how many postsynaptic receptors

00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:52.539
have accumulated there.

00:13:52.539 --> 00:13:54.842
If you look at an animal
three weeks after birth,

00:13:54.842 --> 00:13:56.112
a wild-type animal,

00:13:56.112 --> 00:13:57.821
those spines are already mature.

00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:00.721
So they have mature synapses.

00:14:00.721 --> 00:14:04.742
There's a lot of data that has shown this.

00:14:04.742 --> 00:14:07.017
But then if you look at the heterozygous,

00:14:07.017 --> 00:14:09.726
so if you delete one copy
or two copies of the gene,

00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:13.390
you have significantly smaller spines

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.114
at this juvenile time point.

00:14:15.114 --> 00:14:16.285
They have longer necks.

00:14:16.285 --> 00:14:18.471
So the neck that connects the spine head

00:14:18.471 --> 00:14:20.983
to the dendrites is longer,

00:14:20.983 --> 00:14:24.219
and most interestingly,
there's a pretty significant

00:14:24.219 --> 00:14:26.518
increase in density of those spines.

00:14:26.518 --> 00:14:31.189
But interestingly enough this
size effect is transient.

00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:34.439
So if you look at P65 at 40 days later,

00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:37.172
those spines reach maturation.

00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:39.451
So it's just a delay in maturation.

00:14:39.451 --> 00:14:42.095
Those spines when you inactivate SRGAP2

00:14:42.095 --> 00:14:45.844
seems to be much slower
at reaching maturation.

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:47.219
Instead of being mature at P21

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.096
they're mature at P45.

00:14:49.096 --> 00:14:52.128
But in the adult basically
the spines remain

00:14:52.128 --> 00:14:53.373
having a longer neck

00:14:53.373 --> 00:14:57.819
and very significantly
higher numbers basically,

00:14:57.819 --> 00:15:00.716
very higher, significantly higher that.

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:02.916
So what happens if we
humanize mouse neurons

00:15:02.916 --> 00:15:04.590
for SRGAP2C, right?

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.471
I briefly mentioned before

00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:10.720
that our model based on
studies we published before

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.131
was that the truncated version,

00:15:12.131 --> 00:15:14.282
the human-specific version of this gene

00:15:14.282 --> 00:15:16.423
would bind to and inhibit the function

00:15:16.423 --> 00:15:18.215
of the ancestral copy, right?

00:15:18.215 --> 00:15:19.708
So the prediction would be

00:15:19.708 --> 00:15:22.092
that if we express
SRGAP2C in a mouse neuron

00:15:22.092 --> 00:15:24.513
that expresses SRGAP2A,

00:15:24.513 --> 00:15:27.498
we would get phenotype that
look exactly like this, right?

00:15:27.498 --> 00:15:29.434
And that's exactly what we found.

00:15:29.434 --> 00:15:32.532
Essentially if you look at
juvenile animals control

00:15:32.532 --> 00:15:35.770
or SRAGP2C humanized mouse neurons,

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.107
you get this delayed maturation, right,

00:15:38.107 --> 00:15:41.707
but they actually reach maturation at P65

00:15:41.707 --> 00:15:43.346
instead of P21.

00:15:43.346 --> 00:15:46.811
And they retain longer necks
and higher spine density.

00:15:46.811 --> 00:15:48.992
So this was a very interesting
result for us, right?

00:15:48.992 --> 00:15:51.040
This is because essentially we know

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.882
that those three features
delayed maturation, a longer neck

00:15:55.882 --> 00:15:57.960
which actually has very
important function,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.440
and a higher density are three phenotypes

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.518
that are known to
characterize human neurons

00:16:02.518 --> 00:16:06.032
compared to either mouse
neurons or non-human primates.

00:16:06.032 --> 00:16:10.157
So beautiful work from Javier
DeFelipe, Rafael Yuste,

00:16:10.157 --> 00:16:12.942
my colleague at Columbia,

00:16:12.942 --> 00:16:15.794
have shown that if you look
at spine density for example

00:16:15.794 --> 00:16:18.157
between human or non-human primates,

00:16:18.157 --> 00:16:19.447
or if you look at spine density

00:16:19.447 --> 00:16:21.032
between human and mouse neurons,

00:16:21.032 --> 00:16:24.479
you essentially get 30% to 50%

00:16:24.479 --> 00:16:28.087
more dense, higher density of spines

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:30.446
and those spines have longer necks.

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:33.657
And we also know that
synaptic development in humans

00:16:33.657 --> 00:16:35.493
is profoundly neotenic.

00:16:35.493 --> 00:16:37.768
So basically very prolonged maturation,

00:16:37.768 --> 00:16:39.550
very delayed maturation.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.025
So this is interesting, right?

00:16:41.025 --> 00:16:44.201
Essentially with just
introducing a single gene

00:16:44.201 --> 00:16:46.470
that's human specific in mouse neurons,

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:48.799
we've seen a copy three major aspect

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.034
of synaptic development.

00:16:50.034 --> 00:16:52.662
Delayed maturation, higher density

00:16:52.662 --> 00:16:55.775
and change in the morphology
of those spines, right?

00:16:55.775 --> 00:16:58.536
But we have a problem which is that

00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:01.551
we know that changing and increasing

00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:03.116
the density of excitatory synapses

00:17:03.116 --> 00:17:05.535
cannot be the only explanation

00:17:05.535 --> 00:17:09.407
since beautiful work from
Javier DeFelipe and many others

00:17:09.407 --> 00:17:13.341
have shown that there is an
amazing degree of conservation

00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:17.192
in the ratio between excitatory
and inhibitory synapses

00:17:17.192 --> 00:17:19.227
in the cortex, right?

00:17:19.227 --> 00:17:21.129
So, we know that if SRGAP2,

00:17:21.129 --> 00:17:23.391
if that's the only thing SRGAP2 is doing,

00:17:23.391 --> 00:17:26.344
increasing the number
of excitatory synapses,

00:17:26.344 --> 00:17:27.538
we would have a problem, right?

00:17:27.538 --> 00:17:29.078
We would have a major imbalance

00:17:29.078 --> 00:17:30.835
between excitation, inhibition

00:17:30.835 --> 00:17:32.877
which is the landmark of many

00:17:32.877 --> 00:17:35.213
neurodevelopmental disorders for example

00:17:35.213 --> 00:17:38.249
such as autism or epilepsy.

00:17:38.249 --> 00:17:41.121
So either SRGAP2 was doing the job

00:17:41.121 --> 00:17:42.993
and was coordinating the maturation

00:17:42.993 --> 00:17:45.735
of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses

00:17:45.735 --> 00:17:47.518
or some other genes,

00:17:47.518 --> 00:17:49.678
maybe some of the other gene duplications

00:17:49.678 --> 00:17:51.596
that I mentioned before would do the job.

00:17:51.596 --> 00:17:55.275
It turns out that nature
has selected SRGAP2

00:17:55.275 --> 00:17:56.984
probably for a reason.

00:17:56.984 --> 00:17:59.165
It's because SRGAP2 does
exactly the same thing

00:17:59.165 --> 00:18:00.936
it does at excitatory synapses

00:18:00.936 --> 00:18:02.222
and inhibitory synapses.

00:18:02.222 --> 00:18:04.626
So we discovered this
because more recently

00:18:04.626 --> 00:18:07.171
because now we can actually visualize

00:18:07.171 --> 00:18:11.132
inhibitory synapses with amazing accuracy

00:18:11.132 --> 00:18:14.388
using for example this gephyrin GFP.

00:18:14.388 --> 00:18:16.781
Gephyrin is a protein
that's exclusively localized

00:18:16.781 --> 00:18:18.458
at inhibitory synapses.

00:18:18.458 --> 00:18:19.975
And using single cell technology,

00:18:19.975 --> 00:18:22.538
single cell genetic labeling technology

00:18:22.538 --> 00:18:26.705
we can not only visualize with
submicron precision spines,

00:18:27.649 --> 00:18:30.359
we can actually localize
those inhibitory blue tones

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:33.021
either the ones that are made
on the dendrite shaft here

00:18:33.021 --> 00:18:35.802
or even more rare blue
tones that are made directly

00:18:35.802 --> 00:18:37.344
on spine heads here.

00:18:37.344 --> 00:18:39.374
I can tell you more about this later on.

00:18:39.374 --> 00:18:43.541
And remarkably, we find
that the same thing happens

00:18:44.436 --> 00:18:46.731
then for spines if you look
at inhibitory blue tone,

00:18:46.731 --> 00:18:49.806
if you down regulate
SRGAP2A, the ancestral copy,

00:18:49.806 --> 00:18:53.004
or you introduce and humanize mass neurons

00:18:53.004 --> 00:18:55.035
for SRGAP2C expression,

00:18:55.035 --> 00:18:58.876
you get higher density
of inhibitory clusters.

00:18:58.876 --> 00:19:03.043
Those inhibitory synapses
are much smaller early on

00:19:03.043 --> 00:19:06.219
but ultimately reach maturation at P65.

00:19:06.219 --> 00:19:08.784
And there's a change in
their actual localization,

00:19:08.784 --> 00:19:11.283
the striking increase in the one,

00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:13.512
the inhibitory synapses made on

00:19:13.512 --> 00:19:15.098
through the spine heads here.

00:19:15.098 --> 00:19:18.566
So increased density
and delayed maturation.

00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:20.270
It's pretty remarkable.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.147
In fact, if you plot the normalized

00:19:22.147 --> 00:19:24.613
increasing density for spines

00:19:24.613 --> 00:19:27.317
and for inhibitory
synapses between control

00:19:27.317 --> 00:19:28.941
and humanized mouse neurons,

00:19:28.941 --> 00:19:32.483
we get remarkably similar effects, right?

00:19:32.483 --> 00:19:34.352
So the conclusion here is that

00:19:34.352 --> 00:19:37.595
nature has selected the
gene duplication event

00:19:37.595 --> 00:19:40.980
that of a gene that essentially controls

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.678
the co-evolution of inhibitory

00:19:43.678 --> 00:19:45.732
and excitatory synapses, right?

00:19:45.732 --> 00:19:47.962
This is really I think a very important

00:19:47.962 --> 00:19:50.535
take-home message here.

00:19:50.535 --> 00:19:54.604
So, I will finish here by taking a minute

00:19:54.604 --> 00:19:58.030
to recap everything I told you today.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.947
We've identified a gene and SRGAP2A

00:20:02.331 --> 00:20:06.498
which in its ancestral form
expressed in all mammals

00:20:07.353 --> 00:20:09.770
controls three very important

00:20:11.285 --> 00:20:12.960
aspect of synaptic development.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.206
It controls the density of
excitatory inhibitory synapses

00:20:16.206 --> 00:20:19.167
through work, I didn't
have time to show you.

00:20:19.167 --> 00:20:22.204
We were actually able to do
structure function analysis

00:20:22.204 --> 00:20:24.804
in vivo using gene replacement strategies.

00:20:24.804 --> 00:20:26.728
And so, we can actually dissociate

00:20:26.728 --> 00:20:29.105
how SRGAP2 regulate spine density

00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:31.113
and inhibitory synapse density

00:20:31.113 --> 00:20:33.273
from how it controls the maturation

00:20:33.273 --> 00:20:36.711
of excitatory or inhibitory synapses.

00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:40.619
And we discovered that the
human specific copy of this gene

00:20:40.619 --> 00:20:42.899
which is this truncated form

00:20:42.899 --> 00:20:45.376
which remains able to
bind to the ancestral copy

00:20:45.376 --> 00:20:48.713
and inhibit its function
inhibits all three

00:20:48.713 --> 00:20:51.846
major functions of SRGAP2, right?

00:20:51.846 --> 00:20:56.013
So what are the future
directions on this project?

00:20:57.097 --> 00:21:00.372
So, there are three future directions.

00:21:00.372 --> 00:21:02.861
The first one is what are
the upstream regulator

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.092
of this protein?

00:21:04.092 --> 00:21:06.879
I didn't tell you anything
about how this gene is regulated

00:21:06.879 --> 00:21:09.325
and how the protein itself is regulated.

00:21:09.325 --> 00:21:12.889
We have some evidence of
what's upstream of this.

00:21:12.889 --> 00:21:15.477
The second very important question is,

00:21:15.477 --> 00:21:17.899
where are these increased
number of connections

00:21:17.899 --> 00:21:18.917
coming from, right?

00:21:18.917 --> 00:21:20.834
So this gene basically,

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.857
the emergence of this humans-specific copy

00:21:23.857 --> 00:21:25.963
increases the total number of synapses

00:21:25.963 --> 00:21:28.422
by 30% or 40% which is very significant.

00:21:28.422 --> 00:21:32.683
Where are those connections
coming from, right?

00:21:32.683 --> 00:21:35.192
We have some ideas about this already.

00:21:35.192 --> 00:21:37.722
And finally probably the most important is

00:21:37.722 --> 00:21:39.630
what aspect of circuit function

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.184
has been affected by the emergence

00:21:42.184 --> 00:21:43.834
of this human-specific copy?

00:21:43.834 --> 00:21:46.806
That's something that's much
more difficult to approach

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:47.639
but believe it or not,

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:52.201
we actually have some very
interesting results about this.

00:21:52.201 --> 00:21:53.993
So finally, the people who did the work.

00:21:53.993 --> 00:21:55.485
The work was largely carried out

00:21:55.485 --> 00:21:58.023
by a very talented postdoc
in my lab, Cecile Charrier,

00:21:58.023 --> 00:21:59.786
who now has her own lab

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:03.523
at Ecole Normale Superieure
in Paris in France.

00:22:03.523 --> 00:22:06.301
But she was assisted by many people

00:22:06.301 --> 00:22:08.287
and many people in my lab,

00:22:08.287 --> 00:22:10.317
at least those four people listed here

00:22:10.317 --> 00:22:13.674
are involved in current
aspect of the project.

00:22:13.674 --> 00:22:16.519
And finally I'm excited
since I moved to Columbia

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:17.966
about four years ago,

00:22:17.966 --> 00:22:20.838
Columbia is creating a
third campus actually

00:22:20.838 --> 00:22:22.398
called Manhattanville,

00:22:22.398 --> 00:22:25.348
and very recently we went
from an architectural sketch

00:22:25.348 --> 00:22:27.420
to an actual building

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.220
that will host 55 labs,
about a thousand people.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.076
So, the Zuckerman Mind
Brain Behavior Institute.

00:22:33.076 --> 00:22:35.075
We're very excited to
move into this building

00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:36.335
hopefully this fall.

00:22:36.335 --> 00:22:37.772
Thank you for your attention.

00:22:37.772 --> 00:22:40.905
(audience applauding)

00:22:40.905 --> 00:22:43.488
(upbeat music)
