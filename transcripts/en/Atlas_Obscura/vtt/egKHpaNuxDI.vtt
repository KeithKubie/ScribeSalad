00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.710
- Lion dance is not only for Chinese,

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.377
lion dance for the
people who is passionate.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.230
My name is James Liao.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.400
I'm born and brought up in India, Kolkata.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.810
I have been teaching lion
dance and martial art

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.760
more than 10 years.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.640
The lion dance is centuries-old tradition

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.850
performed for Chinese New
Year and special functions

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.850
to bring good luck and prosperities.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.750
The first Chinese came to
Kolkata three hundred years ago.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.270
They used to work for
British to make the ship,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.050
then they worked as tanneries owner,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.350
shoe shops, beauty parlors.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.880
Their migration started mid-eighties,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.670
after nineties, I feel a
lot of people have migrated.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.330
So they came and gone and
there's no other Chinese left,

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.880
that's why all my troupe members,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.331
they are all Indians.

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:07.240
(speaks in foreign language)

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.000
Flatten, circle, back.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.950
My students are not coming
from a very good income family.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.820
They are struggling to pay the bills.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.390
I give them the lion dance
training classes for free.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.830
We are doing a lot of lion dance shows

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.760
and I pay them lots of hongbao

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.040
and I think those helps them a lot

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.303
for their bills and tuitions
and all kind of stuff.

00:01:28.784 --> 00:01:31.616
(clapping)

00:01:31.616 --> 00:01:35.783

00:02:03.187 --> 00:02:06.220
(dancers laughing)

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.480
- [James] That's my reward

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.810
to see them to perform well
and make the crowd happy.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.530
There is something that
they have never seen before

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.560
in India.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.540
I'm still using the tradition,
but now I want to mix up

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.210
with a little bit of art, a
little bit of entertainment

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.220
and comedy to attract more and more crowd.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.203
It's make it more fun to watch.

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:26.638
Three!

00:02:26.638 --> 00:02:27.471
- [kids] Three!

00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:28.304
- Four!
- [kids] Four!

00:02:28.304 --> 00:02:29.137
- One!

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:29.970
- [kids] One!

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.053
- Stay there, stay there!

00:02:33.345 --> 00:02:34.178
Stay there.

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:36.845
(kids shouting)

00:02:38.377 --> 00:02:40.218
I'm going to go about make a future team.

00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:43.240
(laughing)

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.860
Some people in the Chinese community

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.450
is not very happy of what I'm doing,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.420
teaching the Indian kids.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.253
I told them that,

00:02:51.253 --> 00:02:52.367
"You should be proud of it,

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:54.957
"that Indians are accepting our culture,

00:02:54.957 --> 00:02:57.347
"and they are practicing
it in a serious manner,

00:02:57.347 --> 00:03:00.330
"so there is no reason
for you to feel upset."

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.020
Any tradition is for everyone,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.020
is not only for the particular race.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.440
Right now, the lion dance is getting

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.810
more and more popular in India.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.200
In a few years, there won't be any Chinese

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.750
doing the lion dancing,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.400
so we are the first
person to open the market,

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.460
and in the future there is going to be

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.317
lots of troupe like Malaysia.

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.736
