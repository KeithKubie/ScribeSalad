00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.060
We're at another interesting juncture because we're about to run our

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.795
second sagas function for the first time.

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:08.330
What do you think is going to happen when we do?

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.310
As usual, it will create a new context for the function invocation.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.790
But that context will exist within the second of the two red contexts that were

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.770
created from calling this red new saga function.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.640
Behavior will proceed as normally until we get to the line that

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.020
does the logging.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.500
What do you expect the output will be?
