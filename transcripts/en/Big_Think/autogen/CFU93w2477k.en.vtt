they this they're literally scratching
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.310
they this they're literally scratching
their head saying why would you why

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
their head saying why would you why
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.719

would you run an organization like this
why would you not empower people who are

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
why would you not empower people who are
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.760
why would you not empower people who are
closest to the customer for instance to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770
closest to the customer for instance to
 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740

make a decision why would you why would
you not share information like that's a

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
you not share information like that's a
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.880
you not share information like that's a
huge women organizations that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
huge women organizations that
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.310
huge women organizations that
Millennials don't get to some extent the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
Millennials don't get to some extent the
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.380
Millennials don't get to some extent the
earlier generations are gonna have to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
earlier generations are gonna have to
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.410
earlier generations are gonna have to
learn to give up control that's a that's

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
learn to give up control that's a that's
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.630
learn to give up control that's a that's
a big theme I'm

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
a big theme I'm
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.180
a big theme I'm
seeing in organizations that that you

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190
seeing in organizations that that you
 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.860
seeing in organizations that that you
know most of our management systems are

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870
know most of our management systems are
 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.110
know most of our management systems are
based on control being a good thing and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
based on control being a good thing and
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.870
based on control being a good thing and
I'm finding organizations that give up

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880
I'm finding organizations that give up
 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.699
I'm finding organizations that give up
on that actually get to achieve more and

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709
on that actually get to achieve more and
 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.220
on that actually get to achieve more and
so I think the smart organizations are

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230
so I think the smart organizations are
 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.110
so I think the smart organizations are
gonna get clearer looking at their

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120
gonna get clearer looking at their
 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.090
gonna get clearer looking at their
millennial workforce much of much of

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100
millennial workforce much of much of
 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.000
millennial workforce much of much of
whom are gonna be entry-level to say I

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
whom are gonna be entry-level to say I
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.280
whom are gonna be entry-level to say I
know you're entry-level but in this area

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290
know you're entry-level but in this area
 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.680
know you're entry-level but in this area
I'm gonna let you run with it like

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690
I'm gonna let you run with it like
 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.510
I'm gonna let you run with it like
within these walls you can do whatever

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520
within these walls you can do whatever
 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.460
within these walls you can do whatever
you want you can experiment you can be

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470
you want you can experiment you can be
 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.160
you want you can experiment you can be
in charge and so you just have to be

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170
in charge and so you just have to be
 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.600
in charge and so you just have to be
clear about where those walls are so

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610
clear about where those walls are so
 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.820
clear about where those walls are so
that they don't have huge impacts on the

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830
that they don't have huge impacts on the
 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.580
that they don't have huge impacts on the
rest of the enterprise but find places

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590
rest of the enterprise but find places
 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.229
rest of the enterprise but find places
early on to do that so they have the

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239
early on to do that so they have the
 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.820
early on to do that so they have the
experience of making their own decisions

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830
experience of making their own decisions
 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.640
experience of making their own decisions
I also think in general organizations

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650
I also think in general organizations
 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.080
I also think in general organizations
will be pleasantly surprised when they

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090
will be pleasantly surprised when they
 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.850
will be pleasantly surprised when they
start letting their employees experiment

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860
start letting their employees experiment
 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.470
start letting their employees experiment
because I think they'll start seeing

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480
because I think they'll start seeing
 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.400
because I think they'll start seeing
results that they wouldn't have

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410
results that they wouldn't have
 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.459
results that they wouldn't have
predicted that they would get
