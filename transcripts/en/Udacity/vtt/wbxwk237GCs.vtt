00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.610
The Android platform is incredibly powerful. It unlocks

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.760
so many capabilities for you to exploit in

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.090
using your applications to deliver amazing delight to

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.180
your users. Now, with that incredible power comes

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.200
great responsibility, and there's two things that you

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.580
can't violate. These are two really, really important

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.600
and prime directive light constraints. The first one

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.630
is, you must be purposeful. What does that mean?

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.780
Just because an API exists in Google Play services

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.490
or because there's a thing that you can do, there's

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.190
a sensor that exists, doesn't mean that you should use

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.180
it just for that reason. Be purposeful means that, understand

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.510
how you're going to delivery delight or some use to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.920
your user. Why does that feature or sensor need to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.660
be in your application? And if it doesn't, don't put

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.810
it in there. Actually, be restrained in how you're creative.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.680
And the second one is,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.930
&gt;&gt; To be respectful. You need to be respectful of your user because

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.220
your application might know a lot about your user and it's really important

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.230
that you use that information to deliver delight to your user. A Contextware

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.600
application can go from being amazing to being kind of creepy pretty fast.
