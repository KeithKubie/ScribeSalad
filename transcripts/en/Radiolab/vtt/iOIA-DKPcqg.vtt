00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.920
You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.163
S. T.

3
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.180
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.230
And what we're going to do in this particular show is we're going to, um,

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.030
this is one of my favorites. Yeah. Favor, right. Cause you weirdly,

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.990
you certainly gave it your all. Exactly. Um, I don't know. Wait,

7
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:29.510
what do we say here? I mean this is like a,

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.190
this is a little bit of a tussle and we sorta wanted to bring it back cause you

9
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:34.980
know, winter's approaching things are kind of heavy right now.

10
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:38.370
We could use a little lightness wa so this begins with a very,

11
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:42.870
very successful uh, film editor with a, well you'll,

12
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.980
you'll meet him in a moment.

13
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.450
Comes to us with an idea with Jad loves I hate and things go from there.

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.160
Perfect. Can hear us now. Hello. Hello? Hello? Hello. It starts with Walter,

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.263
my hero,

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.760
<v 1>Walter Murcia.</v>

17
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.390
I'm a film editor and sound designer and I've been working in films since the

18
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:00.620
late 1960s.

19
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.360
<v 0>Resume includes, I'm going to make him on, off we go, the godfather</v>

20
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.910
apocalypse now. I love the smell of pump in the morning, ton of other films,

21
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.110
the thing we're talking about.

22
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.880
So you should know is the one of the more spectacular stories I've ever heard.

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.090
How did you bump into this tail?

24
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.660
<v 1>Well, I was in Leon in France doing a film,</v>

25
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.020
unbearable lightness of being. This is back in 1986.

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.780
I was supposed to be there for a week and it wound up,

27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.920
I was there for a month and I ran out of things to read.

28
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.950
So I went down the street from the hotel and there was a bookstore and uh,

29
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.580
I was interested and still am in cosmology. You saw,

30
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:48.130
I picked up a book by the, uh, Carl Sagan of France,

31
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.230
a man named Hubert Reeves. Yeah. You there

32
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.300
<v 0>actually he's French Canadian. He translates this Gal Sago. Anyway,</v>

33
00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.080
merchant ends up buying Reeves book, goes back to the hotel, finds a cozy spot.

34
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.360
<v 1>So I was happily reading away and he was trying to explain with some difficulty</v>

35
00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:06.970
because it was a difficult topic.

36
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.900
How did matter condense out of the sort of cork soup that we believe happened

37
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.330
right after the big bang. And He tried various, uh,

38
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.060
attempts scientifically, but then he said to give you a sense of,

39
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.210
uh, the poetry of this moment.

40
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.810
The best thing is the story that Mala parte tells

41
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.440
who is in Malheur Party. Well, he was a journalist,

42
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.710
a poet, a diplomat soldier,

43
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.000
prisoner film director, and somebody who, uh,

44
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.410
got around. Yeah.

45
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.420
<v 0>And speaking of getting around in 1942,</v>

46
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:55.130
a Melanie's newspaper [inaudible] the loss, Sarah sent Malaparte Day

47
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.470
<v 1>to report, um, on the eastern and northern fronts of war,</v>

48
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.020
specifically the Russian Finnish border.

49
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.560
And he had a front row seat of the siege of London ground,

50
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.210
the agony of the Nazi bombardment of that city. And it's from there.

51
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.160
Then Malaparte he tells his story.

52
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.280
So this one day, this was in the winter,

53
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.580
Mala party was posted with the Finnish army who were fighting along with the

54
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:25.581
Nazis and they were perched just north of Leningrad on the shores of Lake

55
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.930
Ladoga, which is this big lake abutting the city. And on this day

56
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.400
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

57
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.340
<v 0>the Nazis are bombarded area around the lake.</v>

58
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.010
This started a forest fire. Everyone ran for cover.

59
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.780
Soldiers ran every which way.

60
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.010
In the middle of the forest there were Soviet forces that were locked up in a

61
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:55.011
stable and we fortunately panicked and broke out of the stable hundreds of them

62
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.410
and they just started running in Russian to get away from the fire. Right?

63
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.100
So you have hundreds of horses bolting through this flaming forest heading

64
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.020
towards the open space I had,

65
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.350
which was the lake and all the ones they burst out of the forest and go

66
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:11.820
barreling into the lake.

67
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.280
Stampeding one on top of the other is the all get deeper and deeper into their

68
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:17.910
heads.

69
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.880
And it is this moment when they enter the lake that according to the story,

70
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:23.760
something very weird happens in the blink of an eye.

71
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.140
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

72
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.880
<v 3>snaps them shot, it just freezes,</v>

73
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.340
suddenly turns to ice with a bang.

74
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.370
It goes from water to ice with this violent snap and suddenly the horses are in

75
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.020
to mellow Carthay writes it.

76
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:44.790
Even the waves on the lake were gripped in mid air and sort of suspended there.

77
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.763
You doubt

78
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.090
<v 1>the next morning when Mullah party in the fins woke up,</v>

79
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.750
they discovered the forest fire had burned itself out. And look at that.

80
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:04.610
The lake has frozen solid overnight and his finished friends said, yes,

81
00:05:04.611 --> 00:05:09.530
that sometimes happens. And then they are looking to see what are those bumps?

82
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.220
Uh, on the ice over there they go to investigate.

83
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:18.221
And I find themselves in this horrific sculpture garden of horses heads sticking

84
00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:23.780
up out of the solid marble like floor of ice,

85
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.080
you said hundreds. So hundreds of course heads hundreds of abortions.

86
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.280
These are the, these are not gonna Decay, right? Cause it's freezing cold.

87
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.170
Or they looked there,

88
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:36.170
they said those horses stayed there all winter and a Muller party was there in

89
00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:41.870
that region of the world, uh, during that winter. And uh,

90
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.930
every so often he and the other soldiers would go and have a smoke and they'd go

91
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.690
into the sculpture garden and wander around looking at this miraculous thing.

92
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.130
So this image of the horses frozen

93
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.790
<v 0>in this lake,</v>

94
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.790
there's image beautiful and strange and disturbing and a profound in some way

95
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.540
made us wonder what made me wonder. I should say, I told you at the time,

96
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.320
it don't trust this story. It's not scientifically impossible.

97
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.330
And I keeping an open heart, you thought, could this possibly be true?

98
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.970
Could, could there be a grain, perhaps several grains,

99
00:06:19.971 --> 00:06:23.320
perhaps a lake's worth of grains of truth. Your heart, the story.

100
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.750
Just your mind is like loose like a thing. Anyway,

101
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:30.230
I did this for a year. Yeah. And you know what? We're gonna,

102
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.540
we're gonna reconstruct that argument right now and take this uptown. All right.

103
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.830
All right. Let's do this to a real scientist, to a real scientist.

104
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.030
In the course of our argument,

105
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.260
we ended up going uptown to Rockefeller University to meet a couple of people

106
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:46.100
who know about ice.

107
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:50.690
So we're going to go play with some super cool ice among them.

108
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.120
This fellow. Okay. I'm Alexandra Petroff. I in the Raymond and Beverly Sackler.

109
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.180
Fogo. Did you ever wonder who I, Raymond and Beverly Sackler?

110
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.770
They occasionally almost show up and I almost meet them, but I never have. Yeah.

111
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.550
By the way, the Sackler family has recently come into a bit of controversy.

112
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.200
We all know that now. We didn't at the time. In any case,

113
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.920
Alex, who must be said is an amazing dude,

114
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.960
graciously agreed to demonstrate that you can in fact create the conditions of

115
00:07:19.961 --> 00:07:23.020
that massive lake inside a tiny little test too. Oh,

116
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.830
can somebody hold this road of in here and I'll get the tube set up inside his

117
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:30.100
freezer. Grabbed his trusty Falcon. Yup. This is called a falcon tube.

118
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.280
Just a blessing too. Filled with water. No, this is not normal water.

119
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.060
This is the really nice water. It's very, very pure water. No minerals,

120
00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:37.780
no Dustin.

121
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.810
They're like super distilled and he says when you take water like that and you

122
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:45.730
cool it down, you can get it far below its freezing point and it won't freeze.

123
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.160
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

124
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.970
<v 0>unless that is, you happened to have a horse. You have a tiny horse here.</v>

125
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.050
We have a tiny office and we're going to drop that into the Falcon Tube and do

126
00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:59.460
that. That's going to be awesome. So he handed us the tube.

127
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.110
I'm holding a little vile of super cooled water. What? Alex?

128
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.240
What temperature do you think this is that am I going to make money?

129
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.810
This is mine. Minus 20 c c Celsius. Wait,

130
00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:15.240
when does water freeze and says zero. So it's 20 degrees below freezing point.

131
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.570
It's still water, but now for long cause we unscrewed the cap. Are you?

132
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:19.553
Are you filming?

133
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.210
We held a little plastic horse over the tube countdown or something. Okay.

134
00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:28.650
On the count of three. Guilty. All right. Three, two, one.

135
00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:37.960
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

136
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.050
<v 0>for dad because the moment that little plastic cores hit the water,</v>

137
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:43.060
the water is slammed into ice.

138
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.900
Suddenly that little guy was trapped in an ice cube. Oh my God.

139
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.140
He's Thor's is frozen. That's amazing.

140
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.570
Please remember the portion was plastic.

141
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:00.930
No animals were harmed in this experiment. Is this honestly breathtaking?

142
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.820
It happens so fast.

143
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.580
Catastrophic ice formation just like that through the c word. Robert.

144
00:09:06.581 --> 00:09:08.560
Say it again. Catastrophic.

145
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.880
This is Virginia Walker and I'm in the department of Biology Queens University.

146
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:16.690
Virginia was one of the many people that we called up to ask like what the hell?

147
00:09:16.691 --> 00:09:18.820
Like why does this happen? It shouldn't.

148
00:09:18.821 --> 00:09:22.480
This water just frees gradually the way that most water does, you know,

149
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.550
at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or whatever. No, actually, so you see,

150
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.310
this is why we have to start at the beginning. As Julie Andrews says,

151
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.550
a very good place to start. Right? Alright.

152
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.700
So the only reason that water freezes normally at zero Celsius and 32 Fahrenheit

153
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.980
is that the something that that makes it freeze? We call that a nuclear later.

154
00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.100
Sounds like a superhero. Yeah. All right,

155
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:54.890
so then you can eat 10 a nuclear is like a seed, right?

156
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.850
Didn't know this,

157
00:09:55.851 --> 00:10:00.620
but it turns out water almost always needs a seed in order to grow ice.

158
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.880
So it turns out water by itself is not actually that good at remembering how to

159
00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:08.340
become ice. That is Aaron pedit.

160
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.420
She is a glaciologist at the University of Alaska.

161
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:13.940
Fairbanks in which means is that when water cools down,

162
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:16.190
the molecules start to slow their movement.

163
00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:19.850
They get a little bit closer together and at that point they want all hold hands

164
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:20.900
and become ice set.

165
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:24.890
The water molecules don't quite remember very well how they're supposed to be

166
00:10:24.891 --> 00:10:28.040
organized. They're like, wait, do you stand here and I stand here.

167
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.030
How do we do this? Again,

168
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.120
they need to be shown what combination of angles work the best to create a nice

169
00:10:35.121 --> 00:10:39.200
stable structure. What they need is say a speck of dust.

170
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.160
That's the nuclear he's throwing some dust into otherwise pure water.

171
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.290
Now they have a guide because ice can start to mimic whatever the,

172
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.480
the shape of the dust particle is who,

173
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.940
what happens is that the water molecules start to form a cage around the dust

174
00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:57.800
particle and that cage shape is very similar to the shape they need to make ice

175
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.180
and suddenly they're like, oh, that's how we do it. So in a sense,

176
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:06.400
the dust particle is reminding the watermelon qls how to freeze.

177
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.210
Well, no, I don't think of it like that.

178
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.090
Virginia says it's actually a not quite so gentle.

179
00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:17.290
Really what's happening is the dust particle is forcing the water molecules into

180
00:11:17.291 --> 00:11:20.680
the right shape around it. It's like a, it's like a command.

181
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:23.830
It's nothing about memory. It's, it's, it's a physical thing.

182
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.580
They just get jammed in there. Wow. Let's just like Julie Andrews, like a Nazi.

183
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:31.920
So then these, these, these ice.

184
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:39.790
Okay, so if as we just learned water needs a catalyst to nucleate or in order to

185
00:11:39.791 --> 00:11:40.690
freeze,

186
00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:46.050
does it this at least raise the possibility that that Finnish Russian lake had

187
00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:50.320
reached a super cooled state along come these horses and they were the

188
00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:53.290
nucleators. Maybe they had dust on their hair or whatever. I know,

189
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.660
but whatever it was, it started a chain reaction.

190
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.580
Ice Spread outward from these horses shot across the entire lake and froze the

191
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:03.190
whole damn thing at once.

192
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:10.690
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

195
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.490
can hold yours there. All right,

196
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.070
we're going to take a break and we will continue this meaningless tussle in just

197
00:12:25.071 --> 00:12:25.904
a moment.

<v 0>Okay, so Jad Robert Radiolab.</v>

211
00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:25.890
Before the break we posited what I thought was an interesting theory, Robert,

212
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.830
not buying it. Yeah. We'll get to your skepticism in a moment,

213
00:13:28.831 --> 00:13:33.831
but I want to talk a little bit more about nucleators for a second because when

214
00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:36.950
we were talking with Virginia, she told us something kind of cool. Uh,

215
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.270
we asked her like, what else? Uh, nucleates ice, like we learned about dust,

216
00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:47.220
but what else can do it? Okay, so the best nuclear later is ice itself.

217
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:47.761
She says,

218
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:51.510
if a little bit of snow falls into some water or a little bit ice forms in the

219
00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:55.230
water, organically, the water molecules will rush around that and Bam,

220
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.880
if you don't have ice,

221
00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:02.180
what is the second best thing to nucleate this ice happens to be bacteria.

222
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.140
Turns out she says there are three different kinds of bacteria.

223
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:09.880
They can generate these special proteins,

224
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.380
[inaudible] protein that can instantly turn water into ice. In fact,

225
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:17.680
when we were reporting this story of video started circulating on the Internet,

226
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.710
it showed a scientist taken a bottle of water, squirting coat,

227
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.990
a little bit of this bacteria in, and then the thing just shocked in the ice.

228
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:30.120
And the cool thing is these bacteria are actually plant pathogens,

229
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.170
plant killers,

230
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.350
and so you've probably seen grass growing in your backyard or whatever and it

231
00:14:35.351 --> 00:14:36.940
can be all covered with frost,

232
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.490
but then you know the frost can melt and it's still green. Yeah,

233
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.850
but if those bacteria present,

234
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.020
she says they'll spit out their proteins onto the plant,

235
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.260
which generates these ice crystals, the ice crystals,

236
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.420
then slice the plant open and expose the inside of the plant.

237
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.170
At the bacteria say, hmm, yummy. He has lunch and the eat the uh,

238
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:01.880
eat the inside of the plant. It's a good strategy, but that's not the cool part.

239
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.560
Virginia says she is also found these proteins in bacteria that don't kill

240
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:09.230
plants. So that made me think, made her wonder why,

241
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:11.360
like why would they need to make ice?

242
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.360
And that's when it occurred to her and a few other researchers.

243
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.880
Maybe it's about transportation. Exactly what we'll think about it.

244
00:15:19.881 --> 00:15:23.330
These bacteria are just sitting on these plants and what happens is

245
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.510
<v 3>the wind comes along,</v>

246
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.730
blows up this little bacteria into the upper atmosphere,

247
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:34.080
blows them literally up into the clouds. They're not particularly cold hardy.

248
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:37.500
So now they have a situation, they do not want to be all the way up there.

249
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.600
They got to get back down to the earth.

250
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.860
And unless they hitch a ride on those horses that you keep talking about,

251
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.270
they're so light, they might not come down to earth. So what they do,

252
00:15:48.271 --> 00:15:50.250
she suspects is they use the plant trick.

253
00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:54.390
They spit out these proteins into the cold wet cloud,

254
00:15:54.391 --> 00:15:58.350
which galvanizes the water molecules around them. To form

255
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.380
a snowflake around their body.

256
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.160
So now they've got this little hovercraft that they can use to coast on down

257
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.840
fifth, they make ice,

258
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:16.220
they can get back down and they can get back down in a different place and start

259
00:16:16.221 --> 00:16:19.940
a new colony of bacteria somewhere else. And so by this way,

260
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:24.340
they get disbursed around the whole Earth. Think about that.

261
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.680
The next time it's winter and it's snows.

262
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.580
Apparently if you melt each snowflake,

263
00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.040
you will find a little bacterium inside it.

264
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.680
<v 0>You're saying all of them, all the stuff. I,</v>

265
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.870
I haven't looked at every single snowflake, of course,

266
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.070
but it makes perfect sense, doesn't it? That's a myth. That's a very,

267
00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:44.690
very cool idea. Yeah.

268
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.960
I suddenly like the bacteria Movio hell of a lot better than the horse movie.

269
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.460
So at least I, I've, you know, and, and, and at least has a shot at being true.

270
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.770
Yeah. The horses.

271
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:04.020
So when we were reporting this story and talking to Aaron Pettit and Virginia

272
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.390
Walker and a bunch of other scientists, when we asked them,

273
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.080
could an entire leg have flash frozen in an instant,

274
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.600
trapping all those horses uniformly? The answer that we got was no.

275
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.630
Did you hear her? No. There. Did you hear the sound of it?

276
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.610
Let me ask it to a different way. When you say absolutely not,

277
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.710
just to kind of a gentle no,

278
00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.870
I'd say that's an absolutely not because as Aaron told us,

279
00:17:30.871 --> 00:17:33.540
when you're talking about freezing an entire lake,

280
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.390
well you've got a lot of problems to consider. First.

281
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:41.460
The process of freezing actually is a source of heat itself because like when

282
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:43.830
water molecules form bonds to make ice,

283
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:48.660
that's a lot of activity and activity produces energy and now that's gonna make

284
00:17:48.661 --> 00:17:49.710
things a bit warmer.

285
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:53.190
Not to mention the fact that horses are warm blood in animals,

286
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.820
so they also would slow down the process of freezing. Right. Also,

287
00:17:56.821 --> 00:18:00.030
the water would never have been pure enough to super cool in the first place

288
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:00.893
because there's,

289
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:06.050
there's too many things in the lake that would provide that initial nucleation

290
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:10.380
plants, organisms, dirt. Dammit. Did somebody actually see this?

291
00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:14.220
What is the actual evidence that um, no,

292
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:19.740
nobody saw any of this as it actually happened when we told Walter Marsh with

293
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:23.790
the scientists, told us in typical, uh, Walter Mertz fashion,

294
00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:28.791
he was IC calm and he reminded us that he never told us it was true that mallet

295
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.080
parte often mixed fact and fiction.

296
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:35.310
And that the real reason he was attracted to this story was because it offered a

297
00:18:35.311 --> 00:18:39.300
metaphor for cosmology right at the beginning of the universe.

298
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.360
Really. I mean, we, I feel,

299
00:18:42.361 --> 00:18:45.200
excuse me if a small bit of skepticism will do things,

300
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.650
it's true for the universe. Metaphor, metaphor, metaphor, even.

301
00:18:49.651 --> 00:18:52.830
So come on. What does he mean? What did he mean? Here's what he means.

302
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.070
And if you're a physicist listening right now, just turn off the radio.

303
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.810
So we're just talking among ourselves here, right?

304
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.030
So you can think of it in one of two ways, right?

305
00:19:03.031 --> 00:19:07.500
The first is that idea of super cooling that we saw at Rockefeller where under

306
00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:11.670
the right circumstances, water can cool down way below its freezing point,

307
00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.580
not freeze. And then all of a sudden

308
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.040
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

309
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.980
<v 0>and you can suddenly do that, which we saw at Rockefeller in the test tube. Now,</v>

310
00:19:23.981 --> 00:19:28.090
according to Janell 11 professor of physics and astronomy, Barnet College,

311
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.020
Columbia University,

312
00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:34.120
the metaphor holds because that bizarro flash freezing phenomenon actually

313
00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:38.650
happened repeatedly. She says in the moments after the Big Bang, yes,

314
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.310
Super Cooling is definitely something that happens in the early universe.

315
00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:47.400
She says right when the universe got it start, it was still small,

316
00:19:47.401 --> 00:19:50.310
like the size of a grapefruit inside there. Grapefruit,

317
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:55.320
it was extremely hot back then. It was probably a million, trillion, trillion,

318
00:19:55.321 --> 00:19:59.490
trillion times hotter. [inaudible] million, trillion, trillion, trillion,

319
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:04.350
10 to the 32 times hotter, but as a little grapefruit began to expand,

320
00:20:04.351 --> 00:20:08.430
the temperature started to drop and it dropped and drop to a point where the

321
00:20:08.431 --> 00:20:11.160
universe should freeze, so to speak,

322
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.760
but it didn't and it's waiting. It's waiting to freeze and you're like,

323
00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:18.630
what's happening? Why aren't you freezing? Then suddenly, oh, there it goes.

324
00:20:18.631 --> 00:20:23.090
Phase change, so go ahead. Okay. I don't know exactly what you're saying.

325
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.130
We keep going. All I'm saying is there's a lot of face changes.

326
00:20:25.131 --> 00:20:27.230
Some of them were super cool, don't worry about it. Okay.

327
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.210
There's another parallel, which I think is actually even more interesting, um,

328
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:35.070
has to do with those seeds we talk about. So if you go back to the grapefruit,

329
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.830
okay, inside it's very, very hot.

330
00:20:38.831 --> 00:20:43.420
You've got this wash of energy and this energy is uniform, right?

331
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.283
It's [inaudible]

332
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:46.080
<v 8>all [inaudible]</v>

333
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.430
<v 0>the same thing spread</v>

334
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.580
<v 9>evenly, everywhere, the same. But then as things cool,</v>

335
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:55.840
you begin to get these tiny fluctuations,

336
00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:01.050
little variations in temperature and density where it's a little bit harder and

337
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.920
denser in one point than another.

338
00:21:02.921 --> 00:21:07.370
We're talking about clumps like maybe over here is a little bit more matter in

339
00:21:07.371 --> 00:21:11.010
heap and over there, and these are our, see,

340
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:15.040
I see. I don't think that you're describing seeds like I understand.

341
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.110
See if seeds are little things that happen, things that track other stuff. No,

342
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:19.241
no.

343
00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:24.241
But these behave just like seeds because as the universe cools down and expands

344
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:28.270
and begins to add all these new forces and all these new particles, gravity,

345
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.340
electron, photons, atoms,

346
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.340
those little bits of variation from the beginning are still there.

347
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.060
And now they're growing bigger because now we have gravity, right?

348
00:21:37.061 --> 00:21:41.740
So a little concentrations of stuff are now attracting more stuff and more stuff

349
00:21:41.741 --> 00:21:43.870
and more stuff. And as the universe expands,

350
00:21:43.871 --> 00:21:48.280
they expand into ultimately those little blips have become these massive

351
00:21:48.281 --> 00:21:49.520
objects. Amazing. Yeah.

352
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.920
The the largest structures that we know about in the universe have their seeds

353
00:21:53.921 --> 00:21:55.330
in these tiny fluctuations.

354
00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:00.120
<v 10>What does that mean? When you go on a,</v>

355
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.930
on a star wars kind of voyage?

356
00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:07.380
So you're in your spaceship and you're going at some incredibly high speeds,

357
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:12.410
you're rushing through the universe and you see huge clouds of gas with

358
00:22:13.201 --> 00:22:17.310
nurseries for stars and you leave them and you go to a galaxy and then another

359
00:22:17.311 --> 00:22:19.350
galaxy. Here's a galaxy over here and a galaxy over there.

360
00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.860
And collectively here you're saying that these massive structures,

361
00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:26.500
walls of galaxies, neighborhoods of stars,

362
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:31.580
there's going are reflections of a very early moment when something went right

363
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.730
<v 9>in the initial broil of stuff like this.</v>

364
00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.710
Some beautiful structures that you're describing are like the snowflakes around

365
00:22:40.711 --> 00:22:41.730
the little bit of dust.

366
00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.351
What does that mean?

367
00:22:46.351 --> 00:22:50.850
That the empty spaces that we see when we gaze at the current universe are

368
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.410
actually filled with something that hasn't cooled yet or that isn't quite or

369
00:22:55.411 --> 00:22:57.780
isn't visible to us or is working under different rules?

370
00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.670
If I can hijack your question,

371
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.880
I can say we might not have seen the last of the phase transitions.

372
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:06.960
Our Universe is absolutely continuing to cool. Is it really? Yeah,

373
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.000
it's very cold right now. We have this, uh,

374
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:16.040
dark energy driving the universe to expand at an ever accelerated rate and it's

375
00:23:16.231 --> 00:23:20.550
conceivable that in the future that energy will endure some phase transition and

376
00:23:20.551 --> 00:23:25.500
it will go away or, or decay to something else in this new state of matter.

377
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.750
It might do something different to the evolution of the universe.

378
00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.050
So we might have a phase transition in our future.

379

Tish Boucher for sure. And Marine Bhutto,

387
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.060
the super cool people at Rockefeller University.

388
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.800
Genie Garbarino Phillip Kid, and of course Alexander Petrov. Thanks also to

Jeffers Sandstrom Inger Herberg Mark Martin, Martin troffer,

390
00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.410
Mark Tuckerman and Jason Wexler.

391
00:24:18.411 --> 00:24:21.590
And sincere thanks to all the listeners from Facebook and Twitter who helped us

392
00:24:21.591 --> 00:24:25.100
translate Russian and Finnish books. Oh, and uh,

393
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:29.600
certainly last but not least, Walter merge for being my hero.

394
00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.080
Chad loves you. I love you. And more importantly,

395
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:36.690
he released a book translating Malaparte Day from, uh,

396
00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:41.540
Italian to English, uh, which is where we got the story of the, uh,

397
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.830
of the horses falling in the lake.

398
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.040
It's called the bird that swallowed it's cage.

399
00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:49.870
The selected writings have Curzio Malaparte Day. All right. So that's,

400
00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:53.930
that's us saying, oh, wait, one more thing. One more thing. Go to our website,

401
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:58.990
radiolab.org and you can see videos we shot at Rockefeller of water turning into

402
00:25:00.321 --> 00:25:03.380
ice. In a flash, super cooling right in front of your eyes. It's amazing.

403
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.890
radiolab.org I'm jet. Boom. Rod. I'm Robert Quote,

404
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.450
