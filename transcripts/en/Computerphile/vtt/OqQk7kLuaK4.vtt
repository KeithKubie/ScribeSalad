The spinner is that little that little circle that little wheel of dots that sort of spins around in the video window

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.489
[when] all of a sudden we've run out of video to play we have not sent the video to your computer fast enough the buffering

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.849
Circle is my nemesis it may be one of the most

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.750
unwelcome

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.750
animations on the Internet

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.050
The biggest problem that we're trying to attack today is how do we get rid of the spinner?

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.640
how do we make it so that as you're watching a video it never stops until you get to the end and

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.540
It's it's a big challenge. [it's] it has a lot of different dimensions, and there's so many things that can go wrong and

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.049
Some of them are under our control and some of them are not under our control the buffering strategy to youtube videos

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:49.559
Is different depending on where you watch them in some cases the video you'll start to download it and off it goes

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.419
In other cases you download it in pieces like [it] sliced bread in general

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.930
We prefer to download in pieces because it lets you adapt it means that you can

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.299
Decide that things are great and give people a high quality video or you can decide that things aren't going to not going so well

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.260
And you could downgrade and try to make the playback smoother the spinner looks the way

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.369
It does it's there just to at least to give you some notion that we're still trying

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.909
but we don't spend a [lot] of time figuring out how to

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.470
Make it look nicer. We spend more time figuring out how to make it go away

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.639
Spinner itself is actually it's a [Jif]

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.650
It's a chip sitting there

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.869
Yeah, it's just is [just] sitting there going round and round and round well it depends YouTube videos play in so many places

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.019
There are many different versions there are

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.930
jpegs [there] are csS

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.329
animations there are

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.629
Flash animations when someone uploads a video to us we then take that video and we create a whole

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.868
bunch of different files out of it and those files represent

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.960
different levels of quality different levels of

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.978
Bandwidth and you can see this if you use the youtube player you have that little selector which says you know 720p 480p

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.159
360p 240p those are all the different files. There are some one that's for example if

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.110
You shot a video on your phone, and it's very very small. There's not much gained by making one. That's very very large

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.000
So there are some constraints in that way in addition to those files those files themselves are

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.780
Chopped up into small pieces so for each of those files

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.740
We [have] these pieces that [represent] a couple seconds of video the actual size

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.589
can [vary] and that's something we play around with

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.410
From time to time to [see] if it has any impact on the reliability of the streaming one of the challenges that we have to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.979
Deal with is getting to all these different devices that [support] different formats, and so we actually we have them

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.149
We have these as [Mp4] [s] you know using the h.264 codec

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.720
We have these as webm files with the VP8 and VP9

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.040
Codecs we also have these as 3GP files with some other MpEG-4 codecs to reach older phones

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.229
So not only have you got all of these videos being uploaded every day

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.780
You're then turning them into all these different resolutions, and all these different file formats

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.940
We have a pretty large set of formats and resolutions that we support at the end of the day

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.799
So when I upload this video how many different formats will it be existing in?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.500
that's a really good [question] and

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.550
Personally I've almost lost count

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.179
It's it's certainly a couple dozen google has a lot of different data centers [around] the world and we also have

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.100
You know a network of caches [that] sort of deployed with you various isPs around the world

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.959
So as you as you're sort of dividing up as you're uploading this video creating all these different formats

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.929
Chopping those formats up into pieces then you're putting each of those videos in whatever data center that

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.970
may happen to have space

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.820
we're making a couple of replicas to make sure we don't lose it and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.280
Then over time as [people] watch the video

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.709
It will get sort of it will get further

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.739
Distributed to different places so that it's close to where the people are watching it. It's pretty amazing isn't it it's pretty fun

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.069
It's a pretty big system. It's one of the cool things [about] working here is it's

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.709
That there aren't many systems like it in the world

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.660
So there's any host of things that can go wrong when we're trying when we're trying to play a video

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.169
you know it could be that you're using your computer and

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.709
Your computer is doing a lot of different things at the same [time] it could be that you're on a wi-Fi [Network]

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.418
That is kind of like a little bit weak like especially imagine. You're at a hotel and [you] know hotel

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.630
Wi-Fi is let's the undertow bad it could just be that

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.390
There's a lot of activity going on in your iSp and in your neighborhood

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.399
It could be that no one in your

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.070
Area has ever watched this video before so we don't have a copy close by and we [have] to go to a [faraway] server to

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.520
Get it the key message. Here is just that there's an inordinately

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.320
But some of which we can't control directly and so the best we can do and the thing we feel very compelled to do is

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.489
Work around these problems to the best. We can and [make] them invisible to you

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.020
this is why we chopped the video up into small pieces [the] thing that you connect with

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.989
Gathers those pieces and puts them in order so [they] can play back in sequence as you're watching the video

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.880
It's you know. It's getting the next piece and the next piece and it's looking a couple pieces ahead

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.780
Well, they don't have to be in order

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.470
YouTube videos it can be broken into pieces

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.259
And then delivered out of order or also you could break them up so that the audio is in one piece and that the video

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.390
Is in another and so then when [you]?

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.880
When you watch them the thing that you're watching puts them back together as it gets to each piece its

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.089
Observing, how fast it was able [to] retrieve that piece

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.580
It's like I got this hd piece, and it downloaded really quickly so I can keep getting hD

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.879
Or it might say the hD pieces are starting to come in slowly

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.350
And I'm not going to be able to maintain that if I keep asking for HD

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.950
eventually [I]

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.670
[know] the user is going to watch the video faster than I can get the video and you're going to have that spinner and

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.059
So then I would say for the next piece. I'm going to go get the 480p piece or the 360p piece instead

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.670
To make sure that the video keeps going on uninterrupted and of course. We do the reverse as well

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.640
It could be that you're watching the video at 360 p

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.189
But we noticed that it's really fast and we say

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.119
Okay, you have a really fast connection next time I'm going to upgrade you to hD behind the scenes magic

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.420
You don't have to do anything, and we give you a better quality when you see the buffer spinner

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.080
We retry [we'll] try to get another video that

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.749
We think might play more smoothly youtube should just work, and you're welcome to make choices as they're presented

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.290
But you shouldn't have to

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.229
It's really up to us to try to make the video play as as best it can and what we would like to do is

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.329
Give you not just one that's adequate one. That's beautiful

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.270
That's that's hd that has great sound and that's our goal, and we should bring that to you

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.780
You shouldn't have to ask

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:53.119
This is our responsibility to make better, and we're not done until no one ever sees that spinner and people still see that spinner

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.269
Yeah, we we collect the data we monitor the forums

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:03.319
We know it's still happening, and we're constantly tuning and investigating and trying to figure out okay if people are still seeing the spinner

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.569
Why does it have something to do with?

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.840
The type of Network they have does it have something to do with the country

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.820
They're in does it have something to do with the video

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:17.180
They're watching the relationship from people's device to the internet is probably [the] one that's fraught with the most variation

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.099
one of the big challenges is the fact that we're trying to support a

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:25.970
huge range of different types of environments

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:33.230
You know everything from someone watching a video on their phone in India to watching a video on a new 4K?

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.789
TV with gigot with a gigabit connection in the [u.s.], do I feel that people blame me for

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.370
YouTube's Performance issues I

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.910
Think they do

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:47.119
Blame me for you, too performance issues, but I think that they're correct. [I] don't think there's any approach out there

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.120
That's been suggested or any

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.720
Technique that's been out that out there. That is probably not part of our

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.809
bundle of tricks the Burden of proof on

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.360
YouTube is to work and

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.980
If you're not getting if the video doesn't play as you wish then you should ask why?

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.439
We make sense for us to walk [in] and say guys you know

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.219
I'm feeling like we ought to put a higher weight on something even if I were to

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.630
Feel that we ought to put a higher way than one watch 26 27 zeros

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.760
And then a few ones for every single character that is incredibly wasteful
