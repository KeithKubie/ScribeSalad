1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,460
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,490
This is radio lab and today
we're talking about color. Okay.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,590
And that actually brings
us back to Jane Nights.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,700
I'm a professor of Ophthalmology,
university of Washington, Seattle.

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,020
Jay has actually spent his entire career
trying to get creatures to see colors

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,860
that they normally can't see.
Well, yeah. And he started,

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,090
this is kind of an interesting story,

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,440
a by taking some colorblind monkeys who
couldn't see red. They have blue cones,

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,400
green cones, but no red cones, which
is not unlike a lot of human males.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,263
In any case,

11
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,380
he had these monkeys and was able to take
the human gene for the red cone rabbit

12
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:38,250
and a virus injected into
the monkey's eyes and Bam,

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,800
the monkeys suddenly had red
cones. Yeah. So it had blue,

14
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,960
green, and red. Was this like
Lasik? So it was just like a,

15
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:50,370
a 10 minute outpatient situation
for the monkeys. I would say close,

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,450
close to Lasik. Could they
then now see red? Well,

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,300
every single morning before
they get their breakfast,

18
00:00:57,301 --> 00:00:59,820
they have to do their
color vision test. So,

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,030
so we'd say each monkey at a computer,

20
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,670
we add a touch screen and the
screen looks totally gray, man.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,850
We bought that field of gray.

22
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:12,600
He adds a little red blob
right now. Here's the key.

23
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,240
We use grape juice as the reinforcement
for the monkeys. But the game is, yeah,

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,630
the touch the blob before you get
your juice. So before the surgery,

25
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:26,040
they weren't seeing any blobs and they
weren't getting any juice because all

26
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:26,910
they could see was gray.

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,210
So a little red block could be right
there in front of them and they never see

28
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:34,680
it. And the morning after, they're
a lasix color booster shot. Okay,

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,660
that's true. Did you see it? They

30
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,990
still couldn't see it.

31
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,440
Day after day they would do their
tests and everyday they would fail.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,700
Every day they would fail

33
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,690
and

34
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,470
no blob, no juice. But it's fun for them.

35
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,890
They get out of their cage and
they talk to their friends.

36
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:57,880
And then did you fail? Fail. Okay.

37
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,680
You got up the other day, another fail

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,730
until one morning after about 20 weeks,

39
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,970
Jay woke up the monkeys gave them
the test and they began to not fail.

40
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,260
Really, if you watched the video of this,

41
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,080
it actually looks like the
monkey is like, wow, you know,

42
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:24,880
I'm not having any failures and check
out this dot. Look at this thing.

43
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,620
Check it out.

44
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,620
But I did get some sense that they
felt like that their life had improved.

45
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,790
[inaudible] well, if this
works so well with the monkeys,

46
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:40,180
couldn't you take a colorblind human
and give them back the thing they're

47
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:41,530
missing? Absolutely.

48
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,420
We could cure colorblindness in a
human with exactly this technique.

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,830
We really,

50
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,830
the only thing that we have to do is
convince the FDA that the risks are low

51
00:02:55,511 --> 00:02:58,840
enough and the benefit is high enough
that it'd be something we could do and

52
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,440
have never tried it or
no, we've never tried it.

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,000
Although I get a lot of emails that
say I don't care what the risks are.

54
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,230
I've even had offers.

55
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,100
How bout if I come to your laboratory
and you don't tell anybody late at night

56
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,280
and you give me the shot in the
eye and we won't tell anyone,

57
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,710
which brings us back to
our original question.

58
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,550
If you can take a colorblind human
and give them normal color vision,

59
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:26,551
could you take a normal color seer and
boost them to make them a little more

60
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:31,750
shrimpy? Well, yes. Yeah.

61
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,400
We said, sure, why not. But then
there's the whole FDA thing.

62
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,590
But here's the real surprise.

63
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,000
J says there were some people who are
already a little bit mantis shrimp,

64
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,520
like there are colored mutants,

65
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,580
if I may call them that in the nicest
possible way among us or they're out there

66
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:51,754
in theory.

67
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,740
Okay, so here's the deal. The genes
for the cones in our eyes see color.

68
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,880
You have the red queen blue cones. Yep.
They're on the x chromosome. Now men,

69
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:05,090
as we know, only have one of those
women have two x chromosomes,

70
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,930
which means that women have two
sets of these cone making genes.

71
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,410
Normally one said it's just
a spare. It's not used,

72
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:15,950
but still they've got two
sets. And so someone said, Aha,

73
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,470
it is theoretically
possible. Then some women,

74
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:21,350
this spare set of jeans
might mix up, turn on,

75
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,850
morph into a whole new cone, a forth comb.

76
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,730
We're going to call it the yellow cone.

77
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,920
So people with normal color vision are
trichromatic cause we've got three cones.

78
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,710
A woman like that would
be a tetra Chromat.

79
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,180
So altogether she'd have a blue
cone, a green cone, a yellow cone,

80
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:42,610
and a red count, but she
wouldn't just see more yellow.

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,890
This new yellow would mix with the red
and the blue and the green to create

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,980
thousands, maybe millions
of more shades of color.

83
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,450
This amazing technicolor
is not the right word.

84
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,430
It's whatever would be
the DEX kind of color.

85
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:02,290
That would be even more super duper.
This was just the thought experiment.

86
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,310
Yeah, but Jay actually figured
out a way to test for this.

87
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,840
We can look in people's blood and I can
say this woman has the genes for blue

88
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,000
cones, green cons, yellow
cones, red cones. You can
do a DNA test. Really? Yeah.

89
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,290
So he started doing blood tests
and he found this one woman,

90
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,450
she worked at the same place we did
crazily enough at the university.

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,600
He looked at her DNA and he saw
the gene for the fourth coat.

92
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,973
Yeah. Wow.

93
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,280
So did she see in super technicolor
or how would you even know that was,

94
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,090
that was a problem.

95
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,520
And so we thought of an experiment in
order to be able to see whether or not she

96
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:44,680
had this extra dimension of Color Vision.

97
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,030
He was able to produce these two
yellow lights that to us, you know,

98
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:52,210
trichromatic normal track
Crummins look totally identical.

99
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,990
We're color blind to that
difference. But to a Tetra Chromat,

100
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,780
a woman with this fourth cone, they
would look totally different. Yeah.

101
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,010
So they brought her in.
I said, okay, here it is.

102
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:09,010
Do you see these as different?
And she said, no, no,

103
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,750
I don't see them as any to know,

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,930
but the story doesn't end there. Good.

105
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,700
Jay told us about a colleague of his
in England because she's at New Castle

106
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,080
named Gabrielle Jordan,

107
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:24,110
and she apparently found eight of
these women with the extra cone.

108
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:25,130
And out of those eight,

109
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:30,131
seven of those women behave exactly like
the person that I had tested couldn't

110
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:31,274
see the difference,

111
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,210
but one of them took one look at
those two yellows and said no,

112
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:40,190
they look totally different to me.
Oh, one of these women was saw.

113
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,660
The south side is different.

114
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:45,500
So one of them had the Koan but you could
use it and the others had the cone but

115
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:49,640
couldn't use it or yup.
So why is that? Yeah, why?

116
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,980
Well this is the part if you'd like,

117
00:06:51,981 --> 00:06:55,550
I could tell you what my theory
is of what's going on. Yeah,

118
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,180
so I think that right,

119
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:57,831
Jace has,

120
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:02,710
let's just imagine you grew up in a world
without color completely and totally a

121
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,770
black and white world houses would be
painted black and white printers with all

122
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:10,190
the print in black and white. Even the TV,

123
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,060
they would just have black and white TV.
Women's makeup would be just, you know,

124
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,350
either dark or light.

125
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,980
So it wouldn't make any difference if
you had color vision because you would

126
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,980
never use that color vision.
There'd be no words for color.

127
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,800
[inaudible]

128
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,940
now, just to make an interesting,

129
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:29,890
let's imagine one day a bright
red apple plops into your world.

130
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,930
How would you react to it?

131
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,440
What'd you see it you think, well,
so that's a very good question.

132
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,970
Maybe says j. Even though you have
the ability to see that Red Apple,

133
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:45,150
if you've never had a chance to
use that ability to practice,

134
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,670
it may just lay dormant and that he thinks
might be what happens to women living

135
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,890
with the extra cone in our world.

136
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,540
They're very rarely subjected to colors
that would stimulate their extra kind of

137
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,070
cone differently.

138
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,580
So you're saying those other colors just
aren't around enough for them? Yeah.

139
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,560
Everything that we make is based on
the fact that humans are trichromatic.

140
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,450
The television only has three colors.

141
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,600
Our color printers have
three different colors.

142
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,920
There's nothing out there that we make
artificially that a tetra chromatic could

143
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:17,430
see.

144
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,430
But Jay says maybe some women because
they're just more aware or because of the

145
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:26,790
job that they do. Maybe someone
who works with color all the time,

146
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,040
like a florist or a
painter, little by little

147
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,840
because they're paying
such close attention,

148
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,420
their brain would learn
to see that difference.

149
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,193
[inaudible]

150
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:51,510
so naturally we wanted to find one of
these mythic labels in that mythic.

151
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:52,420
Maybe I say

152
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,810
that as it,

153
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,590
cause we tried to find that one woman
that he mentioned you the one out of

154
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,070
eight.

155
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,300
Yeah. And we had a really hard time and
we began to doubt that she even existed.

156
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,260
And then we began to look online and
you see all these websites thing,

157
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,900
are you a tetra Chromat
contact us, contact us.

158
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,970
Everybody is searching for these women.

159
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,940
And we began to feel like you were
chasing Unicorns a little bit.

160
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,960
But then our producer Tim Howard claimed,

161
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,930
he claimed that he had
found one calculating. Yeah,

162
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:21,330
you are right on the parish street.

163
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,110
He'd been in touch with j j
told him that he tested a woman,

164
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,090
determined that she had the fourth cone
and this woman was an interior designer.

165
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,050
Oh. But Jay had not yet determined
whether she could use her fourth cone.

166
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,240
So we sent Tim to
Pittsburgh where she lives

167
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,700
right there to see what he could
find out. Hi, I'm Susan Hogan.

168
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,910
There are three and an
interior designer. Lucia,

169
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,830
like she's great or you
have a jukebox. Really?

170
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,610
You want me to play something?
How about number three? Oh seven.

171
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:55,490
It just seems appropriate cause it's
about color. Wider shade of Pam.

172
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,130
Um, she told me a lot about
how she uses color in her work.

173
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:05,600
You see the different colors of paint
because she thinks a lot about it in terms

174
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:09,590
of painting walls. I know the way
the sun is oriented in a room,

175
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,940
each wall will look a different color
even though in any case, here's my plan.

176
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,790
I ordered this test before
I went to Pittsburgh that
Jay had suggested I get at.

177
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,270
Okay. Alright. Open it, open it up.

178
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,840
It involved these little
pieces of brown fabric. Okay.

179
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,490
They all look identical. They
look strikingly the same to me.

180
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,320
Yeah. Lynn, Brenna, me, Soren. Those
are completely indistinguishable.

181
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,390
Couldn't see a difference. They
all look the same to you guys. Yes,

182
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,720
but I'm assuming they're actually not
all the same. That's the trick. Jay said,

183
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,360
if you show them to a real tetra Chromat,

184
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,410
they're going to be able to see these
subtle differences that you know,

185
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,790
you and I can't see.

186
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,980
And I'm back to Pittsburgh. So how about
we head over toward that tree? Is that,

187
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,200
that looked good. Take my shoes off.
Oh yeah. It'll be much more fun for me.

188
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,250
We ended up doing the test in a nearby
park. We're going to do a bunch of these,

189
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,510
if you don't mind. The first trial
I took out three of the swatches,

190
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,220
two that were exactly the same and
one that was supposedly different.

191
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,550
And when you took it out, could you
see the difference? No. No. Huh.

192
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,350
So I go behind the tree
and I whisper into the mic.

193
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,870
Number three is different. Number
three, I hope you couldn't hear me.

194
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,500
Yeah, I'll let you take a look.

195
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,200
She steps back in the swatches,

196
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,650
gives a look for a moment and then she
says number three said third one is

197
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:38,720
different. It's more neutral, less
red than one and two on the left.

198
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,370
One for one luck. So I went
behind the tree eye on second,

199
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:48,020
changed up the swatches so that now the
middle swatch was the odd one out and

200
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:50,390
same, same deal. Ready, set, go easy.

201
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,750
Which number? It looks different.
The middle middling number two.

202
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,570
You are right? Yeah. Wow. Okay.

203
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,530
Then I figured I got to make it
harder. I switched it up and I made it.

204
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,870
So all three are different
and I didn't tell her,

205
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,630
oh three are different.

206
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,760
[inaudible]

207
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,160
all three different I o green,

208
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:19,080
red less red as I'm knocking
it out of the park. I didn't,

209
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:23,320
I do as well on my sats.
Tim. Wow. You found her.

210
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,780
I was sure that she was not going to
be, there's no way this test can work.

211
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,360
Well, it actually might not
have totally worked. Right.

212
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,620
What did she start to fail there? There's
one little thing I didn't mention,

213
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,380
but I brought along a friend, um,
Jason Lacroix, painter landscape,

214
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,850
still life thought. I try him out as
a control cause you were thinking, uh,

215
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,200
let's get someone who likes color but
as a boy and can't be a Tetra Karma.

216
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,790
Right. Okay. So, and, uh, when we
tried the exact same tests with him,

217
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,170
I mean these three, they look the
same, don't they? To, you know,

218
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,650
I see different, he was amazing. Uh,

219
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,270
every time the first one on the last
few jumped out immediately, number one,

220
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,680
they all three look different to me.
Wow. Was he just as good as Susan? Yeah,

221
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,170
I always a little bit disappointed.
I gotta say it was no where,

222
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,870
where he couldn't do it and
she could no better than me.

223
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,090
I only had pieces of brown cloth, you
know, so it doesn't prove anything.

224
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,510
I guess she still might be a tetra
Chromat. Right. For All I know.

225
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,900
And there was this one moment I
had no, it doesn't prove anything,

226
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:32,730
but I asked her, um,

227
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,180
I asked her about the sky and the sky
was just that quintessential sky blue and

228
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,160
she was, I was like, what
do you see? And she's like,

229
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,440
see, um, do you see some of
the pink and the blue? See,

230
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,910
I see a lot of pink. Like among the blue,

231
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,290
there's red in that blue section,
she was looking up at a blue sky.

232
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:57,400
And seeing red. Yeah. Yeah.
Do you see that? No. Oh,

233
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,980
I see so much red like up here and it's,

234
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,760
uh, it's kind of a cop out, but it's
just kind of that perfect sky blue.

235
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,840
Okay. That's, that's a good,
it's just mixed in there.

236
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,400
That's cool. I think I don't see is any
green in that blue? I just see reds,

237
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:16,580
right? Especially around
the white clouded section.

238
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,250
And at that moment I felt
like my sky is boring.

239
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,340
I'm so sorry for you.
For us. I'm sorry for us.

240
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,400
No, I mean, how do we know
that any of this makes sense?

241
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,160
Yeah, that's the fine of it. Yeah.

242
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,810
So

243
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,000
[inaudible] as a minutes. Hold is

244
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,180
that phase at first just goes to

245
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,030
the Tony Shayda. Hey,

246
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,240
Brown's browns, man about me.

247
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,393
Joe's mad.

248
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,970
She's just mad about me calling him.

249
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,490
[inaudible]

250
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,180
you know, we haven't talked
about yet. What's that? Um,

251
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,250
where do the colors come from? Okay.
I mean like, like I'm sky colors. No,

252
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:40,570
no, like, like painterly colors.
Like, uh, like marine blue and, oh,

253
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:43,090
like artificial colors. Well, no,
they're not out. That's the thing.

254
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,730
You think they come from
a factory or something,

255
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:50,230
but originally they came
from the earth. Yeah.

256
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,480
And there's one story about Chloe that
has haunted me for about a year and a

257
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:00,490
half. It's so strange. I don't know
if it's true or not, but I mean,

258
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,260
I don't know if you've read my book
of good. That's Victoria Finley again.

259
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:08,230
Her book is called color. And
this story starts with, well,

260
00:16:08,231 --> 00:16:12,450
a particular kind of goop. It's
a color called Gumbos. It's um,

261
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,840
it's named after Cambodia,

262
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:19,070
a French word for Cambodia and it comes
from the SAP of a tree that grows in the

263
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:24,430
Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand border
area. And this is a yellow color.

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,980
It's a color

265
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,550
[inaudible].

266
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,300
How you get it is really
the sticky part. I mean,

267
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,600
the way they get it is that they cut a
slash in the bark and then hitch up a

268
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,770
tube made of bamboo about the
circumference of a quarter. Yes.

269
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,620
And then little droplets of goop come
on. A little tiny drop does a good,

270
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,740
and they fill up the tube

271
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,850
the same way you do. You know,
you get maple syrup or, or rubber,

272
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,630
but they leave it for a
couple of years. Years. Yes.

273
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,200
Aw.

274
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,770
All right. So it's a release

275
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,493
precious.

276
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,640
So slow drop.

277
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,940
That's some pretty strange thing. Draw up

278
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,750
[inaudible] can happen in that time.
What do you mean snap has secrets?

279
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,200
Secrets. What? Secrets. Wait a minute.

280
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,990
So after two long years,

281
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,460
the harvesters come back and each of
those tubes is now full of this. Um,

282
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,440
quite quite like plastic. It sort of,

283
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:32,840
it's got that sort of plastic
resonate kind of feel,

284
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,520
but that's just the beginning. The resin
makes this incredible transformation,

285
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:41,270
which we actually saw Sean and
I. Hello. Thanks to this guy.

286
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,910
My name is Charles
claimer. I'm a color man.

287
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,990
He owns creamers pigments in
Manhattan and he sells this Cambos.

288
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,490
It is an important yellow,

289
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,510
amazing when you use it
[inaudible] powdered and the
resin form because when you

290
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:58,520
have a look at it or to this year,

291
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,740
it's just like this and the
doll it creed Brown. Yeah.

292
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,900
You imagine like a, a ball
of earwax. I mean you think,

293
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,040
well that's not very interesting coming
out of Dusky sort of people are in

294
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,720
color, but then you put
a drop of water on it

295
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,990
or you grind it up in a bowl with a
little water in your on that it looks like

296
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:22,740
this blue. Let's see, and there it is.

297
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,560
What does a little bit of lips
bright, very bright yellows,

298
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,590
bright fluorescent yellow.
Suddenly it's like power.

299
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,900
It means it is quite an
excitedly color. Very, very loud.

300
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,080
I carried one around for ages so
I to have a look at this color,

301
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,950
look how boring it is now put a drop
of water in it showing kids and I was

302
00:18:41,951 --> 00:18:44,590
really happy. I give them,
gave it to one kid who was,

303
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:47,500
you just said you light it and it was
only afterwards that I found out that it's

304
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:51,400
so dangerous. I mean I use
dangerous. Why? Through get to bed.

305
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,883
Yeah.

306
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,160
When the guys used to chip it in in
small pieces was actually a time built in

307
00:18:59,451 --> 00:19:01,960
from the visit the toilet
at least once an hour.

308
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,710
Ian Garrett knows that because he was
technical director at this art supply

309
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:10,150
company called Windsor and Newton in
England and here's what really got us

310
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,140
interested in all this.

311
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:15,490
Back in the 1980s Winsor and Newton
would get these shipments of Cambos from

312
00:19:15,491 --> 00:19:18,520
Cambodia and they would take it
to them to this production room.

313
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,760
Quite a dusty area. Just
had a table in there,

314
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,820
big old table where the workers would
set and then they would have this hammer,

315
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,250
put the Cambos pieces on this
lump of iron and then hit it,

316
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,170
shatter it into small pieces because
that's how they make it into a kind of

317
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:36,640
usable, solvable paint.

318
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,840
And one day one of the workers was
chipping and scraping at the resin.

319
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,000
There they were, they found something
in the resin that they didn't expect.

320
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,350
They found bullets,

321
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,480
bullets in the hunks of
resin lodged in them.

322
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,100
Yet sometime in the two year
drip drip process toward the end,

323
00:19:57,101 --> 00:20:00,940
probably as the resume was getting
thick, a bullet went through the air,

324
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:04,480
went into the goop and
stayed there. Actually,

325
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,860
it wasn't just one bullet total of about
a dozen and those are just the ones he

326
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:11,800
found lying around the factory.
There were probably many more.

327
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,780
They fall into two salts.

328
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,940
That's a very sharp pointed one about
just over an inch long and then the other

329
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:21,340
type A, a small sort of barrel shapes,

330
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,780
which are about three quarters of an
inch long and half a dozen of each.

331
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,400
How they got there and what they pass
through on the way into The Gambia,

332
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,263
I'm not sure

333
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,193
[inaudible].

334
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,121
Well,

335
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:40,290
we do know of course was that those
years in Cambodia where years of war and

336
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,900
murder, a million and a
half people died there.

337
00:20:42,901 --> 00:20:46,410
Most of them in the killing fields and
that's the same place where you'd find

338
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,180
the gangbusters. I mean it's
shocking really any cause it,

339
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:53,860
those were just the random little
bamboo tubes hanging on the trees.

340
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,480
What happened in that grove?

341
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,000
The proposition here would
be that at some point,

342
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:07,570
maybe because of the famous killing fields
that some 14 year olds with collision

343
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,040
of cough rifles after finishing a
series of murders or just shot lots of

344
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:15,080
bullets, just sprayed that growth.

345
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,570
In order to get into the little tiny
bamboo canisters collecting this gunboat,

346
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,680
they would've had to have sprayed that
entire grove with machine machine gun

347
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:28,430
bullets. And in that year
or two years, um, somebody,

348
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,630
um, the ditch people I should think.

349
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,990
Yeah. Well, I mean, they, they, it's
not necessarily a battle scenario.

350
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:38,520
It could have been target practice.

351
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,770
You see these things hanging on
the side of a tree. You, you,

352
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,390
you want to practice your a marksmanship.

353
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,950
But th I mean, there is a way in which
the, there's violence in this color.

354
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:53,670
I guess. There's fine. It makes me wonder
about, does it ever give you pause?

355
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,220
[inaudible]

356
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,980
did they ever give me what,
sorry. Pause. Pause. No. Uh,

357
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,750
not really.

358
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,860
We would to remote bought it from a
guy in Holland who bought it from an

359
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:10,550
exporter who got it from
Lord knows where in Cambodia.

360
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,190
But the idea that it could've
been attached to to that.

361
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,470
Wow.

362
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,640
Bloodshed. Does that bother
you at all? You're saying them?

363
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,010
Do I think it's, it's morally acceptable.
Is that what you're asking me? Yeah.

364
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,570
Um, no. It wasn't Winsor Newton
who discovered these things?

365
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,390
These things were demanded by customers.

366
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,470
You're a hard-hearted man. I feel

367
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,290
I had never thought about it until
you, you pitched it like that.

368
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,190
As we kept on talking, Ian made it clear.

369
00:22:46,191 --> 00:22:49,220
It wasn't that he hadn't thought
about the violence per se. It's just,

370
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,070
it wasn't like breaking news to him.

371
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,130
They sell some pigments that come straight
out of hills that are right in the

372
00:22:55,131 --> 00:22:59,450
middle of war zones. Okay. Colors
are sometimes soaked in blood.

373
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,340
That's just how it is.

374
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,920
On the other side of the coin,

375
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:07,921
I've made it my career in 40 years to
make artists' paints on the basis that

376
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,360
people who paint tend not to make war.

377
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,050
It's a peaceful occupation

378
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,190
that is more or less what the Euston
George Kramer who runs the paint shop,

379
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:23,180
he was pretty much of the same mind.
You could think of it this way.

380
00:23:23,181 --> 00:23:27,050
Imagine the first person to
ever find this brilliant yellow,

381
00:23:27,051 --> 00:23:28,730
maybe 10,000 years ago.

382
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,250
He's walking through the forest after
it's rained and he sees it there on a tree

383
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,241
and he's amazed.

384
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:39,740
So he puts his finger into the yellow and
then Dab some on his face and he feels

385
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,920
instantly beautiful,
like larger than himself.

386
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,490
It is about being to something

387
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:52,500
transcendent and that just George is the
other side of the coin to an upper high

388
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,810
or whatever. Therefore,

389
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,920
[inaudible] from all sorts of
ceremonies, marriages, feasts,

390
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:05,240
maybe warpaint to feel invincible any
moment he suspects that needed to be

391
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:08,600
pulled out of the ordinary and lifted up.

392
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:13,660
And you need something that is prior to
something which is beautiful and special

393
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,370
and this yellow gives
her something special.

394
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:22,910
[inaudible]

395
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,540
it is perfect in all

396
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,003
[inaudible].

397
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,680
Thank you to Victoria Findlay. Her
book is called color, short and simple.

398
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:13,290
When to Ian Garrett, um,

399
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,230
of Windsor and Newton who did not wither
under our withering moral attack on

400
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:18,840
contrary.
