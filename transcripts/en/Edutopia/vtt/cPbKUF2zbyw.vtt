00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.039
&gt;&gt;John: We've got to find a way to reach
all kids, every kid no matter what.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:29.759
And the arts do that.

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.599
They give us ways to engage
kids, to get them involved,

00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:36.129
to have them be part of what
we want them to be a part of,

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.909
which is learning the curriculum.

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:05.809
&gt;&gt;Diane: I got here during the summer
and I had 18 letters of resignation

00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:08.289
on my desk from teachers, out of 45.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:09.799
That was really scary.

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:13.399
And then the discipline on
the first day was shocking.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.869
I'd never seen kids
that disengaged before.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.549
&gt;&gt;Diane: After really fighting hard
to stabilize Bates Middle School

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.899
for the first three
years, it became obvious

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.999
that we needed a whole-school
reform effort.

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.859
&gt;&gt;Pat: Because we are an arts-
integration school, every teacher is

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.139
expected to use arts integration
in their classrooms, in some shape

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:38.429
or form, in every content area.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.669
&gt;&gt;Pat: The idea behind
arts integration is

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:44.779
that you learn the content
area through the art so it sort

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.199
of opens a new door to understanding.

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.739
&gt;&gt;John: One of the things that the
arts do is they provide different

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.619
strategies and different skills
that go across all curriculum:

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.229
collaboration, problem-solving
skills.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.349
You have to figure
out what will work,

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.109
And you have to work through it.

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.849
And sometimes you fail
and you gain from failure.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.829
I mean, that's the best
thing about the arts.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.709
You don't have to be
perfect all the time.

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:15.529
We need to teach kids that
you learn through failure.

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:16.439
Take that risk.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.499
You take a risk, you're successful,
that's a life-long skill for kids.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.399
&gt;&gt;Stacey: We're going to start
off with some artful thinking.

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.639
I'm going to show you another image
from the Ars Ad Astra project,

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.809
the art gallery that went
to the Mir Space Station.

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:36.099
&gt;&gt;Pat: Artful thinking is an
approach to teaching visual arts

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:40.149
through a series of routines, and
each routine has a set of questions

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.559
that the teacher asks about a
piece of art and they're designed

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.039
around critical-thinking skills.

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.549
What they're doing is showing a
piece of art and asking kids to look

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.959
at it carefully and to make
some assumptions about it.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.729
&gt;&gt;Stacey: This will be a routine
for imagining and observing.

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.109
Please take a moment to
look at the painting.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.669
Choose beginning, middle, or end.

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:04.489
If this artwork is in the beginning
of the story what might happen next?

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:09.459
And if this artwork is at the end of
the story, what was the story about?

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:11.439
&gt;&gt;Student: I chose the beginning,

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:14.749
I said "An international space
corporation wanted to send a new kind

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.899
of space probe to each planet of
our solar system to study life.

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:21.939
And the space probes hold a new
kind of animal scientifically made."

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:25.249
&gt;&gt;Stacey: Typically they spend
ten seconds looking at a piece.

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.579
This encourages them to
really observe every portion

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.929
of that painting or artwork, and
then it allows their thinking

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:34.729
to be visible.

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:37.819
&gt;&gt;Pat: We ask ourselves, where
are the kids struggling?

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:42.009
We want to then target
that standard, because we want

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:43.389
to approach it through
art integration

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:44.879
to find another way to reach them.

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:47.109
&gt;&gt;Stacey: Maddie, read the
learning goal for us nice and loud.

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.399
&gt;&gt;Maddie: I will understand and
demonstrate rotation and revolution

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:51.779
by choreographing a dance.

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.639
&gt;&gt;Stacey: Thank you very much...

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:55.469
&gt;&gt;Stacey: Today you kids are dancing.

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.709
&gt;&gt;Stacey: I wanted my kids to
understand rotation and revolution,

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.989
they frequently mix them up.

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:04.059
&gt;&gt;Stacey: You will choose a
movement from your choreography today

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:08.009
and you will tell me how your
movement represents rotation

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.039
or revolution.

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.029
&gt;&gt;Stacey: So I decided
to make two dance groups.

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:16.609
&gt;&gt;Caleb: If I was doing the learning
out of a textbook, it wouldn't stick

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:18.439
with me, because
I'm a visual learner.

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.099
I'm an active learner, so
by doing exciting things,

00:04:21.179 --> 00:04:24.899
creative things, it sparks
my interest, so then my mind,

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:27.069
it keeps on my mind -- oh
remember when you did this?

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:28.239
Remember when you did that?

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:30.859
When we have our unit test then
I can know the characteristics

00:04:30.859 --> 00:04:32.769
of the different planets.

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:34.289
&gt;&gt;Stacey: These are all
the movements I want

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.529
to see included in your choreography.

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:38.149
I'm going to give you two okay?

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:41.329
&gt;&gt;Student: Alec is the sun and like
you get in the middle and we all get

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:42.399
in a circle at the very beginning.

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.859
&gt;&gt;Student: Everyone who is
an expert of each planet,

00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:48.259
we each go around at
however fast the planet goes.

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:56.919
&gt;&gt;Student: Boom, Boom,
Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.589
&gt;&gt;Pat: We've seen a huge
difference in the kinds of questions

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:05.699
that kids are answering and the kinds
of questions teachers are asking

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:09.889
because when they use the art to ask
these critical-thinking questions,

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:14.699
the kids are using skills that
they didn't know they had.

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.189
&gt;&gt;Diane: Over the last five years
we've made significant gains

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:19.719
in all of our student groups.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.269
For instance, our English-language
learners have increased their student

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:27.709
achievement in math and in
reading by almost 30 percent.

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:32.819
Our Special Ed scores are jumping
higher than we could have even hoped,

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.799
and we're developing a body
of research data that show

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:40.189
that arts integration can
help struggling students learn

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:41.509
those standards.

00:05:41.859 --> 00:05:45.309
&gt;&gt;John: To see parents that
never came into a school to all

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:49.899
of a sudden be there, to come in and
say "Thank you, my son is engaged

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:51.219
where he never was before."

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:55.339
&gt;&gt;John: I saw what it did for
kids and it's changed my career.

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:59.189
I mean they say arts are
transformative, it transformed me.
