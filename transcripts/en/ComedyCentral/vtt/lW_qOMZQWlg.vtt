00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:01.089
- It is September 11th.

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:03.502
I guess we should
probably talk about that.

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:04.777
- [Tom] (chuckles) Yeah.

00:00:04.777 --> 00:00:06.222
- It's been 17 years.

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:07.215
- Damn, that's crazy.
- 17.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.871
- If a child was born on September 11th,

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:12.407
they've been able to drive for a year.

00:00:12.407 --> 00:00:14.081
- [Tom] They can almost smoke
- They're like what happened?

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.443
- Yeah, they can almost smoke,
but they still can't smoke.

00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:18.885
- They're almost too old to have sex with.

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.214
(laughing)

00:00:20.214 --> 00:00:23.633
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.120
- I was in my senior year of
high school and it was like

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.037
first period, whatever,
it was my first period.

00:00:31.574 --> 00:00:32.407
- Nice.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.299
(group laughing)

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.460
- Yes, bleeding for the first time,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.576
I think it probably was around that time

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:39.774
and I just, we were reading King Lear

00:00:39.774 --> 00:00:43.444
and it was the scene where
his eyes get poked out

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:46.104
and I remember my teacher,
Mrs. Larson, being like,

00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:47.313
"Today is like a rough day,

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.253
"because we're gonna
be reading about, like,

00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:50.862
"this really gnarly scene that happens

00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:52.550
"and I just wanna prepare you for it,"

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.131
and then I heard the intercom just like,

00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:58.313
and we didn't get announcements,
until after second period,

00:00:58.313 --> 00:01:01.943
so I heard the intercom
go, like I heard it turn on

00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:03.414
and I remember in that moment,

00:01:03.414 --> 00:01:05.841
being like, something
fucking serious happened,

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:07.742
just hearing a, clunk, like that

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:10.253
and then my best friend's
dad, who was our principal,

00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:12.839
got over and was like,
"Teachers, turn on your TVs,"

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.430
and I remember I was the same as you, Tom,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.181
we turned it on and I go
"What's the World Trade Center?"

00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:18.639
- Yeah.
- And I remember Mrs. Larson

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:21.880
going like, "You don't know
what the World Trade Center,"

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.552
and I remember being,

00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:25.304
- [Tom] Yeah.
- like that became my,

00:01:25.304 --> 00:01:28.217
like mourning, that was my emotion,

00:01:28.217 --> 00:01:29.431
it was like being shamed,

00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:30.264
- [Tom] Yeah, yeah.
- about not knowing.

00:01:30.264 --> 00:01:31.680
I didn't know what it was.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.018
- [Tom] Like when you call
your teacher Mommy on accident.

00:01:33.018 --> 00:01:35.681
(group laughing)

00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:36.803
- Do people do that?

00:01:36.803 --> 00:01:38.320
- [Matt B] Oh, yeah.
- I did.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.153
- Mommy?
- What do you mean?

00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:41.135
- I called my gym teacher Mommy.

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:43.135
- You did that?
- No way!

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:46.412
Wait a second, that is your 9/11?

00:01:46.412 --> 00:01:49.250
- I was doing sit ups and my
gym teacher said something,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.274
I was like "Mommy, I need to, oh no, no!"

00:01:51.274 --> 00:01:52.774
- Oh, my God, Tom.

00:01:54.152 --> 00:01:56.492
- Welcome to what we're
gonna make fun of you for

00:01:56.492 --> 00:01:59.298
for the rest of school.
- That is so--

00:01:59.298 --> 00:02:01.396
- Mommy.
- That's a common thing

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:04.511
though, like I have teacher
friends, that are like,

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:07.183
"I get called Mom at
least like once a month."

00:02:07.183 --> 00:02:08.360
- Yeah.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.639
- Yeah, but when the other
kids don't see it that way.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:12.774
- Oh, of course not.

00:02:12.774 --> 00:02:14.471
- By the way, Mommy,
- Oh yeah.

00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:16.534
- is so much worse than Mom,
- Right.

00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:18.307
- I mean, Mommy?

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:19.140
- [Tom] (laughing) Yeah.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.461
- I think that's why you use
Mommy as a joke so often,

00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:23.776
because it's like something
that really stuck out to you.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.937
- [Tom] Yeah.
- That is so humiliating.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:26.851
- I know.
- Yeah.

00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:28.732
- Do people still hit you
up on Facebook, hey Mommy?

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:30.483
- No, I cut all of those
people out of my life.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.548
- Okay, good for you.

00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:32.477
- Oh, my God.

00:02:32.477 --> 00:02:35.962
- Everyone in that gym
has died slowly over time,

00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:39.618
methodically one by one.
- Then I put in 30,000.

00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:41.257
- [Nikki] The Mommy Murders.
- There's like

00:02:41.257 --> 00:02:42.498
a weird serial killer.

00:02:42.498 --> 00:02:43.331
(laughing)

00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:46.248
- You carve Mommy on their corpse.

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.371
- I can totally see this on Dateline.

00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:50.820
- Oh, my God, I wanna talk

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.235
about more embarrassing moments like that,

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:54.647
because that just like
really tickled my soul.

00:02:54.647 --> 00:02:56.747
I'm sure that you guys have them as well.

00:02:56.747 --> 00:02:58.461
- Ah-huh.
- We'll get to more,

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.470
if you've done something so embarrassing,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.486
like I wanna hear your most,

00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:02.759
if you've got an embarrassing story,

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.768
that is literally the
most embarrassing thing,

00:03:04.768 --> 00:03:07.698
like try to top saying Mommy,

00:03:07.698 --> 00:03:10.065
calling your gym teacher
Mommy in what grade?

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:12.422
- Probably like, I was
probably in 1st or 2nd grade.

00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:14.094
- Oh, okay, that's not
as bad as what I thought.

00:03:14.094 --> 00:03:15.143
- I think it's still pretty bad,

00:03:15.143 --> 00:03:17.728
it might have been 3rd.
- I'll take 7th or 8th.

00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:20.019
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it was around.

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.769
- Nevermind Tom jeez.

00:03:22.973 --> 00:03:24.088
- It was my college gym.

00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:26.333
- Yeah I, mean, if you
have something to top that,

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:28.183
please call into the show at 844-COMEDY9.

00:03:28.183 --> 00:03:30.266
We'll be back after this.

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:32.704
And we're back with more show.

00:03:32.704 --> 00:03:36.657
We're talking embarrassing
moments on the show today.

00:03:36.657 --> 00:03:38.480
Matt Fulchiron you got one for us.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.003
- Yeah I was 19 and I
came back from lunch,

00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:43.096
I was in college, and I went to my dorm

00:03:43.096 --> 00:03:45.699
and I was walking into my
door and these three girls

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.949
were like "Oh, there he is,

00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:51.356
"I can't believe you're
showing your face tonight.",

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.635
and I was like what are you talking about?

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:55.069
They're like "You don't remember?",

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.649
and I'm like, No, and they're like,

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.879
"You walked in our room last
night, we were all hanging out,

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.129
"you opened up the laundry
box, with the lid on it,

00:04:06.523 --> 00:04:08.222
"and pissed in the laundry box,

00:04:08.222 --> 00:04:11.536
"and then like, fucking
closed it and walked out.".

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:13.310
Cause it was right where the toilet

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.932
in my parent's bathroom was.

00:04:14.932 --> 00:04:15.898
It was like sleep walking.

00:04:15.898 --> 00:04:17.065
- Oh, dammmmn.

00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:19.992
- It was like the first week of school.

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:23.801
- Oh no, that's always so
humiliating when that's your--

00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:25.093
- I ended up being friends with 'em.

00:04:25.093 --> 00:04:26.120
They didn't care that much.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.878
But now I think it's sexual assault.

00:04:27.878 --> 00:04:28.994
- Well, probably is.

00:04:28.994 --> 00:04:32.315
I hope the statute of
limitations is up on that.

00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:35.642
Yeah, but in that moment
you were like the worst.

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:36.858
What did you say?

00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:38.113
- I didn't believe them.

00:04:38.113 --> 00:04:39.126
- Right.

00:04:39.126 --> 00:04:40.393
Are you a sleepwalker?
- No!

00:04:40.393 --> 00:04:42.219
- Are you a sleep pisser?
- No!

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.052
- Were you drunk?

00:04:43.052 --> 00:04:44.207
- You've never done that before?

00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:45.384
- Ah, I had about three beers.

00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:46.762
I don't think that's ever drunk.

00:04:46.762 --> 00:04:47.897
- So you were wasted.

00:04:47.897 --> 00:04:49.155
- Yeah.
- Maybe.

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:50.738
I mean possibly.
- Yeah.

00:04:50.738 --> 00:04:52.437
- I weighed a lot less then.

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:54.460
But three beers, I don't know.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.434
- That's wild.

00:04:55.434 --> 00:04:56.487
- I think that's sleepwalking.

00:04:56.487 --> 00:04:57.695
- Yeah that's sleepwalking.

00:04:57.695 --> 00:05:00.528
- Yeah it's gotta be sleepwalking.

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:05.468
Mike Baldwin do you have
an embarrassing story?

00:05:05.468 --> 00:05:06.406
- Yes

00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:08.641
(group laughing)

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:12.808
I was probably 21 or 22
and there was a girl named

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:17.222
Jessica McDaniel, who I
went to high school with,

00:05:17.222 --> 00:05:19.853
and I had a crush on her
since like freshman year,

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:23.683
and never did anything
with her or anything,

00:05:23.683 --> 00:05:27.127
until this one night, when I'm 21 or 22,

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:29.420
we're at this party, I
don't remember where it was,

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.551
I remember it was a brick
house and I'm like sitting

00:05:31.551 --> 00:05:35.713
on the porch and I'd been
drinking tequila all night long,

00:05:35.713 --> 00:05:37.699
and she'd been drinking
something apparently,

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.376
because it came up,

00:05:39.376 --> 00:05:41.576
and she was like "Do you wanna
just make out or something?"

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:42.776
And I was like , oh, yes,

00:05:42.776 --> 00:05:46.771
and we started making
out for like 5 seconds

00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:49.688
and then I just like
immediately started crying.

00:05:49.688 --> 00:05:52.912
And I was like I've just had
a crush on you for so long.

00:05:52.912 --> 00:05:53.849
- What?

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.199
- And she, just like the look
on her face of like wow dude,

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.957
and then me crying made me cry more,

00:06:00.957 --> 00:06:03.024
and I'm like I don't know why I'm crying.

00:06:03.024 --> 00:06:05.014
- Oh my god, you poor thing.

00:06:05.014 --> 00:06:08.463
- I still think about it at
least once a week and cringe,

00:06:08.463 --> 00:06:10.854
- Oh no, you do?
- at how awkward it was.

00:06:10.854 --> 00:06:12.559
- Does it make your whole body tense up?

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:13.392
- It sure does.

00:06:13.392 --> 00:06:15.084
- Cause I do that at least
once a day. (gasping)

00:06:15.084 --> 00:06:15.982
Oh my god, that happened.

00:06:15.982 --> 00:06:16.945
- [Nikki] Yeah.
- Oh no!

00:06:16.945 --> 00:06:18.283
- Oh shit I just thought of one.

00:06:18.283 --> 00:06:19.433
- [Nikki] Oh you got one?

00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:21.338
- It's one, I forgot , I
tweeted this the other day,

00:06:21.338 --> 00:06:23.469
but it was during a breakup,

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:24.391
(group laughing)

00:06:24.391 --> 00:06:26.258
so it wasn't embarrassing
in a big room sense but

00:06:26.258 --> 00:06:28.547
just for me I still think of it.

00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:29.630
- Totally.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.621
- This girl I dated in
college broke up with me,

00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:34.932
we were hanging out at her
place and just out of nowhere,

00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:37.321
we started talking about like,

00:06:37.321 --> 00:06:38.580
yeah, I don't think this is working out,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.041
and I was devastated,

00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.608
and I was just like alright
we'll I guess it's over.

00:06:43.608 --> 00:06:47.012
So I got up and I was like
I guess I'll just go then.

00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:49.736
And then as I was walking out of her door,

00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:52.618
I thought I heard her say
something and I was like, what?

00:06:52.618 --> 00:06:55.743
And then she was like,
"I didn't say anything."

00:06:55.743 --> 00:06:57.206
- Oh god.

00:06:57.206 --> 00:06:59.684
- Oh alright well I guess
I'll just keep on walking.

00:06:59.684 --> 00:07:02.479
I thought she was like, wait! (laughing)

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:06.073
- Oh man, one girl called in and she,

00:07:06.073 --> 00:07:08.505
that reminds me of a story
that a girl called in

00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:10.205
and now her call's gone.

00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:11.038
Damn it.
- Dammmmn.

00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:11.871
- Call back in!

00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:13.896
You had a thing where a
guy said something to you,

00:07:13.896 --> 00:07:16.896
and you misinterpreted what he said.

00:07:18.398 --> 00:07:21.148
Let's go to Dugan, in Sacramento.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.320
- [Dugan] Hi Nikki, how are you?

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.943
- Good Dugan, tell me what happened?

00:07:27.943 --> 00:07:30.442
What's your most embarrassing moment.

00:07:30.442 --> 00:07:32.339
- [Dugan] Well I just want to say,

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:35.705
it's not as bad as calling
somebody mommy, so.

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:37.556
- What the fuck Dugan come on!
- Dis!

00:07:37.556 --> 00:07:39.903
- I'm getting it from
all ends today, Dugan.

00:07:39.903 --> 00:07:42.186
- [Dugan] Come on Tommy, I mean mommy.

00:07:42.186 --> 00:07:44.569
(group laughing)

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:47.194
So, scene is I'm about 12 years old,

00:07:47.194 --> 00:07:49.506
coming home from soccer practice,

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:52.116
got a ride with a family
friend and a player,

00:07:52.116 --> 00:07:55.234
and both my mom and dad's car are home.

00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:57.928
And I'm like wow that's really strange,

00:07:57.928 --> 00:08:00.749
they woulda picked me
up from soccer practice.

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:03.755
So I didn't really think of it too much,

00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:07.537
and I walk into the house
and there's my mom and dad,

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:10.258
in the kitchen just going
at it on the kitchen table.

00:08:10.258 --> 00:08:12.565
- (laughing) Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

00:08:12.565 --> 00:08:14.526
- [Dugan] Dude, like I was 12.

00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:16.325
I'd maybe seen like
some Playboys and stuff,

00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:20.543
so I was like what are
you doing to mom dude?!

00:08:20.543 --> 00:08:21.555
- Brazzers!
- You hurt mommy?!

00:08:21.555 --> 00:08:24.305
(group laughing)

00:08:26.412 --> 00:08:29.840
- [Dugan] So I ran to the neighbors house,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.630
and she was like this elderly,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.097
grandmotherly type of a
neighbor and she was like,

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:37.045
"Oh did you just come
home from soccer practice?

00:08:37.045 --> 00:08:39.103
"How 'bout some milk and cookies?",

00:08:39.103 --> 00:08:41.207
and it's was just like
what I needed at that time

00:08:41.207 --> 00:08:45.874
and then I walked home maybe
about an half an hour later

00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:50.496
and my dad was sitting
in the front ya know,

00:08:50.496 --> 00:08:53.985
in the dining room area and
he's like "We need to talk."

00:08:53.985 --> 00:08:54.995
- [Group] Oh no.

00:08:54.995 --> 00:08:57.015
- We're sending you to boarding school.

00:08:57.015 --> 00:08:58.577
(group laughing)

00:08:58.577 --> 00:09:01.494
- So your parents saw you see them?

00:09:02.743 --> 00:09:04.926
- [Dugan] Uh, I think my dad saw,

00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:07.801
my mom was otherwise engaged.

00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:09.626
- Yeah, she was blindfolded

00:09:09.626 --> 00:09:11.522
- (chuckles) She was blindfolded.

00:09:11.522 --> 00:09:12.815
- [Dugan] She didn't
see what was going on.

00:09:12.815 --> 00:09:15.752
But I'm pretty sure my dad
heard the door, like crack,

00:09:15.752 --> 00:09:17.361
and like looked around.

00:09:17.361 --> 00:09:20.308
- They were really hot
back then though right?

00:09:20.308 --> 00:09:22.261
- [Dugan] What's that?
- (laughing)

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.719
- Nothing nevermind.
- Your parents were hot.

00:09:23.719 --> 00:09:26.135
Wait, so did he have a
talk with you about like,

00:09:26.135 --> 00:09:28.615
hey I know what you saw or was it

00:09:28.615 --> 00:09:30.562
- [Dugan] So it was like that talk,

00:09:30.562 --> 00:09:34.748
and then it lead into
like, ya know, the talk.

00:09:34.748 --> 00:09:35.806
- Right, right.

00:09:35.806 --> 00:09:38.276
- Look sometimes when a mommy
and a daddy love each other.

00:09:38.276 --> 00:09:40.831
- Here's the good news, the
talk is going to be way easier

00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:42.458
than the fucking intro.

00:09:42.458 --> 00:09:45.041
- Yeah that's true.
- Yeah, god.

00:09:46.234 --> 00:09:48.029
That sucks when something
embarrassing happens to you

00:09:48.029 --> 00:09:50.727
that you walk into and then
you have to deal with it.

00:09:50.727 --> 00:09:51.600
- Oh yeah for sure,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.354
like seeing someone else
jerking off or whatever.

00:09:54.354 --> 00:09:56.947
- But I want to hear the
worst story that someone has

00:09:56.947 --> 00:09:58.696
about sending the wrong text to someone.

00:09:58.696 --> 00:10:00.641
Because I think that, that
is seriously, kind of,

00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:01.572
the worst.

00:10:01.572 --> 00:10:06.254
That fills me with, if that
happened to me I would just

00:10:06.254 --> 00:10:08.618
- I did that when a
friend, ah not a friend.

00:10:08.618 --> 00:10:10.367
- When your talking shit

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:11.726
- Yeah, I had a girl,

00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:13.148
- I'm getting chills

00:10:13.148 --> 00:10:13.981
- (laughing) Go ahead.
- One of my friends, ah,

00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:17.980
dated this dude that we all
hated and then his parents,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.569
we were like 19, so we
would drink at their,

00:10:21.569 --> 00:10:23.816
his parents place, they
were the family that's like,

00:10:23.816 --> 00:10:26.374
"You can drink, but only
if it's under our roof."

00:10:26.374 --> 00:10:28.593
or whatever, and their
party sucked or whatever,

00:10:28.593 --> 00:10:31.532
so we left and we tried to
come back and I, Zach was like

00:10:31.532 --> 00:10:34.202
"Well you left, so just fuck
you man, you can't come back."

00:10:34.202 --> 00:10:36.953
and I was just, I tried to
send my other friend like,

00:10:36.953 --> 00:10:40.810
Man Zach fuckin sucks, and
I sent it straight to Zach.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:41.943
- Yes you did.
- Oh no.

00:10:41.943 --> 00:10:43.840
- And then how do you deal with that?

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.711
- I was just like, You're
pissing me off man,

00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:46.677
I just tried to own it,
- Oh yeah you just doubled down

00:10:46.677 --> 00:10:48.575
- I acted like I,
- Meant to?

00:10:48.575 --> 00:10:49.974
- Meant to do that, yeah.

00:10:49.974 --> 00:10:53.169
- I haven't sent like a
talking shit text by accident,

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:57.000
but I told you're this story recently,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.909
I sent a group chat to,
- Oh my god Mike,

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.243
this is so hilar--

00:11:01.243 --> 00:11:02.859
Mike is so stupid.

00:11:02.859 --> 00:11:03.951
(group laughing)

00:11:03.951 --> 00:11:07.272
Like this is one of the
stupidest things and adult could,

00:11:07.272 --> 00:11:08.938
like I can't
- This was all,

00:11:08.938 --> 00:11:10.645
- This is so, ugh, okay

00:11:10.645 --> 00:11:13.302
- It was on Thanksgiving,
and it was probably like,

00:11:13.302 --> 00:11:14.516
almost 10 years ago.

00:11:14.516 --> 00:11:17.028
It was my first Iphone or
at least the first Iphone,

00:11:17.028 --> 00:11:19.740
that had group chat
capabilities and I sent like,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.907
Happy Thanksgiving milady,

00:11:23.247 --> 00:11:26.779
like I hope you have a day
as beautiful as you are,

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:30.197
or something like that and
sent it to like 10 girls,

00:11:30.197 --> 00:11:32.558
and didn't realize that
it was a group chat.

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:34.469
So then the first reply was like,

00:11:34.469 --> 00:11:36.492
"Aww, thanks Mike, your so sweet." ,

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:38.111
and then the second reply is

00:11:38.111 --> 00:11:41.718
"Wait, Mike did you send
this to more than one girl?",

00:11:41.718 --> 00:11:44.472
and then the third reply is like,

00:11:44.472 --> 00:11:46.372
"Yep I think he did.",

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:49.091
and then they all just
continued talking to each other

00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:52.253
on my group chat and I was like,

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.764
I want to die right now,

00:11:54.764 --> 00:11:57.362
and they're like it's fine,
like don't worry about it.

00:11:57.362 --> 00:12:00.472
But still, that's another one
that I cringe at sometimes.

00:12:00.472 --> 00:12:01.305
- Oh, boy.

00:12:01.305 --> 00:12:03.428
- I got one for ya, I
was dating this girl,

00:12:03.428 --> 00:12:04.869
she lived in Kentucky.

00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:07.150
She sent me a nude picture of herself,

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.064
and I said, hey this is um,
you sent this to someone else.

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:12.397
And she goes no.

00:12:13.522 --> 00:12:15.734
Ya know cause I saw like
two numbers in the top,

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:17.031
like I know you sent this to someone else.

00:12:17.031 --> 00:12:18.656
- She goes, "No I just took
it, this is just for you.",

00:12:18.656 --> 00:12:22.537
and I'm like no you sent
it to another number too.

00:12:22.537 --> 00:12:24.251
She sent it to her fucking cousin as well.

00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:25.501
- [Group] Nooo!

00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:29.116
- Damn!

00:12:29.116 --> 00:12:29.949
- God!

00:12:30.798 --> 00:12:32.550
Wait let's go to

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.328
- She was racist.
- Can we go to,

00:12:34.328 --> 00:12:35.775
Can we go to Justin, in North Carolina?

00:12:35.775 --> 00:12:38.542
I've really, I really just
read the excerpt of this story.

00:12:38.542 --> 00:12:40.710
Justin tell us, wait don't read
it, I want him to tell you.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:41.543
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:41.543 --> 00:12:43.936
- Justin what happened to you?

00:12:43.936 --> 00:12:47.615
- [Justin] Well, I actually
back in my twenties,

00:12:47.615 --> 00:12:49.161
I was married at the time
- He sounds like

00:12:49.161 --> 00:12:50.138
he's from North Carolina.

00:12:50.138 --> 00:12:51.201
- (laughs)

00:12:51.201 --> 00:12:52.808
- [Justin] Yes, yes I am,

00:12:52.808 --> 00:12:55.537
and um, I had my wisdom teeth removed,

00:12:55.537 --> 00:12:59.765
and my wife took me to
have the surgery done,

00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:03.111
and we came back home and I
was still very incoherent,

00:13:03.111 --> 00:13:08.111
with medicines, and somewhere
in that timeframe my mother

00:13:08.504 --> 00:13:11.883
came over to visit while
I was still in bed,

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:14.853
and I thought that it was my wife,

00:13:14.853 --> 00:13:18.448
and I told her that I wanted to taste her,

00:13:18.448 --> 00:13:20.378
and it was actually my mother.

00:13:20.378 --> 00:13:21.285
- Oh man.

00:13:21.285 --> 00:13:24.095
- You told your mother that
you wanted to taste her.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:24.928
- Oh god.

00:13:26.303 --> 00:13:28.197
- Did they tell you later on
that you're had said that?

00:13:28.197 --> 00:13:31.383
Or did you like in the
moment go like, oh shit!?

00:13:31.383 --> 00:13:33.633
Was there like a video of it?

00:13:33.633 --> 00:13:35.319
- [Justin] My wife was actually sitting,

00:13:35.319 --> 00:13:37.429
no luckily thank god there was no video,

00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:40.719
but my wife was standing
kind of in the background,

00:13:40.719 --> 00:13:44.535
and heard me, my mother did
not acknowledge it at all,

00:13:44.535 --> 00:13:46.483
and later on my wife told me about it.

00:13:46.483 --> 00:13:47.823
So, pretty embarrassing.

00:13:47.823 --> 00:13:48.962
- Oh god.

00:13:48.962 --> 00:13:49.962
- God, yeah.

00:13:51.151 --> 00:13:52.898
Okay let's go to Brad in Michigan,

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:55.693
he sent a text to the wrong person.

00:13:55.693 --> 00:13:57.313
What happened Brad?

00:13:57.313 --> 00:14:00.985
- [Brad] So I was in a new
relationship, still kind of

00:14:00.985 --> 00:14:03.057
in the hot and heavy section of it,

00:14:03.057 --> 00:14:05.492
and I had a little side job
where I was painting houses,

00:14:05.492 --> 00:14:08.062
and I was painting a
house for this older lady,

00:14:08.062 --> 00:14:13.062
and I sent her the words, are
we gonna fuck tonight or what?

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.676
- Did she reply?

00:14:17.676 --> 00:14:20.472
- [David] She did, she
said, "Well, I hope not."

00:14:20.472 --> 00:14:21.778
- Well that's great.

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:23.379
- [David] But then I had
to finish the painting job,

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:25.166
so that was awful.
- Oh god!

00:14:25.166 --> 00:14:25.999
- Oh no!

00:14:28.416 --> 00:14:32.046
- I once was having really,
really loud sex in an Air BNB,

00:14:32.046 --> 00:14:34.556
that I had rented, and I got a text,

00:14:34.556 --> 00:14:35.860
this was really embarrassing,

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.983
I never had to see they guy again,

00:14:36.983 --> 00:14:39.776
but the guy whose place
it was texted me that,

00:14:39.776 --> 00:14:43.466
hey, my landlord called last night,

00:14:43.466 --> 00:14:48.466
and there was screaming
coming from your apartment,

00:14:48.535 --> 00:14:51.210
and I just wanted to make
sure everything was okay.

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.965
And I was like, does he
know that I was having sex,

00:14:53.965 --> 00:14:56.398
or is he really checking in
on like if everything's okay.

00:14:56.398 --> 00:14:59.178
I didn't know how to really handle it,

00:14:59.178 --> 00:15:03.815
so I was in a writer's room
for my show at the time,

00:15:03.815 --> 00:15:07.418
and I remember Benji Aflalo,
one of my writer's was like,

00:15:07.418 --> 00:15:08.961
"Just tell him you were auditioning,

00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:10.085
like you were practicing an audition.

00:15:10.085 --> 00:15:11.043
- Oh that's good.

00:15:11.043 --> 00:15:12.231
- So I wrote back and was like,

00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:15.319
Oh I had and audition where
I have to scream a lot.

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:19.572
I'm really sorry. I
wanted to just be like,

00:15:19.572 --> 00:15:20.989
I was having sex.

00:15:22.405 --> 00:15:23.628
That was embarrassing because,

00:15:23.628 --> 00:15:28.576
oh and then another time I was
having sex with my boyfriend,

00:15:28.576 --> 00:15:30.766
and I think the most
embarrassing times have been,

00:15:30.766 --> 00:15:34.209
when I've heard that people
have heard me have sex later on.

00:15:34.209 --> 00:15:35.626
Cause it's so embarrassing,

00:15:35.626 --> 00:15:38.729
and I'm not someone
who's trying to be heard.

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:40.502
When my ex and I used to have sex,

00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:44.710
this one time we were staying
with his cousin in Chicago,

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.109
and both his brothers were
sleeping in the living room,

00:15:47.109 --> 00:15:48.694
and we were in a guest room,

00:15:48.694 --> 00:15:50.407
and I was trying to be so quiet,

00:15:50.407 --> 00:15:52.286
cause I didn't want his
brothers to hear me having sex,

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:54.657
like there's no way, that's
like not something I get off on,

00:15:54.657 --> 00:15:55.989
or would ever want.

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:59.654
And like the next day they
were like ,hey wolfie,

00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:02.277
they called me wolfie,
and I didn't understand,

00:16:02.277 --> 00:16:03.722
and then it was like an inside joke

00:16:03.722 --> 00:16:06.585
that I sounded like I
was howling like a wolf,

00:16:06.585 --> 00:16:10.802
and it turns out like they
all, every one of his friends,

00:16:10.802 --> 00:16:12.570
cause he lived with roommates,

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.611
I'm really loud when I have sex.

00:16:14.611 --> 00:16:18.694
And I didn't know that,
and I don't know that and

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:22.502
one of my most embarrassing
moments is on camera,

00:16:22.502 --> 00:16:27.502
from when I did Not Safe, I
gave my dad a lie detector test,

00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:30.154
and one of the questions,
that a writer wrote was like,

00:16:30.154 --> 00:16:31.817
Have you ever heard me having sex?

00:16:31.817 --> 00:16:32.650
- [Group] Oh no.

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.483
- God.

00:16:33.483 --> 00:16:36.168
- And I remember asking
that like please be no,

00:16:36.168 --> 00:16:39.297
but I lived at home and
had a lot of sex at home,

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:41.072
when I lived at home with my parents,

00:16:41.072 --> 00:16:44.473
with my ex-boyfriend,
and my dad has heard me.

00:16:44.473 --> 00:16:45.681
- Oh no!
- Dammmn!

00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:46.973
- So for him to have to tell me,

00:16:46.973 --> 00:16:49.093
that he heard me was so humiliating.

00:16:49.093 --> 00:16:50.861
- Oh my god.
- Not safe.

00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:52.635
- Not safe, I was not,

00:16:52.635 --> 00:16:55.424
- Has he ever walked in on you?

00:16:55.424 --> 00:16:56.794
Or your mom?

00:16:56.794 --> 00:17:00.365
- One time, a guy was
inside me in my bedroom,

00:17:00.365 --> 00:17:02.917
and my dad knocked on the
door and was like, "Hey Nick!"

00:17:02.917 --> 00:17:04.508
and I was like, I'm talking to my dad,

00:17:04.508 --> 00:17:08.338
while there's a dick in me,
I cannot believe I have to,

00:17:08.338 --> 00:17:10.000
and I was like, I'll be right out!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.568
Ya know like my voice
cracked and I remember like,

00:17:12.568 --> 00:17:15.796
there's someone in me and
I'm talking to my dad,

00:17:15.796 --> 00:17:20.249
this is the worst thing
- That is very weird, yeah.

00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:23.809
- My mom walked in on me by myself once.

00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:26.112
- Oh jerking off?
- Yeah.

00:17:26.112 --> 00:17:28.425
Like, pants off jerking off
- Oh, boy.

00:17:28.425 --> 00:17:30.732
Oh yeah I remember you
telling me this story.

00:17:30.732 --> 00:17:33.458
- Not just a quick, oh I can
just pull up my waistband,

00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:35.855
or whatever, there was like
nothing that I could do

00:17:35.855 --> 00:17:38.979
- You're getting a long jerkin
- Mommy! Mommy.

00:17:38.979 --> 00:17:40.236
- I'm just gonna go through some of these.

00:17:40.236 --> 00:17:42.360
Joshua in North Carolina,
accidentally sent a dick pic,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.205
to his commanders/leaders
instead of his fiance.

00:17:45.205 --> 00:17:46.812
- (clapping)
- I love that.

00:17:46.812 --> 00:17:48.194
- That's a salute.

00:17:48.194 --> 00:17:50.152
- Oh my god,
- This is, the Kyle one,

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.610
is pretty insane.
- Kyle, let's talk to you.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.193
Kyle, who did you send what to?

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.886
- [Kyle] I sent a dick
picture to my mother in law.

00:17:58.886 --> 00:18:01.679
- [Group] (laughing)

00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:03.541
- That is so brutal.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.290
- What did she say?

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.914
- [Kyle] Um, well as nice as she can be,

00:18:08.914 --> 00:18:10.898
she thought it was very nice,

00:18:10.898 --> 00:18:13.494
but after that, every time
we went over to the house,

00:18:13.494 --> 00:18:16.089
she got very beet red whenever she saw me.

00:18:16.089 --> 00:18:18.352
- Yeah.
- Oh my god.

00:18:18.352 --> 00:18:19.333
- Beet red is right.

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:21.000
Right, guys?
- Yeah, no kidding.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.892
The thing is like sometimes
when I meet porn stars,

00:18:23.892 --> 00:18:26.737
or I meet people who have had sex tapes,

00:18:26.737 --> 00:18:28.269
it's weird to see them,

00:18:28.269 --> 00:18:30.705
cause your like, I've
seen your dick, ya know.

00:18:30.705 --> 00:18:32.305
- (laughs) I have a joke about that.

00:18:32.305 --> 00:18:33.138
- You do?

00:18:33.138 --> 00:18:35.456
- Well I'm just like, I
like when girls in porn,

00:18:35.456 --> 00:18:37.338
look like girls I know in real life,

00:18:37.338 --> 00:18:40.649
but I don't wanna know a girl
in real life that does porn.

00:18:40.649 --> 00:18:41.487
- Yeah.

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:43.206
- Cause then I'd have to
like, hang out with her

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:45.726
and she's like , oh, hey
what TV shows do you watch,

00:18:45.726 --> 00:18:50.551
and I'm just like heh-heh, your
butthole can get really big.

00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:52.610
- Yeah.
- How does it do that?

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.992
- Well I feel that way
with guys I've slept with,

00:18:54.992 --> 00:18:58.107
like I feel like I'm friends
with a lot of guys whose dicks

00:18:58.107 --> 00:19:00.012
have been in my mouth and inside me.

00:19:00.012 --> 00:19:03.136
And it's just so, whenever
I'm with them I'm like,

00:19:03.136 --> 00:19:04.534
oh my god, this is so weird.

00:19:04.534 --> 00:19:05.367
- Right?

00:19:06.216 --> 00:19:08.414
- How are we talking
about your kids right now,

00:19:08.414 --> 00:19:09.940
when your dick has been in my mouth.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.420
I feel like that's the only thing

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.255
we should be talking about.

00:19:13.255 --> 00:19:17.088
It's so weird that you
just move on with life.

00:19:18.591 --> 00:19:20.183
Okay
- There's Tony.

00:19:20.183 --> 00:19:21.782
- Let's go to Tony in Montana.

00:19:21.782 --> 00:19:23.813
What happened to you Tones?

00:19:23.813 --> 00:19:26.063
- (laughs)

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.832
- [Tony] It was before the
age, I didn't have access

00:19:30.832 --> 00:19:33.270
to porn before cellphones and all this.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.478
The hottest thing I could
get my hands on was,

00:19:35.478 --> 00:19:37.854
grandpa ordered Jerry Springer Uncensored.

00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:40.253
- Oh hell yeah! I remember those.

00:19:40.253 --> 00:19:42.887
- [Tony] And I was strokin'
it in his chair at two o'clock

00:19:42.887 --> 00:19:43.720
in the morning

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.000
- [Tom] Did you say soakin' it?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.833
- Stroking.

00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:46.666
- [Tony] Yeah!

00:19:46.666 --> 00:19:49.822
I'm full stroke about to ya know,

00:19:49.822 --> 00:19:53.780
and then grandma walks
in and she goes "Tony?"

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.169
and I just immediately,
- No it's Jeff.

00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:59.476
- [Tony] I didn't know I could
go that soft that quickly.

00:19:59.476 --> 00:20:00.309
- Oh wow!

00:20:00.309 --> 00:20:01.910
- [Tony] I didn't know that was possible.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.058
Then I go back into the bed,

00:20:03.058 --> 00:20:05.645
and my bedroom, when I
stayed over at their house,

00:20:05.645 --> 00:20:09.728
was near hers, and I hear
her giggling, giggling!

00:20:11.016 --> 00:20:11.849
- Oh god!

00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:15.017
- [Tony] I wanted to
shoot myself in the head.

00:20:15.017 --> 00:20:16.898
- How old were you at the time.

00:20:16.898 --> 00:20:18.209
- [Tony] 14

00:20:18.209 --> 00:20:21.430
- Oh yeah that's definitely
shoot yourself in the head age.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.645
- And this Jerry Springer tape,

00:20:22.645 --> 00:20:25.013
were they fighting and their
breasts came out, or what?

00:20:25.013 --> 00:20:25.976
Why were you jerking off to it.

00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:28.550
- [Tony] It was a cowboy stripper chick.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.874
- Oh okay.
- Alright.

00:20:30.874 --> 00:20:33.170
- [Tony] I mean at that point
I was jerking off to lingerie,

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:36.431
JC Penney's sections, I mean
I couldn't find any better.

00:20:36.431 --> 00:20:37.697
- These kids don't know.

00:20:37.697 --> 00:20:39.459
- You could make anything work back then.

00:20:39.459 --> 00:20:40.292
- Ya had to.

00:20:40.292 --> 00:20:42.275
- I remember looking at Target ads,

00:20:42.275 --> 00:20:44.583
you remember when they'd
have a little bras section?

00:20:44.583 --> 00:20:48.753
- God, it's so crazy like
that the simplest thing,

00:20:48.753 --> 00:20:50.253
and now there's just so much.

00:20:50.253 --> 00:20:51.550
- And now it's like, I wanna see two dicks

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.449
in her ass at the same time.

00:20:53.449 --> 00:20:54.282
- I know.

00:20:54.282 --> 00:20:56.031
- Where's the two dick in the ass videos.

00:20:56.031 --> 00:20:57.612
- This is why I don't watch porn a lot,

00:20:57.612 --> 00:20:59.211
because I don't wanna get there.

00:20:59.211 --> 00:21:00.900
- Desensitizes you.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.864
- I still like just a bra.

00:21:02.864 --> 00:21:04.908
- That time when my mom walked in on me,

00:21:04.908 --> 00:21:07.203
I was watching the Grind on MTV.

00:21:07.203 --> 00:21:09.943
Which is just like, they would play music

00:21:09.943 --> 00:21:12.580
and people would dance.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.996
But it was like, ya know, skimpy clothing.

00:21:14.996 --> 00:21:16.596
- Sure I remember that.
- I was just like,

00:21:16.596 --> 00:21:18.267
man that girl with the long socks

00:21:18.267 --> 00:21:20.171
and the short skirt on, ugh!

00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:22.097
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:21:22.097 --> 00:21:24.815
- Now I just breeze
past Instagram accounts,

00:21:24.815 --> 00:21:26.476
like it's nothing.

00:21:26.476 --> 00:21:28.177
I woulda killed for that when I was 13.

00:21:28.177 --> 00:21:29.010
- Right?

00:21:30.685 --> 00:21:33.790
- I can tell right now that
you watch a lot of anal porn,

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.090
because you mentioned it twice.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.343
- I really don't watch,

00:21:36.343 --> 00:21:37.850
- Third time's the charm.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:40.179
- I don't go for anal porn.

00:21:40.179 --> 00:21:42.166
- That's all I watch now.

00:21:42.166 --> 00:21:44.195
- Sometimes its like ya know,

00:21:44.195 --> 00:21:49.091
girl gets fucked hard by a
guy, and then I'm like alright,

00:21:49.091 --> 00:21:51.982
that seems okay and then
it's directly in her ass,

00:21:51.982 --> 00:21:54.565
then I'm like, you should mention that.

00:21:54.565 --> 00:21:56.833
- I feel like that's another
thing I don't like about porn.

00:21:56.833 --> 00:21:58.469
I feel like that's just implied now,

00:21:58.469 --> 00:22:01.543
if it's sex at all, eventually
anal is going to pop up.

00:22:01.543 --> 00:22:03.497
- I get so angry when I'm watching a video

00:22:03.497 --> 00:22:04.929
and anal doesn't happen.

00:22:04.929 --> 00:22:08.899
I really do, I find that
too many don't end in anal,

00:22:08.899 --> 00:22:10.540
and I need anal in my porn.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.906
I don't need it in my
personal life every time,

00:22:11.906 --> 00:22:15.935
but in my porn, I need
girl to take it in the ass.

00:22:15.935 --> 00:22:17.465
Like that's where I'm at right now.

00:22:17.465 --> 00:22:20.268
- I feel usually there's
like a dance to it.

00:22:20.268 --> 00:22:24.018
It's like the oral, then
regular penetration,

00:22:27.091 --> 00:22:31.643
then they go to anal and
then they go back to oral.

00:22:31.643 --> 00:22:32.724
- Right, right.
- Yeah.

00:22:32.724 --> 00:22:33.641
- ATM baby.

00:22:35.198 --> 00:22:38.063
Then you go to the ATM machine,
stick your dick in that.

00:22:38.063 --> 00:22:41.405
Um, let's go to Lola,
she's been waiting a while.

00:22:41.405 --> 00:22:44.382
I wanna hear about an
accidental text you sent.

00:22:44.382 --> 00:22:46.132
Who'd you send it to.

00:22:48.398 --> 00:22:51.182
- [Lola] So one of my
coworkers called in sick,

00:22:51.182 --> 00:22:53.946
and it was on a group chat,

00:22:53.946 --> 00:22:58.124
and I texted who I thought
just my manager was,

00:22:58.124 --> 00:23:02.138
to bitch about it and so he texts me back

00:23:02.138 --> 00:23:06.155
and it's really subdued like,
well, I'll see you at work,

00:23:06.155 --> 00:23:08.155
and I was like oh shoot!

00:23:09.299 --> 00:23:11.313
I texted him privately, and I was like,

00:23:11.313 --> 00:23:12.690
was that on a group chat?

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.144
And he was like, all your numbers came up,

00:23:16.144 --> 00:23:18.734
and I was like oh (gasps)

00:23:18.734 --> 00:23:20.114
- Oh no!
- Dammmn.

00:23:20.114 --> 00:23:22.987
- [Lola] It is one these
people this is like very,

00:23:22.987 --> 00:23:27.320
very, very sensitive and
gets worked up very easily.

00:23:29.014 --> 00:23:31.906
- What do you do, I mean
that is biggest fear.

00:23:31.906 --> 00:23:34.746
I need to stop talking shit on text cause,

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:36.610
that is bound to happen to me.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.672
It's almost, one time I sent
a text to my ex-boyfriend,

00:23:40.672 --> 00:23:43.195
that was meant about him,

00:23:43.195 --> 00:23:45.318
he was late for a flight
that we were catching

00:23:45.318 --> 00:23:46.292
and it wasn't his fault,

00:23:46.292 --> 00:23:47.955
and I was like, he's fucking late again,

00:23:47.955 --> 00:23:50.916
and he was so mad that I
had that tone about him

00:23:50.916 --> 00:23:53.541
to someone else, and he should have been.

00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:54.417
- Damn.

00:23:54.417 --> 00:23:57.734
- In that little mistake, I can't imagine

00:23:57.734 --> 00:24:01.812
if your really, really laying
into someone and you send it.

00:24:01.812 --> 00:24:03.773
That's why you should never,

00:24:03.773 --> 00:24:06.044
you should always nicknames for people.

00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:07.722
- Sometimes you gotta call somebody,

00:24:07.722 --> 00:24:08.785
if you want to talk shit,

00:24:08.785 --> 00:24:10.221
sometimes you gotta just
make a fucking call.

00:24:10.221 --> 00:24:11.323
- Just call them, yeah.

00:24:11.323 --> 00:24:12.465
That's a good point.

00:24:12.465 --> 00:24:14.758
- You make nicknames for
people, like fatso. (laughs)

00:24:14.758 --> 00:24:16.687
- Yeah like fatso, yeah.
- I wonder who that is.

00:24:16.687 --> 00:24:21.164
- You need an easier like,
I, can't, think, of anything.

00:24:21.164 --> 00:24:23.268
- (laughs)

00:24:23.268 --> 00:24:25.337
- I'm not quick enough to give examples,

00:24:25.337 --> 00:24:27.082
but you get what I'm going for.

00:24:27.082 --> 00:24:28.387
- You up Mike, you up?

00:24:28.387 --> 00:24:30.922
- You know I think like farting
when you don't mean to fart

00:24:30.922 --> 00:24:32.402
is one of the most embarrassing things,

00:24:32.402 --> 00:24:35.348
that can happen to a girl, or a guy.

00:24:35.348 --> 00:24:36.575
- For sure.

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:38.145
- Like when you accidentally fart.

00:24:38.145 --> 00:24:40.870
Those moments to me stand out so much,

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.246
- Like I know exactly where I was.

00:24:42.246 --> 00:24:43.079
- Yeah, sit-ups

00:24:43.079 --> 00:24:44.513
- Again sit-ups.
- Yeah, sit-ups.

00:24:44.513 --> 00:24:46.088
Yes, yes.
- Mommy, I farted.

00:24:46.088 --> 00:24:47.031
- I'm sorry mommy.

00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:47.864
- Oh my god.
- Have you ever,

00:24:47.864 --> 00:24:51.004
have you ever, accidentally
burped when your yawning?

00:24:51.004 --> 00:24:52.792
- [Group] Yes.

00:24:52.792 --> 00:24:55.393
- Where you're like just
so into the yawn its like,

00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:57.436
that little throat noise.

00:24:57.436 --> 00:24:59.240
- Oh man, a weird noise came out,

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.231
when I was on a date recently,

00:25:01.231 --> 00:25:04.566
and I just got really loud after it.

00:25:04.566 --> 00:25:07.489
Like to hide it in retrospect,
do you know what I mean?

00:25:07.489 --> 00:25:09.249
- It's like the,
- And I saw him jump,

00:25:09.249 --> 00:25:10.704
at how loud I got.

00:25:10.704 --> 00:25:13.209
It was me trying to make him forget,

00:25:13.209 --> 00:25:15.439
that I just made a really
weird throat noise.

00:25:15.439 --> 00:25:18.437
- Its the voice equivalent
of jogging a little bit

00:25:18.437 --> 00:25:20.304
when you trip over a curb
or something like that.

00:25:20.304 --> 00:25:22.054
- It is exactly that.

00:25:23.137 --> 00:25:27.538
- Your like nope I'm just jogging
a little, all of a sudden.

00:25:27.538 --> 00:25:31.084
- Or just like getting angry
at whatever's around you,

00:25:31.084 --> 00:25:33.329
when you really are just mad at yourself.

00:25:33.329 --> 00:25:37.259
Like, I fainted on stage
once and I lashed out

00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:39.222
at the crowd for not helping me,

00:25:39.222 --> 00:25:41.581
when really I was just mad at myself.

00:25:41.581 --> 00:25:43.205
- You really fainted on stage?

00:25:43.205 --> 00:25:45.108
- That was my most
embarrassing moment probably.

00:25:45.108 --> 00:25:46.728
- Were you out for a long time?

00:25:46.728 --> 00:25:48.588
- For about five to ten seconds

00:25:48.588 --> 00:25:49.519
- Oh, okay.
- Something like that.

00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:53.398
Yeah but like fully fainted,
passed out, fell on the stage.

00:25:53.398 --> 00:25:55.062
- I fainted at a party once

00:25:55.062 --> 00:25:58.714
and I woke up and everybody
was still just laughing at me.

00:25:58.714 --> 00:26:00.736
So it was a short enough time that,

00:26:00.736 --> 00:26:01.587
- So you killed?

00:26:01.587 --> 00:26:03.651
- I did, I killed at that party.

00:26:03.651 --> 00:26:06.047
- It was deafening
silence, when I fainted,

00:26:06.047 --> 00:26:07.872
It almost woke me, that's what woke me up,

00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:10.549
was that the audience
that had been laughing,

00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:11.565
like everything stopped.

00:26:11.565 --> 00:26:14.893
- But maybe they assumed
that you were in the middle

00:26:14.893 --> 00:26:16.190
of a bit or something like that.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:18.016
- They did, they did, and I was not.

00:26:18.016 --> 00:26:20.082
A lot of them were like oh
we thought you were joking.

00:26:20.082 --> 00:26:22.161
And I was like, what, why is that funny?

00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:23.287
That isn't.

00:26:23.287 --> 00:26:25.878
I was offended that they thought I was

00:26:25.878 --> 00:26:27.335
a stunt comic or whatever.

00:26:27.335 --> 00:26:28.229
- Right.
- Yeah.

00:26:28.229 --> 00:26:29.554
- Nicki Kaufman.
- Maybe it was going somewhere

00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:32.551
like I've seen comics trip
getting on stage before,

00:26:32.551 --> 00:26:36.030
and the audience just,
- Assumes.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.111
- assumes, ah, that's what
he does at the beginning.

00:26:38.111 --> 00:26:39.287
He just trips and falls.

00:26:39.287 --> 00:26:41.787
(rock music)
