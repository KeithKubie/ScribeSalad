the overall goal of the research in my

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
the overall goal of the research in my
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.860
the overall goal of the research in my
lab is to find the therapy against the

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870
lab is to find the therapy against the
 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.860
lab is to find the therapy against the
Alzheimer disease that's it's a very

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:30.870
Alzheimer disease that's it's a very
 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.700
Alzheimer disease that's it's a very
general way of the same things and to be

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710
general way of the same things and to be
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.900
general way of the same things and to be
to be more specific we are we have

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
to be more specific we are we have
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.830
to be more specific we are we have
different strategies in the lab to to go

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840
different strategies in the lab to to go
 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.280
different strategies in the lab to to go
to to to achieve this goal so we are

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290
to to to achieve this goal so we are
 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.910
to to to achieve this goal so we are
trying to approach it from different

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920
trying to approach it from different
 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:55.130
trying to approach it from different
perspectives and and and if I have to

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
perspectives and and and if I have to
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.410
perspectives and and and if I have to
summarize these perspectives in a few in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
summarize these perspectives in a few in
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.680
summarize these perspectives in a few in
a few words I should say that in one

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
a few words I should say that in one
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.070
a few words I should say that in one
kind of studies we are trying to to

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080
kind of studies we are trying to to
 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.760
kind of studies we are trying to to
understand what is the function of a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
understand what is the function of a
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.139
understand what is the function of a
molecule that is called beta-amyloid and

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149
molecule that is called beta-amyloid and
 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.600
molecule that is called beta-amyloid and
this is a molecule made by men amino

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
this is a molecule made by men amino
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.330
this is a molecule made by men amino
acid when once there are made amino acid

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340
acid when once there are made amino acid
 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160
acid when once there are made amino acid
together that those molecular called

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
together that those molecular called
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.520
together that those molecular called
peptides anyway this bed amyloid which

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530
peptides anyway this bed amyloid which
 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.830
peptides anyway this bed amyloid which
is produced in very high amount in the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
is produced in very high amount in the
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.440
is produced in very high amount in the
brain of people with this disease and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
brain of people with this disease and
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.559
brain of people with this disease and
this no nose would be very toxic to the

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569
this no nose would be very toxic to the
 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:39.050
this no nose would be very toxic to the
communication of the cells in the brain

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
communication of the cells in the brain
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.350
communication of the cells in the brain
and therefore to lead to memory

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
and therefore to lead to memory
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.630
and therefore to lead to memory
impairment so but we know that this

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
impairment so but we know that this
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940
impairment so but we know that this
molecule is President the brain of

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
molecule is President the brain of
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.910
molecule is President the brain of
people throughout life just normal

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
people throughout life just normal
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.279
people throughout life just normal
healthy people and it is there in very

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289
healthy people and it is there in very
 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.210
healthy people and it is there in very
low amount and nobody knew what was the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220
low amount and nobody knew what was the
 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.330
low amount and nobody knew what was the
function if I told that any function

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
function if I told that any function
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.990
function if I told that any function
this protein in this very low amount

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000
this protein in this very low amount
 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.990
this protein in this very low amount
what most of scientists thought was that

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
what most of scientists thought was that
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.850
what most of scientists thought was that
it was a kind of piece of garbage in the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
it was a kind of piece of garbage in the
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.100
it was a kind of piece of garbage in the
brain of people with no relevance

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
brain of people with no relevance
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.790
brain of people with no relevance
whatsoever and instead we have started

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800
whatsoever and instead we have started
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.809
whatsoever and instead we have started
working on it and we found that actually

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819
working on it and we found that actually
 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.330
working on it and we found that actually
they probably the very vital function of

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
they probably the very vital function of
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.740
they probably the very vital function of
this protein in very low amount is just

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
this protein in very low amount is just
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.130
this protein in very low amount is just
to be there to lead to normal memory so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
to be there to lead to normal memory so
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.250
to be there to lead to normal memory so
without it we

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260
without it we
 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.770
without it we
cannot store information the brain we

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780
cannot store information the brain we
 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.619
cannot store information the brain we
cannot learn they will not be it normal

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:38.629
cannot learn they will not be it normal
 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.149
cannot learn they will not be it normal
memory so I mean with all the study what

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159
memory so I mean with all the study what
 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.940
memory so I mean with all the study what
we think is that this molecule is there

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950
we think is that this molecule is there
 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.440
we think is that this molecule is there
it's necessary from memory and then for

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450
it's necessary from memory and then for
 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.960
it's necessary from memory and then for
some unknown reason we start making

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970
some unknown reason we start making
 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.600
some unknown reason we start making
people which with the disease are making

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610
people which with the disease are making
 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.270
people which with the disease are making
a lot of it and the fact is a lot just

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280
a lot of it and the fact is a lot just
 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.660
a lot of it and the fact is a lot just
makes the opposite of what it does in in

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670
makes the opposite of what it does in in
 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.360
makes the opposite of what it does in in
the normal brain so it's actually it

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
the normal brain so it's actually it
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.119
the normal brain so it's actually it
reduces memory when it is there in a

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129
reduces memory when it is there in a
 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.289
reduces memory when it is there in a
very high amount and so this is a very

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299
very high amount and so this is a very
 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.710
very high amount and so this is a very
very interesting characteristic and we

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720
very interesting characteristic and we
 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.379
very interesting characteristic and we
think that actually until the studies

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389
think that actually until the studies
 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.910
think that actually until the studies
were not there what people were doing to

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920
were not there what people were doing to
 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.729
were not there what people were doing to
understand the cause of the disease was

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739
understand the cause of the disease was
 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.619
understand the cause of the disease was
just to look at this from the very end

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629
just to look at this from the very end
 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.990
just to look at this from the very end
of it instead of trying to understand

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000
of it instead of trying to understand
 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.649
of it instead of trying to understand
you know it was a kind of a piece of a

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:35.659
you know it was a kind of a piece of a
 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.490
you know it was a kind of a piece of a
puzzle it is missing to understand the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500
 
 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.129
 
to understand how something which is

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139
to understand how something which is
 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.250
to understand how something which is
there becomes what is the beginning of

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260
there becomes what is the beginning of
 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.270
there becomes what is the beginning of
the of the end for for the poor memory

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280
the of the end for for the poor memory
 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.460
the of the end for for the poor memory
so in other words just to make things

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470
so in other words just to make things
 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.409
so in other words just to make things
more simple because simpler because

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419
more simple because simpler because
 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.300
more simple because simpler because
otherwise we get lost here is that now

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310
otherwise we get lost here is that now
 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.819
otherwise we get lost here is that now
now we know that number function of this

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829
now we know that number function of this
 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.099
now we know that number function of this
protein very low amount of the brain is

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109
protein very low amount of the brain is
 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.759
protein very low amount of the brain is
to lead to memories that this molecule

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769
to lead to memories that this molecule
 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.990
to lead to memories that this molecule
is necessary for memory and we now need

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000
is necessary for memory and we now need
 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.330
is necessary for memory and we now need
to understand how the problem starts our

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340
to understand how the problem starts our
 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.640
to understand how the problem starts our
memory is impaired we need to understand

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650
memory is impaired we need to understand
 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.580
memory is impaired we need to understand
how this normal regulation of the level

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590
how this normal regulation of the level
 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.680
how this normal regulation of the level
of this product in the brain is broken

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690
of this product in the brain is broken
 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.950
of this product in the brain is broken
and so the branched have to make a lot

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960
and so the branched have to make a lot
 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.230
and so the branched have to make a lot
of it so we think that through the

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240
of it so we think that through the
 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.839
of it so we think that through the
status and through establishing which

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849
status and through establishing which
 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.930
status and through establishing which
number function this protein we could

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940
number function this protein we could
 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.670
number function this protein we could
understand at the very beginning of the

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680
understand at the very beginning of the
 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.800
understand at the very beginning of the
disease and once you've usually you

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810
disease and once you've usually you
 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.629
disease and once you've usually you
understand how the disease starts which

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639
understand how the disease starts which
 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.310
understand how the disease starts which
something which you really we do not

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320
something which you really we do not
 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.930
something which you really we do not
have it so so far

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940
 
 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.930
 
what I found is that the normal function

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940
what I found is that the normal function
 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.530
what I found is that the normal function
of this protein is there to lead to

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540
of this protein is there to lead to
 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.020
of this protein is there to lead to
memory the opposite of memory loss so

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030
memory the opposite of memory loss so
 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.930
memory the opposite of memory loss so
now I would like to understand to bridge

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940
now I would like to understand to bridge
 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.670
now I would like to understand to bridge
between the normal function of this

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680
between the normal function of this
 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.760
between the normal function of this
protein which is just to lead to memory

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560
population they used to eat the brain of
 

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.620
population they used to eat the brain of
the dead people and then they were

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:18.630
the dead people and then they were
 

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.930
the dead people and then they were
transferring disease which one of the

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940
transferring disease which one of the
 

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.120
transferring disease which one of the
symptoms of this disease was dementia

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.130
symptoms of this disease was dementia
 

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.430
symptoms of this disease was dementia
and they were all developing dementia so

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440
and they were all developing dementia so
 

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.210
and they were all developing dementia so
over there there was a high incidence of

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:28.220
over there there was a high incidence of
 

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.450
over there there was a high incidence of
the ninja just because this habit of

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:31.460
the ninja just because this habit of
 

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.280
the ninja just because this habit of
heating the brain of the people that

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:34.290
heating the brain of the people that
 

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.340
heating the brain of the people that
were dead and therefore like an

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:37.350
were dead and therefore like an
 

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.300
were dead and therefore like an

higher incidence of people affected this
 

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.540
higher incidence of people affected this
is once this was found in this habits

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:50.550
is once this was found in this habits
 

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.750

were blue and we stopped then the

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760
were blue and we stopped then the
 

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.260
were blue and we stopped then the
incidence of disease became the same as

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:56.270
incidence of disease became the same as
 

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:04.530
incidence of disease became the same as
with another populations

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.960
 
in general you know if you look at our

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:06.970
in general you know if you look at our
 

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.640
in general you know if you look at our
society there is not a population of

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:11.650
society there is not a population of
 

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.940
society there is not a population of
people or you know that is more affected

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:14.950
people or you know that is more affected
 

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.420
people or you know that is more affected
by the loss of memory it is a problem

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:18.430
by the loss of memory it is a problem
 

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.090
by the loss of memory it is a problem
that hits with aging so something

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:21.100
that hits with aging so something
 

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.020
that hits with aging so something
related with the with aging and so it's

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.030
related with the with aging and so it's
 

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.670
related with the with aging and so it's
as we age we get more memory no more

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680
as we age we get more memory no more
 

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.130
as we age we get more memory no more
memory problem obviously not all the

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:32.140
memory problem obviously not all the
 

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.470
memory problem obviously not all the
people are evil there are somewhat a

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480
people are evil there are somewhat a
 

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.640
people are evil there are somewhat a
better memory than others and and we do

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:38.650
better memory than others and and we do
 

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.860
better memory than others and and we do
not know why some people have a better

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:40.870
not know why some people have a better
 

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.330
not know why some people have a better
memory than others I mean we say that

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:44.340
memory than others I mean we say that
 

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:52.590
memory than others I mean we say that
that they if we keep ourselves and our

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:52.600
that they if we keep ourselves and our
 

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.390
that they if we keep ourselves and our
brain exercises just like a muscle then

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:57.400
brain exercises just like a muscle then
 

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.130
brain exercises just like a muscle then
we tend to have memory problems less

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:02.140
we tend to have memory problems less
 

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.400
we tend to have memory problems less
memory problems so it kind of protective

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:05.410
memory problems so it kind of protective
 

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:09.600
memory problems so it kind of protective
the activity of mental activity even

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:09.610
the activity of mental activity even
 

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.490
the activity of mental activity even
some people think even physical activity

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:11.500
some people think even physical activity
 

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.590
some people think even physical activity
it could be protective against the

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600
it could be protective against the
 

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.560
it could be protective against the
memory loss the problem problem you know

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:16.570
memory loss the problem problem you know
 

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:22.050
memory loss the problem problem you know
the loss of memory that's what I would

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:22.060
the loss of memory that's what I would
 

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:28.380
the loss of memory that's what I would
have to say obviously there are diseases

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:28.390
have to say obviously there are diseases
 

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.280
have to say obviously there are diseases
which are associated the one of the most

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:32.290
which are associated the one of the most
 

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.100
which are associated the one of the most
typical one is Alzheimer disease which

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.110
typical one is Alzheimer disease which
 

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.130
typical one is Alzheimer disease which
are associated with the loss of memory

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:38.140
are associated with the loss of memory
 

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:47.920
are associated with the loss of memory
and others but are less relevant unless

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:47.930
 
 

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:52.540
 
and the characteristic symptoms of our

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:52.550
and the characteristic symptoms of our
 

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.340
and the characteristic symptoms of our
symptom of our semi disease which is

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:54.350
symptom of our semi disease which is
 

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:56.800
symptom of our semi disease which is
really whole Markel disease is the loss

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:56.810
really whole Markel disease is the loss
 

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.740
really whole Markel disease is the loss
of what we call short-term memory so

00:13:59.740 --> 00:13:59.750
of what we call short-term memory so
 

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.470
of what we call short-term memory so
that's how the disease starts actually

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480
that's how the disease starts actually
 

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.780
that's how the disease starts actually
it's people who cannot remember what

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:04.790
it's people who cannot remember what
 

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.780
it's people who cannot remember what
they just did just as a very short-term

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:07.790
they just did just as a very short-term
 

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.810
they just did just as a very short-term
memory loss and let's last for a very

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:10.820
memory loss and let's last for a very
 

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.160
memory loss and let's last for a very
very long time and publicity the memory

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.170
very long time and publicity the memory
 

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:19.389
very long time and publicity the memory
problem get worse and worse and only a

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:19.399
problem get worse and worse and only a
 

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:21.300
problem get worse and worse and only a
day late stage of Alzheimer's disease

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:21.310
day late stage of Alzheimer's disease
 

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.760
day late stage of Alzheimer's disease
it's when also logical memory is

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:24.770
it's when also logical memory is
 

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.790
it's when also logical memory is
affected but the major characteristic of

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.640
 
well I mean that obviously I bet that

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:57.650
well I mean that obviously I bet that
 

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.890

smell is much more important for a dog

00:17:59.890 --> 00:17:59.900

and therefore that probably much better
 

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.530
and therefore that probably much better

it's very bored to be exercised at
 

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.400
it's very bored to be exercised at
learning I bet that relying too much on

we do not need to learn but because as I

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:31.450
we do not need to learn but because as I
 

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.750
we do not need to learn but because as I
said at the beginning attention is very

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760
said at the beginning attention is very
 

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.500
said at the beginning attention is very
important so if you do not pay enough

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:37.510
important so if you do not pay enough
 

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:40.530
important so if you do not pay enough
attention because you write that kind of

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:40.540
attention because you write that kind of
 

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.850
attention because you write that kind of
thing then obviously you will learn less

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:44.860
thing then obviously you will learn less
 

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.800
thing then obviously you will learn less
so the secret would be just a minute

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:46.810
so the secret would be just a minute
 

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.110
so the secret would be just a minute
obviously if you repeat 10 times the

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120
obviously if you repeat 10 times the
 

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.580
obviously if you repeat 10 times the
same thing you have more chances to

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:50.590
same thing you have more chances to
 

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.610
same thing you have more chances to
learn it or if you use association with

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:53.620
learn it or if you use association with
 

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.200
learn it or if you use association with
in what you learn with something else

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.210
in what you learn with something else
 

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.990
in what you learn with something else
and you store this association in the

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000
and you store this association in the
 

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.510
and you store this association in the
brain then then you will remember that

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520
brain then then you will remember that
 

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.690
brain then then you will remember that
particular thing better than another so

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:06.700
particular thing better than another so
 

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.010
particular thing better than another so
it's there are ways people uses and to

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:11.020
it's there are ways people uses and to
 

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:15.710
it's there are ways people uses and to
memorize and and then there are also

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720
memorize and and then there are also
 

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.570
memorize and and then there are also

better will remember geographical names

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.110
better will remember geographical names
 

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:30.840
better will remember geographical names
location etc so I bet there are people

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:30.850
location etc so I bet there are people
 

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.880
location etc so I bet there are people
are better remember don't use notes and

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:32.890
are better remember don't use notes and
 

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.760
are better remember don't use notes and
music than others depends also what you

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:35.770
music than others depends also what you
 

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.410
music than others depends also what you
like it what you don't like just because

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:37.420
like it what you don't like just because
 

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.090
like it what you don't like just because
you pay more attention to what you liked

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:39.100
you pay more attention to what you liked
 

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.769
you pay more attention to what you liked
and what you don't like

00:20:43.769 --> 00:20:43.779
 
 

00:20:43.779 --> 00:20:46.139
 
as I said before the only thing this

00:20:46.139 --> 00:20:46.149
as I said before the only thing this
 

00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:48.029

issuer is just to exercise your brain

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:48.039
issuer is just to exercise your brain
 

00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:51.180
issuer is just to exercise your brain
and just like you do with the gym know

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:51.190
and just like you do with the gym know
 

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:54.839
and just like you do with the gym know
with your muscles and that's for sure

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:54.849
with your muscles and that's for sure
 

00:20:54.849 --> 00:20:56.969
with your muscles and that's for sure
should help because the brain we have to

00:20:56.969 --> 00:20:56.979
should help because the brain we have to
 

00:20:56.979 --> 00:21:00.899

see the brain also like like an organ it

00:21:00.899 --> 00:21:00.909
see the brain also like like an organ it

has a reserve so if we built up bigger
reserve then when diseases will heat or

00:21:07.709 --> 00:21:07.719
reserve then when diseases will heat or
 

00:21:07.719 --> 00:21:09.299
reserve then when diseases will heat or
the memory program we will start

00:21:09.299 --> 00:21:09.309
the memory program we will start
 

00:21:09.309 --> 00:21:10.859
the memory program we will start
occurring we will have more time to

00:21:10.859 --> 00:21:10.869
occurring we will have more time to
 

00:21:10.869 --> 00:21:14.339
occurring we will have more time to
compensate for the for the problem so it

00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:14.349
compensate for the for the problem so it
 

00:21:14.349 --> 00:21:18.509
compensate for the for the problem so it
diseases should be start later and

00:21:18.509 --> 00:21:18.519
diseases should be start later and
 

00:21:18.519 --> 00:21:22.259
diseases should be start later and
slower and just not that we will avoid

00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:22.269
slower and just not that we will avoid
 

00:21:22.269 --> 00:21:26.459
slower and just not that we will avoid
the disease but it almost likely what we

00:21:26.459 --> 00:21:26.469
the disease but it almost likely what we
 

00:21:26.469 --> 00:21:31.229
the disease but it almost likely what we
scientists think most likely happen is

00:21:31.229 --> 00:21:31.239
scientists think most likely happen is
 

00:21:31.239 --> 00:21:34.320
scientists think most likely happen is
just with more reserved in the brain so

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:34.330
just with more reserved in the brain so
 

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:37.579
just with more reserved in the brain so
that's for sure I have to say also that

00:21:37.579 --> 00:21:37.589
that's for sure I have to say also that
 

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:40.139
that's for sure I have to say also that
although it needs to be confirmed

that the does not mean that it will not
 

00:22:12.039 --> 00:22:14.279
that the does not mean that it will not
happen but it will happen there will be

don't think it works like that

00:23:37.639 --> 00:23:37.649
 
 

00:23:37.649 --> 00:23:40.529
 
it happens and most likely you are

00:23:40.529 --> 00:23:40.539
it happens and most likely you are
 

00:23:40.539 --> 00:23:46.769
it happens and most likely you are
storing things in the brain and you're

00:23:46.769 --> 00:23:46.779
storing things in the brain and you're
 

00:23:46.779 --> 00:23:49.529
storing things in the brain and you're
confusing for me your fantasy with the

00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:49.539
confusing for me your fantasy with the
 

00:23:49.539 --> 00:23:56.759
confusing for me your fantasy with the
reality and were you one possibility the

00:23:56.759 --> 00:23:56.769
reality and were you one possibility the
 

00:23:56.769 --> 00:23:58.230

perception of what you saw so you store
 

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.509
perception of what you saw so you store
in a certain way because you're

00:24:03.509 --> 00:24:03.519
in a certain way because you're
 

00:24:03.519 --> 00:24:09.779
in a certain way because you're
convinced that that it's that way but it

00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:09.789
convinced that that it's that way but it
 

00:24:09.789 --> 00:24:15.210
convinced that that it's that way but it
was not that way if let's say

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:15.220
 
 

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:20.130
 
a stupid example I mean you're convinced

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:20.140
a stupid example I mean you're convinced
 

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.649
a stupid example I mean you're convinced
that maybe were not did not pay that

that maybe were not did not pay that
 

00:24:22.659 --> 00:24:24.960
that maybe were not did not pay that
much attention and you convince that

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:24.970
much attention and you convince that
 

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.090
much attention and you convince that
person was just in red instead was pink

or a color close to read then then you

00:24:33.899 --> 00:24:33.909
or a color close to read then then you
 

00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:36.000
or a color close to read then then you
you store the thing in that that way

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.010
you store the thing in that that way

you store the thing in that that way
obviously with time and the memory will

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440
obviously with time and the memory will
 

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.840
obviously with time and the memory will
become more far away certain aspect

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:42.850

could disappear and we could fill them

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:46.750
could disappear and we could fill them
 

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:49.230
could disappear and we could fill them
with other aspect just to fill the gap

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240
with other aspect just to fill the gap
 

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.110
with other aspect just to fill the gap
so we make up for the memory and we

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120
so we make up for the memory and we
 

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.760
so we make up for the memory and we
build up the memory and the time of

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:53.770
build up the memory and the time of
 

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.140
build up the memory and the time of
recalling the memory we are recording

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:57.150
recalling the memory we are recording
 

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.480

stuff that occurred in other
 

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.279
stuff that occurred in other
circumstances because I mean it's a

circumstances because I mean it's a
 

00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:05.130

recorder like passive recording it's a

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:08.590
recorder like passive recording it's a
 

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.279
recorder like passive recording it's a
more active process so being an active

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:11.289
more active process so being an active
 

00:25:11.289 --> 00:25:16.950
more active process so being an active
process there are could be ways of you

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960

know changing it because actively we can
 

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.070
know changing it because actively we can
we can change so that's something which

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080
we can change so that's something which
 

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.990
we can change so that's something which

you change something from analog to

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240
you change something from analog to
 

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.799
you change something from analog to
digital just to make one of those things

00:26:28.799 --> 00:26:28.809
digital just to make one of those things
 

00:26:28.809 --> 00:26:33.899

not the video from the computer and in

00:26:33.899 --> 00:26:33.909
not the video from the computer and in
 

00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:35.700
not the video from the computer and in
that process of changing from analog to

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:35.710
that process of changing from analog to
 

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:40.649
that process of changing from analog to
digital you can change something and

00:26:40.649 --> 00:26:40.659
digital you can change something and
 

00:26:40.659 --> 00:26:44.159
digital you can change something and
will not be the same you know what if

00:26:44.159 --> 00:26:44.169
will not be the same you know what if
 

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:48.419
will not be the same you know what if
you change the chip or something and you

00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:48.429
you change the chip or something and you
 

00:26:48.429 --> 00:26:51.090
you change the chip or something and you
change the yellow into a green so what

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:51.100
change the yellow into a green so what
 

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.680
change the yellow into a green so what
there was yellow will be green and or a

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:55.690
there was yellow will be green and or a
 

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.930
there was yellow will be green and or a
when I say nay you can even artificially

00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940
when I say nay you can even artificially
 

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:04.289
when I say nay you can even artificially
change it to into a B if you want

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:04.299
change it to into a B if you want
 

00:27:04.299 --> 00:27:05.639
change it to into a B if you want
because if you tell the computer to

00:27:05.639 --> 00:27:05.649
because if you tell the computer to
 

00:27:05.649 --> 00:27:07.200
because if you tell the computer to
change all the a into a bit and

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.210
change all the a into a bit and
 

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.899
change all the a into a bit and
everything would be a baby or sometimes

00:27:09.899 --> 00:27:09.909
everything would be a baby or sometimes
 

00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:11.639
everything would be a baby or sometimes
you this process some may will changing

00:27:11.639 --> 00:27:11.649
you this process some may will changing
 

00:27:11.649 --> 00:27:13.710
you this process some may will changing
their be done will change just some

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720
their be done will change just some
 

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:16.680
their be done will change just some
activity something that is they are

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:16.690
activity something that is they are
 

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:24.390
activity something that is they are
occurring and it changes

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:24.400
