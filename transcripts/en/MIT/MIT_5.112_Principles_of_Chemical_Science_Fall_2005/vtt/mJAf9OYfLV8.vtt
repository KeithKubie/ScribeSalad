00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.281
Let's pick up from where we
were on Friday.

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:24.990
We had discovered the nucleus.
Now we were faced with the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.291
problem, as all the scientific
community was in 1911,

00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:36.000
in trying to understand the
structure of the atom.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.585
Where was the nucleus in the
atom?

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:41.953
Where was the electron?
How were they bound?

00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:46.262
How did they hang together?
And we talked about the fact

00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:49.788
that the electron in the
nucleus, the force of

00:00:49.788 --> 00:00:53.000
interaction is the Coulomb
force.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.875
And we started talking about
how, at that time,

00:00:56.875 --> 00:01:01.594
the only equation of motion
that was going to allow us to

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:06.902
figure out how the electron and
nucleus moved under influence of

00:01:06.902 --> 00:01:11.199
this Coulomb force was Newton's
equations of motion,

00:01:11.199 --> 00:01:15.580
in particular the Second Law,
F equals ma.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.709
And so, in order to apply that
equation of motion,

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:24.764
we needed a model for the atom.
And what was the simplest and

00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:31.000
most obvious thing to do was to
suggest the planetary model.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.889
After all, that is how the
astronomical bodies moved around

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:39.177
the sun.
And so the model that is set up

00:01:39.177 --> 00:01:44.404
is one where this electron has a
uniform circular motion around

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:49.546
the nucleus with a well-defined
radius, which we called r star.

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:52.244
We said that given this,

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.857
the acceleration was a
constant.

00:01:54.857 --> 00:02:00.000
It was given by v squared over.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.228
The linear velocity over r.
We plugged that into F equals,

00:02:05.228 --> 00:02:08.870
put in the Coulomb force,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.472
and from that we were able to
calculate the kinetic energy of

00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:18.021
that electron going around the
nucleus.

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:23.063
Well, the reason I want to
calculate the kinetic energy

00:02:23.063 --> 00:02:28.665
from this model is because I
want to ultimately calculate the

00:02:28.665 --> 00:02:33.732
total energy.
And why I want to calculate the

00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:38.756
total energy is going to be
obvious in just a few minutes.

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:41.753
My goal is to get the total
energy.

00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:46.778
Actually, I am using my notes
from Friday because I didn't

00:02:46.778 --> 00:02:50.392
finish them.
You may need to get them out.

00:02:50.392 --> 00:02:55.504
This will probably often be the
case, is that I won't quite

00:02:55.504 --> 00:03:00.000
finish the notes from the other
lecture.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.725
I will start out the next
lecture where I left off,

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:09.734
so you should bring your
previous day's notes to class

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:13.326
if, in fact, you use them during
class.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:18.996
I want the kinetic energy plus
the potential energy because I

00:03:18.996 --> 00:03:24.289
want both of them to add them up
to get the total energy.

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:29.204
I know the kinetic energy.
Now, we need the potential

00:03:29.204 --> 00:03:33.636
energy.
What is the potential energy?

00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:39.090
Well, the potential energy is
the integral over the operating

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.090
force over the appropriate
limits.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.000
In this case,
if our force of interaction is

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.363
the Coulomb force,
which I will just represent as

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:54.363
F of r,
I am going to integrate this

00:03:54.363 --> 00:03:58.454
from r star out,
and this is going to be minus

00:03:58.454 --> 00:04:04.916
the integral of the force.
Now, some of you may have seen

00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:08.319
this before.
This is a general case,

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.472
the potential energy of
anything is minus the integral

00:04:13.472 --> 00:04:18.819
of the operating force over the
appropriate coordinates.

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:22.708
If you have seen it before,
that is fine,

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:26.500
you are happy.
If you have not seen this

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.000
before, you are panicked.
Don't panic.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.166
I do not hold you responsible
for this.

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:38.000
You will see it in 8.01 later
on this semester.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.666
When you see it later on,
you can come back here and say,

00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:45.416
okay, now I know what is going
on.

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:50.333
But I just need it right now to
make a point about the total

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:54.416
energy of the system.
And that is what is going to

00:04:54.416 --> 00:05:00.000
lead me to the conundrum.
I need the potential energy.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.547
It is the integral of the
force.

00:05:02.547 --> 00:05:05.589
Let me plug in,
here, my force that is

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:10.273
operating, e squared 4 pi
epsilon nought r squared.

00:05:10.273 --> 00:05:14.630
I do that integral and put in

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.068
the appropriate limits.
It is minus e squared over 4 pi

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:23.424
epsilon nought r star.

00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:27.287
Now I have kinetic energy plus
potential energy.

00:05:27.287 --> 00:05:32.389
Let me add them up.
The kinetic is one-half e

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:37.262
squared 4 pi epsilon nought r
star.

00:05:37.262 --> 00:05:41.849
Potential, minus e squared over

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:47.201
4 pi epsilon nought r star.

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:52.839
The result is minus one-half e
squared 4 pi epsilon nought r

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:55.419
star.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.667
That is the total energy here

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:08.624
of this particular system.
Well, why I wanted this total

00:06:08.624 --> 00:06:15.707
energy is to show you that this
total energy is negative.

00:06:15.707 --> 00:06:23.043
What that negative means to us
is that the system is bound.

00:06:23.043 --> 00:06:30.000
The electron and the nucleus
are stuck together.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.478
And I can show you that maybe a
little more clearly if I draw an

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:39.565
energy level diagram.
Let me plot here the total

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:42.347
energy.
And I am plotting it as a

00:06:42.347 --> 00:06:45.652
function of r,
the distance between the

00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:50.434
electron and the nucleus.
Well, what you can see is that

00:06:50.434 --> 00:06:54.521
for very large r,
the energy here is going to be

00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:57.113
zero.
Way out here,

00:06:57.113 --> 00:07:01.138
for very large r,
where we have the electron and

00:07:01.138 --> 00:07:06.105
the nucleus separated infinitely
apart, the energy is zero.

00:07:06.105 --> 00:07:09.445
And, of course,
as you bring them closer

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:14.241
together, the energy goes down.
And when you are exactly,

00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:17.496
and we calculated this,
at r star here,

00:07:17.496 --> 00:07:22.720
well, then the total energy is
minus one-half e squared over 4

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.259
pi epsilon nought times r star.

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:32.466
If you brought the electron and

00:07:32.466 --> 00:07:36.525
the nucleus into this value here
of r star,

00:07:36.525 --> 00:07:39.151
the energy would change like
that.

00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:42.652
But the big point is this
energy is negative,

00:07:42.652 --> 00:07:46.392
or it is lower than the
electron and the nucleus

00:07:46.392 --> 00:07:49.416
separated.
That means that the electron

00:07:49.416 --> 00:07:54.111
and nucleus are stuck together.
You are going to have to put

00:07:54.111 --> 00:08:00.000
this much energy into the system
in order to pull them apart.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.765
That is the big point here,
is that this model so far looks

00:08:05.765 --> 00:08:10.933
like everything is hunky-dory.
Everything is working.

00:08:10.933 --> 00:08:14.213
The electron stuck to the
nucleus.

00:08:14.213 --> 00:08:18.487
It is not going anywhere.
It looks terrific.

00:08:18.487 --> 00:08:24.451
But here comes the conundrum.
The conundrum is that classical

00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:28.228
electromagnetism,
which was pretty well

00:08:28.228 --> 00:08:33.000
understood by this time,
1911, 1912.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.292
Maxwell's equations,
that was down pat.

00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:42.602
But what classical
electromagnetism says is that

00:08:42.602 --> 00:08:48.589
when you have a charge,
and this electron is a charge,

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:54.351
that is accelerating,
that charge has to be emitting

00:08:54.351 --> 00:09:00.000
radiation.
It has to be giving off energy.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.142
After all, that is actually how
an antenna works.

00:09:05.142 --> 00:09:09.642
In an antenna,
what you are doing is taking

00:09:09.642 --> 00:09:13.821
charge and sloshing it,
accelerating it.

00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:18.000
When it accelerates,
it emits radiation.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.178
That is how you broadcast.
That is true,

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:27.750
it was known in 1911.
Synchrotron radiation works the

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.692
same way.
When you have a synchrotron,

00:09:32.692 --> 00:09:37.884
the way you get synchrotron
radiation is essentially by

00:09:37.884 --> 00:09:41.923
accelerating charge.
That is a given and is

00:09:41.923 --> 00:09:46.250
actually, again,
something you will talk about

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:51.730
in much more detail in 8.02.
But the point here is if this

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.923
charge is being accelerated,
and it is, then it must be

00:09:56.923 --> 00:10:02.364
giving off radiation.
It must be giving off energy.

00:10:02.364 --> 00:10:06.766
Well, if it is giving off
energy, we look at our energy

00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:10.516
expression here.
That must mean that the energy

00:10:10.516 --> 00:10:15.326
in the system is going down
because it is losing the energy.

00:10:15.326 --> 00:10:17.934
It is giving it off to
radiation.

00:10:17.934 --> 00:10:21.684
If E is going down,
it is getting more negative

00:10:21.684 --> 00:10:24.538
here.
The only way for E to get more

00:10:24.538 --> 00:10:30.000
negative is for this r star
right here to be changing.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.086
Is for r star to be getting
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:10:37.086 --> 00:10:44.173
Well, we could set up another
set of equations using what we

00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:50.058
know from classical
electromagnetism and from what

00:10:50.058 --> 00:10:56.905
we have already done here.
What we would find is that this

00:10:56.905 --> 00:11:04.351
value here of r star would go to
zero in t equal 10^-10 seconds

00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:13.000
if r was originally on the order
of an angstrom to begin with.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.444
Here is the problem.
Classical equations of motion

00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:22.777
coupled with classical
electromagnetism,

00:11:22.777 --> 00:11:29.000
they are making a prediction
that my atom is not going to

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.252
live more than 10^-10 seconds.
Because in 10^-10 seconds,

00:11:35.252 --> 00:11:38.544
that electron is on top of the
nucleus.

00:11:38.544 --> 00:11:43.482
We no longer have an atom that
was already known to have a

00:11:43.482 --> 00:11:47.727
volume associated with a
diameter that is about an

00:11:47.727 --> 00:11:51.019
angstrom.
The classical way of thinking

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:55.611
is making a prediction that is
not consistent with the

00:11:55.611 --> 00:11:58.990
observations at that time.
And even now,

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:04.274
it is predicted that the atom
essentially kind of annihilates,

00:12:04.274 --> 00:12:10.599
collapses in 10^-10 seconds.
And that is the problem that

00:12:10.599 --> 00:12:13.940
the scientific community had in
1911.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.375
That is the problem we have
right now.

00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:20.345
And they had it for 10,
12 years.

00:12:20.345 --> 00:12:23.502
Now you can say what is wrong
here?

00:12:23.502 --> 00:12:28.050
Well, it is possible,
and they were thinking about

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:32.507
this, too.
It is possible that maybe this

00:12:32.507 --> 00:12:35.349
force is wrong,
this Coulomb force.

00:12:35.349 --> 00:12:38.358
That is a possibility.
Or, of course,

00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:42.537
maybe it is the equations of
motion that are wrong.

00:12:42.537 --> 00:12:46.047
That is possible.
Or, maybe it is classical

00:12:46.047 --> 00:12:50.811
electromagnetism that is wrong.
Well, of course what it is

00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:54.991
going to turn out to be is the
equations of motion,

00:12:54.991 --> 00:13:00.750
F equals ma.
Bottom line is that you cannot

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:05.518
use classical mechanics to
explain the motion of this

00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:10.011
microscopic particle,
the atom, in the constrained

00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:14.320
environment of an atom.
That is the bottom line.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.997
We need different mechanics.
We cannot use classical

00:13:18.997 --> 00:13:24.590
mechanics to describe how that
electron hangs on that nucleus,

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:30.000
how they are bound.
And so that was the problem.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.166
This signaled something was
really amiss in the scientific

00:13:35.166 --> 00:13:38.338
community in the world at that
time.

00:13:38.338 --> 00:13:40.876
That is our problem now,
too.

00:13:40.876 --> 00:13:45.407
What is the next step?
Well, historically the clues

00:13:45.407 --> 00:13:50.483
about why the electron did not
actually collapse into the

00:13:50.483 --> 00:13:55.287
nucleus, like classical physics
predicted, came from a

00:13:55.287 --> 00:14:00.000
completely different area of
discussion.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.747
It came from the discussion of
the wave-particle duality of

00:14:05.747 --> 00:14:09.909
light and matter.
It was long believed that

00:14:09.909 --> 00:14:15.558
matter, with its particle-like
behavior, was distinct from

00:14:15.558 --> 00:14:20.612
light, which was this
transmission of energy through

00:14:20.612 --> 00:14:24.106
space.
But, in the last 1800s and

00:14:24.106 --> 00:14:29.049
early 1900s, there were a few
experiments that appeared on the

00:14:29.049 --> 00:14:33.991
horizon that began to suggest
that maybe this boundary between

00:14:33.991 --> 00:14:38.852
matter with its particle-like
behavior and radiation with its

00:14:38.852 --> 00:14:42.579
wave-like behavior was not as
rigid as thought.

00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:45.820
And, in fact,
what we are going to see is

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.628
that radiation has both
wave-like properties and

00:14:49.628 --> 00:14:53.923
particle-like properties.
It depends on the particular

00:14:53.923 --> 00:15:00.000
experiment that you do which one
of those behaviors you see.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.200
And, consequently,
matter behaves both as a

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.000
particle and a wave.
Again, it depends on exactly

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.200
what experiment you do,
which one of those properties

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:18.299
you observe.
What we are going to do right

00:15:18.299 --> 00:15:24.299
now is put aside the discussion
of the structure of the atom.

00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:30.000
We are going to put it aside
until next Monday.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.960
We have to do that because we
need some more information in

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.990
order to take a big leap to get
us out of this constraint of

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.448
classical mechanics.
And those clues,

00:15:40.448 --> 00:15:44.273
as I said, came from this
discussion of the wave-particle

00:15:44.273 --> 00:15:48.165
duality of light and matter.
And that is what we are going

00:15:48.165 --> 00:15:51.375
to be talking about for the next
three lectures.

00:15:51.375 --> 00:15:55.541
Then we are going to come back
and tie in those results to the

00:15:55.541 --> 00:16:00.500
structure of the atom.
Of course, where that is going

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:05.750
to lead us is a new equation of
motion called quantum mechanics.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.166
That is where we are going.
Let's start off by talking

00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:14.750
about radiation or light.
We are going to talk about its

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.000
wave-like properties,
then Wednesday we are going to

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
talk about the particle-like
properties of light,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.083
and Friday we are going to talk
about the wave-like properties

00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:32.812
of matter.
That is where we are going.

00:16:32.812 --> 00:16:38.541
Let's talk about waves here.
You all know that waves are

00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:42.395
some periodic variation of a
quantity.

00:16:42.395 --> 00:16:45.000
A water wave,
for example,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.687
is a periodic variation of the
level of water.

00:16:49.687 --> 00:16:54.687
At some points in space,
the water level is high.

00:16:54.687 --> 00:17:00.000
At other points,
the water level is low.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.506
Sound wave.
Well, a sound wave is the

00:17:03.506 --> 00:17:07.402
periodic variation of the
density of air.

00:17:07.402 --> 00:17:11.883
At some points in space,
the air is very dense.

00:17:11.883 --> 00:17:16.363
At other points in space,
the air is not dense.

00:17:16.363 --> 00:17:22.207
Well, light or radiation is a
period variation of an electric

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:25.811
field, as I depict here on this
slide.

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:32.815
Electric field versus position.
There is a periodic variation

00:17:32.815 --> 00:17:37.184
of the electric field.
Now, exactly what is an

00:17:37.184 --> 00:17:40.776
electric field?
Some of you know this,

00:17:40.776 --> 00:17:44.854
some of you don't,
but an electric field is

00:17:44.854 --> 00:17:49.708
literally the space through
which the Coulomb force

00:17:49.708 --> 00:17:51.747
operates.
For example,

00:17:51.747 --> 00:17:57.669
if we have a negatively charged
plate and a positively charged

00:17:57.669 --> 00:18:02.148
plate here.
The space through which the

00:18:02.148 --> 00:18:06.604
Coulomb force is operating here,
and the Coulomb force is

00:18:06.604 --> 00:18:11.379
operating because we have two
plates here that are oppositely

00:18:11.379 --> 00:18:14.482
charged.
The electric field is the space

00:18:14.482 --> 00:18:17.665
through which the Coulomb force
operates.

00:18:17.665 --> 00:18:22.281
If we put a positive charge in
that space, you know what is

00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:25.702
going to happen.
In this coordinated system,

00:18:25.702 --> 00:18:30.000
the positive charge is going to
float up.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.750
Because the negatively charged
plate is up above.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:40.590
If we reversed the potential
difference and put a positively

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.450
charged particle in this
electric field,

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:48.211
in this space,
it is going to move down

00:18:48.211 --> 00:18:53.061
because now the negatively
charged plate is lower.

00:18:53.061 --> 00:18:59.000
This electric field here has
not only magnitude --

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.647
You can imagine here the
magnitude is given by the

00:19:02.647 --> 00:19:05.923
difference in the potentials of
these plates.

00:19:05.923 --> 00:19:09.719
The larger the difference,
the larger the magnitude.

00:19:09.719 --> 00:19:12.548
But it also has direction.
In one case,

00:19:12.548 --> 00:19:15.600
it is pointed this way.
In the other case,

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.471
it is pointed that way.
And that is reflected here on

00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:22.151
this plot of the electric field
here.

00:19:22.151 --> 00:19:26.022
What you see is that right
here, the magnitude of the

00:19:26.022 --> 00:19:31.079
electric field is small.
As you move along in x,

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:34.968
that magnitude increases,
goes to a maximum,

00:19:34.968 --> 00:19:39.760
then turns around and at some
point literally is zero.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:44.462
And then the electric field
changes direction and its

00:19:44.462 --> 00:19:48.531
magnitude increases in the
opposite direction.

00:19:48.531 --> 00:19:51.877
Increases, increases,
gets to a point,

00:19:51.877 --> 00:19:55.494
then turns around and becomes
zero again.

00:19:55.494 --> 00:20:00.468
If you have a charge in a
radiation field and you put it

00:20:00.468 --> 00:20:05.846
right here --
Well, it would be pulled in one

00:20:05.846 --> 00:20:08.969
direction.
If you put it over here,

00:20:08.969 --> 00:20:12.734
it would be pulled in the other
direction.

00:20:12.734 --> 00:20:16.683
We have a magnitude and we have
a direction.

00:20:16.683 --> 00:20:21.183
Now, not only is light a
periodic variation of the

00:20:21.183 --> 00:20:26.234
electric field in space,
it is also a periodic variation

00:20:26.234 --> 00:20:32.650
of the electric field in time.
That is, this is a picture of

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.939
that field, that one instant in
time.

00:20:35.939 --> 00:20:39.229
We will call it t equals 0.

00:20:39.229 --> 00:20:42.336
However, that electric field
moves.

00:20:42.336 --> 00:20:45.169
It propagates.
And the distance,

00:20:45.169 --> 00:20:50.652
or the time it takes for the
electric field here to move over

00:20:50.652 --> 00:20:54.582
one wavelength,
I have shown this as a star.

00:20:54.582 --> 00:20:59.882
The time it takes for this
maximum to go from here to here,

00:20:59.882 --> 00:21:05.000
one wavelength,
is defined as one period.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.092
And a period is given by one
over nu,

00:21:09.092 --> 00:21:12.829
where nu is the frequency of
the radiation.

00:21:12.829 --> 00:21:16.120
It is the number of cycles per
second.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.035
In other words,
if you were sitting here at x

00:21:20.035 --> 00:21:24.217
equals 0,
you were tied at x equals 0,

00:21:24.217 --> 00:21:30.000
and you were just watching this
electric field come by.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.735
You would see a maximum in that
electric field,

00:21:34.735 --> 00:21:40.294
one maximum every second if the
frequency is one Hertz.

00:21:40.294 --> 00:21:44.926
In other words,
the frequency is the number of

00:21:44.926 --> 00:21:49.352
maxima you would see pass by you
per second.

00:21:49.352 --> 00:21:54.088
Well, we have a unit to
characterize frequency.

00:21:54.088 --> 00:22:00.733
I call it cycles per second.
It is cycles per second,

00:22:00.733 --> 00:22:06.882
but the formal unit is Hertz.
Hertz is inverse seconds.

00:22:06.882 --> 00:22:10.640
We leave out the number of
cycles.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:16.562
The number of cycles is implied
in the unit of Hertz.

00:22:16.562 --> 00:22:22.142
To give another example,
here, suppose we had some

00:22:22.142 --> 00:22:30.000
radiation and the frequency of
that radiation was one Hertz.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.940
Suppose we had an electron,
an electron is charged,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:40.571
and we put here at x equals 0
and we tie it at x equals 0.

00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:44.523
What is going to happen to this
electron?

00:22:44.523 --> 00:22:50.353
Well, what is going to happen
is that this electron is going

00:22:50.353 --> 00:22:56.577
to be pulled down and then it is
going to be pushed back up once

00:22:56.577 --> 00:23:00.529
every second because the
frequency, here,

00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:04.423
is one Hertz.
It is charged,

00:23:04.423 --> 00:23:07.779
and we are tying it at x equals
0.

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:13.576
It is going to go like this.
It is going to oscillate once

00:23:13.576 --> 00:23:17.949
every second if this frequency
is one hertz.

00:23:17.949 --> 00:23:22.322
Here it goes.
An electron is pulled down and

00:23:22.322 --> 00:23:26.084
then pushed back up once every
second.

00:23:26.084 --> 00:23:30.457
Now, we, of course,
can write an equation to

00:23:30.457 --> 00:23:36.966
describe this oscillation of the
electric field in both space and

00:23:36.966 --> 00:23:41.552
time.
x is the position variable,

00:23:41.552 --> 00:23:45.996
t, the time variable,
and I have written it down

00:23:45.996 --> 00:23:49.021
here.
I will explain this more in

00:23:49.021 --> 00:23:53.087
just a moment,
but what I also want to point

00:23:53.087 --> 00:23:57.625
out is that an oscillating
electric field always,

00:23:57.625 --> 00:24:01.407
always, always has
perpendicular to it an

00:24:01.407 --> 00:24:06.860
oscillating magnetic field.
That is well described by

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.357
Maxwell's equations.
Again, you are going to see

00:24:10.357 --> 00:24:13.630
that in 8.02.
And the magnetic field here has

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:18.169
the same essentially function
form and characteristics as this

00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:20.848
electric field.
And, because it does,

00:24:20.848 --> 00:24:24.419
I am just going to talk about
the electric field.

00:24:24.419 --> 00:24:27.767
Here is the expression for the
magnetic field.

00:24:27.767 --> 00:24:32.809
I just call it H.
But, again, it is a function of

00:24:32.809 --> 00:24:36.616
position and time.
Here is an illustration,

00:24:36.616 --> 00:24:40.241
just the variation of the
electric field.

00:24:40.241 --> 00:24:45.679
Light, radiation is actually a
variation in space and time of

00:24:45.679 --> 00:24:49.123
both the electric and a magnetic
field.

00:24:49.123 --> 00:24:53.021
That is why it is
electromagnetic radiation.

00:24:53.021 --> 00:24:56.646
Now, let me show you on the
8.02 website.

00:24:56.646 --> 00:25:01.084
Let me get that rolling.
There it is.

00:25:01.084 --> 00:25:04.156
Now we have to start it.
All right.

00:25:04.156 --> 00:25:07.228
One of these is the electric
field.

00:25:07.228 --> 00:25:10.391
The other one is the magnetic
field.

00:25:10.391 --> 00:25:14.638
This is a simulation that 8.02
has made for you.

00:25:14.638 --> 00:25:18.704
You can go and look at it on
the 8.02 website,

00:25:18.704 --> 00:25:22.590
but you can see it propagating
here in time,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:28.102
and you can see its variation
in space of this electromagnetic

00:25:28.102 --> 00:25:32.021
field.
Let's look at this functional

00:25:32.021 --> 00:25:35.576
form just a little more
carefully, just to make sure

00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:39.689
everybody is on the same page.
I think many of you have seen

00:25:39.689 --> 00:25:42.198
this before.
What we are going to do,

00:25:42.198 --> 00:25:46.171
because we have two variables,
is we are going to hold one

00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:50.005
variable constant and plot it as
a function of the other

00:25:50.005 --> 00:25:53.978
variable, just to explain the
parameters that go into this

00:25:53.978 --> 00:25:57.486
functional form.
At time t equals 0,

00:25:57.486 --> 00:26:01.086
if in this equation here I
stick in t equals 0,

00:26:01.086 --> 00:26:03.747
I have a form that looks like
this.

00:26:03.747 --> 00:26:07.347
It is just the cosine function
in x.

00:26:07.347 --> 00:26:11.573
And you can see that the
amplitude goes from positive A

00:26:11.573 --> 00:26:14.547
to minus A.
And so what you see is that

00:26:14.547 --> 00:26:19.165
this A in front of the cosine,
the physical meaning of it is

00:26:19.165 --> 00:26:23.626
just the maximum amplitude.
If you were given a functional

00:26:23.626 --> 00:26:27.147
form with a number in front of a
cosine, well,

00:26:27.147 --> 00:26:32.000
you could read off the
amplitude immediately.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.923
The other parameter that
characterizes this wave is the

00:26:36.923 --> 00:26:40.660
wavelength.
It is the distance between two

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:44.490
successive maxima or two
successive minima.

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:50.051
And you can also see here that
the field is going to be at its

00:26:50.051 --> 00:26:55.794
maximum amplitude whenever this
x is an integral multiple of the

00:26:55.794 --> 00:26:59.259
wavelength, lambda,
2 lambda, 3 lambda,

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:04.000
or minus lambda,
minus 2 lambda or zero.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.964
If you were given a waveform
and there was a number in front

00:27:08.964 --> 00:27:12.245
of the x, you can almost,
by inspection,

00:27:12.245 --> 00:27:17.210
tell what the wavelength is.
That number would be equal to 2

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.996
pi over lambda.
Now what we are going to do is

00:27:20.996 --> 00:27:25.961
hold x constant and set it equal
to zero, and then plot this

00:27:25.961 --> 00:27:30.000
functional form as a function of
time.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.123
Again, we have the cosine
function, oscillates from plus A

00:27:36.123 --> 00:27:39.884
to minus A.
Now the time between two

00:27:39.884 --> 00:27:46.438
successive maxima or minima is
what we spoke earlier of as the

00:27:46.438 --> 00:27:50.305
period.
It is the time for one cycle.

00:27:50.305 --> 00:27:56.000
In other words,
is it one over the frequency.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.448
And you get the maxima then
whenever the time is an integral

00:28:01.448 --> 00:28:06.065
multiple of the period,
whenever time is 1 over nu,

00:28:06.065 --> 00:28:09.759
2 over nu, 3 over nu,
or minus 1 over nu,

00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:11.976
minus 2 over nu,
or zero.

00:28:14.746 --> 00:28:18.625
These are the
characteristics of the

00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:22.319
functional form,
amplitudes, wavelengths,

00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:26.290
frequencies.
Now, I told you that the period

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:31.000
was given by 1 over nu.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.950
Let's just do a quick proof
that the period is actually 1

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:42.900
over nu, one over frequency.
How are we going to do that?

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:48.849
Well, what I said was the
definition for a period was the

00:28:48.849 --> 00:28:53.631
time it takes the wave to move
one wavelength.

00:28:53.631 --> 00:28:59.793
If this is the wave at t equals
0, this then coming up here

00:28:59.793 --> 00:29:05.000
should be the wave at one period
later.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.505
And so, if we moved over
exactly one cycle,

00:29:09.505 --> 00:29:16.157
what this means is that at one
period later the functional form

00:29:16.157 --> 00:29:21.199
ought to look exactly like it
did at t equals 0.

00:29:21.199 --> 00:29:27.743
If I take my general expression
for the waveform and plug in t

00:29:27.743 --> 00:29:33.000
equals 1 over nu,
I get this.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.847
What you can see at first
glance is that it doesn't really

00:29:36.847 --> 00:29:39.547
look like this,
or at least not just yet,

00:29:39.547 --> 00:29:43.462
but we are going to make it
look like this and we are going

00:29:43.462 --> 00:29:46.027
to do so legally.
What are we going do?

00:29:46.027 --> 00:29:48.119
This just repeats that
equation.

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:51.494
You can already see we have
some cancellation here.

00:29:51.494 --> 00:29:55.140
These two nu's go away,
so I just have cosine ((2 pi x)

00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:00.000
over lambda minus 2 pi).

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.415
In order to simplify this,
I am going to need a

00:30:03.415 --> 00:30:06.905
trigonometric identity,
which you may or may not

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:11.361
remember, cosine (alpha minus
beta) is the cosine alpha times

00:30:11.361 --> 00:30:15.891
cosine beta plus the sine of the
alpha sine beta.

00:30:19.826 --> 00:30:23.910
I am going to let 2(pi)x be
alpha, and beta will be 2pi.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.846
I am going to plug that in.
Here, we can see some nice

00:30:27.846 --> 00:30:31.348
simplification.
This cosine 2pi,

00:30:31.348 --> 00:30:35.224
of course, is one.
The sign of

00:30:35.224 --> 00:30:40.112
2pi is zero, this term goes
away, and what I have left is A

00:30:40.112 --> 00:30:45.168
cosine 2 pi x over lambda at t
equals 1 over nu.

00:30:45.168 --> 00:30:48.117
And, indeed,

00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:52.921
that is the same functional
field as the field at t equals

00:30:52.921 --> 00:30:55.280
0.
That is our proof that the

00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.000
period is equal to 1 over nu.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.567
Now, this wave also propagates
in space.

00:31:03.567 --> 00:31:06.768
It moves.
It goes from here to here.

00:31:06.768 --> 00:31:10.243
And another important
characteristic of

00:31:10.243 --> 00:31:15.914
electromagnetic reaction is the
speed with which it propagates.

00:31:15.914 --> 00:31:20.213
Let's just quickly calculate
what that speed is.

00:31:20.213 --> 00:31:23.597
We have enough information to
do that.

00:31:23.597 --> 00:31:27.987
Speed is always distance
traveled divided by time

00:31:27.987 --> 00:31:32.735
elapsed.
And we said that at t equals 0,

00:31:32.735 --> 00:31:36.000
this is what our waveform
looked like.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.294
We also said that one period
later, this is what our waveform

00:31:41.294 --> 00:31:45.000
looked like.
We know at one period that the

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
waveform moved over one
wavelength.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.029
The speed is the distance
traveled, which is a wavelength,

00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:57.882
divided by the time elapsed,
which is 1 over nu,

00:31:57.882 --> 00:32:03.256
the period.
Therefore, the speed is lambda

00:32:03.256 --> 00:32:07.273
times nu.
That is the speed with which

00:32:07.273 --> 00:32:11.180
this wave propagates.
And, of course,

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:17.259
you already know that all
electromagnetic radiation has a

00:32:17.259 --> 00:32:22.470
constant speed of about 3x10^8
meters per second,

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:26.052
or we call it c.
And what that is,

00:32:26.052 --> 00:32:33.000
is the product of the
wavelength times the frequency.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.025
The electromagnetic spectrum,
of course, is infinitely wide.

00:32:38.025 --> 00:32:41.432
And here is the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:32:41.432 --> 00:32:46.627
We won't do this in any kind of
detail, but I just want you to

00:32:46.627 --> 00:32:50.119
note here that on the long
wavelength end,

00:32:50.119 --> 00:32:52.845
we have what we call radio
waves.

00:32:52.845 --> 00:32:57.615
And on the short wavelength,
then, we have our gamma rays

00:32:57.615 --> 00:33:02.469
and cosmic rays.
And, in the case of the gamma

00:33:02.469 --> 00:33:06.302
and the cosmic rays,
because the wavelength is

00:33:06.302 --> 00:33:10.730
small, lambda is small,
that means those waves have a

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:14.648
high frequency.
In the case of the radio waves,

00:33:14.648 --> 00:33:19.502
because those wavelengths are
long, that means those waves

00:33:19.502 --> 00:33:24.016
have a lower frequency because
the frequency times the

00:33:24.016 --> 00:33:27.252
wavelength is a constant.
It is this c.

00:33:27.252 --> 00:33:32.382
It is 3x10^8 meters per second.
And, of course,

00:33:32.382 --> 00:33:35.516
right in here,
a very small region,

00:33:35.516 --> 00:33:39.664
narrow region of the
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:33:39.664 --> 00:33:44.181
are the light waves that are
sensitive to our eye.

00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:49.251
What you do need to know is
that the red wavelengths are

00:33:49.251 --> 00:33:53.215
longer and the blue wavelengths
are shorter.

00:33:53.215 --> 00:33:58.284
Again, the important thing is
lambda times nu is always,

00:33:58.284 --> 00:34:04.000
for every kind of radiation,
equal to a constant.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.413
And that constant is c. Now,

00:34:07.413 --> 00:34:11.836
the other thing that you just
need to know is the relative

00:34:11.836 --> 00:34:15.948
ordering here in wavelengths.
You do need to know that

00:34:15.948 --> 00:34:19.750
microwaves are longer
wavelengths than gamma rays.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.310
All MIT students should know
that.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:26.577
And one other thing I might
say, because we are going to

00:34:26.577 --> 00:34:31.000
talk about this a little later
in the course.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.752
See these microwaves?
Well, molecules will absorb

00:34:34.752 --> 00:34:38.973
microwaves, take it in.
That kind of radiation is going

00:34:38.973 --> 00:34:43.584
to set the molecule rotating.
Molecules will absorb infrared

00:34:43.584 --> 00:34:47.962
radiation, and that kind of
radiation is going to set the

00:34:47.962 --> 00:34:51.792
molecules vibrating.
Molecules will absorb visible

00:34:51.792 --> 00:34:55.935
and ultraviolet radiation.
What that is going to do is

00:34:55.935 --> 00:35:00.000
promote an electron to an
excited state.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.469
Then sometimes those electrons,
in the excited state,

00:35:04.469 --> 00:35:08.166
want to relax back down to the
ground state.

00:35:08.166 --> 00:35:11.518
When they do so they give off
radiation.

00:35:11.518 --> 00:35:15.558
That is the origin of
fluorescence and sometimes

00:35:15.558 --> 00:35:19.426
phosphorescence.
Then sometimes molecules will

00:35:19.426 --> 00:35:23.982
also fluoresce if they absorb
X-rays, but with X-rays,

00:35:23.982 --> 00:35:30.000
if a molecule absorbs them,
it also kicks out an electron.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.378
And we will be looking at that
in a few days to identify the

00:35:35.378 --> 00:35:38.659
energy levels in atoms and
molecules.

00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:41.941
This, I think,
you are familiar with.

00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:47.136
So far I have just told you
what electromagnetic radiation

00:35:47.136 --> 00:35:51.147
is, how we characterize it:
speed, frequency,

00:35:51.147 --> 00:35:56.616
wavelength, maximum amplitude.
But what I have not shown you,

00:35:56.616 --> 00:36:01.265
yet, is any evidence that
indeed light has wave-like

00:36:01.265 --> 00:36:06.673
characteristics.
And to do that we are going to

00:36:06.673 --> 00:36:10.683
do the experiment that
essentially was done to

00:36:10.683 --> 00:36:14.514
demonstrate the wave-like
behavior of light,

00:36:14.514 --> 00:36:17.990
and that is Young's two-slit
experiment.

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:22.445
This is the late 1800s.
What was done was to take a

00:36:22.445 --> 00:36:25.386
source of monochromatic
radiation.

00:36:25.386 --> 00:36:31.000
We are going to use 6,330
angstroms, 633 nanometers.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.238
It is a helium neon laser.
And it is going to impinge on

00:36:36.238 --> 00:36:41.285
just a thin metal plate.
It does not have to be metal.

00:36:41.285 --> 00:36:45.761
It can be anything.
But what we did was poke two

00:36:45.761 --> 00:36:51.095
holes in it, made two slits.
And naively you might think,

00:36:51.095 --> 00:36:56.428
if you looked at a screen out
here, that this screen will

00:36:56.428 --> 00:37:03.000
light up in spots that are
directly opposite those slights.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.480
Because, after all,
light travels in straight

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.941
lines.
And so if the slits here are

00:37:10.941 --> 00:37:15.727
0.005 meters apart,
you might think that the two

00:37:15.727 --> 00:37:21.429
bright spots on the slit will be
about 0.02 inches apart.

00:37:21.429 --> 00:37:25.094
Well, of course,
that isn't the case.

00:37:25.094 --> 00:37:31.000
What you really see is an array
of bright spots.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.051
And Christine has up there in
the projection booth a helium

00:37:36.051 --> 00:37:39.882
neon laser that is shinning
behind two slits.

00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:43.714
You've got really beautifully
now, Christine.

00:37:43.714 --> 00:37:47.546
That is great.
And what you see is that there

00:37:47.546 --> 00:37:52.249
is a whole array of spots.
There aren't just two spots.

00:37:52.249 --> 00:37:55.993
There is a bunch of spots here,
bright spot,

00:37:55.993 --> 00:38:00.000
dark spot, bright spot,
dark spot.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.165
You've also got another pattern
superimposed on that.

00:38:05.165 --> 00:38:11.324
It almost looks like you would
see the single slit diffraction,

00:38:11.324 --> 00:38:17.086
too, on top of the double slit,
but we won't get into that.

00:38:17.086 --> 00:38:22.748
But this is not just two spots.
Let's see if we can try to

00:38:22.748 --> 00:38:28.509
understand how this pattern
arises, what this pattern comes

00:38:28.509 --> 00:38:32.809
from.
Well, waves have the property

00:38:32.809 --> 00:38:37.264
of superposition.
Superposition means that if I

00:38:37.264 --> 00:38:42.689
take a wave and have it in
space, but now I take a second

00:38:42.689 --> 00:38:48.307
wave and put it in the same
place in space but make it such

00:38:48.307 --> 00:38:53.925
that the maxima of both waves
are in the identical place in

00:38:53.925 --> 00:38:58.962
space, what I have is a
situation where the two waves

00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:04.000
add that property of addition of
waves --

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.130
When they are in the same place
in space, that property is

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:11.826
called superposition.
That is the property of waves.

00:39:11.826 --> 00:39:15.884
And in this particular case,
we are going to have what we

00:39:15.884 --> 00:39:20.231
call constructive interference.
They are going to add up such

00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:24.507
that the amplitude here of the
resulting wave is going to be

00:39:24.507 --> 00:39:29.000
twice the amplitude of each of
the individual waves.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.263
This is constructive
interference.

00:39:31.263 --> 00:39:34.349
On the other hand,
I can have two waves in the

00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:37.710
same place in space,
but they can be positioned so

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:41.825
that the maximum of one wave is
at the same point in space as

00:39:41.825 --> 00:39:45.254
the minimum of the other.
And because we have these

00:39:45.254 --> 00:39:47.860
positive and negative
amplitudes, well,

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:51.769
then these are going to cancel
when they add up and we are

00:39:51.769 --> 00:39:55.404
going to have the null result.
We are going to have no

00:39:55.404 --> 00:39:57.873
intensity.
That is called destructive

00:39:57.873 --> 00:40:03.054
interference.
Well, in order to understand

00:40:03.054 --> 00:40:08.727
how this property of
interference gives rise to these

00:40:08.727 --> 00:40:13.963
array of bright spots in the two
slit experiment,

00:40:13.963 --> 00:40:19.854
let me actually use water waves
as an example to try to

00:40:19.854 --> 00:40:26.727
understand why we get this array
of spots, or this row of bright

00:40:26.727 --> 00:40:31.774
spots and dark spots.
Here is the beach.

00:40:31.774 --> 00:40:35.619
Here is the water.
This is the top view.

00:40:35.619 --> 00:40:39.070
Here is the water.
Here is the sand.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:43.014
Here is where I wanted to be
all weekend.

00:40:43.014 --> 00:40:47.056
And the waves are rolling in to
the shore.

00:40:47.056 --> 00:40:51.788
There are the wave fronts.
And then suppose I get

00:40:51.788 --> 00:40:56.028
ambitious and,
for whatever perverse reason,

00:40:56.028 --> 00:41:02.042
I decide to build a barrier to
prevent these waves from coming

00:41:02.042 --> 00:41:07.094
onto the beach.
Except I poke two holes in the

00:41:07.094 --> 00:41:11.075
barrier, two little holes.
Well, you know what is going to

00:41:11.075 --> 00:41:13.589
happen.
When the wave approaches that

00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:16.382
barrier, well,
through that little hole a

00:41:16.382 --> 00:41:19.734
little bit of the wave is going
to sneak through.

00:41:19.734 --> 00:41:23.365
And because that little hole is
really pretty little,

00:41:23.365 --> 00:41:27.346
what is going to happen is that
the wave front is going to

00:41:27.346 --> 00:41:32.460
spread out isotropically.
And so that wave front is going

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.746
to look like a semicircle
centered on that little hole.

00:41:36.746 --> 00:41:40.079
And, of course,
this wave front is going to

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:43.174
keep propagating.
And it propagates out.

00:41:43.174 --> 00:41:46.349
And then soon enough,
a wavelength later,

00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:50.714
another wave sneaks through and
I have two semi-circles.

00:41:50.714 --> 00:41:55.238
And the distance between those
two semi-circles is lambda.

00:41:55.238 --> 00:42:00.000
That is the wavelength.
That is the wave crest.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.285
That is the maximum of the
wave.

00:42:02.285 --> 00:42:04.570
Keep going.
That propagates out.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.855
Keep going.
That propagates out.

00:42:06.855 --> 00:42:11.351
Well, at the same time that the
waves are sneaking out through

00:42:11.351 --> 00:42:14.815
that little hole,
waves are sneaking out through

00:42:14.815 --> 00:42:18.132
this little hole.
And I will color them green.

00:42:18.132 --> 00:42:21.523
That wave propagates out and
keeps propagating.

00:42:21.523 --> 00:42:25.208
The other one sneaks through
and keeps propagating.

00:42:25.208 --> 00:42:30.000
And now let me clean up the
drawing a little bit.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.718
And I am going to call this
slit one.

00:42:32.718 --> 00:42:37.325
The green waves are the waves
that have come through slit one.

00:42:37.325 --> 00:42:41.781
The blue waves are the ones
that have come through slit two.

00:42:41.781 --> 00:42:45.934
And the distance between any
two successive maxima here,

00:42:45.934 --> 00:42:49.333
or any two semi-circles is,
of course, lambda.

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:52.958
And lambda is the same for slit
one and slit two.

00:42:52.958 --> 00:42:57.565
Now, I want you to look at this
spot that I just circled right

00:42:57.565 --> 00:43:00.864
here.
Right here what do you see?

00:43:00.864 --> 00:43:02.521
Interference.
Absolutely.

00:43:02.521 --> 00:43:05.697
You have two maxima at the same
place in space.

00:43:05.697 --> 00:43:09.288
You are going to have
constructive interference right

00:43:09.288 --> 00:43:11.152
there.
What about this spot?

00:43:11.152 --> 00:43:14.397
Constructive interference.
What about this spot?

00:43:14.397 --> 00:43:16.883
Right.
Everywhere along that line you

00:43:16.883 --> 00:43:19.852
are going to have constructive
interference.

00:43:19.852 --> 00:43:22.683
Now, let me just tell you one
other thing.

00:43:22.683 --> 00:43:26.342
We have every constructive
interference all along this

00:43:26.342 --> 00:43:30.425
line.
Now look right at this point

00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:33.284
here.
What you see is you have the

00:43:33.284 --> 00:43:38.309
superposition of the blue wave
that has come from slit two,

00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:43.420
and this blue wave has traveled
out from slit two a distance

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.846
four lambda.
One, two, three,

00:43:45.846 --> 00:43:48.532
four lambda.
That is the radius.

00:43:48.532 --> 00:43:52.170
It has traveled out a distance
four lambda.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:56.502
It is constructively
interfering with a wave coming

00:43:56.502 --> 00:44:03.000
from slit one that has traveled
out a distance three lambda.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.707
One, two, three.
The difference in the distance

00:44:06.707 --> 00:44:11.705
traveled by those two waves that
are constructively interfering

00:44:11.705 --> 00:44:15.090
is one lambda.
Let's keep going in order to

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:18.959
understand this diagram.
Let's look at this spot.

00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:23.392
Right here, what do you have?
Constructive interference.

00:44:23.392 --> 00:44:27.020
Right here you have
constructive interference.

00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:31.775
If you kept going you would
see, everywhere along this line,

00:44:31.775 --> 00:44:36.574
constructive interference.
Now let's look at the

00:44:36.574 --> 00:44:40.775
difference in the distance
traveled by the waves that are

00:44:40.775 --> 00:44:43.925
constructively interfering along
that line.

00:44:43.925 --> 00:44:46.400
Well, you see the green wave
here?

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.750
The wave that is constructively
interfering is one that has

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.300
traveled out a distance two
lambda.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.375
That is, r sub one is equal to
two lambda.

00:44:56.375 --> 00:45:00.500
It is interfering
with this wave front

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:05.000
that has traveled out a distance
four lambda.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.022
The difference in the distance
traveled by those two waves is

00:45:09.022 --> 00:45:11.770
two lambda.
4 lambda minus 2 lambda equals

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:13.849
2 lambda.
I think on your notes,

00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:17.335
it is actually this case that I
have written it down.

00:45:17.335 --> 00:45:20.687
Here is another point of
constructive interference.

00:45:20.687 --> 00:45:24.039
Here is another point of
constructive interference.

00:45:24.039 --> 00:45:27.189
Everywhere along this line,
we have constructive

00:45:27.189 --> 00:45:31.034
interference.
And, if you analyze this,

00:45:31.034 --> 00:45:35.346
the difference in the distance
traveled would be zero.

00:45:35.346 --> 00:45:39.251
What you would expect,
if you were to image this,

00:45:39.251 --> 00:45:43.971
you'd expect right here very
bright spot, very bright spot,

00:45:43.971 --> 00:45:47.713
very bright spot.
This is going to be symmetric

00:45:47.713 --> 00:45:51.619
around the center,
so there will be a bright spot

00:45:51.619 --> 00:45:54.304
out here, a bright spot out
there.

00:45:54.304 --> 00:46:00.000
Let's look at this actually in
real life in a water tank.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.991
There we go,
up here on the side boards.

00:46:03.991 --> 00:46:09.312
Here are the waves coming this
way onto some barrier,

00:46:09.312 --> 00:46:13.406
and here are the holes.
Here is one hole.

00:46:13.406 --> 00:46:17.909
Here is the other hole.
And then these bright

00:46:17.909 --> 00:46:21.184
semi-circles are the wave
fronts.

00:46:21.184 --> 00:46:27.119
And what I want you to notice,
and you have to kind of look

00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:32.953
out here, right there you see a
whole bunch of very bright

00:46:32.953 --> 00:46:37.266
spots.
Well, if this were light and we

00:46:37.266 --> 00:46:41.725
had a screen then right here we
would see the screen light up.

00:46:41.725 --> 00:46:44.868
And then right here you see
kind of nothing.

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:47.792
That nothing is destructive
interference.

00:46:47.792 --> 00:46:52.178
That would be a dark spot if,
in fact, this were light and we

00:46:52.178 --> 00:46:55.833
were looking at a screen.
Then here is another very

00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:58.684
bright spot.
Here is another very bright

00:46:58.684 --> 00:47:02.643
spot.
This is on a website from the

00:47:02.643 --> 00:47:07.474
University of Colorado,
which, if you are not familiar

00:47:07.474 --> 00:47:11.576
with, is actually kind of a very
neat website.

00:47:11.576 --> 00:47:15.222
It has some very elementary
topics in it,

00:47:15.222 --> 00:47:19.689
but it also has some topics
that even you would be

00:47:19.689 --> 00:47:23.608
interested in.
And that is actually the name

00:47:23.608 --> 00:47:27.619
of the website.
And so what is going on here,

00:47:27.619 --> 00:47:34.000
in the case of the light,
is just what we have explained.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.703
We've got this line of
constructive interference that

00:47:37.703 --> 00:47:41.548
is going to result on the screen
as a very bright spot.

00:47:41.548 --> 00:47:45.608
And then another line with
another bright spot and another

00:47:45.608 --> 00:47:49.667
line with a very bright spot.
And this is symmetric around

00:47:49.667 --> 00:47:52.231
the zero.
Right at this point we have

00:47:52.231 --> 00:47:56.219
constructive interference.
In between we have destructive

00:47:56.219 --> 00:47:58.975
interference.
Constructive,

00:47:58.975 --> 00:48:00.852
destructive,
constructive.

00:48:00.852 --> 00:48:05.130
And that is the origin of the
many different bright spots.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:09.559
And now there is a condition
that has to obtain in order for

00:48:09.559 --> 00:48:12.937
there to be maximum constructive
interference,

00:48:12.937 --> 00:48:17.215
and that is this condition.
The difference in the distance

00:48:17.215 --> 00:48:21.794
traveled of the two waves that
are interfering to give us that

00:48:21.794 --> 00:48:25.171
maximum constructive
interference has to be an

00:48:25.171 --> 00:48:29.000
integral multiple of the
wavelength.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.550
I will explain this a little
bit more starting on Wednesday.

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:34.750
Okay.
See you then.
