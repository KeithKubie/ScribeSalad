Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So a couple of weeks ago I asked a question

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.050
here on Smarter Every Day in hopes that it would be beamed up to the space station so the

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.080
astronauts could answer. Well that happened.
- Why don't we take the next question on YouTube.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.130
I'm Destin from Huntsville Alabama. This is Sadie and Spotsy.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.150
On the International Space Station, if you're free falling in one position, without touching anything,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.230
with no spin, is it possible to wiggle in such a way that you're able to rotate

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.250
to a different angular position and then stop? On Smarter Every Day we

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.270
demonstrated this with a high speed camera and a cat, who is a non holonomic system and

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.290
can do this by extending his legs, arching his back and twisting in a very specific pattern.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.330
So can humans do this on orbit? You want to say hey to the astronauts?
- Hey.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.350
- Thank you. We look up to you guys.
- OK well that's a great question.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.410
We don't have any cats on board, but we have a medical doctor

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.440
who maybe can try to demonstrate, the next best thing to a cat.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.490
So he's gonna try to demonstrate for you. Yes indeed you can, you can do this. So he's gonna get out

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.520
here and stop himself in open space, and he's gonna show you how he can turn himself

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.540
around. So he can't change his angular momentum but he can

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.550
change his body position and move himself to an orientation. So, I hope you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.570
believe that what you saw happen with the cat isn't a mystery

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.600
and that it can happen in space too. Great question.
- So needless to say

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.620
I'm very excited about how this went down. Sadie has one more question by the way. What's your question?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.650
- Why do you not have a cat on board?
[laugh]

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.690
So one day I hope to do research on the international space station myself.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.730
So I thought it'd be pretty cool if I took a time hack and figured out exactly where the guys were when we

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.760
were talking. Turns out when they started listening to my question they were over the top of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.780
Ecuador, and in the 70 seconds that we talked, they buzzed across the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.850
equator, over Peru, which is cool because I spent a lot of time in Peru, and

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.860
into Columbia. I also thought it was pretty cool that after they answered the question you could see

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.910
Chris Hadfield over to the side. You can see the gears turning in his head, and I think

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.940
when the camera started flipping off he started doing a little test himself. He thinks

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.960
like me. He wants to figure things out. Which is good, to have people like that on the space station.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.000
You heard me say that I look up to you. But I'm not trying to be funny or anything

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.030
like that. I actually do watch the International Space Station pass over my house. The tool I

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.080
use is heavens-above.com. You can go and you can enter where

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.100
your house is, and it'll tell you the next times that the ISS is gonna pass overhead.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.110
It's really awesome. Even tells you where to look. Anyway, so I recommend going to do that.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.140
But, warning, if you do that you're gonna have to turn your computer off and walk outside the house

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.160
and actually observe some real science, so maybe you should do that.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.180
So I'd like to leave you with this. You are bound on the earth like I am, but

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.230
there is a human, that is ambassador for you in a weightless environment up on the International

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.250
Space Station, and he tweets every day. All you have to do is follow these

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.260
guys. They're up there. They're gonna pipe down pictures that they take every day and they're

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.270
really interesting. All you have to do is not be lazy and go look at what they're doing.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.290
It's really cool. Also you should follow NASA. They have good stuff every day.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.330
For some reason if you want to follow a less interesting guy, I'm right here. Feel free to look at my stuff

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.380
as well. Anyway I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. That was awesome.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.430
Have a good one.
(Crowd) 5.. 4.. 3..

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.440
2.. 1.. Fire!
