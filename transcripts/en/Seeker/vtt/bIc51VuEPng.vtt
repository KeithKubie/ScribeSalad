00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
I don't know about you but I never eat enough vegetables they're just so unappealing.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.940
But maybe I'd be more tempted to eat them if they came from outer space.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.360
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.860
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.300
So recently astronauts aboard the International Space Station chowed down

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.240
on the first bite of space lettuce.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.260
It's technically red lettuce but they call it "outredgeous" lettuce.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.440
Get it? Get it? Oh, it's so bad it's good.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.340
Puns aside, I'm super stoked that

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.220
NASA astronauts Kjell Lindgren and Scott Kelly along with Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.800
got their dose of leafy greens while orbiting 220 miles above the surface of the Earth.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.560
In what's considered an important step to self-sustaining systems,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.260
NASA scientists grew the lettuce in microgravity over

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.840
a period of thirty-five days.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.280
It's not the first batch though. Other plants have been grown aboard the station.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.580
One study published in the journal BMC Plant Biology discussed small, white flowers

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.660
that grew in space to see how well they would grow without a lot of gravity.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.800
And just last year

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.590
lettuce was grown that was sent back to earth to be analyzed for safety concerns.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.310
Once they got the a-okay, another round of plants were grown.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.570
So how do you grow plants in space?

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.400
It's a little tricky since plants have evolved stems to fight against gravitational forces.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.720
So how would they grow in low and microgravity?

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.480
Well, pretty well apparently.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.960
The ISS uses the VEGGIE system developed by Orbital Technologies in Madison, Wisconsin.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.259
The system contains lighting and nutrients for a space garden.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.659
Yes! Space garden!

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.919
This particular garden contains red, blue and green LEDs.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.720
The red and blue mostly for plant growth and health. The green so the plants don't look

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.380
weird under the red and blue lights and more resemble lettuce grown here on Earth.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.770
The plants get their nutrients from a pillow and pillows can come in various

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.330
sizes depending on what kind of veggies are grown in them.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.050
Pillows only work once though but that's by design.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.670
That way there's a reduced chance of microbial growth from the system and plants.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.140
For plants that might have more microbes,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.780
a sanitation method they can do in the space station will have to be developed.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.740
Like Scott Kelly and his buddies, for instance, use citric acid-based, food-safe wipes to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.479
clean the lettuce before eating it.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.020
Besides providing a source of nutrients that's not freeze dried maybe space

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.180
gardens can offer other benefits, too.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.280
Dr. Gioia Massa, one of the scientists working on veggies, says there may be a psychological benefit.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.460
In extended manned missions with only a half of dozen or so crew, space can be tiring and lonely

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.260
but tending to a garden might give the astronauts' mood a boost.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.660
Some studies like one published in the journal of HortScience,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.720
show that gardening and greenery increases positive mood.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.280
Gardening helps people feel more relaxed, pleased and optimistic.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.140
Definitely feelings we might need as we leave our home planet.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.820
Growing plants without Earth's soil will be crucial to any long-term trip to a planet like Mars.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.960
With limited resources and not a lot of chances for restocking,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.340
expeditions will have to be self-sustaining.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.620
Scott Kelly called this experiment a big step in that direction.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.100
But this research could help us here at home, too.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.440
A lot of the same technology -- the LEDs, the pillows and the watering system --

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.580
could help us farm more efficiently.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.720
We could grow food in smaller spaces and with less energy.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.680
So cool space beads and just in case you were wondering,

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.270
Scott Kelly said the lettuce tasted awesome.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.640
Speaking of awesome innovations back here on Earth, Intel creates the breakthrough technologies that make

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.810
amazing experiences possible.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.970
Having Intel Inside makes for better experiences outside.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.950
Intel drives innovation with products like processors, wearables and IOT devices

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.150
and within data centers, in the PC and beyond.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.960
So would you eat space lettuce?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.280
