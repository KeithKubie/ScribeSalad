00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.960
How many continents are there? If you grew
up in the English-Speaking world you might

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.880
think that the answer is obvious: 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.839
But not everyone count continents the same
way.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.249
The usual deffiniton, that they’re large
land masses separated from others by oceans

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:17.930
is fine, until you actually start to think
about it, and then you run into problems.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.970
Problems, like, this:

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.790
Here’s Europe, here’s Asia and you’ll
notice the lack of ocean between them. Why

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.570
then, are they two different continents?

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.340
The usual reason for this split is a cultural
one: that Europe is so different from Asia

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.680
that it’s best to pretend it’s a separate
entity.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.830
OK... maybe.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.969
But if the cultural argument is valid then
surely it also applies to India and the middle

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.800
east. Now you have nine continents and a new
problem: if culture defines continents then

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.589
you’ll never stop drawing increasingly unhelpful
lines.

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:46.460
So some places ditch the culture division
and combine Europe and Asia into Eurasia.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.890
This Eurasia is not to be confused with this
Eurasia, which has always been at war with

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.920
Eastasia
Making Eurasia gives a six continent view

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.920
of the world.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.069
But what about over here: North America and
South America?

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:59.909
They’re connected at Panama – or at least
they were until Teddy Roosevelt decided that

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.479
someone had to cut that country in half and
it might as well be him.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.390
But even still the Canal is only 13 meters
deep.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.240
You could walk all the way from Northern Alaska
across the narrow Panama canal and, if it

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.830
weren’t for the deadly, impenetrable, poison
filled Brazilian rain forest, make it all

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.610
the way to the southern tip of Chile. So North
and South America, despite the canal, aren’t

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.830
really divided.
Which is why some places, particularly South

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.780
America, treat America as a single continent,
not two. Which brings the total number of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.810
continents down to five.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.140
But... if you discard the Panama Canal then
you also have to discard the Suez Canal and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.170
you’ve just created the monstrously large
Afro-Eurasian continent: 85 million square

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.210
kilometers home to 5.7 billion people.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.620
With this four-continent view of the world
we must be done because there are no more

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.250
continents to merge and our deffiniton from
the beginning is now consistent.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.270
Except we’re not done because of that troublesome
word 'large'. Exactly how large is continental

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.360
large?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.240
Is Australia really a dinky continent or is
it the king of the Islands? Why not make Greenland

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.170
the smallest continent? It’s pretty big,
even if you took away its ice.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.680
And speaking of ice, what about Antarctica?
The forgotten continent unfairly smushed against

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.430
the bottom of maps just because no one lives
there.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.900
Remove the ice sheet that covers Antarctica
and you reveal it for the archipelago it really

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.970
is not the single land mass it pretends to
be.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.220
And, to complicate matters, the largest of
these Antarctic Islands is smaller than Australia.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.370
So if you want to keep calling Antarctica
a continent, then there’s a bunch of other

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370
islands that might want to be continents too.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.130
Islands like New Guinea, Borneo, Madagascar,
Baffin Island, Sumatra, and Honshu.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.800
While this seems inclusive to the point of
silliness, ultimately someone has to decide

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.860
what ‘large’ means and that’s going
to be an arbitrary line.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.440
This problem will be familiar to anyone who
remembers the is-Pluto-a-planet-or-not-a-planet

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.130
fiasco which hinged -- mostly -- on this same
issue of size.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.580
So now we’re more confused than before we
started: there might be three continents or

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.650
dozens. You know what will sort this out:

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.910
SCIENCE!

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.080
Confusion + science = answers

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.970
Let’s ask a Geologist what a continent is.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.360
For them a continent is a tectonic plate:
parts of the Earth’s crust that move together.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.750
So, geologists, show us your continents.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.330
The Antarctic, plate, the Australian plate,
the Eurasian plate, the South American plate,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.880
the African plate. So far, this looks pretty
good.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.080
The... middle eastern plate. The... indian
plate. The Caribbean plate?

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.430
The pacific plate? Well, there isn’t even
anything there.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.640
Well, there’s mostly nothing there. The
Nazca plate? The scotia plate? Really?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.190
At least North America is still lookin’
reasonable. Until you include a chuck of Russia,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.069
and half of japan and half of Iceland!

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:21.670
Well, this is unhelpful -- thanks a lot, Geologists.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.740
The heart of the problem is that the word
'continent' doesn’t have a simple &amp; consistent

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.190
deffiniton for every day use. So how many
continents are there? Well, how many do you

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:46.830
want there to be?

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.260
Six. The answer is clearly six.�
