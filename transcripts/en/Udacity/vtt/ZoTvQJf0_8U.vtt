Finally, we're going to review these really cool functions which put together,

00:00:03.617 --> 00:00:07.866
are called Piecewise Functions. Let's take a look at a graph of the following

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:13.718
function. Match the pieces of the function with the region of the graph. You

00:00:13.718 --> 00:00:17.678
can choose from x squared, x plus 2, and 2, and please be sure to fill in the

00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:23.715
corresponding regions on the right-hand side. Fill in the blue boxes with the

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:29.031
appropriate symbols and the green boxes with the appropriate numbers.
