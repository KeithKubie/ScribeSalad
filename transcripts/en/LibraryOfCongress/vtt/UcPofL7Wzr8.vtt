00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Hi, everybody.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.640
How are you doing?

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.940
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.240
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.540
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Welcome to
the National Book Festival.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.840
My name is Rob Casper.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.980
I'm the head of the Poetry and
Literature Center at the library.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.130
You guys are the last big group
before we go into the evening.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.750
We're happy to have you here at
the Poetry and Press Pavilion.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.490
I want to thank the cochairman of
the festival, David Rubenstein,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.490
and the many National
Book Festival sponsors

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.590
who made this possible this year.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.430
Also, I want to thank those who
supported it year after year.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.800
Chief among them, The National
Endowment for the Arts,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.770
that that helps make
this pavilion possible.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.070
They're all in the back.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.370
You can check out their materials.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.170
It's give them a big hand.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.640
[ Applause ]

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.200
You, too, can support the
festival with a gift of a donation

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.180
by checking the information in the
festival program and on the app.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.130
We welcome your help in making
the festival possible next year

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.430
and every year.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.950
The festival would not be
possible without the support

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.740
of sponsors and booklovers.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.020
Two other housekeeping
items I have to add.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.270
First, if you could
silence your cell phones

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.830
or any electronic devices
that might interfere

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.130
with the recording of this event.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.780
Second, if there is a Q&amp;A session,
and the mics are on either side,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.080
don't worry about [inaudible].

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.800
Mics are on either side.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.990
You can come up and ask
questions, but if you do,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.210
know that this event
is being recorded,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.600
and you will be part
of the recording.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.670
So I realized that
there's no podium now.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.310
So I could do a very Juan
Felipesque kind of thing and,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.650
you know, do my little dance.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.460 position:56%
How lucky we are today to have Juan
Felipe Herrera here in conversation.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.880
I have such love for our 21st Poet
Laureate Consultant in poetry,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.250
though I'm still recovering
from trying to keep up with him.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.290
And you'll see, you understand
that more as the hour goes on.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.340
Juan Felipe was, arguably, the most
active poet to accept the position

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.240
with two projects in his first
term and three in his second,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.850
and just for a point
of reference, usually,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.090
we let a poet laureate
have one project

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.160
in the second term, not five total.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.910
But what projects they were.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.300
My personal favorite title
is The Technicolor Adventures

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.690
of Catalina Neon, though
I am probably proudest

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.320
of Word Street Champions and
Brave Builders of the Dream.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.940
Yeah, even looking at it now,
I think, those are impressive.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.310
I could say more about them and
Juan Felipe's tenure as laureate,

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.440
but I'll leave that to our
moderator, Anya Creightney,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.730
the program's manager
at the library's Poetry

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.500
and Literature Center, and
a fellow poetry visionary.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.410
But let me just say
that Juan Felipe is one

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.840
of the most life-affirming
people I have ever known.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.010
He continues to inspire me with
his enthusiasm, his sincerity,

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.730 position:56%
his openness and generosity, and his

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.590
but dazzling creativity,
I know I'm not alone.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.510
Please join me in welcoming Juan
Felipe Hererra and Anya Creightney.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.200
[ Applause ]

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.500
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Thank you.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.800
Thank you.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.100
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.400
[ Applause ]

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.700
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Thank you so
much, Ron, for that introduction,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.000
and thank you all for being here.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.080
Welcome to the 2017
National Book Festival.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.420
At least the tail end of it anyway.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.220
So I thought we'd start in an
unusual place, since it's the end

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.200
of the day, and many of
us have been here all day.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.180
I thought that maybe
we start with a poem,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.480
if that's all right with you all.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.030
Maybe Juan Felipe can
read us a poem.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.580
And then we can get
into it, all right?

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.130
So I chose this poem, Juan Felipe,

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.990
because you wrote it during your
term as poet laureate and first

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.780
and foremost, it's fun, like you.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.080
So will you read it for us?

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.380
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Okay.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.680
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Okay.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.980
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Sure, thank you.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.280
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: You're welcome.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.580
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: To
be here, and thank you, Anya.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.880
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: My pleasure.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.180
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Thank you so much, and Rob,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.480
thank you so much once again.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.780
Library of Congress and everyone
right here, muchos gracias.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.080
Thanks everybody.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.110
Well, no, I use to -- my
uncle used to love boxing back

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.610
in the early days in Southern
California and San Diego.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.930
It was a big old, brutal coliseum a
few blocks down from where we lived

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.280
on C Street, and all the
wrestlers were out there, you know,

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.540 position:56%
and the boxers and Sweet Pea Johnson
and Mexican boxers and que Dynamite

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.840
and [Spanish name given].

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.150
Those cool guys slugging it
out with peanut shells flying

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.470
out of the bleachers.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.860
That was also, those were the years
of Sonny Liston and Cassius Clay,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.530
who became Mohammed
Ali, who I loved.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.780
And so this poem, then it, is
titled You Can't Put Mohammed Ali

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.080
in a Poem.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.730
Because, you know, he passed away
not too long ago, and I just had

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.170
to write a poem for him, but
then I thought in a split second,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.510
you can't put Mohammed Ali --

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.170
there's no way you
can put him in a poem.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.220
He's just too big, too powerful.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.240
So this is it, and so let's
do this together, by the way,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.540
since we're starting off.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.840
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Let's do it.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.140
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And
it's been a beautiful day,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.130
and you have beautiful hearts,

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.950
and you do beautiful
things for so many people.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.630
So let's all say -- let's just say
the title to get the ball rolling.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.890
Everyone say, "You can't."

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.190
&gt;&gt; [audience] You can't.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.490
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Put Mohammed Ali.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.850
&gt;&gt; [audience] Put Mohammed Ali.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.150
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: In a poem.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.450
&gt;&gt; [audience] In a poem.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.750
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: If you did.

&gt;&gt; [audience] If you did.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.350
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: It would.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.650
&gt;&gt; [audience] It would.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.950
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Knock you down.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.250
&gt;&gt; [audience] Knock you down.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.550
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Remember Sonny Liston?

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; [audience] Remember Sonny Liston?

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.150
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.450

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.750

Still standing.

&gt;&gt; [audience]: It could be peace.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.340
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
It could be unity.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.640
&gt;&gt; [audience]: It could be unity.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.940 position:56%

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.540

&gt;&gt; [audience]: But.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.140
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: This poem.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:38.440
&gt;&gt; [audience]: This poem.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.740

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.940
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Sting.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.240
&gt;&gt; [audience]: Sting.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.540
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Like a.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.840
&gt;&gt; [audience]: Like a.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.140

&gt;&gt; [audience]: Bee.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.740
[ Applause ]

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.040
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: You see?

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.340
We didn't put Mohammed
Ali in the poem.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.640
We didn't put them in the poem.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.940
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: That's right.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.240
That's why love that poem.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.540
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:27.840
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: He
ends up with a poem.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.140
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And
you have Mohammed Ali now.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.440
You have Mohammed Ali.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.740 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Well, I told
you he was lively and fun, didn't I?

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.040
&gt;&gt; [audience]: Yes.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.340
[ Applause ]

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.640
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: So we're
here to talk a little bit,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.940
reflect a little bit anyway, about
your term as US Poet Laureate,

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.240 position:56%
your two terms, from 2015 to 2017,
and all of you know him as Laureate,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.540 position:56%
but for those who don't know, he was
first appointed by former Librarian

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.840
of Congress, James H. Billington,
and then reappointed in 2016.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.140
It was a special time
for the library,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.970
and inside of those two
years, you did a lot.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:47.590
Rob alluded to all of what you did.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.010
You kept us running
there in the office,

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.100
and you kept us dazzling ourselves.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.870
So I thought we could talk a
little bit, but person going

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.550
to remind you all of
some what you did.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.970
Are you ready for your list
of what you, yourself, did?

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:05.060
So you traveled to hundreds
of universities, colleges,

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:10.110
community centers, elementary
schools, festivals, and libraries.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.690
You watched not one but
five Laureate projects,

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.570
all of which extended your
particular vision of poetry.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.420
You collected four
honorary doctorates,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.060 position:56%
the Robert Kirsch Lifetime
Achievement Award from the LA Times.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.660
And outstanding Latino and
Cultural Award in Literary Arts

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.810
and Publications from
the American Association

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.150
of Hispanics in Higher Education.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.830
You gave a slew of commencement
addresses, too many interviews

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:41.470
to list, and you wrote one
YA book, one children's book,

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.500
and two board books, and you
said, half a poetry collection.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Right, yeah.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: So can we have a
round of applause for all that work?

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:55.060
[ Applause ]

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.990
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Thank you,
Anya, and you know, and everyone,

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.760
you know, the thing is, the
inspiration comes from people,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.090
and the inspiration comes from
when people let me know, you know,

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:10.680
their stories and where they're
coming form and how they feel

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.950
about these last couple of years.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:18.810
In particular, last two years,
and I do all this for everyone.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.770
I do all this for everyone, and
the doctorates are for everyone.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.790
So that's what that's about.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.560
You know? If it was for me,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.790
I would probably be just
walking my dog, you know?

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.460
I'd be walking my dog.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.760
But this is for you.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.060
It for you.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.360
It's not for me.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.000
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
I somehow doubt that.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.690
But I want to go back
to the beginning.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.840
Can you tell me what you
remember about the time, you know,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.800
that specific time when
you were first appointed?

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.550
What most excited you
or intimidated you.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.850
It was a big moment.

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.150
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's a big moment.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.450
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Big lifetime moment.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.750
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: I
think it was just the change.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.810 position:56%
You know, when you hit change in the
face, when it hits you in the face,

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:59.150
there really is nothing to
say, because you write in it,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:02.540
and there's few words to express
what you're going through.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.990
I didn't have any words to
express what I was going through.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.710
Rob Casper said, "Juan Felipe,
your laugh is going to change.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.310
It's going to change, one Felipe.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.610
Come on. Are you excited?"

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.020
And I was just standing
there like a mummy.

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.300
I would like a mummy
because it was so big,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.090
and I couldn't come
up with any words.

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.390
I like -- I believe Rob.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.120
I said how's it going to change?

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.420
I changed a lot of things.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.000
I'm already done changing.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.570
I went through the changes
already, but he was right.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:40.670
Little by little, a tsunami grew,
and all the people that I met,

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.440
and everything that they told me
and what I saw them go through,

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:51.200
and what they were going through,
it just added a lot of force

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.910 position:56%
to the tsunami of their humanity, of
our humanity, and there were so much

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.140
that I couldn't contain
myself after two years.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.610
After two years, I
literally was scorched.

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:06.020
I literally was scorched, and I
didn't know what to do with all

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.900
that fire in me, and all
the feelings and emotions

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:15.660
that were expressed to me
from high schoolers, elders,

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.480
those that were running from ICE.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.560 position:56%
Students that were crying, because
of how they felt about the election.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.060
Students, young people, that
said they believed in peace.

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:32.830
That they wanted a life of
peace, and on and on and on.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.360
They said, "Juan Felipe, we
came all the way from Racine,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.820
and we know that you're going
to be in Milwaukee tonight.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.570
So we came from Racine, and we're
really excited, because we want

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.400
to hear about we are
interested in climate change.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.170
Because we are interested
in climate change."

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.760
And you know, that's how it was.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.990
I said, well, you know
what, put away my poetry.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.700
Let's talk about climate change.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.380
That's what happened.

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.910
People were interested in coming
together, and poetry was okay,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:09.370
but they really wanted
to be together.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.230
They were so concerned
about so many things.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:16.750
So that's where the change started
really brewing, and it just kept

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.670
on moving until the
very end and now.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.970
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: It sounds

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.320
like you're describing
yourself as a vessel.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.620
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yes.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.920
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Yeah, a sort of vessel.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: That's true.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:28.360
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: So you've
talked a lot about the humanity

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.310
and the doctorates, for example,
you said are for everyone else.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.610
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
They're for everyone.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.910
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
They're for everyone else.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:35.210
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: That's it.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:37.300
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: So this is
something I think is something you

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.570
believe substantially, and
it's what makes you you,

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:45.420
and I think you think poetry should
be an inclusive space and full

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.820
of not just truth but tenderness.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.120
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yes.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.080
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: And not
just community but also craft.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.140
So I want you to talk a little bit
about your vision and this idea

00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:00.450
of inclusivity and how that
relates to your idea of poetry.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.750
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Okay.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.050
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Yeah, that space.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.350
That special space.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.650
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: All
right, I'll give it a go.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.810
You know, when we began -- when
I began, it was in the late 60s.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.310
Well, actually, in high
school, when I was a junior,

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:18.770
and then when I hit
UCLA in '67 on an EOP,

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.450
affirmative-action
economic opportunity grant,

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:28.100
that the only way I could be there,
and that was the time, as you know,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:33.410
of the Vietnam war and all the fire
around it, and that was the time,

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:37.180
as you know, all the
movements came to a boil.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.840
The women's movement.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.140
You name it.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:42.480
The gay/lesbian movement.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.400
The black power movement.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.000
The red power movement.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.330
Yellow power.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.260
All the colors of power.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.870
They came to a peak.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.160
You know, [Spanish spoken],
the international linkages

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:04.170
with Latin America, Mexico,
and beyond, came to a peak.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.130
So that it was about
coming together.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.920
In my case, this was a
perfect moment for me

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.960
because I could stand
up on a stage and speak.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.310
And recite.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.150
I had been working on
it since twelfth grade,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.730
because I was so afraid to speak,

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.270
I said I don't want
to be afraid to speak.

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.660 position:56%
I want to be able to tell the truth.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:27.020
I'm afraid to tell the truth.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.960
I don't want to be afraid anymore.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.850
So I began to train
myself and inquire --

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:37.890
just come out and throw my voice
out there, as afraid as I was.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:43.790
So '67 and '68 is when the stage
appeared, and I can actually get

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.260
up there and try my voice out,
and it was about tenderness,

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:52.380
and it was about kindness, because
it was about gathering our peoples,

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.870
and it was about embracing
our lives,

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:01.490 position:56%
it was about healing our communities
with as much as we could provide.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.100
Whether it was information.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:08.520
Whether it was music,
poetry, cultural knowledge,

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:14.550
historical awareness, ways to
organize, all those were embraces,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.430
and all that was kindness.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:20.110
And of course, we had to deal with
police brutality, and of course,

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.060
we had to deal with issues
of war and peace and issues

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.720
of power all at the same time.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:29.620
But I began that way,
and with a guitar,

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:35.180
and 7-foot-long hair and tunics.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:41.080
I wore a Mayan tunic, Tenajapa,
woven in Tenajapa Chapas.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.560
So that's how I began.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.540
So kindness for me
as an integral part.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:50.040
It's hard to get in touch with
kindness, because, in my case,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:56.220 position:56%
these days, I'm getting really
angry, and I don't like to be angry.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.010
But it's just kind of pouring out
of me, and I have to just work it.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:05.630
I have to work it out and
breathe and stretch and meditate,

00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.170
and write it out and
talk it out a bit.

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.740
The idea is kindness.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.830 position:56%
And that's, perhaps, the only way
we can make things work the way they

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:18.330
need to happen.

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:24.360
And also, facing our fears
and confronting the issues

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.220
that are taking place
at the same time,

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.210
like we just said, with tenderness.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:35.390
And poetry, then, we have to open
it up so it could be all colors,

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.320
all languages, all classes,
and find ways to write it

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.030
in a different manner
and use all manners.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:47.660
You know, I started with one
hand, which was as a street poet,

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:52.490
as a spoken word poet, a
bilingual poet, a self-made poet,

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.530
a community poet, and you
all make the tortillas.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.220
You know, you all make
the poetry together.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.250
There really is no workshop.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:03.850
The workshop is your community,
and then much later, when I was 40,

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.570
I went to the writers' workshop.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.280
So then I had two hands.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.060
I had the spoken word
community hand,

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:16.270
self-made poetry are the stages,
in the rallies, and the marches,

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.400
and then with the workshop,
then a friend of mine said,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.190
what you come to the workshop?

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.490
The writers workshop?

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:23.790
I go, what is that?

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.090
What is that?

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.390
I've never heard of it.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.690
He goes, that's where
people come around a table

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:28.990
and read poetry to each other.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.520
All, I said, I can do that.

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.460
That's not going to
be a problem at all.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.150
So I applied, and I got in.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.930
So then I learned a number of
things, another set of writers,

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.820
another set of history,
word histories

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.020
of writers, and also, new tools.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:53.820
So I had two hands now where I
could make a really big tortilla.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:55.260
So I'm happy about that.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.310
So that's when you start messing
with your stanzas and lines

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:03.390
and have a great time, as well is
saying things that need to be said.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:09.110
So that's how it is, and we need
to really let our voices come in.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:14.090
It's good to honor all our poetry,
but we're missing a lot of poetry.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.630
We're missing a lot of poetry.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:19.320
So we need to open the doors
for writers from all countries,

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.000
because they're writing
great material.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.930
I had an interview with the
Excelsior from Mexico City,

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.180
and one of the first
things the reporter said

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.750
from the Excelsior,
biggest newspaper.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:33.280
He said, "Well, now that
you're [Spanish spoken]."

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:39.050
He said, now that you're the
laureate of the United States,

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.390
what are you going to do to bring
Mexican poets to the United States?

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:51.070
Well, uh, if I was in the
travel business, we could do it,

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:54.770
but the real -- it
was a good question.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.200
You know, we do a lot of poetry,
and we have a lot of issues to deal

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:05.040 position:56%
with it too, then open it up, and
get it out without too many hurdles.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.340
There's a lot of hurdles sometimes.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.640
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
A lot of hurdles.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.940
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: You
know, there's a lot of steps

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.040
to go through, and we
must open it up, really.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:17.710
Open up the road, but then again,
we have to also open up the pathway

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.430
for our international
and global writers.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.060 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: What do we gain?

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.130
I know it's perhaps
obvious question,

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.400
but I think it bears repeating.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.700
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
What do we gain from --

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.000
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Yeah, when we gain?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.300
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
From Singapore and China?

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.600
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.900
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
And from Africa?

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: What do we gain?

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.500
What do we all gain in our --

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.800
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: And
from Mexico and from Cuba?

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.100
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Yeah, all over the world.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.170
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Well, we
gain voices that we have not heard,

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.130
and we're going to be surprised,

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.750
because people are
saying things differently,

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.170
and they're so different, that we
become a little too complicated.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.880
That's one of the things
that I picked.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.930
I said, gosh, who got
complicated in my writing?

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:03.190
I sure got all my stuff all tangled
up, and people are just saying it,

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:09.130
and that's great, and also
doing all the other things,

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.920
you know, complex things.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.960
That's okay, but they're
very direct,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:20.040
and I just like to hear
voices from the world,

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:25.100
and I want to hear more voices from
Brazil, more voices from Africa,

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.810
from Lithuania, where everybody
in Lithuania knows poetry,

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.690
and like that, you
know, where people --

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:36.510
I was having some kind of food
with Margarita, my partner,

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.480
in San Diego, in Old Town.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:44.560
I live in San Diego Barrio, Logan
Heights, and I went to Old Town

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.780
because Old Town, it was kind

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.600
of like a tourist area,
but it's okay, you know?

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.390
Let's just go to Old Town.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:57.360
So I was in Old Town.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.800
A woman that was serving, you know,
the food and her partner, friend,

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.680
for some reason we
got in a conversation

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.910
about the great Turkish
poet, Nazim Hikmet.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.750
I do know how that
happened, and they said,

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.940
"Oh, you know Nazim Hikmet?"

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.140
I go, well, a little bit.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.630
"We love Nizem Hikmet.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.930
We know all his poetry.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.780
And in Turkey, we all
know Nizim Hikmet."

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:25.700
I go, I should have known.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:30.270
You know? Because in Turkey,
everybody knows Nizim Hikmet,

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:34.220
and people here from that
country know Nizim Hikmet,

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:39.840
who was a great poet, was a great
poet, and same thing with Korea.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.140
You know, I'm hanging out.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:46.320
I don't know how I got into it talk
about Ko Un, a great Korean poet,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.370
and I was talking with
a Korean student,

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.680
and he goes, "You know Ko Un?"

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.110
I go yeah.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:56.100
"Wow, everyone in Korea knows
Ko Un, and you know Ko Un."

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.610
Yeah, he's great.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.910
Well, okay.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:04.620
Yeah, let's have a
conversation, you know?

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.880
Wow. You know, kind of
rebel Buddhist monk outside

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.180
of the -- what is it?

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.940
Outside of the what?

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:14.340
Outside of the box?

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.640
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Yeah, stratosphere.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.960
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Korean, Buddhist.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.260
He was here.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.940
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: He was at
the Library of Congress, yes.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:22.050
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Amazing
poet who wrote how many thousands

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.340
of poems about people that he met.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.640
How many? What's the number?

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.940
10,000?

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.240
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yep.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.540
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Thousands.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:35.390
He said one day, today,
I'm going to write a poem

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:37.190
about everybody that I know.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.320
And he wrote like 12 volumes.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.620
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: I
guess, mm-hm, you'd have to.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.630
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Twelve volumes, thousands,

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:47.620
and that's just one
project Ko Un did.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.920
And I like him.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:50.220
He's a lot of fun.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.520
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.820
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: So I like
it when I hear about other poets,

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.890
and that's how I learned about him.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:57.980
I learned by having conversations.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.280
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Presumably, you also learn

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.980
about yourself in the same way.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: I was kind
of challenged to learn about myself.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:08.170
I was challenged to
learn about myself.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:15.330
I was reading Basho on the plane
over here, the great Japanese poet.

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:21.110
He was born in 611, and he talks --

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:26.300
he has diaries with haikus so
you're reading these diaries.

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.300
He has these journeys, right?

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:35.580
You, through Japan, Tokyo,
outside of Tokyo, Kyoto back then.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:42.080
And he talks about just
walking and writing,

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:48.680
and the most precious thing is to
notice the moon, and that's it.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.980
That's it.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.180
The most precious thing is to
notice the moon and the moonlight,

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.980
and he also meets people
along the way,

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.330
but he talks about
a lot of big things.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:07.320
And he talks about how he met a
little, tiny girl on the road.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:14.050 position:56%
This was hard to read, and he said,
-- he says someone must've left her.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:19.520
Her parents must have abandoned
her here by the river, and he says,

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.930
"I gave her the food I had."

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.440
He says, "But I noticed that
a greater force had put her

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.180
in this predicament,
and I had to go on."

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:34.420
And that's hard for me to read.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.180
Because I'm kind of a rescue guy.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.640
I'm a big rescue guy.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.850
I carry cookies to feed
the sparrows outside.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:46.990
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
You did it today.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.820
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
So I was reading Basho,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.040
and I really enjoy reading
him because of what he said

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:56.670
about being a poet, and
how times have changed now.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.870
You know, walking, we don't
really think about walking

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:05.630
or noticing what he called nature.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.810
It's kind of secondary
may be or tertiary,

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.490
or maybe not even on our list.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:15.020
We're just walking and working
like Malcolm Margolin said,

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:20.430
a great publisher in the Bay
Area, who founded Hey Day Books.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:26.800
And we went to have a dinner after
reading on the Laureate Road.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.100
He goes, "Let's go
have dinner, Juan."

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.400
I said okay.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.700
And then he said, "Juan."

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.080
I go, yes, Malcolm?

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:38.030
"What happened to recess?

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.040
[ Laughing ]

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.640
What happened to magic, Juan?"

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.280
And just like Basho,
you know, the moon.

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.120
What happened to the moon?

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.760
What happened to recess?

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.060
What happened to magic?"

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.250
I know that sounds
unexpected, maybe, to you.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:57.550
But he hit me hard.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.900
I go, yeah.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.300
What happened to recess?

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.060
I'm writing nonstop
like a poetry machine.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.100
I said, why am I doing this?

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.960
Why do I have to become
a poetry machine?

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.260
And I meet my friends.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.560
"Hey, Juan.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.860
So what's your new book, Juan?"

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.080
You know, I've got a
new book I'm doing now.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.750
You know, I want to send it
out, and then I'm going to work.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.770
You know? I go, that's okay.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.020
But when I think about
Basho and I think

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.540
about Malcolm, something's
not right.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.000
Something's not right.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.120
So it's good to meet
people and listen

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:40.940
to them, and reevaluate myself.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.240
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.540
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Yeah.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.240
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Well, speaking
of reevaluation and reflection,

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.970
I'd be remiss if we
didn't talk a little bit

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.140
about these many poet
Laureate projects.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.440
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Okay.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.740
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: I wonder if we
can talk a little bit about them.

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.040
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Okay.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.340
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: I'll
give the audience just a peek

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.120
into what you -- how
you kept us so busy.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.420
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Okay.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.490
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: We had, in your
first year, La Casa de Colores,

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.520
which was really two
objects boiled into one,

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.730
a crowd sourced poem revolving --

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.020
or with revolving themes
of your choosing,

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.250
and then a short video installation
where you discussed specific items

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.860
from the collection of
Library of Congress,

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:18.080
and then in the second
year, you had what rob was ,

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.820
the Word Street Champions and
The Brave Builders of the Dream,

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.200
a joint project with the
Chicago Public Schools District,

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.370
the fourth largest school
district in the country.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.980
The Poetry Foundation, of
course, the Library of Congress,

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.210
in which basically a pilot
enrichment program for teachers

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.900
to bring poetry into
the school curriculum,

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.060
and then you had The Technicolor
Adventures of Catalina Neon,

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.690
which ultimately yielded a
children's book with pictures

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:44.610
from a local illustrator
named Juana Mendina,

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.170
and the whole book was intended
for second and third graders.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.120
And last, but certainly not
least, you had The Laureate Lab,

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:55.890
which was a creative, multi-used
space at Fresno State University,

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:00.420
California, promoting artistic
expression and play and fun,

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.300
everything that's Juan Felipe.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:07.150
So I wonder, of that massive
list that just going so much,

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:12.240
maybe you want to pick one and talk
a little bit about what it meant

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.270
to you, either The
Word Street Champions.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.890
These for all second-year projects,
either Word Street Champions

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.660
or Cata, Cata Neon, as we came
to call her in the office,

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.530
that was so special to all of us.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:24.830
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
That's right.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.130
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.510
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Well,
you know, I want to thank you

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.440
and Anne Holmes, and I
want to thank Rob Casper.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:38.070
If it wasn't for the staff and
Ron egging me on to keep on going

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:42.950
and never said no, and I said to
myself, well, if he hasn't said no,

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.700
I just want to keep on going.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:49.130
But you know, having such great
creative support of a people

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.810 position:56%
at the Library of Congress and the
Poetry Center and Literature Center,

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:57.360
I wouldn't have probably
done only one-tenth of that.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.280
So I just kept on going.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:03.360
For me, all of those projects have
to do with what we started with,

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:08.920
in my generation, in the 60s,
with opening up the access

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.170
for the people, access
for the people.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:18.360
So access for the people,
validating their culture,

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.780
validating their language,
validating their experience,

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:27.640 position:56%
validating them as human beings to
fully express themselves, to create,

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:33.460 position:56%
and to build a new society from the
center of where they're coming from,

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:39.690
and that's how I started, and
that's what the laureateship

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.290
and the department
and Rob and yourself

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:46.550
and Anne assisted me in doing.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:50.060
So that's what it was all about,
and it was all about, also,

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.740
creating a public presence.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.860
Where we do not --
where we're not speaking

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:59.360
or we don't have any channels or
our channels are cut off, severed,

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.620
or choked, then we become
silent and invisible,

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:07.000
even though we don't
want to be silent.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.300
We want to write.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.550
We want to speak, but
the forums are not there,

00:31:10.550 --> 00:31:16.150
or the forums are kept away or
banned from our use, in one way

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.750
or another, or a language is
not available in our schools,

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.360
or the reading is not available,
or the books are not available.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.730
So what do you do?

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.630
What you do is you
promote people's voices.

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.030
What you do is you create a
project where the students,

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.720
second and third year, can write
their book, and we're going

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.270 position:56%
to put it up at the Library of
Congress for the whole world to see.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.920
So it will be made public.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.770
So it will have presence.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:45.390
So it won't be invisible, and
the children will not be silent,

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:48.300
and when we went to
Chicago, and Rob Casper.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.730 position:56%
And the children will not be
silent, and when we went to Chicago,

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:57.770
and Rob Casper was instrumental in
making that project become reality.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:59.960
We worked with 40 school districts.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.260
Not one, not two, 40,

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.380
and 40 teachers representing those
districts at the Poetry Foundation.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.790
Rob Casper put together the
support system and our department,

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.040
put it together, making sure it
was well-oiled and kept on going,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.370
and Don Share, the people at The
Poetry Foundation supported it.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.030
So we had the support system,
and the teachers had a budget,

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.970
and it came together, and why?

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:28.080
So they could have materials,
creative poetry ideas,

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.300
and exercises for their students
who do not have enough materials

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:39.710
or enough exercises and approaches
to expressing themselves,

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:44.380
in order to tell their stories
and have their voices heard,

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.460 position:56%
to make it heard, to make it public,

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.370
to make their faces
present everywhere

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.670
and those 40 school districts.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.510
So it's that same idea.

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.150
[ Applause ]

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:58.760
That's what it is.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.060
[ Applause ]

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.070
And that's the way all
those projects work.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.540
And the Catalina Neon
was a lot of fun.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.840
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: It was fun.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.140
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Because we
had second graders, second graders?

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.440
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney:
Second and third.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.740
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera: Second
and third graders submitting ideas

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.710
on how to write the story of
Catalina and her dog, Tortilla,

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:21.140
who jumps over the
fence and gets lost,

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.400
and they decided where
it got lost too.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.040
They decided to take the doggie

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.170
under a big, old, underground
tunnel.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.690
So then I had to go down
there, and then they decided

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:33.570
to create a magic dome
of the library.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:36.510
So they went to the magic
dome, and then they wanted

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:39.510
to throw space carrot
beings into it.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:44.280
So we had some space carrot beings.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:48.470

skateboard to the Earth.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.610

But it was fun also

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:03.820
Because they were like
my writing team.

They used to be, you
know, they had other jobs,

we use the word Catalina, Catalina.

He goes, "Yeah, okay."

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:34.970
Then I went to Anya.

&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Neon.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.140

And then she said neon.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.610
I said, perfect!

That's it, yeah!

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.780
So then I went to Rob's office.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:58.980
Hey, Rob, you know, we've got it.

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.800

That's good.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.670
But it needs a little
bit, one more thing.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:07.970
One more little spice.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.270

And then Rob said, "Oh,

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.360
a lot of giving, giving,
giving everywhere I went.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.750
People just gave and gave
and gave and gave to me,

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:49.450
themselves to me, believed in me.

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.470
I encouraged them highly.

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:59.850 position:56%
Told me their stories, or just stood
up and just stood there in front

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:03.200
of me, and that's it,
and I saw them.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.010
I stood with them, and
that was it, in many ways.

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.430
Whether it was an Silver City
up in the mountains in Mexico,

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.750
or whether it was in South
Florida, and St. Petersburg,

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:20.570
where people were dancing a
jitterbug at the hotel, and on.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:28.640 position:56%
So I was filled with -- I'm filled
with their lives and their feelings,

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:32.050
and all the challenges that they're
facing, and again, once again,

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:36.160
a lot of issues about
immigration and migration

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.270
and the youth, very
nervous about it.

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:42.030
The youth are feeling a lot, all
these things that we're feeling.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.150
They're feeling them tenfold.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:48.570
Not just the way you and I feel
them, but tenfold, because they're

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:52.960
so young and so sensitive, and they
really a pay attention to all it.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.360
They're very interested in all
of it and concerned about it.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:02.660
Issues of war and peace, issues
of what's going on in the street

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:08.060
and the brutality that's
taking place, the violence,

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:12.480
and issues from the government
that they don't agree with,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.990
that they feel are against them.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:19.060
So they're very concerned
about that.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.630
They were very difficult stories.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:26.160
So I walked away with
inspiration, and I walked away

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.460
with a greater concern and
belief, and believing more,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:37.310
when human beings, and wondering
how we can all survive and how

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:40.790
to assist them, and what
can I do as a writer?

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.370
And what can I do as a good
old-fashioned human being

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.890
without the writing,
without the books?

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.230
And it's almost like this.

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:51.730
When I listen to the youth poets
here, and when I meet you here,

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:57.230 position:56%
I know that you all have big
hearts, and you all are doing things

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:04.510
for others, and you all love
language, knowledge, cultures,

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:06.570
and you all are very inclusive.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:10.670
I've got a feeling that's who you
are, and I also have a feeling

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:14.350
that you want to do something
about what's taking place,

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:15.900
and that's why you're here also,

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.790
even though it doesn't
say it upon the wall.

00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:23.720
So that's where I'm
at, in meeting you,

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:28.330
in meeting all, with more to give.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:30.650
I want to find out
what that is, you know?

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:34.460
I don't want to be
angry, but you know what?

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:38.110
I got a little angry,
and you know what?

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.140
I wrote that -- I didn't
write angry,

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.010
but I wrote very direct poetry.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:48.360
I had to say things, and I
said them, and I got that book

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.420
in the hotel, and I was
filling with it this morning.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:57.920
That's one way, and the
other way is to be joyful.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.670
You have to bring both
poles together.

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:05.110
The concerns for our
communities and for ourselves

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:09.920
and for what's taking place
in our nation, and our joy.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:16.790
We cannot let go of our joy
and just keep the fire burning.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:23.090
We need the fountains of our
joy, and we need the fire, too.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.410
So then the question is
putting them together

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:30.250
without extinguishing
any one of them.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:35.740
So that we have the passion,
the boldness, the honesty,

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.650
the truth speaking and truth
writing, and truth being,

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:45.790
and we have the embrace and the
tenderness and the kindness.

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:47.840
That's our challenge right now.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.700
Because we can do one and burn up.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:59.490
We can do the other and recede and,
perhaps, become silent and perhaps,

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:05.540
both of those are okay, but I think
if you do both, you will solve --

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.000
we'll create -- we'll
have a better answer,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.370
a new example that we
have not had before.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.080
So we need a new example.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.440
We can't do things the way
we did them five decades ago,

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.740
where I started.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:25.160
We cannot do things the way
they're being done now, perhaps.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.760
Because they're very
brutal right now.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.060
We have to do things in a new way.

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.550
So maybe it's a new kind of
writing, and maybe it's a new kind

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.580
of speaking, and a
new kind of gathering.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.760
There has to be a gathering.

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.060
There has to be a gathering.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.360
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Yeah, I agree.

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.660
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
There has to be a gathering.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.960
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: That's lovely.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.260
What's better than that?

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.560
What a great lesson to
of learned, Juan Felipe.

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.860
The biggest of all.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.160
The biggest of all.

00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.250
Well, I'm afraid our time is
up, but I want to thank you

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:54.550
from the bottom of my heart.

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:56.020
You're an absolute joy.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.880
You're an absolute joy.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.220
Please everyone, Juan Felipe.

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.520
&gt;&gt; Juan Felipe Herrera:
Thank you, Rob.

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.820
Thank you, Anne.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:06.340
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
