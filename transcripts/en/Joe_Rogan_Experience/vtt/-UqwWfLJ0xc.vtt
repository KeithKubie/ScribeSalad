1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.390
What will happen.
The Joe Rogan experience.
Maybe that's what book big about.

2
00:00:04.391 --> 00:00:06.120
Maybe bigfoot was about do let's,

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.670
let's create this mythical monster and have people afraid.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.590
They don't want people to move in the woods.
The thing,
cause that's not good.

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.670
That's not good for the Nwa.
Oh,
you're the new little dog.

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.970
They want people to go into cities,
so they create these big firms.

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.910
If they're not doing it,
they should do it.
Create another.
That's it.

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.610
That's the most easy way.
Reason for believing in big foot I've ever heard.

9
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.400
That's so funny.
Thanks for,
it's been around forever though,
Dude.

10
00:00:30.401 --> 00:00:33.820
They talked about it in the CIA's been going on forever and it was in the native

11
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:36.670
American culture before when I bet the Nazis did that.

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.400
Tabitha Nazis like have a bet.
If you go to Germany,

13
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:42.580
they have these mythical creatures that they created a scare people out of the

14
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:46.600
woods.
If they're not,
if they're not doing that,
damn,

15
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:49.780
they got to give me credit if they started doing it because that's a good

16
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:53.590
illuminati move right there,
right.
That's how crazy deep you have to be.

17
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.050
If you're a conspiracy theorist,
if you go so deep,

18
00:00:56.051 --> 00:01:01.051
you think that the CIA was in the native American's before Columbus landed pro.

19
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.740
You don't even understand it had a different name.
It was a series of native art.

20
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.400
They taught the European,
maybe the CIA of the Apache,

21
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.550
cause you know they had to have some evil elites that lied to their people,

22
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:18.460
right?
Maybe they wanted to keep their tribes together.

23
00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:21.540
So they said they created these monsters so you can't go out there.

24
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.710
We're going to protect you so you've got to stay here.

25
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.340
Wouldn't that be a good move for,
it's probably exactly what happened.
Right?

26
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.560
And they got these crazy stories of these monsters.
Yeah,
man,

27
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.240
you got to stay here.
They had protection.
CIA.
Yeah.

28
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.650
Native Americans.
Just Brown building empires.
One on one.
You create,

29
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.070
you scare them with aliens.
We got a threat from up here,

30
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:46.060
so we need to protect you.
And then we got threats down here.
Two jobs,

31
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.990
maybe jobs was a CIA movie.
Let's keep people out the ocean.

32
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.760
We got to keep them in the cities.
It's all CIA,
Bro.
Everything I is all powerful.

33
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:58.960
Imagine if they just worked for good instead of trying to,
you know,

34
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:00.880
what they do at the native American community.

35
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.380
<v 1>People who are talking about AI,</v>

36
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:07.381
automating programming have never really written serious code coding is thinking

37
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.160
it's automated,

38
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:14.161
structured thinking and AI that can program as well or better than humans is an

39
00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:16.690
AI that just took over the world.
That's end game.

40
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.070
That's the end of the human species.
Uh,

41
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.330
and I can give you arguments why I don't think that's coming either.
Um,

42
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.040
people who are thinking,

43
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.250
and I know I'd take the opposite side from some very famous people in this

44
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:31.300
debate,
but we're nowhere near close to General Ai,
not in our lifetimes.

45
00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:35.560
You don't have to worry about it.
Even in our lifetimes.
Really.
It's so overblown.

46
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.390
Uh,
it's a,
it's another,
it's a combination of Cassandra complex.
You know,

47
00:02:40.391 --> 00:02:44.860
it's fun to talk about the end of the world combined with a god complex,

48
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.450
like people who have lost religion.

49
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:50.130
So they were looking for meaning in some kind of end of history.
Right.
Um,

50
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.250
the reason why I don't think AI is coming anytime soon is because a lot of the

51
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:57.880
advances and so called AI today or what we call narrow AI,

52
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.410
they really pattern machine learning to figure out like what is that object on

53
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:05.770
the screen or how do you find the signal in all that noise?

54
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.430
There's nothing approaching what we call creative thinking,
uh,

55
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.840
to actually model general intelligence.
You run into all kinds of problems first.

56
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.570
We don't know how the brain works at all.
Number two,

57
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.050
we've never even modeled a paramecium or an Amoeba,
let alone the human brain.

58
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.320
And number three,
there's this assumption that all of the,
uh,

59
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.620
computation is going at the cellular level,
at the neuron level,

60
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.910
whereas nature is very parsimonious.
It uses everything at his disposal.

61
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.990
There's a lot of machinery inside the cell that is doing calculations that is

62
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:38.190
intelligent,
that isn't accounted for.
And the best estimates are,

63
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.530
would take 50 years of Moore's law before we can simulate what's going on inside

64
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:45.310
a cell near perfectly and probably a hundred years before we can build a brain

65
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:46.930
that can simulate inside the cells.

66
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.070
So putting it at saying that I'm just going to model neuron is on or off and

67
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:54.520
then use that to build the human brain is overly simplistic.
Furthermore,

68
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.070
I would pause it.
There's no such thing as general intelligence.

69
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.700
Every intelligence is contextual within the context of the environment that it's

70
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:02.680
in,
so you have to evolve an environment around it.

71
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.320
So I think a lot of people who are peddling general AI,

72
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.700
the burden of proof is on them.

73
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.760
I haven't seen anything that would lead me to indicate we're approaching general

74
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.090
AI.
Instead,
we're solving deterministic,
closed,
set,

75
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:17.290
finite problems using large amounts of data,
but it's not sexy to talk about it.

76
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.860
<v 0>If you come in last,
you give us called,</v>

77
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.280
spread it out collectively $1 million.

78
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.350
You're doing better now.
It's 12 bucks champ tour bus champ.

79
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.110
You have to think about that.
I just sign up for,

80
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.860
you're not going to lose if those are the stakes.

81
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.120
What is the government division?
Wait,
hold on.
Hold on one second.
Let's let aside,

82
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:46.020
let's talk to bus.
Champ comes at a price.
Dude,

83
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:47.880
my bus was so fucking sick.

84
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.680
You can't just be tour bus champ or his daughters or his five.
I was two.

85
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.160
I was 12 I was chair.
Listen,
listen.
Do you understand that this is strange,

86
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.550
that you keep failing at these things and yet you keep bragging every time we

87
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:03.660
get together,
contemplate events.
So much success when it comes to you guys.

88
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.550
Then I think sometimes you guys forget about it.

89
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.710
I was trying to share [inaudible] shame.

90
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.890
[inaudible]
Nelson Alive,
don't you?

91
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.350
You're not the tour bus champ to bus that I was on this week is better than any

92
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.440
bucks championship was going on already asking me who's tour bus trip.

93
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.470
Let's say why it's me.
Of course I'll come cause I have the better bus.

94
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.240
Did you ever take a picture of your bus and put it online?
Yeah.
Oh really?
Yeah.

95
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.310
And you had fucking Photoshop to a hundred times.
No.

96
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.610
The outside of your bus doesn't count.
Tom,

97
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:42.270
the inside of your bus that looked like a prison yard didn't look like a prison

98
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:44.700
yard too.
Did not,
did not have a broken transmission.

99
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:49.350
No Internet TV's that didn't work.
You had no internet on your [inaudible].

100
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.210
Just the one and I want you to pause for a second and imagine a world where the

101
00:05:54.211 --> 00:05:58.400
thing that you're bragging about when you have been called out for failing to

102
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:01.820
challenges in a row hard as fuck it makes it great.

103
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.120
The first thing you talking about is this.

104
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.520
We're not even in the shape of the bus that you drive around in.

105
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.600
I didn't start to my ship tour bus.
How much is prepared woods?

106
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.150
Was the transmission bad?
We'll then I when

107
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.710
I get a flat tire,
well then I had shit

108
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.760
show.
I'm Leonardo Dicaprio at the front of the titanic.
We,

109
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.410
we had a challenge who came in last you you're talking about flipped her over.

110
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.283
Totally.
Somebody was like,

111
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.650
what are the repercussions for you fucking pussing out?
Well,

112
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:36.340
I'm not posting your fucking founded.

113
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.060
The reasons why I have this right here is because I read about you saying that

114
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:43.400
you're going to put it on your mantle piece and I'm like,

115
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:47.480
that's never going to very or Mickey mantle piece.
Joe,

116
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.110
can you entertain you?

117
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.580
Can you entertain a circumstance in which you think Burt could beat you?

118
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.020
Hip Hop make,

119
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.070
make again like the old hustler make an even game where they could be anybody's

120
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:01.540
at this point,
like a pool game was always saying no,
no,
no.
When I play pool,

121
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.140
but like in the challenge that where it's like you've got to make it have to be,

122
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.580
I'd have to have some form of lymphoma

123
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.550
really wrong with me

124
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.020
<v 2>if you want to bring together,
I don't know,</v>

125
00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:17.590
people who are on opera opposite opposite sides of the climate debate for

126
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:20.200
example.
Good luck,
I'm sure.
Right?
Well,

127
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:25.201
why is part part of that you could argue is if one side just does not accept

128
00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:28.030
science,
how can you really bring those people together?

129
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:30.640
It doesn't mean you need physical conflict to resolve it.
In fact,

130
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.390
I completely agree with you.
The physical conflict is totally counterproductive,

131
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.480
but at a certain point on some issues,

132
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.570
I understand why there's like an intractability to the debate where it seems

133
00:07:42.821 --> 00:07:46.270
completely impossible to move forward because whichever side you're on,

134
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.780
I would argue that I'm on the right side of these issues and others would

135
00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:50.614
disagree.

136
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:55.450
When you're far apart in a way that you can't even agree as to like what the

137
00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:58.630
starting point facts are about the conversation.
How do you even,

138
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.790
how do you start?
I have some ideas as to how I try to do it,
but it's very tough.

139
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.690
It's very tough.

140
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.670
I just don't think dunking on people always like constantly shitting on people

141
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.590
is necessarily the way to do it.
Yeah,

142
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.640
and I think it's important to distinguish between just straight up ad hominem

143
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.850
where someone is wrong and bad,
uh,

144
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.420
because I think they're a bad person or they're an idiot or whatever to

145
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:27.421
recognizing when somebody is a participant in bad faith and a conversation to

146
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:32.861
when someone has maybe fallen prey to audience capture or whatever else might be

147
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.450
kind of influencing what,
what and how they're doing.

148
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.610
I think that those criticisms are legitimate,

149
00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:43.540
but you got to stay away from just ad Hominem.
When I woke up that morning,

150
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.130
I was about one 62.

151
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.270
I woke up at 5:00 AM way answer at 9:00 AM I have to be one 55.

152
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.870
So I've got seven pounds to to cut it,
which is okay.
You know,

153
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.640
it's not too bad.
Cut about nine pounds of the day before.

154
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.050
I'm a little dehydrated,
a little,
you know,
I'm a little already worn,

155
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.140
but uh,
as the way cut was going,
you know,

156
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:07.290
we got till about eight o'clock and I had only cut a pound and a half,

157
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.300
so I still want 61 in a half something at eight o'clock Wayne's or at nine

158
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.180
o'clock to the point where we got to do something.

159
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:20.210
So they start to put me in the bathtub just because we do most of our cuts in

160
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:23.670
the bath.
You know,
when you,
when you're in a high humidity,
you,

161
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.220
you're going to cut more water weight or are you going to sweat more?

162
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.790
And water is obviously a hundred percent humidity.
Um,

163
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.350
so they start throwing bull and hot water because we couldn't get the water hot

164
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:38.430
enough to make me sweat more Christ.
So we just take a kettle's of,

165
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:43.350
of hot water and just pouring it on me.
Uh,
and you know,
doctors are in analogies,

166
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.310
twin and 12 people in and out of the the,
the hotel room to make sure I'm okay.

167
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.810
Uh,
and I make sure that I could cut the weight and I was just in such a,

168
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:56.790
like an adrenaline fucking like on 10.
I'm like,
just get,
Oh,
you know,

169
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.620
I'm screaming at everybody on,
literally,
I was in the tub,
I was crying like,

170
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.530
why?
But to me,
I was like,

171
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:09.560
there's no way I'm not making this weight and six pounds in about an hour,

172
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.780
maybe two hours,
cause I go wait in about nine o'clock or so,
uh,
army,
uh,

173
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.480
about nine 30,
10 or so,
um,

174
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.430
six pounds in two hours.
This,
it was brutal.

175
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.070
But I think that just kept me as such a,

176
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.620
such a 10 or my adrenaline level.

177
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:31.210
I never really understood how to bring it back down,
you know?
And,

178
00:10:31.211 --> 00:10:34.560
and rob would try and talk to me and try and tell me like,
hey,
calm down.
Like,

179
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:37.560
you know,
take a few deep breaths.
And I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
I'm breathing,
whatever.

180
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.610
I wasn't listening to it,
so,
hm.
