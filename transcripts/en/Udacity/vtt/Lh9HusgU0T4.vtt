00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I chose to break this problem down into three parts.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the first part, the block is moving from exactly the center

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
where it just hit the timer over to the spring.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In the second part it's in contact with the spring compressing it and then finally extending again,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and in the third part, the block is moving to the right back towards the timer.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Note that this problem is completely symmetrical, so it's sufficient for me to solve

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the problem on one side, and I now the same thing is going to happen for me on the other side.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I only need to solve for one period of the block moving over here and bouncing back to the timer.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I know the same thing is going to happen on the right side.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In the first part, the block needs to travel a distance of 1.5 m and it's going in a velocity of V₀.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I'm going to use this kinematics equation here

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and I know that the acceleration is going to be zero during this part

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so I can cross out this term, and doing a little algebra and plugging in my values here,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I find that the time it takes for the block to move this distance of 1.5 m is equal to 1.5/V₀.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I'm actually going to skip part two for a second and move on to part three.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And in part three we said that the block is moving to the right

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and needs to cover the same distance of 1.5 m again, and we know from conservation energy

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that the kinetic energy of the block has to be the same both before and after

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
it makes contact with the spring, which means that its speed will actually remain the same

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
both before and after since the mass is remaining the same.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This means that part three is actually an exact mirror image of part one.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
The block is just moving to the right this time over a distance of 1.5 m

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
at the same speed V₀, except this time it's to the right.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We could actually conclude right away that the time for part three

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
is just equal to 1.5/V₀ just like part one.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now what about part two, well I made the argument in the question

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that the time that the block stays in contact with the spring is actually equal to 1/2 of the period.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Not the full period of the oscillation of the spring, and this is because at this point

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the spring is just about to pull back on the block, but because the block isn't attached

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the spring can't actually pull back on the block.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The block is free to move with the same velocity it has at this point,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which happens to be the maximum velocity as well as the velocity

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that the block started with when it was coming in V₀.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We can say that for part two, the time it takes is simply equal to the period of the T/2.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Alright, now let's put these three times together.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
If we add together these three times and substitute in the period for the oscillations

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of a spring, we get this equation for the time it takes the block to move away from the timer

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and return back to it, and we know that we want this time to be equal exactly to 1 s.

00:02:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And solving this equation for V₀, I get that the original speed to be equal to 1.08 m/s. Great job!
