is you get a lot of publicity there's a
lot of focus on them the downside is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
lot of focus on them the downside is
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.250

for obama in the fall if he got the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
for obama in the fall if he got the
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.359
for obama in the fall if he got the
nomination and the reverse but over time

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
nomination and the reverse but over time
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.810
nomination and the reverse but over time
I think that a very large number of them

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
I think that a very large number of them
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.230
I think that a very large number of them
will come around because the alternative

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
will come around because the alternative
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.170
will come around because the alternative
I think will be worse that is the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
I think will be worse that is the
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.120
I think will be worse that is the
election of Senator McCain and a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
election of Senator McCain and a
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.929
election of Senator McCain and a
Republican to the presidency and

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939
Republican to the presidency and
 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.819
Republican to the presidency and
particularly since you consider that in

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
particularly since you consider that in
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.609
particularly since you consider that in
many respects the policies being pursued

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
many respects the policies being pursued
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.870
many respects the policies being pursued
would be those of the current

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
would be those of the current
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.810
would be those of the current
administration which certainly anybody

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
administration which certainly anybody
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.600
administration which certainly anybody
who's voted for Obama or Clinton and in

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
who's voted for Obama or Clinton and in
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.170
who's voted for Obama or Clinton and in
the primaries wouldn't be supporting so

the primaries wouldn't be supporting so
 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.030
the primaries wouldn't be supporting so
a lot will depend upon how the candidate

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
a lot will depend upon how the candidate
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.370
a lot will depend upon how the candidate
who doesn't get the nomination handles

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
who doesn't get the nomination handles
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.499
who doesn't get the nomination handles

that they will help

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600
that they will help
 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.700
that they will help
to heal the wounds once this competitive

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710
to heal the wounds once this competitive
 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.830
to heal the wounds once this competitive
process is over difficult as that can be

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
