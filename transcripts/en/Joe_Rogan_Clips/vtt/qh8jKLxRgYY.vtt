1
00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:01.850
There's a chain reaction to it,

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.850
just like craft getting caught and getting a blowjob that shut down business.

3
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:08.160
All you got no United States.

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.190
Nobody walked into a spa without wondering whether or not existing of her and

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.890
your name was going to be blown out on them.

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.080
<v 1>Isn't that crazy?
But here's the thing,
they,
they miss,
they get this guys,</v>

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.140
there's a video of this guy.
Do you want a massage?
So they've got video of it.

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.830
Right?
And at the end,
the girl jerks,
I'm off.
What if she didn't jerk them off?

9
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.480
What if she just gave him a massage?

10
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.510
What kind of a fucked up invasion of his privacy if he just went in there to get

11
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.000
a massage.
Right.
Or was everybody just getting jacked off?

12
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.660
I would imagine when you sent him a plea deal to drop the charges.

13
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:45.890
So I don't know what happened.
He ratted everybody out.
He's like,

14
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.100
I need to stay up Marie Brown kids.

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.460
<v 0>Well,
I gotta tell you,
you know,
I was a so loan some,
you know,</v>

16
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:58.430
I took some comfort there in my lifetime is if Paul Simon ones wrote and,

17
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.053
and um,

18
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.620
<v 1>yeah.</v>

19
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.730
<v 0>Okay.
I'm not,
I'm,
you know what,</v>

20
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.800
I'm not going to say it because it's just not worth it.
They're worth it.

21
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.420
It's not,

22
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.070
it's not that everybody seems to be perfectly aware that they could be washing

23
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:11.904
your feet.

24
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.950
<v 1>Yeah.
And you know,
and that's fine.
Yeah.
Why is it,
um,</v>

25
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.150
that a guy like that would go to a place like that?
Like he's so rich.
I,

26
00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:23.500
you know what,
he has a guy,

27
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.130
if you don't have a guy who should get a guy like no further,

28
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.690
a cleaner look,
look no further than,

29
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.620
<v 0>uh,
and this is ever,
everybody's going to realize that you out fading.</v>

30
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:37.970
My memory is now.
But,
uh,
uh,
uh,

31
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.360
the English actor that got caught with the,
uh,

32
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.390
<v 1>yes.
Elizabeth Hurley's husband Hugh Grant Grant,
right?
Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.230
Look at you grant married to the hottest woman on the planet at the time,
right?

34
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.200
Ruthlessly hot.

35
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.240
<v 0>Yeah.
Amazingly hot.
You look at it,
he wasn't married jewelry either.
Right,</v>

36
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.320
they're boyfriend,
girlfriend.
And,
uh,

37
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.020
and even I couldn't understand that.
Right.
I mean,
cause I,
I,
you know,
I've,

38
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.980
I've been with a couple of hot chicks before in my life,
but this was,

39
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.070
he wanted to freaky.
Yeah.
He and I,
you know,

40
00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:17.071
and I get that and it comes back to that appetite thing that guys have.

41
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:18.844
You know,

42
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.060
I've gotten a hand job from somebody and I admit this and it was the best sex

43
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:27.640
I've ever had in my life because it was somebody that was at number one.

44
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:32.440
It was a great massage and then this tantric thing going on and,
uh,

45
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.630
and,
and,
you know,
and,
and it,

46
00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:38.500
but it was fantastic and,

47
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.760
and pricey and,
uh,
and,
and it's free most anywhere.

48
00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.610
And that's in Vegas is legal as it can be.
You know,

49
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:49.960
they have milking tables that have a whole,
your Dick Hangs through and,
uh,

50
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.910
they do milk people table look it up.
They got him for the guy.

51
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:58.130
If he lives in the stomach,
well,
you don't have,
you got somewhere to cracks.

52
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.800
You got to get somewhere to put your heart on.

53
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.780
Felt like he just laid on your back.
No,
but it makes more sense.

54
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.540
Hygienically to have like a hole in the bottom of the table.

55
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.110
It'll be on the screen,
I'm sure soon.
That is ridiculous.

56
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.793
And I'm not,

57
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.200
all I'm saying is that in like in Canada,
they,

58
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:24.430
you know,
are the most of the rest of the world.
It's,

59
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.540
uh,

60
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.600
getting a tug is really not considered a crime of any kind whatsoever,

61
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.620
and is harmless.

62
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:36.370
And who gives a shit and why is it okay to massage your feet?

63
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.630
But it's not okay to massage.

64
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.280
I would rather massage my dick then my own feet.
I would,

65
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.390
and I prove it on a regular basis,
regular basis.

66
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.920
I think the problem really is sex trafficking.
That's the problem.

67
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.180
[inaudible] Tom era,
you know,

68
00:03:55.181 --> 00:04:00.100
that's the worst thing that I can imagine.
But,
but,
but I,

69
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.310
again,
I'm not gonna,
I'm not gonna go there because it's the most horrific thing.

70
00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:09.020
You could have the most horrific thing you can imagine taking sides.

71
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.980
Just finish watching that series of bad,
uh,
taking Madeline.
Uh,
and,
um,

72
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.410
and so I'm like,
I just can't even,
that,
that I would,
you know,

73
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:21.930
I would support any,
anything,
any way,

74
00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:26.880
shape or form to have it stomped out,
spend billions of dollars,

75
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.500
put boots on the ground,
you know,
stop it.
If you can,

76
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:35.040
in any way you can,
women who are trying to be legitimate sex workers,

77
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.730
whether or not you think that's the thing they,
you know,

78
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.860
then it doesn't matter what I think it is a thing,
you know,
go down to go.

79
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.340
I just went to Amsterdam before I took my mother to Barcelona because I wanted a

80
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:46.320
little three day stopover,
uh,

81
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.760
before I spent eight days with mom and Barcelona and,
uh,

82
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.160
and their signs don't take pictures of our sex works that our sex workers,

83
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.470
not sex with our sex work.
And,
uh,
I mean,
they,
they,
they totally own it and go,

84
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:06.390
hey,
this is not a bad deal.
You know,
it,
uh,
you know,

85
00:05:06.391 --> 00:05:10.830
your,
you know what you're qualified to do,
make French fries.

86
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.200
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.850
<v 0>Or it turns out you're super hot and,
and you in our country,</v>

88
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.720
you can have this job or in la or in this country,
you're going to have that job.

89
00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.750
Just not everywhere,
but it was only a couple spots in this country,
right.

90
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.760
In Nevada and Nevada for I think that,
and I don't even know.

91
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.760
I think just the bottom.
I think that's it,
but it's to me,

92
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.810
here's what's up my real life and this is important.
Okay.
Um,

93
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.770
I played Vegas a lot,
right?

94
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.630
I'm 10 weekends a year at the Mirage and marijuana is,

95
00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:45.464
uh,

96
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.860
is legal recreationally now and they have the biggest dispensary in the world.

97
00:05:51.411 --> 00:05:54.970
Was he like,
oh,
like it's like a universal made it or something.
You know,

98
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.430
I went in there,
it was fantastic.
And uh,

99
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.630
prostitution is legal.
You can get a drink of liquor 24 hours a day,

100
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:06.770
seven days a week.
And I realize that I'm a law abiding citizen.

101
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.230
I hear when I'm standing on this part of the United States ground,

102
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.380
I don't break any laws at all.
I can be free.

103
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.140
That's why I feel so good when I go to the Vegas.
That's why people go,

104
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:21.320
do you like Vegas?
You get tired of it and I'm no,
no,
you don't want it.

105
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:25.410
Cause I can breathe deep motherfuckers.
That's why I could be who I am.
Yeah.

106
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.480
I can do it openly.
