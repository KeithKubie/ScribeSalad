HERSHEY FELDER: It's
a pleasure to be back.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.770
It's a pleasure
to see you again.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.787
I don't know how many of
you were here last time when

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:13.870
I came to talk about
Beethoven, or how many of you

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:14.703
have seen the shows.

00:00:14.703 --> 00:00:17.050
By a quick show of hands,
who plays an instrument

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.170
who's in the room?

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.890
Anybody?

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.390
All right.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.825
Largely piano, or many things?

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:22.450
Various things?

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.900
Piano?

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.170
Piano?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.860
Lots of things?

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.360
All right.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.880
Great.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.797
Well, one of the things
that has fascinated me

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:31.390
about the music of Debussy, in
particular because he really

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.250
was the change of all music as
we know it in Western music,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.740
is the question about
where things come from.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.073
Now one of the wonderful
things about talking at Google

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.240
and talking to people like
yourselves is essentially

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.470
what you are are inventors.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.440
You're the Debussys of today.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.210
I think about
Debussy and I really

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.820
can't understand
where he came up

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.000
with these ideas that
essentially didn't exist

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.645
before he came up with them.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:59.020
And if we think about that,
and think of the kind of work

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.600
that you yourselves are
doing, the question I always

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.390
have with people
like yourselves--

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.310
you know me, in
terms of inventing,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.660
I'm not really an inventor.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.800
I'm a recreator.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.910
I'm an interpreter.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.180
I'm that kind of person.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.750
I'm somebody who takes
pictures from another world

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.400
and presents them to the public.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.900
But essentially
they've all existed.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.360
I give my own taste to
the whole thing, perhaps,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.773
but nothing more than that.

00:01:20.773 --> 00:01:22.690
What you guys are doing,
and what Debussy did,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.360
is really create
something out of nothing.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.770
All Debussy had were tools.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.070
He essentially
had, at that point,

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.405
the 12 tones of the scale.

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:34.450
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.550
That's all he had.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.140
And he had chord configurations.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.760
He had history of music
that came before him.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.410
But he didn't look
to that music.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.952
It's amazing that he picked
stuff out of thin air.

00:01:45.952 --> 00:01:47.910
So conceptually, what
I'd like to look at today

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.130
is this idea of where
things come from

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.350
and how they actually
arrive there.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.390
How did you guys come
up with the ideas

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.350
that you come up with?

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.940
Are they just dreams?

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.650
Did Debussy suddenly
close his eyes

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.780
and say, what does
this sound like to me?

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.497
And how do you create that?

00:02:04.497 --> 00:02:06.330
In going backwards a
little bit, let's think

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.740
of Beethoven for a second.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.690
Here was a man who
essentially pushed music

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.480
so far that he basically
did what everybody did,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.060
but only after Bach
had did it before him.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.620
If you think of
this with Beethoven,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.690
it's really just a
few pounding notes.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.770
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.650
He claimed to have heard
this because he was walking

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.380
through the streets of
Vienna, he got tired,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.690
and he sat down at
the foot of a tree,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.920
and he couldn't hear
anything by this point.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.340
It was quite late in his career.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.710
Well, not late.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.168
It was middle of his career,
but his hearing had completely

00:02:38.168 --> 00:02:40.030
gone, and he
claimed that he felt

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.940
knocking of a bird on a tree.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.580
And that's where he came home
and interpreted that from.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.350
It's a fascinating idea.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.170
We understand how he came up
with it, where he found it,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.120
and then how he
developed that and used

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.260
those four notes to continually
push further in music.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.950
We can look at Bach and
understand how he captured,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.990
essentially all
of written music,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.390
all of music that we have
[INAUDIBLE],, in such simple--

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.490
you start with
the first prelude.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.350
[PIANO MUSIC]

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.320
This literally sounds like
it was composed yesterday.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.390
It's that fresh.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.992
The voice leading is so perfect.

00:03:17.992 --> 00:03:19.075
The colors are so perfect.

00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:21.828
It doesn't matter what
instrument you play this on.

00:03:21.828 --> 00:03:23.620
For those of you who
play many instruments,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.710
no matter which one you
choose, this is eternal music

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.270
and it will stay.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.890
It's miraculous
how that happens.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.660
Where did these guys
come up with this?

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.400
But all this has a tradition.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.430
It comes from point
0 to point A to point

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.430
B to point C. If we think
of following the composers

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.180
we can see how each one of
them leads to the next guy,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.830
in some way or other.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.800
Beethoven was curious
because, once he went deaf--

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.170
I've always wondered this.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.920
Once he went deaf, was he
able to then self-edit?

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.900
For instance, all of
you guys, whatever

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.340
it is you put out
there on the net

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.840
or whatever, you're doing it,
you're coding, you're working,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.760
you're busy preparing.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.010
You put it out there for the
world and you go, oh god.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.760
That's really bad.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.090
That's doesn't work at all.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.230
I've got to take that back.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.950
I can't believe my
name is attached to it.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.742
I've got to fix it.

00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:11.990
Because suddenly when it
evolves into public form,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.110
we see it in a very
different context.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.982
Beethoven as a composer
never had that ability.

00:04:16.982 --> 00:04:18.190
He would go into the theatre.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.050
He would listen to the music.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.579
He couldn't hear it at all.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.290
He would listen
to it in his head.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.920
So he was never able to say,
ooh, that really sounded great.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.670
It looked great on
paper, but the moment I

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.540
start to do this in front
of the public it's terrible.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.345
The physical
reaction is visceral.

00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:34.720
My idea has always
been that he's

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.360
pushed music so much
further because we

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.110
went with his imagination.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.260
Now Debussy did not have that.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.770
The interesting
thing about Debussy,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.440
he was very, very crotchety.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.150
He, in fact, created a character
called Monsieur Croche.

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.750
Now, croche is an
eighth note in French,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.060
but it also means
old crotchety one.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.910
And he created this character
that basically was a critic,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.770
and it was his alter
ego, and he was not

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.350
nice to anybody about anything.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.330
He could be very nice
in public, although he

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.210
was quite scandalous,
but Monsieur Croche

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.800
was really a terrible guy.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.720
Basically he said,
Beethoven, oh, Beethoven.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.515
He's just the old deaf one.

00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:14.030
Can you imagine?

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.640
And then he said of
Beethoven, the guy

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.940
has something to say, just, poor
thing, has no means to say it.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.590
Mendelssohn, for
instance, Debussy

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.360
said, oh, he's nothing more
than a proper accountant.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.180
And this would go on and on.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.460
He had enemies in Paris
and it was terrible.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.230
But Debussy somehow understood
that each one of them

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.850
contributed something.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.640
Debussy's whole goal
in art and in music

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.480
was not to do any of that.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.970
It was to create
something completely new.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.310
He was fed up with rules.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.290
He wasn't interested
in any of the rules

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.120
that music came before him.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.080
He said, there is only one
guiding factor in all of music,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.150
and that's what pleases the ear.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.240
If it's beautiful for the ear,
and if it feels like something

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.110
for the ear, then
it's worthwhile,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.130
which is the antithesis
of what Beethoven did.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.900
He couldn't care about what
the ear sounds like because he

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.540
didn't know at that point.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.870
He couldn't access it that way.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.360
He could imagine, but
he couldn't access.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.350
So we go back to Debussy and
we have him living in Paris

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.900
in the late 1800s
and the early 1900s.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.840
It's a time where the entire
world of music is changing.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.910
The entire world
of art is changing.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.920
If you think about
Debussy's great influence,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.878
there were two of them.

00:06:21.878 --> 00:06:23.320
One was Turner, the painter.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.390
The other was
Whistler, the painter.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.350
In Whistler's day-- and I just
read about this the other day--

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.450
I think it was in the 1870s.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.305
He had painted "Nocturne
in Black and Gold."

00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:35.680
It's called "The
Falling Rocket."

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.820
It's a wonderful image.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.530
You can look this up.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.120
It's basically this dark
image with these explosions

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.460
of fireworks in
it, and it doesn't

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.830
look like anything
until you stand there

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.020
and let yourself feel.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.630
And it was interesting
that the critic, Ruskin,

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.970
who was the major British
critic at the time,

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.460
basically accused
him of flinging paint

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.270
in the face of the public.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.180
If you look at it
today, it gives us

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.190
such a sense of emotion,
such a sense of feeling.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.910
So how do these guys,
in particular Debussy,

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.460
look at the world
and say, I don't want

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.650
to paint what I see in sound.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.570
What I see in sound
is very simple.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.290
It's raindrops.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.760
It's this or the other.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.990
I want to paint in sound
what I feel when I'm actually

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.820
engaging with nature.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:26.290
So his whole idea was to
paint feeling in sound.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.760
Now how do you accomplish that?

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.040
His whole concept about
accomplishing that

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.070
was actually using
color of sound.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.990
For instance, I'm using
words and so on and so forth.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.110
But if I place my voice
here and I talk like this,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:38.890
you'll hear something.

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.807
You'll hear the words.

00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:42.280
It may be interesting,
but it may not necessarily

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.600
communicate the color
that we're looking for.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.080
And yeah, this is
somebody from Brooklyn

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.880
who talks maybe a
little bit like this,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.510
where I live some of the time.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.740
But at the end of the day, if
you want to give color of sound

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.900
and create that beautiful aura
that makes us feel something,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.290
you all have to use a color.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.560
And color and timbre was
so important to Debussy,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.710
and to try and explain
it, it was a lifetime

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.590
of trying to understand
how sound actually

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.080
affected the spirit.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.500
When we use words, are
they the actual words--

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.870
and this has always been
a fascinating idea for me.

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.650
Are the actual words that we
put on paper or on our screens--

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.160
is it their meaning, or is
it the meaning and everything

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.570
plus the meaning?

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.400
So is it not just
the technical word

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.350
itself that we are using
to express something

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.850
to communicate, but it is the
cultural and all the rest that

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.350
is around that
word that makes it

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.820
so fascinating in terms of how
we communicate one to the next.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.660
So Debussy-- he is looking for
a way to communicate that's new.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.270
He was looking for a way to
communicate that's fresh.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.850
He's looking for a way
to tell you stories.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.520
He did some early
things, stuff like this.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.326
[MUSIC - CLAUDE
DEBUSSY, "ARABESQUE, NO.

00:08:56.326 --> 00:08:56.826
1"]

00:08:56.826 --> 00:08:57.565
It's so pretty.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.930
It just floats, like water.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.910
Where did he come
up with this water?

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.000
The blend of sound.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.590
Now, this is an early
piece of Debussy.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.930
He believed that he
didn't even begin

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.790
to touch what one
could express in music.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.665
Here he sort of thought,
well, that's pretty.

00:09:39.665 --> 00:09:40.610
It's nice, isn't it?

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.560
It's got this kind
of watery color.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.950
Except nobody was even
doing this before that.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.960
Somehow that blend
of color, that

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.770
blend of sound that allowed
us to feel liquid in water,

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.180
was really remarkable.

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.390
And it only took
about 25 or 30 years

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.960
from that sound for the Russians
to come to Paris and say,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.880
we are sick of this water.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.470
We are sick of this sound.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.820
We are sick of all of
these flowing things.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.663
Now we need to have music.

00:10:10.663 --> 00:10:12.830
And so of course then you
have "The Rite of Spring,"

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.455
and all of a sudden
Debussy gets pushed

00:10:14.455 --> 00:10:17.540
to the side with Stravinsky who
thought Debussy was OK but not

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.260
really so great.

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.640
And then we have all kinds
of Russians influencing.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.280
So this goes in cycles,
much like the world is, much

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.470
like we can only hope
that the world continues

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.470
going in cycles.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.310
But Debussy-- when
did he actually change

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:35.480
the world of music?

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.840
Strangely, he changed
it with one instrument

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.070
and with one note.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:46.430
That instrument was a flute
and the note was a C sharp.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.393
One note.

00:10:47.393 --> 00:10:49.310
Now, there are lots of
ways to play a C sharp.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.430
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:56.900
Or the idea of having the
sound that's around the sound,

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.000
and what I think
Debussy understood well

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.390
was that sound is not just
in and of itself a sound.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.670
I think what Debussy
understood perfectly

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.880
was sound is created
by the sound itself

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.980
and by the overtones
and the aura around it.

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.860
So when that first flute
played, it had to do that.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.082
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.800
And then for the first time, he
tells us where we are, sort of.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:40.715
That magic.

00:11:40.715 --> 00:11:44.508
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.410
So with these few bars-- one,
two, three, four, five bars--

00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:02.740
Debussy introduced the world
to an entire new life in music.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.520
Why?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.380
The first thing
is, up until him,

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.313
the people who
really pushed music

00:12:07.313 --> 00:12:08.980
and that he took a
little bit from-- you

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.520
had Rimsky-Korsakov in
Russia, who was pushing music

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:18.670
with chromaticism, making
chromaticism kind of sexy,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:23.110
and when Rimsky-Korsakov looked
at Debussy's music, he said,

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.230
Debussy has absolutely
no talent whatsoever.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.120
He has nothing to
say, and worse,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.510
whatever he does have to say,
he doesn't know how to say it.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.250
That was him.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.650
And then you had,
also, Tchaikovsky.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.230
Tchaikovsky was sent to one
of Debussy's manuscripts,

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.480
and Tchaikovsky looked at
it and said, for an amateur,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.160
it's not bad.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.522
There's a few notes here.

00:12:43.522 --> 00:12:45.730
There's a few ideas, but he
doesn't develop anything.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.690
He doesn't understand.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.560
He doesn't--

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.990
And yet here was a man
who pushed everything

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.820
forth so much, so looking at how
and why is the real question.

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.140
Then we have Wagner.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.230
Now Wagner was a real,
real problem for Debussy.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.580
First of all, at the point
where Debussy discusses Wagner--

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.740
his love of his
life and his wife--

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.720
he was first his lady friend
and then later his wife--

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.860
was Emma Bardac, whom he stole
away from a very rich banker

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.430
because that was
Debussy's thing.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.555
It sort of was!

00:13:19.555 --> 00:13:25.150
And so Debussy, now having
Emma Bardac in his life,

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.310
she was Jewish and Wagner
had no patience for that.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.727
I mean, this goes
back all the way

00:13:28.727 --> 00:13:32.290
to the mid 1800s
where Wagner basically

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:36.970
said, in "Das Judenthem fur die
Musik," Jewishness in music,

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.880
he said--

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.300
it's paraphrased but
you get the idea--

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.860
at the end of the
day, the only thing

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.470
that will save you
Jews from your curse

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.810
is being annihilated.

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.830
And it's interesting.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.280
Now why I bring this up--
it's morbid, but it's good--

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.720
that "Judenthem in der Musik,"
the Jewishness in music,

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.440
actually began with
Wagner in 1850.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.620
From there, much later,
Goebbels and Goering

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.350
took the basis of what
Wagner said and made

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.420
it the basis for
the final solution,

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.530
way long after Wagner is dead.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.990
But this is what
happened and these

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.460
are how these things generate.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.840
This is how terror generates.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.710
This is how
annihilation generates.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.920
This is how genocide generates.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.610
Bad ideas that only get
taken on by crazy people

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.550
and get much, much, much worse
and lead to the worst things

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.850
in the universe.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:33.160
And so here you have Debussy in
this cross-hairs with Wagner.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.190
First of all, he
hated his ethic,

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.860
and he hated his
theories about music

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.890
because they were just
so constantly overt

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.890
and constantly repetitious,
and yet at the same time,

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.410
Debussy stole as much as he
could from Wagner to make

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.090
it work for him.

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.030
The interesting thing
about Debussy and Wagner

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.090
is, at the end, Debussy
said of him, well,

00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:59.890
Wagner is basically
a sunset that people

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.260
are mistaking for a dawn.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.880
Essentially, that
Wagner's time was over.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.380
He came.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.130
He went.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.620
There was nothing more
interesting to learn from him.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.150
But you see, the
thing about Wagner

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.630
that is really remarkable that
then leads us to Debussy, if we

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:17.620
think about something like
this, [INAUDIBLE],, Death

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:23.400
and Transfiguration,
he goes through keys.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.666
Basically death
is transfiguring.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.340
This is where she sings,
[SINGING IN GERMAN]..

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.800
How soft his smile.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.490
And basically what's happened by
this point is that he's died--

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.850
he's been killed-- and she's
standing over his dead body

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.040
and she wants to
join him in death,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.480
because that's the only place
that they can be together.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.350
And what Wagner does is he
takes us through so many keys

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.010
to get there.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:04.370
[MUSIC - RICHARD WAGNER, "DEATH
 AND TRANSFIGURATION"]

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:10.680
And then if that's not
enough we transfigure again,

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.110
and we keep on transfiguring
until we get to here,

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.320
and so on and so forth.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.938
And then because
that wasn't enough,

00:16:16.938 --> 00:16:17.980
we transfigure some more.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.417
[MUSIC - RICHARD WAGNER, "DEATH
 AND TRANSFIGURATION"]

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.830
We keep on going through keys.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.740
Now, the essence of
this going through keys,

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.980
to keep on going this
way, was Wagner's approach

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.110
to telling us about sex.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.480
Now the interesting thing
about this is, in those days,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.370
of course, people
were sexually overt.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:47.480
It's not quite like today.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.620
It wasn't quite as free or--

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.245
I don't even know
which way it's going.

00:16:50.245 --> 00:16:52.070
I don't know what it is today.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:52.770
It's true!

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:56.270
But in those days to
be able to express

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.060
this kind of sexual and
sensual energy in music

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.310
was of prime importance
how to do that.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:04.130
Wagner's way of getting
out all his frustration--

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.140
against the Jews,
apparently-- was

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.880
to write these kinds
of never ending,

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.720
constant turns in
music, these cadences

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.250
that would never resolve.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.730
So this idea that the cadence
kept on pulling us and pulling

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.609
us more and more and more,
and if you listen carefully

00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:26.060
to what he does, even just
a little bit later in this,

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.940
he does something like this.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:34.330
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.110
And it keeps on going and it
keeps on building like this.

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.053
He never lets us
breathe, and that's

00:17:49.053 --> 00:17:50.470
what he does with
musical tension.

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.680
Wagner figured that out.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.630
Debussy then went
one step further.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.010
He said, OK, now how can I
take that, but not as gross,

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.880
and make it just so
sensual and so beautiful,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.730
to use this kind of never-ending
color and use of sound

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.320
and never be bound to a key.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.280
So this all goes back to what
I spoke about very early on.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.110
The real question
in all of this is,

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.870
when you are
inventing something,

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.880
what are the parameters?

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.410
Are there parameters?

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:24.490
What kind of rules
must we abide by

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.130
so that we actually
get to something

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.668
that can be used, adapted,
interesting to the public,

00:18:30.668 --> 00:18:33.210
something that can be used all
over the world, something that

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.330
can be of interest?

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.440
Do we invent exclusive of
how things are received,

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.350
or do we invent with
the mind that this is

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.390
how this is going to be used?

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.720
It's a question I pose you,
because the question for me

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.240
when it comes to great
music and Debussy,

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.030
was he creating these
colors and these ideas

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.530
because they just
came to him and he

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.440
didn't care what the
public felt, or this

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.850
is what it sounded like
to him and it was fine,

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:02.630
and so invented a completely
new world of music?

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.140
Or was he saying, I have
an entire superstructure

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.120
of how music should
go in my head,

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.780
and he placed the
system in order to work?

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.900
That system, a lot of it
based on a whole tone scale.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.797
So many of you know the
scales, simple as it is, right?

00:19:18.797 --> 00:19:20.630
But if we keep the whole
tones, that means--

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.130
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.330
--half tones between each.

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.770
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.297
Now if you play it loud with
no ambience, it's just noise.

00:19:31.297 --> 00:19:32.130
But then you start--

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.390
feels a little bit
like Fantasy Island.

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.880
And you speed it up and it
gets even more Fantasy Island

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.180
and so on and so forth.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.840
So the idea is, where
does this all come from?

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.200
And that's how I'd like to
start our discussion today,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.570
this idea about asking
questions about this,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.080
trying to understand where
it comes from, how it works.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.180
I will use musical examples,
but in order for this to work,

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.680
you need to ask these questions
that are interesting to you.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:02.180
And if we engage
together, then I'll

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.490
be able to answer specifically.

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:04.590
So the floor is open.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.507
Don't waste time thinking
about your question.

00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:07.120
Just ask.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:07.620
Go ahead.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.670
I see you're looking.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.007
Ask me a question about
something like this.

00:20:11.007 --> 00:20:11.840
You've got to think.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.150
All right.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:12.780
Anybody else.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:13.440
A question.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.332
Go ahead.

00:20:14.332 --> 00:20:15.790
That's a very
interesting question.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.840
So I'll repeat for sound.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.800
The gentleman asks, here
you have music or sound

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.500
that has changed over
years throughout history,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.470
and the reception
to it has changed.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.460
There were rules.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.460
In the old days, there was
no such a thing as this.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.570
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.890
The parallel notes.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.200
In the very early days, yes.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.883
But then as we got into
great Western music,

00:20:42.883 --> 00:20:43.800
putting the parallel--

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.480
I mean, that was
against the rules,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.710
completely against the rules.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.530
And our ears have adapted to
these things in various ways.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.630
So the question
is, at what point

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.050
does something like
impressionist music

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:59.280
actually take on a pale of ugh,
and it's not interesting to us

00:20:59.280 --> 00:20:59.972
anymore?

00:20:59.972 --> 00:21:01.680
Well, that's the magic
about great music,

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.840
but here's the thing
about impressionist music.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.560
Debussy could not stand
the term Impressionism.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.860
Basically what he said was,
Impressionism is for imbeciles.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.740
I can do it for real.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.990
Because this whole
idea of impressionism,

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:20.040
it was basically a disparaging
term to sort of slough people

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:20.540
off.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.123
You're not really
good at what you do.

00:21:22.123 --> 00:21:23.770
If you were really
good at what you do,

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.340
you could actually do it within
the context of the rules.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.500
So anything that you're
doing, breaking the rules

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.808
or softening the edges,
means you can't really do it.

00:21:31.808 --> 00:21:34.350
And so instead of really playing
a scale the way it should be

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.290
played, you're now softening it
and mixing it up and doing it,

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:38.820
it's because you can't.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.890
And Debussy said, it's
not because I can't.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.270
I very much so can.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.890
I very can do that.

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.460
The idea of Impressionism
was a term that was used

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.465
and it's stuck.

00:21:48.465 --> 00:21:50.340
But it really didn't
mean anything to Debussy

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:51.798
and I don't think
it meant anything

00:21:51.798 --> 00:21:53.520
to a lot of his compatriots.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.180
What they were doing was
creating a new method of art

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.120
and a new method
of reaction to art.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.420
And so, how do we
know if it stays?

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.940
Well, if we're still doing
it 100 years from now,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.165
it's going to stay.

00:22:07.165 --> 00:22:09.540
And that's the other interesting
thing about what's great

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.430
and what isn't.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:14.077
Chopin said in
the early days, he

00:22:14.077 --> 00:22:16.410
was playing a mazurka for
somebody, something like this.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:27.572
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:22:27.572 --> 00:22:29.030
And somebody who
was sitting there,

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.540
listening to him play this very
elegant dance, said to him, so,

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.427
is it good?

00:22:34.427 --> 00:22:35.510
And he said, I don't know.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.280
Ask me in 100 years.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.630
Because it's true.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.310
Time is really the
test for all of this.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.430
There's a reason
Shakespeare stuck around.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:44.930
And if you look
at all this stuff,

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.900
no matter what you're
looking at artistically,

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.863
we have today, artists
put out things.

00:22:50.863 --> 00:22:53.030
We have-- there are critics
who say, oh, it's great.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.530
It's the greatest thing, and
critics say, oh, it's terrible.

00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.680
And Debussy had his share
of both of those sides.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.320
Most people largely
hated what he did.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.870
They said it was an
abomination to music.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.520
For us to think
about something so

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.350
tame as being an
abomination to music

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.370
is really quite remarkable.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.320
But at the end of the
day, we don't know.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.860
The thing that seems to stay
in terms of your question

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.730
is if it touches any part of
our souls as human beings.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:22.550
If it touches our intellect, of
course there's something there.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.040
But if it touches our
souls, our sensibilities,

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.960
just the sense of feeling--

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.150
and I think feeling
is very important.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.030
And sometimes I worry that
we've lost sense of feeling,

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.920
especially the way the
world is going now,

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.970
the way people feel
to talk to each other.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.440
Does not anybody feel that there
is somebody on the other end,

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.260
you know?

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.400
There is a sense of
being aware of feeling,

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.930
and I think people
like Debussy--

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.240
crotchety as he was,
difficult as he was--

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.678
understood what it meant
to actually feel something.

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:52.220
Even though he couldn't express
it to the people in his life,

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.450
perhaps, as people
who knew him said,

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.310
oh, he was very much
in love with himself.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.143
And he was in love with
his little daughter,

00:23:58.143 --> 00:23:59.720
completely, madly
in love with her,

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.730
and he was in love
with his genius.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.060
But he understood how people
communicated and he understood

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.690
how they felt. And certainly
when it came to something

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.950
like "Pelleas et
Melisande," his opera,

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.780
he understood how
people interact.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.700
And it's interesting.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.230
I know somebody
very much like this.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:17.960
Put them in a room
and they can tell

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.610
you everything about every
interaction between the people

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.960
and how people feel.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.600
Ask him how he feels and
how he interacts himself,

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.550
he can't begin to even share it.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.820
It's a very interesting thing.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.070
I know a director like that.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.110
Fascinating to
watch him operate.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.090
He can look on a
script and tell you

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.890
how every character
is supposed to behave

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.050
to the deepest of their souls.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.720
Talk to him, it's like talking
to a wall, quite literally.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.370
So it's a very interesting
kind of thing how that works.

00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.130
I think music like
this will stay forever

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.950
for the simple reason that I
think it has the human element.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.890
It has a sense of humanity
that's not going to go away.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:57.200
Another question.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.920
How do different people react
to various influences in music

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.830
when it comes to music and
its cultural relationship?

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.970
That was very interesting.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:12.290
I was performing the Beethoven
in San Diego, three, four weeks

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.610
ago, whatever it was.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:19.190
And it was fascinating that
somebody in the audience

00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:25.580
took me to cast during this for
claiming that, in all of music,

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.170
nobody had ever composed
like this of Beethoven,

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.080
in all of music.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.400
And they accused me of
appropriating things.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.840
And I said, appropriating what?

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.140
Well, what about
African American music

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.420
and African music
and eastern music?

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.900
And then I thought about that.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.930
I said, one could
reshape that term

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.990
and say, in the history
of Western music.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.320
So the interesting thing about
Debussy, and this has been,

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:54.320
since you bring it up, on my
mind very much about what do we

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.540
react to in terms of
our-- because culturally

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.770
we're sensitized
to certain things--

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.270
is very interesting that a
lot of what Debussy drew on

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.490
were eastern influences.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.520
One of the things, he saw the
Javanese Gamelan Orchestra

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.060
at the 1889 Paris Exposition
for the first time.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.720
These were guys with shaved
heads and they wore robes

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.910
and they were sitting on
the floor, gongs and bells

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:17.690
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.107
And nobody had ever seen this
in the Western world before.

00:26:20.107 --> 00:26:21.523
And remember, it's
not like today.

00:26:21.523 --> 00:26:23.060
You make a click,
you see whatever.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.410
And this idea.

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:28.820
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:37.510
Using timbre and color
to actually create

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.450
the sound of the
Gamelan Orchestra.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.723
Now what's interesting here is
he uses the pentatonic scale.

00:26:49.723 --> 00:26:50.890
What's the pentatonic scale?

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:51.610
Five notes.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:55.170
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:26:55.170 --> 00:27:02.620
And it's interesting
how that sounds eastern,

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.390
and he does all these
beautiful colors with this.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.760
So now I have a question.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.900
You have [INAUDIBLE] by Debussy.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.930
You have many other
pieces by Debussy

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.570
that use this pentatonic
scale, the scale of the East,

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.030
that was brought to
the West by whenever

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.870
it was presented at the time.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.070
So is that cultural
appropriation

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.130
or is that homage?

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.260
And is homage OK?

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.240
So in terms of how
we react to things,

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.630
it's very interesting to
put Debussy in that box

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:35.830
and say, OK, well, did he use
all of these oriental colors--

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.840
and oriental doesn't
mean Asian in this case.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.920
Oriental means
really the Orient.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.730
It means Russian,
all those kinds

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:48.010
of colors with the open,
weird pentatonic colors.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.610
Did he appropriate that, or did
he find wonderful color in that

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:54.400
and translate it
into his own art?

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.850
And does he then owe royalties
to wherever he stole it from?

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.315
So there are so many
questions to ask here.

00:28:02.315 --> 00:28:03.940
But you know, you
ask the same question

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.290
of a guy like George Gershwin.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:06.340
OK, you have this.

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:11.170
[PIANO MUSIC]

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.600
So you have that guy.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.370
This is clearly a guy who
took African American music

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:28.550
and African American idioms
and basically cleaned it up.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.020
And by that I don't mean
made it pure or holy.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.040
He basically cleaned it up in
that he put it into a structure

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.780
so that it could fit
into a concert hall.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.410
In his day, they said he
made a lady out of jazz.

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:42.350
Today, I'm not so sure that
would be such an easy thing

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:45.420
to say or do because
we are looking at it

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.980
in-- you know, he
basically, essentially,

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.940
appropriated what was the
blues and put it into his music

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.890
and created an American music.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.680
So can we say of him
that that was an homage,

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.110
or that was outright
thievery, or is it right?

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:02.263
Is it wrong?

00:29:02.263 --> 00:29:04.430
We're now, I think, coming
to the point in the world

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.930
where we're starting to look
at these things very seriously.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.270
What belongs to whom?

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.830
What is allowed to be borrowed?

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:10.640
What is not?

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.450
What's correct?

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:12.022
What isn't?

00:29:12.022 --> 00:29:13.730
And I think these are
a lot of questions,

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:14.810
and they're important questions.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.580
I think for the
longest time, whoever

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:20.000
was running the business, they
said, my rules are the rules.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.500
But now we have to
look differently.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.640
I actually think
that's a great thing.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.750
But by the same token,
in the case of Debussy,

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:30.320
the culture that was around him
was not prepared, necessarily,

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.190
to accept what he was going
to give them so freely and so

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.540
easily, but the artist culture
was very much so interested

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.520
in these new colors
that he was opening,

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.350
and that's a fascinating thing.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.260
So in terms of how we
react to it culturally,

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.180
it's like anything.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.330
If we're familiar with
it, it's easier to accept.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:53.120
If we're not familiar with it,
we have to have an open mind

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.560
and wonder if we can
see other and have

00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.810
an emotional reaction to that.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:03.200
We're now becoming a
very interesting world--

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.600
because I get to tour a
lot and be around and see

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.710
a lot of people--

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:10.310
where that is being closed
off, where now what I am

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.620
is what I am and I'm not
interested in anybody else

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.030
or anything else or any other.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.530
I'm not interested in anything.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.480
That scares the living
daylights out of me.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.990
But for some people that's
the only way to live now.

00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:24.800
So all the questions
you're asking-- it's

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:29.980
very important, scary, and at
the same time, eye-opening.

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:34.070
And in the case of Debussy,
will the next generation

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.890
tell us that all that
stuff that he originated

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.860
is cultural appropriation and
we can't listen to it anymore?

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:41.910
I was just in Kentucky.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:45.740
I was performing the
Irving Berlin piece.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.980
And, of course, Irving Berlin
was a Russian immigrant.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:56.120
He was born in 1888, he came
over in 1893, saw Lady Liberty,

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.980
and gave us "God bless
America" and all the rest.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.020
So it's interesting.

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.540
Over there, the question
of Stephen Foster came up.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:06.040
Stephen Foster was
Irving Berlin's hero.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.010
Basically he said that the real
great American songwriter was

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:12.760
Stephen Foster, and he
was able to create based

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.650
on Stephen Foster's ideology.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.470
But now Stephen Foster is
coming under tremendous attack.

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:19.750
First of all, he'd
never been to the south.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.690
I think once on a boat, and I
don't even think he got off.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.490
So that's a fascinating thing.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:27.818
But if you look at
the lyrics of Doo-Dah

00:31:27.818 --> 00:31:29.360
and [INAUDIBLE] and
all these things,

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.170
they are much worse than
the verses that we sing.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:33.670
They're absolutely dreadful.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.140
They're unsingable.

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:38.060
And all the black-face
and so on and so forth.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.865
So the whole question
now comes to,

00:31:39.865 --> 00:31:43.330
is Stephen Foster-- do we take
all of that music and we say,

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:45.970
that's not American because
it's not an American value.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.300
I mean, this is big questions
that we have to deal with,

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.720
and because we have the internet
and because so many people can

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.387
talk to one another,
these are questions

00:31:54.387 --> 00:31:55.928
that we have to deal
with and I think

00:31:55.928 --> 00:31:57.280
the idea is to deal with them.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.580
So in terms of
culture, it affects.

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.370
It affects and it affects
very, very deeply.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.030
Another question, please.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:06.340
Yes.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.840
How much did being grouchy
allow Debussy to actually

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:13.000
be as creative as he was.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.830
Probably a whole lot.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.400
I think being miserable, finding
a way out of being miserable,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.120
this was his way out
of being miserable.

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.340
He went to his art.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.170
But it wasn't just
that he was grouchy.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.640
I think he was an
uncomfortable personality.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.240
First of all, as a kid,
we learned about Debussy

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.620
that his parents--

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.370
he was the eldest.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.953
They didn't pay much
attention to him,

00:32:31.953 --> 00:32:34.060
so they don't really
care about him at all.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.130
Then he finds himself
being a pianist.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:37.473
He goes to the conservatoire.

00:32:37.473 --> 00:32:38.890
They tell him at
the conservatoire

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.807
he doesn't have much
talent, that he's never--

00:32:40.807 --> 00:32:41.740
He keeps on trying.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.360
He keeps on getting second rate.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.940
He then wins the
[FRENCH] in France

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:50.320
and he goes to Italy and studies
in Italy and creates in Italy,

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.580
and he can't stand that there.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.230
In fact, he can't
stand it anywhere.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.940
He's constantly
looking for his place.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.040
And I think the constantly
looking for his place

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:01.090
and the way he fits in is
why he composes in the colors

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:04.470
that he does, because it allows
him to create a world of sound

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.670
and a world of music
that makes sense to him,

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.080
and it's a place
for him to live.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.542
He can feel comfortable.

00:33:09.542 --> 00:33:12.000
And I have to tell you, in the
world that we're in, I too--

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.375
and I think all
of us-- we're all

00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:16.990
looking for what it is we do
that allows us to feel safe

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:19.060
and allows us to feel
whole and allows us not

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:20.800
to feel frightened
and threatened

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.030
by the world around us.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.170
In his case, it's music.

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:25.690
In my case, it's this
and telling stories.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.340
And we're all
looking-- in your case,

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.142
it's creating what it is
you do every single day.

00:33:30.142 --> 00:33:30.850
Another question.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.170
Yes.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.060
Well, what do I
think about living

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:37.690
in this world where we can do
so many things with machines?

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:39.850
Well, essentially,
this is a machine.

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.920
It's a machine with its limits.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:45.370
Today machines are
much less limited.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.980
The interesting
thing is, if we look

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.480
at the history of
the piano, so you

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.910
have the original
clavichord, and then you

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.640
had the harpsichord
that plucked--

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.790
a funny sound.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.490
Then you had the
clavichord and then

00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:00.370
you had the piano
forte, which hit a note.

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.440
None of it sounds like this.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.160
Essentially what we're doing, of
any of this, if you played Bach

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.310
or if you played
Beethoven, this does not

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.300
sound at all what it sounded
like on Beethoven's piano.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.300
I've played one of them.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.425
It doesn't sound like this.

00:34:14.425 --> 00:34:16.090
It doesn't have these colors.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:17.139
Not whatsoever.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:20.610
Chopin's piano doesn't
sound like this.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:21.810
This is far too rich.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:26.400
Chopin's piano had this
airy, light, silvery tone.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.510
We try and create that
on this instrument,

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:30.659
we try and make it sound
beautiful, but believe me,

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:33.870
it sounds nothing like a real
[INAUDIBLE] in Chopin's day,

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:36.050
which had this kind
of mystical sounds.

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.150
So to answer your question, if
these guys, these inventors,

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.159
would be around, I
think they would tap you

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.130
for every single thing
that you could possibly

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:45.989
give to them as an inventor.

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:48.659
To create new and more--

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:50.580
you can't look at a
guy like Debussy, who

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.710
changed the entire
world of music

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:56.280
and how color is sound, and
say, he'd come to Google

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.690
and say, oh, terrible people.

00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:58.890
They have digital sound.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:00.360
It's awful.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:03.780
He'd want to know everything
about how to use that sound,

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.310
how to manipulate it, in
order to make color and make

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:11.590
the world sound beautiful.

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:14.010
I think it's interesting.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.818
As a pianist who likes
to deal with this

00:35:15.818 --> 00:35:16.860
and not play a keyboard--

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:17.830
I don't like to play keyboard.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.872
It has a lot to do with
the sound that comes out,

00:35:19.872 --> 00:35:23.400
but also the immediacy,
because when I do this,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.080
it's an immediate
action, you see?

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.350
When I'm doing it digitally,
what it has to go through

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:29.437
is quite a bit different.

00:35:29.437 --> 00:35:31.770
And yet here you have the
escapement, you have the push,

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:33.000
you have the shove,
you have the color,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.958
you have all these things,
you have the string,

00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:36.120
so it's still a machine.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.000
But there, there seems
to be one extra step that

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
removes it from being
slightly human, so to speak.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.210
So I don't know how
they'd react to that.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.150
I personally find digital music
and things that we can create

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.280
and the kinds of color
of sound amazing.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.290
It's a staggering thing.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.510
What is confusing
and complicated

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.790
for me is taking
a piece by Debussy

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.070
that was intended for
particular instruments,

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.800
digitizing them as if
that's the real thing.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.740
That's not the case.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:03.740
It's not the real thing.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.030
The real thing is essentially
what he composed for.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.390
It's a transcription.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:11.220
But it is very interesting
to create new things

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.710
with the real thing
with these instruments,

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.480
with these wonderful, digital
colors that we can use.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.480
And people are doing it.

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.010
They're doing it every day.

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:22.260
The interesting thing for
me is we're living in a time

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.790
where there is so much sound.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.320
There is so much influence.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.600
What's sound that's
going to be new?

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.700
What is the sound
to us that's going

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.400
to be a sound that's going
to be new that we have never

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.370
heard before?

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:37.110
When are we going to
hear a Debussy come up

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.580
with something--

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:44.140
[PIANO MUSIC]

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.960
--that sounds so
romantic and so sensual?

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.130
When are we going to hear that
that just moves us in that way?

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:06.630
And what is it going
to be based on?

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.700
Is it going to be
based on the notes

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.220
that we know, 12 tone scales
and so on and so forth?

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.110
Or is it going to be
based on something

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.990
that we don't even know and
hasn't been invented yet?

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.990
What will the human ear
tell us that is necessary

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.950
as time goes on?

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:21.732
We don't know.

00:37:21.732 --> 00:37:22.440
Another question.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.635
Yes.

00:37:23.635 --> 00:37:25.260
They have more tools,
they invent less,

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:25.990
and why do I think that?

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.823
I don't think it's that
they have more tools

00:37:27.823 --> 00:37:31.210
and they invent less, but if
you look at the line of history,

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:34.180
we can go all the way back to
the very beginnings of Corelli

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.500
and [INAUDIBLE] and all these
types, and at the same time

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.600
you have Bach and then
you'll have Beethoven

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.220
and then you have Brahms.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:43.710
Well, you're looking at,
basically, a straight line.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:45.870
Sometimes they cross.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.120
There's Chopin at
a period and Liszt

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.140
and then Schubert
just at the beginning.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.580
And then you look
who comes next.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:52.890
You have a little bit somebody.

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.932
But what are you looking?

00:37:53.932 --> 00:37:55.830
You count here,
and you count here.

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:57.310
You use your feet.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:58.920
And then you count
maybe again here.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.490
30, 40, 50.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.830
You're talking about
tens of thousands

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:05.660
of composers over years.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.990
And basically my theory is
time is the great decider

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:10.610
of what's good and what's not.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.740
So thousands and
thousands of composers

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.490
have done this inventing, but
only the great ones stayed.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:18.410
So when you ask,
why are we seeing

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:20.630
so many more tools and
so much less invention,

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:22.200
I don't believe we are.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.900
I only think we can
know what invention

00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.520
is in 100 years from now.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.920
And perhaps somebody is
composing in some room

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.890
somewhere, doing something
absolutely fascinating,

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:34.280
but at the same time, we're
not exposed to it yet.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.240
We don't know.

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:39.510
In 100 years, hopefully, we will
know what our great music is.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.390
And the truth is,
we don't know now.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.600
Will it be Hamilton?

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.860
I don't know.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.360
Hamilton is a lot of stuff.

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.630
I find it fascinating.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.550
It's a phenomenon.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.140
But it's a lot of
stuff-- admittedly,

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.350
by the composer-- that is drawn
from stuff that's immediately

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:55.160
before it and there's
also quotations that

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.350
were immediately before it.

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:59.590
It's not particularly
new in that way.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:03.160
So all of this to say
that we just don't know

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:03.940
who's inventing.

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:07.600
Somebody in this building could
be inventing some kind of music

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.940
that one day will
be discovered and we

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.030
will be able to see as
being absolutely remarkable.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:14.888
We don't know yet.

00:39:14.888 --> 00:39:15.680
Just a couple more.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:16.530
Yes.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:19.985
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:19.985 --> 00:39:22.360
AUDIENCE: What do you think
about artificial intelligence

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.740
creating music?

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.420
HERSHEY FELDER: What
do I think about--

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:30.550
well, sometimes I wonder if I
have artificial intelligence.

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.680
What do I think about artificial
intelligence creating music?

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.870
The question to you is,
because I don't know this,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:42.270
is artificial intelligence as
smart as its creator or not?

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.250
Does artificial
intelligence actually

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:47.800
have a life of its own, or it
doesn't have a life of its own?

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.670
And to me, I don't know
how artificial intelligence

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:54.520
would have a sense of humanity
beyond the creator behind it.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:58.290
So if that's the
case, then why not

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.930
just be human and create music.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.880
I'm not against
artificial intelligence.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.220
I think it's a
wonderful thing that

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.690
needs to be
controlled and managed

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:08.935
by very smart people,
because ultimately,

00:40:08.935 --> 00:40:11.310
if you don't control something
like that it could get out

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:12.780
of hand, as we know.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.790
So could that mean
that, all of a sudden,

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:19.230
we have great composers who
are artificial intelligence?

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.750
The only amount of
artificial intelligence

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.640
that could do that
would be drawing

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.960
on real intelligence
that came before it,

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.343
and so we'd probably only hear
repetitious stuff because--

00:40:29.343 --> 00:40:30.510
but you know, how do I know?

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:30.910
I don't know.

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:31.800
It's not my field.

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.040
But I'd like to believe
that human beings still

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.080
have the height on that.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:39.780
Anyway.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.905
It's one or two more and
then I'll do some playing.

00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:43.290
Yes.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:47.130
AUDIENCE: So on Debussy in
particular, did he view himself

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.190
as a part of the avant garde
or was he just a composer

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:51.278
that critics didn't like?

00:40:51.278 --> 00:40:53.820
HERSHEY FELDER: Was he a part
of the avant garde or something

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.230
that critics didn't like?

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:58.180
I think Debussy viewed
himself as an inventor.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.580
He viewed himself
as somebody who

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.280
wanted the old guard-- he said,
this whole symphonic thing,

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.140
this whole approach
to music, needs

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:06.120
to end because it's boring.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.140
It's structured.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.070
It's full of rules.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.180
It's full of laws.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.320
And we're done with it.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.910
It's enough.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.100
And he wanted to
invent something new,

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.407
and that whole circle, the
group of them-- the poets,

00:41:16.407 --> 00:41:18.990
the symbolists, and so on-- he
looked to them for inspiration.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.490
That didn't come out of nowhere.

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:24.730
Musically, coloristically, I
think it came out of his mind.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:27.380
But in terms of the concept,
of the cultural concepts

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.090
surrounding him, it didn't
come out of nowhere.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:32.550
It came out of a whole group
of people who were looking

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.320
for new ways to tell stories.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.690
As he said, the world
relied for far too long

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.210
on the bloody Germans
for the good music.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:40.930
It was time to change that.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:42.370
And that's exactly what he did.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.340
He changed it, and
he created what

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.950
was a French color
and a French sound.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.370
Listening to Debussy, he is
as avant garde as they go.

00:41:50.370 --> 00:41:52.960
There are crazy things that
he does that even Ravel--

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.370
a totally different aesthetic
and also a modernist in that

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:56.880
way--

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.910
didn't even begin to
attempt what Debussy did.

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.800
He really went as
far as possible

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.750
in terms of using emotional
output to just create music,

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:11.130
and I think he viewed
himself as a new composer

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:14.640
in a very classical sense,
if that makes sense.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:15.690
Yes.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.060
AUDIENCE: So if you
think about Debussy,

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:19.300
two things stand out to me.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.710
One is that the feedback
loop, the time between when

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:25.030
he made something and when
he got feedback on it,

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:26.715
was quite long,
and also the number

00:42:26.715 --> 00:42:28.590
of people that he would
have had contact with

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:32.310
was relatively limited, like
tens of people in his circle.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:35.250
Compared to today,
a musician, not only

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.600
do they have contact
to billions of people,

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.320
but when they put something out,
they get feedback immediately.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.860
How do you think that
impacts the creation process,

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.520
and do you think that's
pressuring music in a way

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.857
that it wouldn't have been
pressured in Debussy's time?

00:42:50.857 --> 00:42:53.190
HERSHEY FELDER: Well, in terms
of that, I think nowadays

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:56.670
it's a very complicated thing
because people can become

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:59.190
stars, on YouTube or
whatever it else it is,

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.500
or on "American Idol"
or whatever chat show

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.920
or so on and so forth, by not
really having the lifetime

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.070
of effort put into it because
we look at it in a box.

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:11.160
If that box works
for us, that's great.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.440
How many careers,
potential great artists,

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:15.360
have been destroyed by
getting there too early

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.568
because they had pretty
faces or because somehow they

00:43:17.568 --> 00:43:19.470
sounded good, and
they really weren't

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:21.510
ready with all that
work that needs to go

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.445
in it to make it really great?

00:43:23.445 --> 00:43:25.290
The answer to
that, I don't know.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.120
What would Debussy do?

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.860
I think he'd be
horrified, quite frankly,

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.120
if he had to put something
out there and not

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.820
be able to go in and fix, not
be able to go in and rework,

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.920
not be able to go in
and look how it went,

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.420
not be able to struggle with it
to make it really, truly great.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.870
Now the great things are
that we have tools to fix.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.640
We have auto tuning things.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.380
We have colors and
sounds that we can

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.510
cover all this kind of stuff.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:54.580
I think it's all part of
the way the world is going.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.340
But I think it's
also very important

00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:00.090
not to forget the huge amounts
of work that must go in

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:02.700
to really creating something
that is really great

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.410
and will have staying power.

00:44:04.410 --> 00:44:05.580
Debussy understood that.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.407
Any great artist
understands that.

00:44:07.407 --> 00:44:09.240
And I think all of you
here understand that,

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.920
sitting in front of your
computers doing your work.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.440
It doesn't just appear and,
OK, let it out to the world

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:16.230
and it's fine and that's it.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.205
You want to go back in.

00:44:17.205 --> 00:44:18.330
You want to make it better.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:22.275
You constantly want to push the
envelope so that your output is

00:44:22.275 --> 00:44:24.030
as best as it can
be, and I don't

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.230
think there's any
alternative to that.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.500
And I think they were just
luckier in that they didn't

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.630
have this kind of access.

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:33.130
Going back to George
Gershwin, who I mentioned,

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.250
I think one of the big
problems with him was--

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:36.960
he was a great
composer, no doubt.

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.670
He had very much to say.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:41.850
But he became famous so young,
and he became so popular

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:46.180
so young, and he said very
early on, I want to be famous.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.600
I want to be famous.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.940
So he composed things
that made him famous.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:54.870
Would he have been a greater
composer if there wasn't radio?

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.390
He was the one who,
basically, was essentially

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.540
one of the first to get his
music played across the nation.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.107
So when you heard
stuff like this--

00:45:03.107 --> 00:45:06.590
[PLAYING NOTES]

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:09.950
--it wasn't United Airlines.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:17.120
It was Gershwin playing 1927
Rudy Valley radio show, or WSJ

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.100
or whatever it was in
New York, being heard

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.558
all over the country at once.

00:45:20.558 --> 00:45:22.850
That was the first time that
such a thing could happen.

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:26.300
Imagine, the first
time the entire country

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.610
heard this together.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:34.460
Or when Kate Smith sang
that, the whole country

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.530
was able to hear it
on the radio together.

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:39.440
But 25 years before that,
even 20 years before that,

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.470
such a thing could not happen.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.120
And so it was, as
you say, limited.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:47.060
So the world has opened
up to such a degree.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.730
The converse problem is that
now everybody's a judge.

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:52.940
Everybody is judge,
jury, and everything.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.950
So you open up your
stuff to the world,

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:56.780
and you can be
finished in two seconds

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:00.170
because too many people give
the like or give the don't like

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.522
or whatever it is.

00:46:01.522 --> 00:46:02.480
Does that make it good?

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.620
Does that make it bad?

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.180
It doesn't make it anything.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.180
It just makes the people
sitting at the computer

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:09.230
and this is what they push.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:10.760
Who gives it that much thought?

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.740
This, there was thought.

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.070
Then again, Debussy
had terrible critics.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:15.770
They hated him.

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.580
They said the worst
things about him.

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.950
So is it any different?

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:19.755
No.

00:46:19.755 --> 00:46:21.380
And then it was
printed in a newspaper,

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.840
so everybody read in
Paris, that for the 200

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:25.400
people there at
the concert, this

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.485
was the worst experience ever.

00:46:27.485 --> 00:46:28.610
They said of his "Le Mer"--

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:31.370
I love this quote.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:32.300
"Le Mer," the ocean.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:32.840
"They came.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.520
They were expecting
something huge,

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.670
something big,
something colossal.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:41.660
And all they got was a little
agitated water in a bowl."

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:46.170
So that then got quoted and
that went all over the place

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.560
and it got reprinted in
newspaper to newspaper.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.250
It just took a
little bit longer.

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:53.200
But the truth is, I do
believe that if it is great,

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.430
and if it above all
is human, then it

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:58.280
will remain, because that's
the only thing that ties us

00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.450
and the world together.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:02.480
If we can connect to each other
on some level and it makes

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.230
us feel.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:05.690
If it doesn't make us
feel, it's worthless.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:07.640
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:10.100
And the last one,
and then I'll play.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:10.770
There we go.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.470
Yeah.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.300
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
Ravel a moment ago.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.480
Can you briefly compare
Ravel and Debussy.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.500
HERSHEY FELDER: Yes.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.882
Ravel and Debussy are two very
interesting characters, sort

00:47:21.882 --> 00:47:23.090
of crossing at the same time.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:27.993
Ravel lived longer and
Ravel was very elegant.

00:47:27.993 --> 00:47:29.660
You look at Ravel and
you think, there's

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.330
a modern, elegant Frenchman.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:35.750
You think the Belle Epoque,
'20s, '30s, hair slicked back,

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:39.120
beautifully appointed,
so elegantly dressed.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.450
Debussy felt like he
was a bit of a remnant

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:45.570
from the late 1800s, and
yet at the same time,

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:46.580
he was so modern.

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.590
If you ask me, I
think these aesthetics

00:47:48.590 --> 00:47:51.560
are completely different,
completely, completely,

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.070
different.

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:56.300
However, there are things
that relate in each of them.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.370
They use similar colors.

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:01.910
Ravel is considered
a jewel worker.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.620
He goes in there
with his little tools

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:07.700
and he corrects his diamond
until it's 100% perfect.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.710
Debussy is a wild animal.

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:11.840
Sometimes the music
is just simple

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.400
and it's expressive and so on.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.460
Ravel, it's in the construction.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:17.840
It's in the architecture.

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.510
It's in the miracle
of what that is.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:22.760
Debussy-- for me.

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.170
I speak only for me--

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:27.350
somehow is a much
broader emotion.

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:31.580
Ravel describes things
musically, aesthetically, very

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:32.210
elegantly.

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:33.640
It's all proper.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:37.560
Debussy is slightly
unhinged in all ways.

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.710
It's a little bit more open.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:41.570
Ravel uses many more
notes than the Debussy.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:42.840
He feels the need to.

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.880
Lots of notes.

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:44.390
Do you play?

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:45.530
No?

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.240
Ravel is just so many notes.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.620
Debussy uses a lot of notes.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.630
Ravel uses times
five, and you always

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.520
wonder why he needs
so many notes.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.550
Well, it's because that's how
he accomplishes his goals.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.010
But it's really a
fascinating thing to listen.

00:48:58.010 --> 00:49:01.000
I'll bid you farewell with
just a little Debussy piece.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.630
It's something
that's so familiar.

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:04.730
It's the thing that
actually, people

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:08.380
say, really changed piano
music and so on and so forth.

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:12.230
It's something I've loved, a
very special piece, something

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:13.690
that every kid plays.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:17.630
But it's amazing how he
captured what he captured in it.

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:20.930
