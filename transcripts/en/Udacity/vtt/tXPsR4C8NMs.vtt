00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.680
Choosing the right editor can be tricky
due to the overwhelming options and

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.490
religious developer battles.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.550
It's almost as bad as the ongoing
battle of taps versus basis, or

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.890
semicolon haters and lovers.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.610
I'm making it super easy for you.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.650
In this course,
we'll stick to Sublime text three.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.190
&gt;&gt; So out of all the choices out there,
why are we going with Sublime?

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.690
&gt;&gt; Well it's simple.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.810
Sublime is four to five times more
popular than the competition.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.860
It's extendable, fast, and
very well supported by our community.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.940
For free alternatives check
out GitHub's Atom editor.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.530
It builds on a similar
plugin architecture.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.590
It's the new kid on the block, and
it's getting better every day.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.800
In the end, I won't be offended if
you decide to use another editor.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.970
As long as you stay away from Notepad.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.710
Just make sure it's fast enough,
can be extended with functionality, and

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.960
is well supported and stable.
