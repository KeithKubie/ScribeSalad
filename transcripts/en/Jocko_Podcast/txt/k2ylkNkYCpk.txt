Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm a chef in a large operation kitchen. I'm second in command overseeing a large kitchen staff and part of a five person management team overseeing thing to entire account. Recently during my last review I was given some advice by my boss and his boss. I'm unsure about my last two annual reviews have gone very well and I'm on the rise in the company. However, they said if it was important for me to get or heat Harvard, they said it was important for me to give up some of my kitchen dog mentality and work to showcase my artistic side and embrace more of a star role in the spotlight, get out of the kitchen a bit more, gain more exposure. Specifically with our high profile clients. While I appreciate their sentiment and respect their big management skills, their style isn't one I strive to emulate or feel would work for me and the way I operate. I've always approached my work is more of a craft than an art and I've always like being a trench dug with my team. My team responds to it and I get results for the business and I feel the results should speak for themselves. It has propelled my career rapidly through thus far. So why would I want to change and be something I'm not? Should I heed their advice or stick to what I do best and keep getting after it on my terms?

Speaker 2:          01:23          Ah, it's one of those questions. It's just funny how, how that last statement is framed, right? Should I stick to what I do best and keep getting after it as if to say, if you say no, you should not stick to what you do best and you should not get after it. Right. That's, that's the frame there. And actually this guy, I answered the question real tersely. I think this came through Facebook messages. I, you know, I said, uh, sounds like you found a comfortable zone for yourself and you want to stay in their little cold blooded response. And he's like, ah, I knew it because as we know in the comfort zone, there's, there was no growth in the comfort zone. So it's interesting this guy is actually getting some, some good solid and straight forward advice from up the chain of command. Uh, plus I think if they have him as more of a personality than the restaurant will do better and they're trying to build their reputation and your reputation at the same time.

Speaker 2:          02:25          And that seems pretty reasonable to me. Right. And I'm not real familiar with the restaurant business, but I'm familiar enough to know if you've got a good reputation with the staff that works at the restaurant. It brings in more people, like there's no doubt about it, the, the relationship, just like any other business, the relationship that you build with the customers strengthens them, strengthens that relationship and makes them want to come back for more. Right. That's the way it works. And so for them to say to you, hey man, hey, you know, you're a good cook. We get that, but we need a little bit more. We want a little bit chef. We need somebody that has, yeah, chef. Sorry. You're good. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. You're a good chef. Well, actually what I think I might've actually purposely said that like, hey, you're doing a good job in the kitchen as a cook.

Speaker 2:          03:16          We don't need someone that's just cooking the food. We need a chef with a reputation with a personality, right? Yeah. There's a difference there, right? Yes sir. So it was called out for reason. Gotcha. He's happy and you can see like kitchen dog. Yeah. He's proud of that. Right. And I get that man, I get that. I get that. Like you're one of the boys, you're back in the, in the grind. Well let me, let me ask you this or let me make this statement. Guess what you have to do as a CEO, as a CEO leader, guess what you have to do? You have to build relationships. You have to make your commanding officer trust you. You have to build relationships with the army. You have to build relationships with Marine Corps. You have to end. In order to do that, you have to like raise your, you have to call a little bit of attention to yourself and raise your hand and say, Hey, this is who I am.

Speaker 2:          04:05          You have to take, this is who I am. You have to actually have to step into the spotlight a little bit so that you can let people know who you are. Because if people don't know who you are, how do you have a relationship with you? And if you don't have relationship with people, how can they trust you? So, so that's part of it, right? That's part of what they're asking you to do. Now, in all seriousness, if if you really don't want to do it, well then you can keep being the guy that's in the back and guess what? You're going to be mad in six months when some other chef gets hired for a different shift than all of a sudden he's out making friends with everyone and he gets promoted. And why does it get promoted? Well, look what the guy's doing, but he's not as good as, he's not as good as a cook as I am.

Speaker 2:          04:52          Guess what? They don't really care. Being making the food is only part of what they want you to do. Just like being a seal. Doing, doing missions is only part of what they, what you need to do to do the mission. You can't just be tactically sound. You've got to have the relationships built so you can work in the battlespace that's owned by a conventional commander. You got to have the relationship that you can get. Your mission's approved up the chain of command on the special operations side. How do you do that? You build, you go out, you talk to people, you get out of your comfort zone. It's a weird thing, you know? I'm kind of, I'm kind of antisocial, right? Like if you don't know me, we're not going to have a conversation. You know? Like we're not having a, I'm like, it's not, I'm not, I'm not walking up and talking to you if I don't know you.

Speaker 2:          05:43          I'm not walking up and saying hi to you. It's not happening. It's not my personality. If you say hi to me, I'll say hi. I'm not disrespectful, I'm not rude, but I'm not looking to have a bunch of conversations with people and so that's known to me, but that's not okay for the business side of my life, which is, hey, I got to talk to people gotta build relationships. Got It. To had to know my commanding officer had to know, the commodore, had to know the, the, the conventional battalion commander had to know the brigade commander had to build relationships. Could I just talk about the war with the brigade commander? Well I could, but what's more powerful that I talk about war and I talk about where I'm from or where he's from or what, you know, other things. Yes. Cause I want to build a relationship with why?

Speaker 2:          06:36          Because I'm trying to build trust. Wah. Why? Because I want him to allow me to go out there and do things in his battle space. So that's what they're asking you. They're asking you to step out of your comfort zone. It doesn't need to become your primary focus. No. Should you try and step out of the comfort zone if you want to grow, if you want to have more opportunity, I would give it a try. I would give it a try. If not, you know, like I said, if you hate it and you feel like you're not being true to your true self, that's okay. Maybe your true self is meant to be the one that's back not getting promoted. Yeah. They need somebody to do that. If it's not you, it might be somebody else. Yeah. So another one of those tough questions where people, you know, hit me with like, should I just be, should I be loyal to myself because the obvious answer that everyone wants to hear is like, yeah, dude, two most important things.

Speaker 2:          07:30          You've got to be loyal to yourself. That's the most important thing. Okay. If that's what your priority is, then that's the most important thing. But guess what? Who does, uh, who can take care of the other kitchen dogs that respect you so much, who can take better care of them then you can cause if you get promoted, if you don't get promoted. And, and Johnny Glamour boy gets promoted because he's likes to go out and Schmooze the clients and now he gets promoted and years and now who's going to take care of the kitchen dogs on his, on his time, right? Not Him. He doesn't care. He's got, he got promoted not for taking care of his guys. He got promoted because he smooths the clients. Play the game a little bit.
