00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.945
For two weeks this February,
the infinity chili pepper

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:07.591
held the world record
for being the hottest pepper on Earth;

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:11.631
so dangerous, it was hotter
than the chemicals used in hand grenades

00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:13.631
by the Indian military.

00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:17.761
But is the infinity chili pepper
the best hot pepper of all time?

00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:20.361
Not anymore—
to find out why,

00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:22.428
all aboard the BOAT.

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:26.906
Let's begin
with what makes hot peppers hot—

00:00:26.906 --> 00:00:29.019
a chemical called capsaicin.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.664
It's not acidic or anything—
in fact, it's an alkaline oil,

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:34.754
and the unique shape
of the molecule

00:00:34.754 --> 00:00:37.865
means that it does
some pretty weird things to mammals.

00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:41.162
Mammals have a specific type
of nerve cell that detects pain

00:00:41.162 --> 00:00:45.040
from heat and abrasion—
now, what's weird about capsaicin

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.153
is that it will attach
to those receptors

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:49.498
and cause calcium ions
to flow in,

00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:53.329
making us think
that we're burning or that we're injured,

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.329
and that's why hot peppers
are hot.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.623
The heat of a pepper is measured
in Scoville Heat Units.

00:00:58.623 --> 00:01:02.872
The basic way they calculate this
is by seeing how much you have to dilute

00:01:02.872 --> 00:01:06.610
an extract of the pepper
before nobody can taste it

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.610
in a glass of sugar water.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.067
Coming in at zero Scoville heat units
are things like bell peppers,

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:14.067
which have no noticeable heat.

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:16.896
Between 100 and 500,
you'll find things like banana peppers

00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:19.009
and the little pimentos
inside olives.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.353
Jalapenos and Tabasco sauce
can rate as high

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:26.300
as 8,000 Scoville heat units,
but habaneros

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.410
can rate as high
as 350,000.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.591
But that's just kid stuff—
at the beginning of this episode,

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:37.283
I mentioned the infinity chili,
which for two weeks in February

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:39.721
was the world record holder
for hottest pepper,

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:42.646
but then in the middle of February,
a man in the UK

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:46.802
named Gerald Fowler cross-bred
two of the hottest peppers on Earth,

00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:50.002
the Bhut Jolokia
and the Naga Morich,

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:54.785
to create a child pepper
that he called the Naga Viper.

00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:59.081
Laboratories tested the pepper
and found that on the Scoville scale,

00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:02.447
it ranked in
at 1.3 million,

00:02:02.447 --> 00:02:06.441
making it the current world record holder
for hottest pepper on Earth,

00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:08.441
but the race continues.

00:02:08.441 --> 00:02:10.128
Just a couple of months ago,
a new strain

00:02:10.128 --> 00:02:14.888
of the Trinidad Scorpion emerged,
simply called Butch T.

00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:17.450
A lab that tested it found
that it ranked

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.793
at 1.4 million Scoville Heat Units—

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:23.482
so hot that in order to cook with it,
the cultivators

00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:26.059
had to wear chemical masks
and body suits

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:28.683
and felt numbness in their hands
for more than two days.

00:02:28.683 --> 00:02:32.537
When its measurements become official,
it will be the reigning champ

00:02:32.537 --> 00:02:34.952
for hottest pepper,
but let's stop talking

00:02:34.952 --> 00:02:38.249
about edible peppers
and move on to things that are weapons.

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.593
1.4 million Scoville Heat Units—
please.

00:02:41.593 --> 00:02:44.797
Law enforcement-grade pepper spray
clocks in

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:47.281
at 5.5 million.

00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:49.483
[spraying sounds]
[coughing sounds]

00:02:49.483 --> 00:02:55.329
And pure capsaicin is so dangerous,
it has its own fire diamond warning code in the US.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.832
On the scale, pure capsaicin sits
way up at 16 million.

00:03:00.832 --> 00:03:02.832
Oh, but we're not even done there.

00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:07.148
Capsaicin can't get any hotter,
but it does have molecular analogs

00:03:07.148 --> 00:03:09.148
that are more dangerous.

00:03:09.148 --> 00:03:12.140
The resin spurge is a cactus
found in Morocco.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.112
It's not a pepper,
and it doesn't contain capsaicin,

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:18.269
but it does contain
a waxy latex substance

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.099
that works just like capsaicin,
except 1,000 times more efficiently.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.653
It's called resiniferatoxin.

00:03:25.653 --> 00:03:29.856
Just like capsaicin,
resiniferatoxin attaches to those cells

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:33.269
responsible for feeling abrasion
and heat pain,

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.636
but instead of stimulating them
by letting a little bit of calcium in,

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:41.117
it lets so much calcium in
that the nerve cell walls break

00:03:41.117 --> 00:03:43.230
and the cell dies.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.691
What this means
is that resiniferatoxin

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:49.708
is so hot,
it actually doesn't always cause pain.

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:53.353
It'll just cause the death of cells
that make you feel pain.

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:55.353
For this reason,
doctors have found

00:03:55.353 --> 00:03:59.785
that if they inject doses
of resiniferatoxin into the spinal cords of dogs

00:03:59.785 --> 00:04:02.432
suffering pain because
of terminal bone cancer,

00:04:02.432 --> 00:04:05.892
those dogs will feel no pain
and be able to play

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:08.098
and frolic for months afterwards.

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:10.098
So what are you waiting for?

00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:13.182
Get out there and order
some jalapeno poppers and feel the heat.

00:04:13.182 --> 00:04:16.712
Speaking of the heat,
I'm going to be in Miami this weekend.

00:04:16.712 --> 00:04:20.613
In fact, I'm probably flying there right now—
Kevin helped me upload this video.

00:04:20.613 --> 00:04:23.027
Next week, we've got
some really awesome stuff.

00:04:23.027 --> 00:04:28.275
IMG, Loot, and a new episode
of Vsauce Lean Back I'm very excited about.

00:04:28.275 --> 00:04:31.618
So stay tuned, and as always,
thanks for watching.
