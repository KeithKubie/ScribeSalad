00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.280
Now, are there actually better examples of ancestry composition? I mean.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.310
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.830
&gt;&gt; I feel like mine's pretty homogenous.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.540
&gt;&gt; I'd love for you to pull up the, the results for a friend of mine Roy King.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.210
&gt;&gt; Holy cow.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.970
&gt;&gt; Who, now, Roy understands that his

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.490
ancestry traces to Europe, to Africa. and that

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.180
he has some Native American ancestry. And when

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.860
we look at his results here, we see,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.730
look, even Chromosome one has multiple colors. It has

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.310
the red, the light blue, and a darker blue. And

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.330
the darker blue there refers to Ash, Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.900
And Roy knows that his father's father was, was Jewish.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.561
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.750
&gt;&gt; And so, if we go back to map view.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.250
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:51.480
&gt;&gt; we'll see that, about getting

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.340
close to a quarter of Roy's ancestry traces back to the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.160
Ashkenazi Jewish population. And that fits with his, one of his

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.970
grandfathers being Ashkenazi Jewish. And if we look at the rest

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.235
of his ancestry, almost half of this is back to sub-saharan Africa.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:11.009
[CROSSTALK]

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.277
The red ring here, and the rest traces back to

00:01:14.277 --> 00:01:19.860
Northern Europe, specifically Britan and Ireland. Now, what is really

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.280
cool is that we have these bars right here. And

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.560
if we look over, if you click on a native american.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.933
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:32.110
&gt;&gt; So those orange and deep red bars refer

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.929
to parts of the genome that trace back to

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.084
Native Americans. And and,

00:01:40.084 --> 00:01:45.810
intriguingly Roy King knows that on his mother's side,

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.780
he has ancestors, acreek and Chocta ancestors. So that is a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.880
showing up in his DNA. So basically you know, his understanding of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.070
where his ancestors come from really shows that very beautifully in his DNA.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.380
&gt;&gt; Right, he has a much more interesting genetic background than I do.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.648
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:04.648 --> 00:02:05.900
&gt;&gt; From many different parts of the world.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.050
&gt;&gt; And that is important. Even when we go to look at the health

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.620
results, the health reports are all done

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.580
in the context of a particular population.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.730
So, it's very important to kind of be clear on the ancestral background of,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.260
of someone as we go to look at the other parts of their results.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.870
&gt;&gt; Great.
