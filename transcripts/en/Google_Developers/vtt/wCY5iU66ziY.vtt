JAMIL MOLEDINA: I'm Jamil
Moledina from Google Play

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.560
business development leading
game strategic partnerships

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.670
as well as sourcing the
Android TV portfolio.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.730
It's really great to
be back here at GDC

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.130
talking about we've been
working on on Android TV.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.480
The platform brings together
the Android L operating system

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.340
and Google Play to
the living room,

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.609
where people spend five to six
hours per day per household.

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.650
Android TV helps you get
there because we already

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.980
have your community business
and product on Google Play.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.760
Right now, smart
TVs are fragmented.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.810
Since Android TV
is a platform, you

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.060
get to get there all at once.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.620
Now at the same time,
we've designed the platform

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.320
to make it simple for you to
adapt your existing Android

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.790
game to Android TV
through a manifest update

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.040
and guidance on adapting the
design to the new form factor.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.770
It's a bigger leap than
going from phone to tablet.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.489
And at the same time
it's not the same--

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.630
it's not exactly the same.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.350
You have to think about what
inputs are going to work.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.260
You've made your game
for touch, but how

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.740
do you navigate in-game?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.730
How do you scroll around
your game universe?

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.510
Also, can the game
scale visually?

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.540
Can the UI?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.940
Here's Infinite Dreams'
"Sky Force 2014" on phones.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.200
It's designed as a portrait
shoot 'em up-- you're

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.640
shooting up the screen.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.120
And here's how it
adapted to television.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.780
They went landscape,
added co-op multiplayer,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.000
and of course gamepad
control support,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.730
and adapted some
of the HUD as well.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.240
Also, think about how
do your play sessions

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.330
scale to the living room?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.810
Mobile games are made for
three to five minutes,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.020
but how can you scale it to 15,
30, or maybe even two hours?

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.770
Our approach in putting together
the portfolio for Android TV

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.290
has been to select high
fidelity games that

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.250
are easily accessible, that
are scaled to the living room.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.080
We've been curating everything
for the launch of the Nexus

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.680
player until now, in
much the same way that we

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.190
do featuring on the main store.

00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:08.884
So it's the same
featuring process.

00:02:08.884 --> 00:02:10.509
It's the same editorial
team that we're

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.240
using to curate
everything, and here you

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.010
can see how the
rails are organized.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.480
This is how the
store presents itself

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.660
across all the devices that
Greg mentioned in his keynote.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.080
And our mantra from the start
has been quality over quantity

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.390
in order to demonstrate
to developers,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.370
OEM partners, and consumers
what the opportunity space is.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.820
So we have over 80 40-star
or better games on the store

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.890
right now.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.150
We focus on games that
have high visual fidelity

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.240
and high accessibility,
both in terms of controls

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.090
and content for a
broader audience.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.177
And in terms of what
that content looks like,

00:02:45.177 --> 00:02:47.010
we have great partners
supporting the store,

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.490
from indies to AAA developers.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.130
Vector Unit's "Beach
Buggy Racing", who

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.110
we saw a lot of earlier today.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.570
Disney's "Castle Delusions",
Senri's "Leo's Fortune",

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.620
Gameloft's "Despicable Me".

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.670
This is just a handful
of what we have.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.260
But also, there's games
coming from console and PC,

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.220
like Ubisoft's "Valiant Hearts"
and "Oddworld-- Stranger's

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.040
Wrath", as well as indie hits
like "The Bridge" and "Goat

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.640
Simulator," making
it possible for you

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.350
to keep your living
room business model

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.740
consistent across platforms.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.080
Now on the hardware side at
CES, Sony, Phillips, and Sharp

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.650
showed their smart TVs
running Android TV.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.060
And Razer's Android
TV-powered Forge TV one

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.027
Best Gaming Product and
Consumer's Choice Award,

00:03:28.027 --> 00:03:30.110
largely because it's an
all-purpose media and game

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.270
player for $100.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.950
Now, I love this picture.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.580
What is going to be the user
experience-- the unboxing

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.840
experience when people bring
home their TVs in 2015?

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.240
It's going to be the portfolio
that we're developing now.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.900
That's why it's important
to adapt to Android TV now.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.660
The games on there
are the first movers

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.730
that set the bar for applying
the app cultural shift

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.280
to living room games.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.970
Also, there's going to be a lot
more product in the pipeline.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.330
As the platform moves forward
and appears organically

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.630
on living room consumer
electronics devices,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.880
the business case
becomes more apparent.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.800
We'll be seeing more custom
experiences like "Sky Force

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.650
2014", and the experiences
Greg was talking about as well

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.380
with second screens.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.380
And finally, here's this
classic game developer dream

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.640
that's possible-- it's
within reach-- to have

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.300
your game attached
to your player.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.050
Have it live seamlessly between
phone, tablet, and living room

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.935
without constraint of
device or platform.

00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:25.810
How do you get there?

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.310
The developer advocacy
team will help you sort

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.810
through the technical issues.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.530
And the Google
Play [? BD ?] team

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.960
will help you get
on to the store.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.910
Network to them through your
favorite social network,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.420
and that's all I've got.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.450
Thank you very much.
