00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.480
Today we're talking about weird materials

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.670
that we use in space, in robots
and in your mouth.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.460
I'm talking about shape memory alloys.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.150
Like the name says,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.570
these are metals that remember different shapes.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.530
To understand how these metals work,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.000
we've got to talk about atoms and organizing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Let's talk about atoms first.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.440
Atoms are tiny bits of matter
that you cannot see with your eye

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.750
yet they make up everything in our world,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.840
from the chair that you're sitting on
to your cell phone.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.000
Atoms have some surprising ways of behaving too.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We'll talk about that shortly.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, how big is an atom?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.430
Well, imagine pulling one of your hairs
out of your head

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.860
and whittling it like a stick 100,000 times.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.910
One of those shavings 
would be the width of an atom.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.950
They're that small.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.980
Now let's talk about atoms and organizing.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.000
You may not know this,
but atoms arrange themselves

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.530
similar to the way we humans arrange ourselves.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.870
Sometimes they sit in rows, like we do

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.780
on a bus or an airplane.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.000
We call that seating arrangement a phase.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.000
Other times they sit diagonal from each other,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.590
sort of like seats in a movie theater or sports stadium.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.000
This is another phase.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.850
When atoms move from one seating to another

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.940
this is called a phase change.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.130
Phase changes are all around us.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.000
You may already know about water's phases:

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.170
solid, liquid and gas.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.750
Many other materials have phases like that too.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.450
Some of them have several solid phases.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.170
OK. Back to those shape memory alloys
we mentioned before.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.180
When we say that the metals 
remember their different shapes,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.170
what we're really saying is they
remember different seating arrangements

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.570
of atoms. When the atoms rearrange,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.710
the metal moves from one shape to another.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.370
Let's look at a phase change in action.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.260
Here I have a metal wire that 
is made out of nickel and titanium.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.830
This metal wire is a shape memory alloy,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.730
and I'm going to make it switch
between its different shapes

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.740
using heat from a lighter.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.630
Watch this.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.830
I'm going to wrap this wire around my finger

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.440
and then heat it.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.000
Amazing!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.270
That wire returns to a straight line,
when I heat it.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.730
Let's try that again.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.510
I'm going to wrap it around my finger,
and heat it.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.490
Yep, that's still amazing.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.000
Not only is it amazing, this is weird,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
because metals generally don't do that.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.760
Here's a paper clip. When I heat it, I get nothing.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.370
What we're seeing is the shape memory wire
changing phases when it gets hot.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.870
When the wire is cold, atoms 
are in a diagonal arrangement,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.350
like the movie theater seating,
we talked about before.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.080
We call this a monoclinic arrangement,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.560
and scientists will call this phase martensite.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.000
When I heated up the wire,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the atoms moved into columns like airplane seating.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.720
This is a cubic arrangement.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.000
Scientists will call this phase austenite.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So when we added the heat, 
the atoms shifted positions seamlessly,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.640
and they'll do this forever.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.380
They have this coordinated motion, 
just like members of a tireless marching band.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.950
Each makes a small shift, but all 
together those small shifts

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.150
create a totally different pattern.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.730
So that's pretty cool, but
where do we use these materials?

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.810
Well, if you look in the sky tonight,

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.790
shape memory alloys are at work -

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.810
on Mars. They're used to move 
panels on the Mars rover,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.100
so that it can study the environment.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.600
Like our metal straightened when it was heated,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.980
the metals holding the panels
will move when electrically heated.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.140
When we stop heating the shape memory metal,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.000
the panel will return back,
due to an opposing spring.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Back on Earth, shape memory alloys
are used to open up clogged arteries

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
as stents, which are small collapsible springs

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.290
that force open passages.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.000
Shape memory alloys are also used to move robots,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
toy butterflies, teeth in braces,
and for a perfect fit every time,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.290
shape memory wires are used 
as underwires in bras.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.000
Now you know Victoria's secret.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.590
By popping a bra into the dryer, 
it'll be brand new every time.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.510
So whether it's on Mars or in your mouth,
small atomic movements

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.660
can create huge changes,

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.000
and understanding the way atoms behave

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.830
allows us to make materials 
that make our world a better place.
