00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.550
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, today we're pleased
to welcome Jon Gertner, author of " The Idea

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.620
Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American
Innovation."

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.170
In this book, Gertner unveils the unique magic
of Bell Labs through the eyes and actions

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.170
of its scientists.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.640
Even more importantly, he reveals the forces
that set off such an explosion of creativity.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.159
Jon has also been a contributing writer at
The New York Times Magazine, where he writes

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:25.529
about business, technology and society.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.519
Please join me in welcoming Jon.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.519
[ applause ]

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.900
&gt;&gt;Jon Gertner: Thanks.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.129
Can everybody hear me OK?

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.399
Thank you for coming.

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.340
I really appreciate it.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:46.360
One of the strange things about working on
a book for 5 years, which I'll put up there.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.489
Oops, sorry.

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.100
There we go.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.250
Is that you're on your own for a while.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.190
You're really living this introverted existence.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.370
Then, you are done with the book and everybody
expects you to be this wonderfully extroverted

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.870
person who can deliver dynamic speeches and
captivate audiences.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.970
I think I can write better than I can speak,
but I will do my best.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.090
Today, I am going to talk a little bit about
Bell Labs.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.460
It's a huge, it was a huge endeavor.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.970
It was a huge organization.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.930
It lasted in its, I guess, in its real, pure
incarnation before the phone monopoly was

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.430
broken up from 1925 until 1984.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.400
Early on, when I was working on the book,
I realized I could probably spend the rest

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.510
of my life writing a book about Bell Labs.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.450
I mean, there was this sort of bottomless
amount of information.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.930
And if you guys ever want to archive it that
would be great because it's all millions of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.650
documents arranged pell-mell in the archives.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.490
So, this was a classic endeavor, I think,
where there was too much information.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.990
And some of the challenge was to sort through
and find a way to tell the story.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.990
Does everybody--.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.780
I don’t know if everyone knows what Bell
Labs was, but it was the R and D arm of AT

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.230
and T. AT and T was a different organization
back then.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.229
It was the telephone monopoly in control of
between 80 and 90 percent of the telephone

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.020
service in the United States.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.890
AT and T was vertically integrated.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.750
It had Bell Labs as its R and D organization
on the bottom.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.100
It controlled a manufacturing company called
Western Electric, too.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.680
AT and T, itself, ran the long distance service.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.200
And it owned either pieces or whole entire
parts of these local operating companies around

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200
the country.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.240
It was the biggest company in the world at
the time.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.390
It employed the most people.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.540
It was the most valuable.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.590
It was a true colossus at the time.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.630
The reason to, for me at least, to write about
Bell Labs was this, which is a, probably a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.850
info-graphic you definitely cannot read from
there.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.960
But a guy at the Times did this for me when
I wrote a story a couple weeks back about

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.170
why it matters.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.500
But, all those little blurbs there are Bell
Labs innovations that as we move along the

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.000
time line, kind of coalesce into this wondrous
electronic world we have today.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.570
And just on a quick short list, if I were
going to tick-off some of the big accomplishments

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.260
and innovations there, probably the things
got rolling in its golden age in 1947 with

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.459
the invention of the transistor.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.650
Many iterations of the transistor followed.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.560
Many process innovations for the transistor
followed as well.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.709
The silicon solar cell came out of there.

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.340
Digital communications and information theory
came out of there.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.990
Cellular telephone networking came out of
there.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:41.880
UNIX, the C language, digital signal processing--
[clears throat] I'm sure Ileft out a few.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.720
Communication satellites, wavelength multiplexing,
fiber optics themselves were not originated

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.460
there, but fiber optic systems did.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.960
So, you can see that these were true platform
innovations on which the industries of today

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.960
were built.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.230
And for me the question was how do I, why
did that happen?

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.989
Why was this one place so creative, so innovative
for so long?

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.880
One reason is it was connected to a monopoly
and it had this endless stream of money and

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.340
it could hire the best people.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.709
Create the, any kind of equipment.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.019
Nothing was too expensive.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.180
It could think long term in a way that is
harder today I think.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.629
It could do science experiments in a way that
is harder today, too, for corporations to

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.580
invest in things that are quite so risky.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.199
Anyway, quickly I think today I will just
talk about two innovations in particular and

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.979
maybe give you a flavor for how innovation
happened there, which is definitely different

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.270
from today.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.319
And also you can ask me questions after, but
also I think these examples work together

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.520
in a complimentary way.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.240
And explain a little bit of how things began.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.520
This is Murray Hill, which some of you may
have heard of or maybe not.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.059
The original Bell Labs was actually here in
Manhattan on West Street, about 20 blocks,

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.059
25 blocks.

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:00.409
A few less actually.

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.309
About 10, 15 blocks south of here.

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:08.639
In the early 40s, they built this as a sort
of escape from the city.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:13.110
They wanted to do their experiments away from
the dirt and the noise and the vibrations

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.110
of New York.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.259
This was the first building.

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.259
Many more followed.

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:19.020
It became quite an enormous complex.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.669
It still stands today.

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.479
It's actually the headquarters of Alcatel-Lucent
at the moment.

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:29.570
But in the time that this photo was taken,
which was I think about 1946 or 47, it was

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.749
just about entering its golden period.

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:36.020
And it was where a lot of the great researchers,
who later became famous, worked.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.650
There a couple of other campuses in New Jersey
as well.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.520
But this was in that era the primary one.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.770
This guy on the left was Mervin Kelly.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.389
And in someways he really forms the back bone
of my book.

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.080
He started at Western Electric in 1917.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.439
And came over to Bell Labs in 1925.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.759
The picture on the left is him in his early
career.

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:04.699
The one on the right is Kelly before he retired
in the late 50s.

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.589
Its also probably a good ad for why you shouldn’t
smoke cigarettes.

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:12.699
Kelly was a heavy smoker [chuckles] and it
aged him pretty seriously.

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:19.319
His first job at Bell Labs, or his first big
job, was to be in charge of vacuum tube development.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.550
And vacuum tubes, as you may know, as one
of these great technologies that has entered

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.050
the dust bin of history.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.050
Almost.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.159
Unless you are a guitar player and you use
tube amps.

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.689
Or you're into high- powered radio transmission
and they still require some of that.

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:39.300
But at the time, the vacuum tube was really
the great invention of Kelly's time.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.719
And what it did, as you may know, is it allowed
telephone calls to actually travel across

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:45.000
the country.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.089
Telephone signals were not digital at the
time.

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:48.509
They were traveling by waves.

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:50.220
They are weak.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.369
They attenuate.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:56.680
The vacuum tubes, in fact-- this is the one
Kelly worked on for years and years called

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.650
the 101 D-- was also called the repeater tube.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.749
And these tubes were spaced every 50 to 75
to 100 miles across the country at repeater

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:06.550
stations.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.789
Phone calls that were going from New York,
for instance, to Menlo Park, would travel

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.909
through many of these repeater stations as
the signal would be amplified and sent on

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:17.740
farther along the line.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.199
Kelly was really good at his job.

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:25.710
He ran the vacuum tube shop and it gave him
deep appreciation of an incremental innovation,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.340
I guess you might say.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.469
He worked on getting cost down and the life
of these things up.

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:37.819
I think he brought the hours they could run
from something like a thousand hours to 80

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:40.499
thousand hours, which was a phenomenal achievement.

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:45.619
And obviously, economics of that were tremendous
as well.

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:47.889
But he fundamentally had a problem with vacuum
tubes.

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:51.960
He probably knew as much or more about vacuum
tubes than anybody in the country.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.159
He felt deeply that they were a flawed technology.

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:57.870
He would complain to his wife that they broke
all the time.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.560
The other problems with vacuum tubes is they
were fairly large as you can see.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.819
This one was just a little bit smaller than
an old style incandescent light bulb.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.879
They used great amounts of power.

00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:10.849
They gave off tremendous amounts of heat.

00:08:10.849 --> 00:08:15.069
They had to warm up to function, so they couldn’t
function cold.

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:16.939
And it had bothered him.

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:22.210
He was always wondering if there was something
else that could replace them.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.319
Kelly had a best friend at Bell Labs and his
name was Clinton Davisson.

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:28.470
He won the Nobel Prize in the late 1930s.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.229
But before either one of these guys became
famous, they shared a laboratory in the teens

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:35.419
and 20s at Bell Labs.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.310
They were kind of the original odd couple.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.620
Kelly was robust.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.969
He had extraordinary amounts of energy.

00:08:42.969 --> 00:08:45.560
I wonder if he might have had A.D.D.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.060
He was in those days before then he was always
on the move.

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.399
He was not somebody who would linger over
things too long.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:56.000
Davisson was the opposite.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.270
Kelly was a fairly good sized man.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:02.490
Davisson was incredibly thin, phlegmatic,
slow moving.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.630
I think Davisson weighed 110 pounds, sometimes.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.630
He would often be sick.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.980
He would go home and he would wear his stocking
cap and his little nightgown, and sit in his

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.500
study at home and write equations.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.149
And Kelly would go visit him and see how he
was doing.

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:21.079
They shouldn’t have got along in theory,
but they did.

00:09:21.079 --> 00:09:24.180
And Kelly actually was awed by Davisson.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.880
In some ways, it speaks to why Kelly was so
good at what he did, and why Bell Labs became

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880
what it became.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:37.850
The thing about Davisson was that he couldn’t
help his colleagues with the actual engineering

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.009
of the projects they were working on.

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:44.089
But what he could do was he could answer questions
nobody else in the staff of Bell Labs could

00:09:44.089 --> 00:09:45.089
do.

00:09:45.089 --> 00:09:47.560
He would give them a deeper, more fundamental
understanding.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.519
For instance, with vacuum tubes and what was
going on deep within the processes of these

00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:53.519
tubes.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:57.550
And what Kelly realized was yes, Davisson
could answer questions nobody else could.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:02.769
But that by imparting a kind of fundamental
understanding of what was happening with these

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:08.740
electronic devices, staff under him at the
tube shop, for instance, could make improvements

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:13.589
that were not just twice as good or three
times as good, but orders of magnitude better.

00:10:13.589 --> 00:10:19.250
It showed him that knowledge gives an unbelievable
power beyond just mere tinkering.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.910
And in many ways, Davisson became the model
for those Bell Lab researchers.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.910
In later years, not everybody was in research
at Bell Labs.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.370
A lot of people were in development.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.730
In fact, the majority were.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.129
But those researchers who were pursuing pure
knowledge and could be tapped for that, Davisson

00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:34.569
was Kelly's model.

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:40.980
So, it's one day in 1937 and Kelly's walking
down the hall and he is likely on his way

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.410
to visit Davisson because Davisson shares
an office with a guy right below him.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:49.060
On that picture, Davisson is on the right
and Shockley-- William Shockley-- is right

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:50.870
below him.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.649
Shockley had joined Bell Labs
in 1936.

00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:56.320
Kelly had hired Shockley.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.320
Shockley was brilliant.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.500
He grew up in Palo Alto.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.420
He went to graduate school at MIT.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:06.610
And for whatever reason, that day Davisson
was likely not there and Kelly decides to

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.540
give Shockley a speech.

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:13.350
And Kelly tells him rather than talking about
vacuum tubes that day, he is complaining about

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.350
switches.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.270
These relay switches that clicked on and off.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.589
And they were the other essential part of
The Bell System.

00:11:20.589 --> 00:11:22.199
They were electromagnetic.

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:26.509
They were slow in a manner of speaking because
they weren’t electronic.

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:28.629
They clicked and moved.

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:29.879
They broke fairly often.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:30.879
They wore out.

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:31.879
They were a huge expense.

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:34.290
There were millions of them in the system.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.630
And he told Shockley that day in 1937, and
it was something Shockley would remember for

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.139
the rest of his life: “If we could just
get these switches out of the system somehow,

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:48.110
if there was someway to replace them, it would
just be an enormous improvement for The Bell

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:49.110
System.”

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.680
There are then these two components-- the
amplifying tubes and the switches--both of

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.310
which are essential to making The Bell System
function, both of which are problematic.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.700
And Shockley takes this to heart.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:08.480
The war intervenes in 1941 and all of Bell
Lab starts working on war-related stuff.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:15.070
[clears throat] And then right after the war,
Kelly creates what later became known as The

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.800
Solid State Team.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.920
He got a group together at Bell Labs, put
Shockley in charge, and asked them to look

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.759
into the nature of semiconductors.

00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:32.310
And semiconductors were relatively new, I
guess you could say, semi-understood material

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:33.310
at the time.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.620
They had become very valuable in war-time
radar.

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:41.149
But Kelly and others at Bell Labs felt that
there was still a good deal amount to know

00:12:41.149 --> 00:12:43.360
about them that they did not.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.089
And the semiconductor group was interesting
for a couple of reasons.

00:12:46.089 --> 00:12:52.470
It sounds a little bit obvious today, but
it was tremendously interdisciplinary, which

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.750
Kelly personally believed was necessary.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.990
So, it wasn't just physicists working together.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:59.860
And it wasn't just experimentalists and theorists.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.870
There were chemists.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.210
There were electrical engineers.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.560
There were circuitry experts.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.579
Everybody was pitching in with somewhat complimentary
talents.

00:13:06.579 --> 00:13:07.600
Not everybody agreed.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.449
There was a nice amount of creative tension
as well.

00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:15.029
The second thing about the group that was
fairly interesting, is that in some ways,

00:13:15.029 --> 00:13:18.810
Kelly's entire career had been built upon
his achievements with the vacuum tube.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.689
And what he is doing in some ways is trying
to get away or get around that innovator's

00:13:22.689 --> 00:13:23.800
dilemma.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:30.060
He's essentially creating a team that, if
it succeeds, will make his entire previous

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.620
career at Bell Labs and all his fame really,
somewhat irrelevant.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:39.529
From 1945 to 1947, the transistor group goes
to work.

00:13:39.529 --> 00:13:41.249
They're not the transistor group.

00:13:41.249 --> 00:13:42.249
Excuse me.

00:13:42.249 --> 00:13:43.249
They're the semiconductor group.

00:13:43.249 --> 00:13:49.319
And in fall of 1947, two guys working under
Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain

00:13:49.319 --> 00:13:56.089
, come up with this,which is very ugly, but
quite miraculous.

00:13:56.089 --> 00:13:57.089
Its about--.

00:13:57.089 --> 00:14:00.570
If anybody's ever seen it, it's actually about
the size of the tip of my pinky.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.900
So it's fairly small.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.149
And that sheet of crystal underneath the arrow
head is germanium.

00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:07.149
It's not silicon.

00:14:07.149 --> 00:14:09.769
Its lightly doped germanium.

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:14.560
And on the side of that arrow head are gold
wires coming in there.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:20.850
And on the day before Christmas Eve, Bardeen
and Brattain with Shockley there, too, demonstrated

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.779
to the Bell Labs executives.

00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:26.720
And they amplified their voice somewhat like
18 times.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:33.199
And they agreed that it was something tremendously
big.

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:37.839
So they found this thing, this punitive replacement
for the vacuum tube.

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:40.019
And it seemed that the world would change.

00:14:40.019 --> 00:14:46.499
But it didn’t because what they discovered
pretty quickly was how hard these things were

00:14:46.499 --> 00:14:48.100
to make.

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:53.160
In those early days, I would go through all
these stories and Bell Labs guys bringing

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.360
in military generals, or heads of corporations,
to see this wondrous new transistor.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.129
But if it was a humid day the thing would
stop working.

00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:03.579
If somebody slammed a door nearby it wouldn’t
work.

00:15:03.579 --> 00:15:06.870
There were tremendous challenges in manufacturability.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.459
Eventually, those were worked out.

00:15:09.459 --> 00:15:14.819
And eventually, too, Shockley created the
idea for something called the junction transistor.

00:15:14.819 --> 00:15:18.889
Still later there were other things like the
field effect transistor that came into play.

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:24.569
And one by one, these problems of manufacturing
were solved by Western Electric factories

00:15:24.569 --> 00:15:26.930
with the help of the development team at Bell
Labs.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:32.740
And by the early 1950s, these transistors
were just starting to make their way into

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.740
the electronics industry.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:43.110
And then at about that same time, in actually
the same lab that the transistor was made,

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.649
these three guys were working on it.

00:15:44.649 --> 00:15:45.649
It was 1954.

00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:51.050
So, the development of the transistor was
continuing, but it was, again, starting to

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.690
infiltrate culture and business.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:16:00.019
And the guy on the far left is Gerald Pearson,
who actually shared an office with Walter

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:03.570
Brattain, who was one of the inventors of
the transistor.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:08.329
And Pierson, with the guy on the right, Cal
Fuller, were working on something called a

00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:10.050
silicon solar rectifier.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.620
I'm sorry, a silicon power rectifier.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.120
Excuse me.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.350
Pearson was an experimental physicist.

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:17.670
Fuller was a chemist.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:22.020
And what Fuller would do is he would make
these pieces of silicon in his lab that were

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.230
diffused.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.670
And he would put these light layers of slightly
impure, slightly doped we call it now.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.070
They didn’t call it that at the time.

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.949
They called it N or P silicon.

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:35.320
On these silicon wafers and he would bring
it to Pearson.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.589
And they would try and work out this device
they were making for the phone system.

00:16:39.589 --> 00:16:45.160
What Pearson started to realize is that this
stuff that Fuller was making was incredibly

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:51.709
photosensitive, not just surprisingly slow,
but had a larger effect than anything Pearson

00:16:51.709 --> 00:16:56.060
could find in the science literature, and
anything he had ever seen before.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.309
And that struck him.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:02.850
What also struck him was he knew a guy in
the middle from college named Daryl Chapin.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.490
Now, all these guys actually worked in different
buildings.

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:09.100
And they just serendipitously almost found
each other.

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:15.410
What Pearson knew about Chapin was that Chapin
was actually looking for a way to solve a

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:19.460
problem that he was working on at Bell Labs
that had to do with those old repeater stations

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.190
I was talking about.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:24.990
They were spaced again every 50 to 100 miles
around the country.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.870
And they amplified phone calls.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:33.480
In some rural areas, these repeater stations
didn't have a real reliable power source,

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480
especially in the south.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:40.820
They used dry cell batteries that would sometimes
stop working, or they used diesel generators.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:46.930
And what Pearson realized, thinking he had
been having lunch with Chapin and knew what

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:51.260
he was trying to work on, was that this thing
that he and Fuller were also working on, too,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.280
could possibly be used as a power source for
this problem.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.640
So, the three men went to work on this.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.810
And eventually, they came out with what was
called The Bell Solar Battery, or the silicon

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.920
solar cell.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.720
And it was tried in 1955 at Americus, Georgia.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.830
And it was very successful.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.040
I'll talk about the economics of it in a second.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.040
But in terms of its function, it worked very
well.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.690
And in fact, it's interesting, too.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:22.500
I live in New Jersey and these are going up
on every phone pole now, too.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:28.560
Except they are a lot thinner and obviously
the efficiencies are much higher.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:34.200
A couple things to just draw from these two
examples I think, or at least things I found

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.380
interesting as I was researching and thinking
hard about what it means.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.100
I think, first, in these two cases it can
demonstrate that innovation is often a response

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:49.270
to needs and to problems, rather than that
classic lone inventor coming up with the idea.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.590
That it's rarely an unprovoked idea.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.252
That, at least for the transistor team, they
were looking into the deeper nature of their

00:18:56.252 --> 00:18:57.252
materials.

00:18:57.252 --> 00:19:01.210
And in the back of their mind they had, at
least Shockley very much had that idea, that

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:04.280
if they found something it could be quite
useful for the phone system.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:08.710
It could get rid of those proliferating switches
and tubes.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:14.540
The solar cell, for instance, was a very clear
response to a problem that Daryl Chapin had.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.740
I think the second thing we learn is that
we're not very good at perceiving breakthroughs

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.700
sometimes when they happen.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.850
The transistor ended up on page 46 of The
New York Times.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.910
And it was actually not even at the top of
this trivial column.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.000
It was located deep down at the bottom.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.780
Saying all these Bell Labs guys might have
a replacement for the vacuum tube.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.080
At Bell Labs, they thought it was quite a
big deal, but it was hard for the rest of

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.070
the country and in fact, the world, to perceive
its immediate import.

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:45.710
Or at least most people.

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.710
With The Bell Solar Battery, which is quite
interesting, is almost the exact opposite.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:51.710
It was a miracle.

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.710
[chuckles]

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.120
It was a pivotal juncture of mankind.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.050
It was on the front page of most newspapers
in the country.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:19:59.950
We had harnessed the power of the sun.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:04.710
And I'm a big solar power advocate, so I'm
not knocking it, but at the time it seemed

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.700
like things had changed dramatically.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:13.360
That we had tapped now a cheap inexhaustible
source of power that would change our culture

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.070
and our society.

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:20.070
But to build on that too, I think there's
a third thing.

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:26.190
And that's that invention is fairly-- can
be fairly-- rapid and sudden and dramatic.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:27.920
But innovation is really long and hard.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.980
And I think you see that with the transistor.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:36.140
Not just how long it took to develop it to
the point where it worked, but also it was

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.910
quite expensive in the beginning.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:43.360
And in those early days, it was really kept
alive by defense contractors.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.800
Bell Labs put them into the Bell system.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.930
But defense contractors and the U.S. government
were ordering them because the low power requirements

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:56.780
of transistors and their tiny size made them
quite invaluable in submarines and airplanes.

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.770
And the extra expense, because they were much
more expensive than vacuum tubes at the time,

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:05.650
was outweighed by those other attributes.

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:09.050
The silicon solar cell wasn't quite as hard
to develop.

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.610
However it was incredibly expensive.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:17.170
I think a year after they developed this device,
Gerald Chapin, one of the inventors, calculated

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:22.730
if he wanted to outfit his house with enough
solar cells to actually power all his appliances

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:26.120
it would cost one point five million dollars.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:32.460
We're obviously at that point where that cost
per cell is coming down dramatically.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:39.200
But obviously, the economics made it completely
a non starter essentially.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.390
And in fact they, realized this after they
did that installation, that demonstration

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:45.550
in Americus, Georgia.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:51.900
That for the amount of, for the expense for
creating these solar devices at the time,

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.790
just wasn’t worth it.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:58.240
Fourth, I think we see from these two examples,
at least at Bell Labs, that there was no way

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.370
of making a set way for making a breakthrough.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.150
The transistor was an orchestrated mid-sized
team.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.190
It was very carefully created.

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.490
And it was very closely managed in many respects.

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:15.070
There was a good deal of freedom there, but
everybody kept tabs on progress.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.810
And there were very frequent meetings.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:18.810
The solar cell--.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.710
As I said, all those guys worked in different
buildings.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:25.500
They found the right problem at the right
time with the right people at the right moment.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.020
It was fairly serendipitous.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:33.841
Finally, I think that even when we think we
understand the value of breakthroughs, maybe

00:22:33.841 --> 00:22:34.841
we don’t.

00:22:34.841 --> 00:22:40.490
I think early on the transistor was obviously
viewed as a replacement for the vacuum tube.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.890
And it was.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.860
But its real value has been in computers,
obviously.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.220
In the chips.

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.320
And they power our phones and laptops.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.090
And god knows everything else.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.970
I think when I was looking in the archives
at AT&amp;T there was only one letter, as far

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:05.400
as I could find, from an MIT professor named
Jay Forrester, a couple days after the transistor

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.490
was invented.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.850
And he wrote to these guys and he said, “hey
can I get a couple samples?

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:14.860
I think those have some real applications
in this computer apparatus that I'm building.”

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:20.210
And its a little unclear from the responses
at Bell Labs whether they realized how valuable

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:21.930
that would be for computers or not.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.620
What they did do was immediately write back
to Forrester.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.840
And they were not writing back to everybody
because they got tons of letters begging for

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.840
samples.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.340
But they wrote back to him immediately and
said “yes, they are on their way.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:35.940
Please let us know if there is anything we
can do to make it easier for you.”

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:43.110
And a quick other thing as for how we don't
know if we understand the value of what an

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.770
innovation might do.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.050
Is that sometimes I am asked, “What was
the great thing that came out of Bell Labs?

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.330
Or the greatest?”

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:50.970
A very hard question, actually.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.750
Sometimes, I find it depends what field of
technology you work in.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:59.710
You can get very different answers, but I
usually say the transistor.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:07.080
And I think it's widely understood to be the
great invention of the 20th Century.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.760
But I wonder in 20 years if maybe the solar
cell might compete in some ways.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:17.120
If it's a matter of where you are in time
when you answer that question.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:20.620
One thing I know for sure is that it wasn’t
the picture phone.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.220
[laughter] But the picture phone is interesting
too.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.690
I'll just end on a quick note here.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.050
The picture phone was just a colossal flop.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:33.540
This was the model one which was unveiled
at the 1964 World's Fair.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:40.060
They actually re-did it before it was rolled
out to the public in 1968.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.230
The model two is a little sleeker.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.150
It was a square actual model.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:49.870
But it was in the days before the web, the
internet.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.560
Everybody else had to have a picture phone
if you wanted to talk to somebody on a picture

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.560
phone.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.250
The system wasn't ready.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.480
It was fabulously expensive.

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.290
It was hundreds of millions of dollars went
down the tubes on that.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:08.590
It's a classic example, I think, of how an
innovator can maybe get the sort of right

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:09.590
idea.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.700
But if you're wrong by about 40 years, you're
in trouble.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:20.300
And one thing that actually came out of the
picture phone research was that the labs always

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.940
have these guys who are not just building
these things.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:29.620
But the research department were sort of testing
them with subjects and psychology and human

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.510
factors type work.

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.970
And they realized it was actually easier to
lie to somebody while you were talking on

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:35.970
a picture phone.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.000
Than if you're just talking to someone on
a telephone.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.121
And apparently you attend to the content and
truth of the conversation much better if you're

00:25:44.121 --> 00:25:45.410
just talking on the phone.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.650
I don’t know if the lesson to that is if
you want to lie to somebody, call them on

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:56.013
Skype or have a chat with them on the web
or not.

00:25:56.013 --> 00:25:59.820
[chuckling] That gives you a little bit of
flavor for the labs I think, at that particular

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.820
time.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.400
There's many more in the book.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.440
It's a long book.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.070
It gets into all these questions of policy
and monopoly, what innovation is, how it differs

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:13.020
from invention, how our world has changed.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:20.010
And how companies, like you guys, have taken
up the mantle to some extent of how innovation

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:22.260
happens and how it has become more distributed.

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:27.570
With science maybe more relegated to our national
laboratories and our universities.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.880
But it has a little bit-- hopefully this gives
you a little bit of flavor.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:40.060
That overriding point I'd just like to make
in closing is that, I think, these two examples

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:44.650
and many others in the book, really show that
a small number of people working within a

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:49.070
large organization can make just unbelievable
changes in the world.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:54.630
And I don't mean just a social impact in how
we live, but also just a huge economic impact.

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:59.920
When we consider the platform industries that
came out of these two inventions.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:05.130
And those ripples that are still really spreading
out from them.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.710
And obviously it wasn’t just Bell Labs.

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.900
Other people picked up on this and made it
better and better and better.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:16.870
There's a whole other story of what was going
on in the West Coast-- Fairchild Semiconductor

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.920
and Intel and how they made it better.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:27.420
But still from this one place came what has
been millions of jobs and a real revolution.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.400
Thank you.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.390
[ applause ]

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:41.540
So, I am happy to take in questions if anyone
wants to ask anything.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:42.540
Yes.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:43.540
Sure.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.540
Oh.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.540
I can't--.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.540
It's a little bright.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.540
I'm sorry.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:48.540
Hi.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:51.140
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I don’t know if you've had a
tour of the building or other Google facilities.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.140
OK.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:58.030
But there's a real estate and workplace services
group that has taken a lot of effort to design

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:01.540
the physical spaces to encourage interaction
and informal.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.600
I wonder if you could say something about
–. I think this has been in some reviews

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.790
of your book about the physical layout of
some of the Bell Labs facilities that encouraged

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:11.790
interaction.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.840
&gt;&gt;Jon Gertner: Sure.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.840
Yeah.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.840
That old slide of Murray Hill I put up.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:22.000
They created these epically long hallways
so people could interact.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.350
Made it almost imperative that you would bump
into people.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.520
At the same time, they situated.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.470
They didn't sequester departments.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:40.700
Mervin Kelly was quite intent on mixing development
people in with the research people, abutting

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.500
chemistry, physics, and metallurgy.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.630
It in some ways seemed like it didn't have
a rhyme or reason, but it worked very well.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:56.370
Another example of that is the MIT Rad Lab,
which you may have heard about, too, which

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:01.200
was a little bit of chaos, but was a very
creative environment.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.220
Kelly was a big believer that great ideas
don't come from like-minded people talking

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.220
to each other.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:13.530
They come from that interface of people with
different points of view and different expertise.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:19.400
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Seems like one hell of a thing
to devote five years of your life to.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.690
What put you on to it?

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.570
&gt;&gt; Jon Gertner: Great question.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:27.510
I actually grew up near Bell Labs in Berkeley
Heights, New Jersey.

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.510
So.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.520
My dad did not work there, although he was
a scientist.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.040
But I was--.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.130
I am a journalist.

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:40.230
I was writing about technology and society
and economics to some extent.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.410
And I was particularly interested in innovation.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:48.980
And I was looking for a book project after
writing a lot of long stories for The New

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:54.480
York Times Magazine, wondering what I could
devote a lot of time to.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.050
And I had been writing about Innovation and
Toyota and some other companies.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:01.920
It occurred to me that I really did want to
write about Bell Labs.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.930
It was a great place.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.890
I didn't really think it would take five years.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.240
[chuckles] I think the original plan was two
years.

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.120
And then I remember just that first year driving
back with interviews from veterans.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.490
Or going to at the time Holmdel, the old labs
was still open.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.260
And there was Murray Hill.

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:30.450
And I would be just excited by the amount
of stuff that there was to write about.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:35.850
But also sometimes with just a pounding headache,
how difficult the task was gonna be.

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:38.320
And it was difficult.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:44.279
It was –. I'm sure all books are difficult
in their own way.

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:49.890
I think in this case with Bell Labs, what
story do you want to tell?

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:53.680
And some people have read the book who even
had nice things about it, said, “You don't

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.840
write much about UNIX and C.” And that’s
true.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:03.320
And I think that's, to me, that was a little
different than the story I was telling about

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.970
five people who formed the core of my narrative.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.970
I think the computer labs at Bell Labs is
going to be a great book in itself one day.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.090
But that was not this particular one.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:19.070
So narrowing it down and figuring out a way
I could some how manage the story of this

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:24.160
place, was also a great challenge.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.690
Anyone else?

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:27.690
I'm not an engineer.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:28.900
So you could totally stump me if you want.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.900
No?

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:30.900
OK.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.900
[laughter]

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:36.490
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Well, first of all, let me just
say I look forward to the computer sciences

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:40.850
book that you are going to write later.

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:41.850
[ laughter ]

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.530
Big surprise, a lot of us from Bell Labs ended
up here.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:46.870
&gt;&gt;Jon Gertner: Yeah

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:53.010
&gt;&gt;Male #3: What else was sort of the legacy
of Bell Labs?

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.860
There was the big earthquake in '84, but in
my experience at least, it still took awhile

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.290
for things to shake out.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:03.680
It wasn’t until really until roughly about
the same time as the dot com boom before you

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.290
started seeing the major exodus.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.060
Where did people go?

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.670
Did they retire?

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:09.900
Did they retire in place?

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:10.990
What happened?

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.830
&gt;&gt; Jon Gertner: It's a great question.

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.830
I was looking for metaphor in the book for
that.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:18.150
I called it an inheritance in some ways.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:24.750
It was this vast sum that got split apart
among descendants . It's true.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:29.060
There was a good amount of momentum after
the break up.

00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:31.911
And Bell Labs was still a very, very good
industrial lab.

00:32:31.911 --> 00:32:34.360
For a number of years after.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.780
They are still doing good stuff, too.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.450
Although the mission is much more narrow.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.170
Some people were split off.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:48.840
The math folks, some went to the Shannon Labs
at AT and T when that was created.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.940
Some went to Bellcore.

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.090
Some went to academia.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:57.160
Some went to the west coast where they realized
they could actually make more money than they

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.090
ever thought possible.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:03.170
[chuckles] Some retired and that's true.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:04.720
And some did stay there.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.130
Because again, there was this momentum where
some of the older people could stay there.

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:14.480
At the time of the break up it wasn't necessarily--.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.050
It was very unclear.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:22.660
Reading the press in the mid 80s about what
would happen to the great AT and T and Bell

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.660
Labs.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:29.190
There was no sense that somehow it was doomed
or that there would be such disruptive changes.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:33.810
And in fact, it was gonna be AT and T and
IBM which were gonna compete in the computer

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:34.810
business.

00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.920
And that was gonna be the big square off.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.920
Yeah.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.010
&gt;&gt;Male #3: It's funny there was maybe a lot
if inertia.

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:45.641
When I joined in '81, there was this weekly
publication called Bell Labs News.

00:33:45.641 --> 00:33:49.030
And at the back there were all the anniversaries.

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.270
Every week.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:55.200
Every week there was at least one person celebrating
his, almost inevitably his, 40th anniversary

00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.190
at Bell Labs, which is just unimaginable today.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.080
&gt;&gt; Jon Gertner: Yeah.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:03.080
It's incredible.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.820
It was a gold watch sort of place, I suppose.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.870
That doesn't exist anymore.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:10.040
Or does exist.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.560
But certainly not in technology.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.140
And I don’t think, certainly the book is
not an act of nostalgia.

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:22.970
I think it's interesting that things have
changed.

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:30.760
As a journalist, it's interesting to watch
things become faster, companies more agile.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:37.950
To see what happens when engineers and entrepreneurs
can switch companies quickly.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:40.450
But there was something to say about that
institutional knowledge.

00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:42.830
It was really there and you could tap it.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.070
And those guys knew stuff.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:48.440
In that sense it was very valuable.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:56.320
And things if they moved slower, they could
take the long view in the the way that obviously

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.730
could pay off in very dramatic ways.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.560
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Hi.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.260
&gt;&gt; Jon Gertner: Hey
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Do you think this notion of the

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.740
research lab is economically feasible today?

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:13.040
I seem to be reading more about the decline
of these research labs, like with Park and

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.890
such, than any kind of successes.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:17.190
Maybe Microsoft Research.

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:22.400
Beyond that, I can't think of any dedicated
research labs that would have the success

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.550
of Bell Labs.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:26.020
&gt;&gt;Jon Gertner: Would you call Google X a research
lab by the way?

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:27.020
I'm just curious.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.380
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Well it's interesting.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:29.740
We met actually.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:32.350
My group is involved with innovation.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.160
We met with some of the people from Google
X.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.380
And who came from Microsoft.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.820
And they say it's an entirely different model.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:46.020
It's not the academic research model that
was ever practiced at Bell Labs or that’s

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.710
done at Microsoft Research.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.290
It's much applied and practical.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:55.630
And, I think, more short term than the long
term thinking that happened at Bell Labs.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.190
So, I don’t know.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.420
It seems like we have lost a lot since then.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.720
&gt;&gt;Jon Gertner: Yeah.

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720
Believe me.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.200
I have struggled for years on that question
of how does one--.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.750
Eventually I just had to sit with contradiction.

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:14.720
That seemed to me to have no resolution that
monopolies are bad for consumers.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.690
They limit choice.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:17.690
They can slow the rate of innovation.

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.430
They can increase prices dramatically.

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:24.000
And yet, they also created this curious institution
of Bell Labs.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.250
That could take this long view because it
was attached to a parent company.

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.780
And therefore could think long term.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.690
And it could terminate research without any
problem at all.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.120
And just move on to the next thing.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.510
And just write it off.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:40.750
Do I think research lab's dead?

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:44.381
I think it's really hard for a company to
fund it and justify it.

00:36:44.381 --> 00:36:48.460
And I think it's especially hard for a company
to--.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.880
It can be like--.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:59.030
Even if hypothetically a corporation were
to invest largely in a pure research endeavor,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.540
it seems to me it would just be so vulnerable
to a boom bust cycle.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.880
That to take the long view would be very hard.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.050
What happens when you have a bad year for
revenues?

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:10.580
Or when growth slows?

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.970
That's a pretty expensive endeavor sometimes.

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:21.490
I think technologies can make research cheaper
now in some ways than they were back then

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:25.000
with computing, but I do think that to capture
the value--.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
To invest in a research lab is very hard for
a corporation because it's very hard to capture

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:38.340
the value of doing basic science, and the
risks are quite high, and the risk of failure

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.340
is tremendous.

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:45.870
So, I don’t know what the answer is right
now with the distributed model of universities

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:49.460
and national laboratories in the private sector.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.350
Is it in sum as good?

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.300
I think it's a great question.

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.970
I like to talk about it.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:38:00.540
I come down in different ways on that, but
if anybody wants to chime in on that I'm very

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:02.550
interested in what you think.

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:03.550
Yeah.

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:07.680
&gt;&gt;Male #5: So, the computer science research
lab in the 60s and 70s had a real reputation

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.390
for being free-wheeling and counter cultural.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:15.450
So, it's funny to see these guys hanging out
in their jackets and ties.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.430
When did that shift happen?

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:23.020
Was it always free- wheeling for its times
or was there a cultural shift over the years?

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.420
&gt;&gt;Jon Gertner: It was pretty free- wheeling
actually.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.400
Especially in the research areas.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:34.940
I mean, there was a kind of telephone guy
culture in the 40s, but by the 50s especially,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:41.570
as I understand it, it started in the theoretical
physics labs where they stopped wearing socks,

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:47.070
[chuckles] but there was always such a great
amount of freedom that dress code fell by

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.070
the wayside.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:53.080
I think, too, that placing Bell Labs within
the larger culture of work.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.910
In general, you would wear a shirt and tie
to go to work.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:03.400
So, in some ways, I think the dress can be
deceptive.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:13.510
That the actual behavior and freedom and the
environment was laid back and free.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:19.010
Even when Claude Shannon , the great mathematician
at Bell Labs, was working on information theory

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:25.940
and digital communications in the late 40s
. He said those guys we were all pretty way

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:26.940
out.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.520
We just left you alone.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:35.220
If you had something and you were on something,
and you had a supervisor who was on board

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:40.730
with you, you couldn't go for a decade but
you could go for a year or two.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.500
And really just make your own plan.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.540
Anyone?

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:45.570
No.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:46.610
OK.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:50.750
Well thank you guys.

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.860
I appreciate it.

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:58.610
I hope it wasn't too boring.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:39:59.610
[chuckles]

00:39:59.610 --> 00:39:59.611
[applause]
