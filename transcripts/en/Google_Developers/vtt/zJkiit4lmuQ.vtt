00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.560
CHRIS CARTLAND: Welcome to
Google+ Developers Live.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.160
My name is Chris Cartland, and
I'm a developer programs

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.040
engineer working on the
Google+ platform.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.910
XIANGTIAN DAI: And I'm Xiangtian
Dai, and I'm a

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.140
software engineer for the
Google+ iOS SDK platform.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.360
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.300
Well, thanks for coming
this week.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.320
We're going to talk about
interactive posts on iOS,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.950
which is why we brought our iOS
expert with us this time.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.420
Everything we are going to talk
about is fully documented

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.250
at developers.google.com/plus,
and you check

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.930
out everything there.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.810
Interactive posts are one of
the really cool features of

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.490
Google+ sign in.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.460
It allows you to help bring
users from the Google+ stream

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.190
into your application.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.760
And so how you're going to do
that is specify a new type of

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.070
share in your application that
has a call to action button

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.920
with a special piece of text
that you choose, so that users

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.980
have some context about what
they're going to do when they

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.280
go to your ap.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.850
So it's a cool type of share.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.570
Xiangtian is going to use the
iOS quick start to demonstrate

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.630
how to get this running, and
use interactive posts.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.020
And then I'm going to show you
a real world example with the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.550
fancy on how that looks
in the Google+ stream,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.830
and in their app.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.760
Ready?

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.710
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yes.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.320
The quick start iOS center is
the faster way to get started

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.740
with Google+ iOS SDK.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.200
It is included as part
of Google+ iOS SDK.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.390
So before we start, let's look
at the document to see what

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.130
the steps are.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.348
So on our document at
googledevelopers

00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:08.760
.google.com/plus, as you can
see, we have a quick start,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.120
and let's go to the iOS part.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.660
CHRIS CARTLAND: And of course,
that's the same place that all

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.970
of our other quick starts
are for any

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.320
of the other languages.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.170
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's right.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.200
So the first step is to
create our project

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.070
in Google API console.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.460
Here you can create a project.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.770
This project recognizes your
apps for the Google+ services.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.010
So the first thing you will do
is to enable Google+ API.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.350
CHRIS CARTLAND: RIght, so you
turn on the Google+ API.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.150
The first time you do that, you
need to accept the terms

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.550
of services.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.920
But there's also a long list
of other APIs that Google

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.760
offers, and you can enable those
just by flipping the

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.820
switch there.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.160
XIANGTIAN DAI: So the next
thing is to create an

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.590
OS to client ID.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.430
this client ID identifies apps
to the Google+, to the Google

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.010
services in particular .

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.360
So here we need to put
your product name.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.050
This product name helps to
identify your app to users.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.530
CHRIS CARTLAND: And this is
a user facing string.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.180
So whatever you put here is
something that your users will

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.280
see, and should recognize is
you, so that they know who

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.610
they're trusting when they
sign in with your app.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.870
XIANGTIAN DAI: And you can also
put on your product logo

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.240
and home page URL down there.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.630
So the next thing is to specify
your application type.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.540
The client type is stored
application, and in

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.470
our case, for iOS.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.100
Now we're going to input
your bundle ID.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.390
This bundle ID is for your iOS
app bundle, which would be the

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:57.285
same as the bundle ID
in your info page

00:05:57.285 --> 00:05:58.590
for the Xcode protect.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.275
In our case, it's
comp.google.googleplussimple.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.670
Note that the same bundle ID
is used to handle URL call

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.600
back from other apps to your
browsers, to your app.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.180
So you need to specify the same
string as your URL cap,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.780
your handle.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.010
If your app is already published
in the App Store,

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.340
you may also want to put your
App Store ID here, so that if

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.350
your app is not yet installed by
user, we can prompt you to

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.830
install it if a deep
link has been

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.030
activated in a user's post.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.700
We'll have this deep link
enabled for now, and we'll

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.650
talk about deep link
a little bit later.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.800
CHRIS CARTLAND: So when we've
done this configuration, this

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.720
allows a user to click on a post
in the Google+ stream and

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.880
be taken directly into your
application on iOS.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.790
So it's a really good way if
you want people to actually

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.980
use your iOS app, and it also
allows Google to direct them

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.740
to the app store if
they don't already

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.420
have the app installed.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.380
XIANGTIAN DAI: That's right.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.870
Note that this client ID stream
is what you're going to

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.360
use to identify your app
to the Google services.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.520
For [INAUDIBLE] string,
we'll use it later.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.970
So here, if you look at the
document, the second step is

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.330
to download the quick start app
as part of our iOS SDK and

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.230
open its Xcode project.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.380
You can always download this iOS
SDK from this link below.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.670
In our case, I've already
downloaded it into my desktop.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.200
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah, so you can
either just click the link

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.620
to download it, or you can
ask Xiangtian to send it

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.205
to you in an email.

00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:47.480
XIANGTIAN DAI: That's right.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.790
CHRIS CARTLAND: On
Google Drive.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.505
XIANGTIAN DAI: OK, so here is
the Google+ iOS SDK 1.2.1.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:02.000
Let's open this folder, and it
has a sample code folder.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.070
Inside you will see your
Xcode project.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:18.530
Open that, and this is our
quick start simple app.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.270
The first thing we will do, as
we just talked about, is to

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.180
replace this client ID stream
with your own client ID as

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.820
you're registered in the
Google API console.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.820
CHRIS CARTLAND: So this is the
only change that you have to

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.549
make to the sample app after
you've download it.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.679
We could just run it right now,
but we're actually going

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:42.110
to have Xiangtian explain it
a little bit more, because

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.059
there's some details
of sharing that you

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.130
might want to see.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.050
XIANGTIAN DAI: That's right.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.180
OK, so--

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.250
by the way, also, one minor
thing you want to change is

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.790
about the URL type.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.110
This has to match
your bundle ID.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.710
CHRIS CARTLAND: Where's
that again?

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.660
This is in the--

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.960
XIANGTIAN DAI: This is in the
info section for your target.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.400
So in the last column, in the
last sections, URL types.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.860
This register URL, your
app will handle.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.350
CHRIS CARTLAND: OK.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.420
Cool.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.530
XIANGTIAN DAI: So here, now
let's go to the Google+ sample

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.830
share view controller
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:23.920
This is the file that
handles the sharing.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.106
Let's see.

00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:28.220
At first, you're going
to initialize this.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.300
Initialized by setting delegated
to itself, to the

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.190
view controller itself.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.510
So basically, in GPP share,
share instance, you'll set

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.820
delegate to this view controller
instance self, so

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.440
that this view controller will
be able to get notifications

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:50.060
back when a user has posted,
or canceled a post.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.810
Next, you'll see a list
of actions, of verbs.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.610
These are for interactive
posts.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.130
Inside interaction posts,
there's a call to action,

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.780
which one labels.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:09.150
And here we list all possible
actions, or labels, for

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.650
demonstration purposes.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.390
But in practice, your app will
pick one action that best fits

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.305
your needs.

00:10:16.305 --> 00:10:19.270
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah, So we just
listed all of the options

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.190
for the call to action button.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.050
You will want to pick whichever
one is most

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.180
meaningful for your app, so if
your app has something that

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.310
people can buy, when someone
shares an item, you'll

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.110
probably want to put the buy
call to action, so that the

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.210
user knows that they can make
a purchase when they

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.990
click on that post.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.220
If you have an invite share, so
like I want to have other

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.880
people join the service with me,
I might have the call to

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.370
action say join.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.970
And there's a whole bunch
of other ones.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.560
If you have a music app, you
might say that someone who

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.095
clicks on this button
is going to listen.

00:10:53.095 --> 00:10:56.260
So all of those verbs are listed
here, so you can choose

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:59.060
which one you want.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.270
But you'll make that decision in
your app, whereas this list

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.320
just makes it easy for the
user to do the sample.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.120
XIANGTIAN DAI: OK.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.300
Let's see what happens
when you actually

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.550
tap the Share button.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.260
Whoops.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.520
Share it.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.360
Yep.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.480
Here, the first thing you'll
do is to get a share view

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.720
instance by calling
GPP share, share

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.110
instance, share dialogue.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.660
So this will give you a share
filter instance, which you can

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.500
fill in these parameters for
this share diagloue.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.430
The first parameter you
could fill is the URL.

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:48.320
So your post contains the
content of web URL.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.630
And so you can fill this URL in
so that our share dialogue

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.560
could render a preview for
this sys web page.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.290
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah, and that
preview could have a picture,

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.920
title, description.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.970
Kind of basic stuff, so that you
can actually see that in

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.360
the Google+ before you
click on the link.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.220
XIANGTIAN DAI: Alternately, if
your share content, if the

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.160
content of the post does not
have a web presence, you can

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.630
also manually assemble the
title, description, and some

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.770
URL by what's called set
title description

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.960
some URL message here.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.740
Now we come to the
deep link ID.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:31.290
A deep link ID is a string that
can be passed directly to

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.750
your app so that when a user
taps on this post, she's

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:43.030
directed into this particular
state of view of your app.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.070
CHRIS CARTLAND: So deep link
ID is just a string.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.890
Developers get to completely
specify it.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:54.520
What happens is when a user
create a share, developers

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.170
attach a deep link
ID to that share.

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.720
When a user clicks on that post
on a mobile device, iOS

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.100
or Android, they will be taken
to your app, and your app will

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.610
be given the deep link ID so
that the user can be taken

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.030
directly to where they should
be in that app.

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.740
So in the case of when you buy
something, you probably want

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.580
to take them to the item that
they were going to purchase.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.430
And in the case that you were
listening to a song, you

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.720
probably want to take them
to that exact song.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.580
XIANGTIAN DAI: That's right.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:26.130
So with that set up, content
deep link ID here by setting

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.520
content deep link ID.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.420
And that the next thing
is the pre-field text.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:35.070
A pre-field text provides you
that good start before the

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.410
actual text content
of the post.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.920
So the user does not have
to start from scratch.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.290
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah, so
this is really cool.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.250
You can pick a meaningful
message for that user and help

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.480
them get started with the share
message in the text, and

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.310
the user can always change it,
because they might start out

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:53.630
with, hey, come join
me in my app.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:54.600
This is a lot of fun.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.090
And then the user might change
it, and maybe plus mention

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.615
some of their friends, or do
anything else that they want

00:13:59.615 --> 00:14:01.460
with the share.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.870
XIANGTIAN DAI: And now we come
to the focus of today's talk,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.150
the interactive post.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:10.890
We make an interactive
post by setting the

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.980
call to action button.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.045
This call to action button
consists of three parts.

00:14:16.045 --> 00:14:20.340
A label, which is one of the
string, or actions that this

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:25.840
above, and the URL, which the
URL of this call to action

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:30.030
button, it will point to.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.760
And then of course but the
deep link ID, which will

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.235
directly take the user
to your app.

00:14:35.235 --> 00:14:37.170
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah, so this is
really the thing that makes

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.560
an interactive post.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.100
The rest of it is all about
sharing on iOS, but right

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.090
here, this is where you get to
actually specify the label

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:48.780
that appears in the stream,
and this is what will make

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:53.590
your type of your share stand
out among others on Google+ so

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.250
that more people will
click on it.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:57.760
Because they know what they're
going to do when

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.230
they hit that button.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.170
XIANGTIAN DAI: That's right.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.900
OK.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.850
And then the last thing you'll
do is to [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:07.530
open, and the share dialogue
will be opened and waiting for

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:12.710
the user to actually finish the
composition and tap on the

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:14.510
post, the share button.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:15.150
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:17.700
XIANGTIAN DAI: OK, let's see
how this works again.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:18.980
In action.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:23.640
So I'm going to run a sample
app on the simulator.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.780
So this is the main interface
on the Apple app.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.540
Before the user can make an
interactive post, she'll need

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.530
to be signed in with Google.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.765
CHRIS CARTLAND: So this is why
Google+ sign in unlocks an

00:15:36.765 --> 00:15:38.420
interactive post.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.680
So the user will need to go
through this consent flow and

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.500
agree to sign in
with your app.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.400
And then once they've done
that, they can click on a

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.390
share button, which in
this case will be

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.090
an interactive share.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:51.660
XIANGTIAN DAI: Yeah.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.430
That's [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.640
That's a bookmark.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:54.990
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:58.080
So a [INAUDIBLE] bookmark, and
this might make sense if your

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.470
app has topics or items
that users bookmark.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:07.480
And so when they share this
topic out to Google+, they

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.510
think that others should be
bookmarking it as well.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.300
XIANGTIAN DAI: That's right.

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.930
And the other share, let's just
put it as our developed

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:18.910
doc, and let's prefield
text with

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.710
welcome to Google+ platform.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:27.251
And let's tap on share, and we
can see the share dialogue.

00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:27.630
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.700
So the things you'll see are the
pre-field text, welcome to

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.870
Google+ platform.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.010
You see the preview,
which was generated

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.320
from the content URL.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.730
And most importantly, you'll see
the call to action down at

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:43.680
the bottom, and it
says bookmark.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.480
And this is what makes an
interactive post interactive.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.060
You can click on that, and it
will be taken directly to the

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.700
app so you can bookmark
something.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.060
Depending on how good you are
at picking that button, you

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:59.936
can actually drive a lot
more users to your app.

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:00.380
XIANGTIAN DAI: OK.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.785
And the user will just tap
on share, and-- oops.

00:17:03.785 --> 00:17:04.750
It's done.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:05.099
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:06.650
XIANGTIAN DAI: It has
stated success.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.390
So this is just a simple app
simulator, and let's see how

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.089
our actual app works.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:14.520
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.980
So we're going to go over
to a real device,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.720
instead of the simulator.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.030
And so there are some
interactive posts in the

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.040
Google+ stream, and I
see this one here.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.230
And it says there's
an unbreakable

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.870
self defense umbrella.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.070
Well, I know everyone
wants one of these.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.650
And that what I see on the
post is a Buy button.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.210
And so this is the interactive
post part.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.590
And if I see this in my stream,
then I think, maybe I

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.990
do want an unbreakable
umbrella.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.240
I will click the Buy button,
because I know that I can

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.590
actually purchase it
on the other end.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:55.610
When I click the Buy button,
I'm taken to the fancy app,

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.320
and I'm not just taken to the
app, but I'm actually taken

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.010
into the app, deep to where that
unbreakable self defence

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:03.000
umbrella exists.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.970
And I can see the man standing
on the umbrella, and I can

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.130
also see how I can add
it to my cart.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.360
So it's a very easy way
for me to get from

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.350
Google+ into an app.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.460
And it's also a very easy way
for me to actually buy

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.410
something, if I wanted this.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:25.430
So that's really powerful,
because developers at the

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:30.210
Fancy got to choose buy
as the call to action.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.320
I mentioned that music apps
could say listen.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.420
So if I click the Listen button,
I'd be taken to the

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.160
app, and then the music would
already start playing.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.840
So it's a really nice experience
for users, and it's

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.970
really up to your creativity to
see how you can make your

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.900
apps better with interactive
posts.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.960
So that's what we
wanted to demo.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.100
I think that there are some
questions that people have

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.430
about interactive posts.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.280
If you have any more, feel
free to leave those, of

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.370
course, on the Google+ event,
or on YouTube, and we'll be

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:05.380
sure to get to them.

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.590
The first comment on here is
do I have to choose between

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.460
interactive posts and
the original share?

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.326
So original type of share.

00:19:14.326 --> 00:19:14.790
Yeah.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:15.570
Xiangtian?

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.340
XIANGTIAN DAI: Sure.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:16.610
Sure.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.220
The interactive post has a super
set of functionalities

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.750
over original share, so that
it contains all of what

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:30.690
original share can do, plus
more, which is this call to

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:33.860
action button, which potentially
lets your app

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.840
stand out in the stream and
leads more users, more traffic

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.850
to your app.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.250
Now of course, whether this call
to action button suits

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.490
your needs is dependant on
individual app developers.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:52.060
So you may want to try it out
to see how it works for you.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:52.610
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:55.570
So you can choose that last
little bit where you add the

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.750
call to action is the place
where you decide whether you

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.850
want to use this or not.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.940
Another common question here.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.440
Currently the Share button
redirects users to Safari for

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.710
a mobile web share instead
of a native

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:09.240
Google+ share dialogue.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.430
Is there a way to avoid this?

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:14.260
So unfortunately, the answer to
this is that right now, you

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.140
have to use Safari in order to
do the interactive post share.

00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:19.490
But that's a good point.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.180
We should try and get that into
the Share app, and we'll

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:22.900
work on it.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.240
So, yeah.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.810
That's a good question.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.290
All right, yeah.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.610
Thanks so much for
joining us today.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:34.530
Everything we talked about is on
developers.google.com/plus.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.550
If you have any further
questions, we have a pretty

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:42.090
good Google+ Developers'
community, and we're also on

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.410
Stack Overflow.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.780
So if you have any questions
about interactive posts, the

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.720
platform in general, if you want
me to fix your computer,

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.060
that's probably not the
best place for it.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:55.970
But just be sure to join us
next week as we talk more

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:57.250
about more topics.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.130
So, thanks Xiangtian for
joining us today.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.970
XIANGTIAN DAI: Thank
you, Chris, for

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:01.545
letting me join you.

00:21:01.545 --> 00:21:02.080
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.550
That was great.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:03.920
Bye.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.170
XIANGTIAN DAI: Bye.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:22:22.067
[MUSIC PLAYING]
