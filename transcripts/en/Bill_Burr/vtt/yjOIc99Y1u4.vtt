1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.890
On,
Hey,
what's going on?
It's bill burn.

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.870
It's time for the Monday morning podcasts for Monday.
Uh,

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.130
match fourth,

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.540
2019 what's going on?
Oh,
why?
Yeah,
I know I'm really late.
I'm really late.

5
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:20.410
But yesterday was the first taping my next special,
uh,

6
00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:22.840
at Royal Albert Hall and tonight is the next one.

7
00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:26.380
So yesterday I had a bunch of stuff I had to do,

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.730
uh,
for like the intro or the special and all of that type of stuff.

9
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.620
So it went great last night,

10
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.700
had an awesome time and a number taped a special war.

11
00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:39.220
I always just did like two shows one night done.

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.510
I've never done like a show and then waited a whole day and then do another
show.

13
00:00:43.511 --> 00:00:44.800
So,
uh,

14
00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:48.670
I'm just looking tonight like I could not have been more thrilled with how it

15
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:50.380
went last night.
Um,

16
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.170
did not have any of this stupid torture that happens afterwards where you just

17
00:00:56.171 --> 00:01:00.010
like,
Oh God,
why did I do this?
And I'll tell have I didn't say that.

18
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.790
Is anybody going to like me after this?
I didn't do any of that shit.

19
00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:06.460
I was just like,
all right,
I miss something here,
Miss,
who gives a fuck?
Right.

20
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.050
But yeah,
it's fine.
I don't give a shit.
It's all going to be good.
So,
um,

21
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.900
tonight I'm just going to go out and have a good time.
And,
um,

22
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.600
as excited as I was to record this special a after last night,

23
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:20.700
I kind of felt a little bit of sadness of like,

24
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:25.210
I'm really gonna miss these jokes.
I've never had that feeling before.

25
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.690
Um,
but I know the next ones would come in or whatever,

26
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:32.320
but it's kind of hitting me here is I'm doing this like,
wow,

27
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:35.230
this is kind of the end of the run for these jokes,
you know?

28
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.980
And then I just move on like bill Bixby right at the end of the hulk.

29
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.850
Just walk away from the act.
Um,

30
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.530
and the smartest thing I did was I already did a Gig at,
um,
Royal Albert Hall.

31
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.110
Ah,
AH,
for fuck sake.
Somebody else just come
and hang on,
hang on,

32
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:57.400
hang on,
hang on.
Sorry.
Has had pies.

33
00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.530
Fucking rang the doorbell and then rings it again.

34
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.400
Like the fucking hotel's on fire.
Oh,
sorry to disturb you.

35
00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:06.070
Just want to know if you need anything in the mini.
I've got,
thank you.

36
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.260
We assuming I'm not fucking here to fucking rings.

37
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:13.590
What if I was sitting here with my fucking balls?
Hang out.

38
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.120
You're going to ring it that fast and then you walk in and then let me guess I'm

39
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:21.020
in trouble.
Right?
Is it true you had your balls out sir?
Well,
yes,
I was in those.

40
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:25.400
Shut up.
There was a woman knocking on that door.

41
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:28.940
You should have realized that any second someone could come walk again.

42
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.680
MMM.
By the way,

43
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:37.340
is that John Wayne stuff?
The dumbest thing.

44
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.330
What is this thing now where we're just going to dig up dead people and just,

45
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.130
did you see what they said in 1964 well I have,

46
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.810
I imagined nothing good.

47
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.190
They've fucking got this documentary coming out about Michael Jackson.

48
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.910
It's just like the guy dead
like so I,

49
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.710
I don't understand like what the fuck would they every other day now somebody

50
00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:09.110
dead.
Somebody got to come along and fucking dig him up and be,
hey,
you know,
they,

51
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.990
they,
you know,

52
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.410
I don't know how much you enjoy this music if you know that the person did this.

53
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.820
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.980
<v 0>Why did they only do it to famous people?</v>

55
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.830
Can all of us dig up our grandparents and be like,
yeah,

56
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.020
remember when you said that

57
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.790
all of these fucking eat I just do.
I do not fucking get it.

58
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.290
I don't fucking get it.
Can you believe
this?

59
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:45.291
This fucking guy who was born in 1907 sounded like a guy who was born in 1907

60
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:49.950
yes.
Yes I can.
Whose grandparents don't go out and say crazy shit.

61
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.640
That's the new fucking thing on earth,

62
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.510
on earth of fucking interview from 40 50 years ago.

63
00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.610
And then line it up with today's,

64
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.600
you know what's right and you don't have to go back that far.

65
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.660
Go back into somebody who's Twitter history.
Remember when you said this?
Yeah,
no,

66
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.780
no.
Remember when we will all saying that,
that's what you supposed to say.
Oh,

67
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:17.460
you know what?
You mother fucking cock sucking fucking assholes.
What now?

68
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.620
I swear to God,
this fucking bullshit.
Hello?

69
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.993
You have what?

70
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.430
Miss who?
I don't know who that is.

71
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.123
<v 1>All right.
Bye.</v>

72
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.500
<v 0>I have miss semi,
Ms Kimmy.
I don't know.
Go.
Fuck that is.</v>

73
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.253
<v 1>MMM.</v>

74
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.850
<v 0>Anyways,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
That's like the new fucking thing.</v>

75
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.950
The new fucking thing is to go back in time and just look up APA.

76
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.470
Quite evidently Truman Capote,
he was,

77
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.660
he wasn't in his fucking Truman as we thought.
He was.

78
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.660
Just think about someone just before all the fucking jokes.

79
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.810
I literally saw somebody get an interview the other day and they were talking

80
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:21.280
about the office,
the American version,
and they asked,

81
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:25.040
could you make that today?
And the,
Oh,
no,
no,
we,
we can never do that.
We go,

82
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.990
most of those jokes wouldn't work today.
That was 10 fucking years ago.

83
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.850
All right.
So Jesus Christ,
enough with,

84
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.960
with the fucking shock and are that you're going to dig up somebody who died 40

85
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:40.580
fucking years ago when they said something surprising.

86
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.283
<v 1>MMM.</v>

87
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.690
<v 0>It's like if you were born in 1907 and so many interviewed you 40 years ago,</v>

88
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.830
you would not want that interview to be made fucking public.
You wouldn't,

89
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.270
um,
anyways,
what fucking world that we live in that the,

90
00:05:56.271 --> 00:06:00.620
the office now considered too edgy for television.
Oh,
James is,

91
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.280
you could never do,

92
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.800
it wasn't the most absurd fucking shows you ever saw in your life.

93
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.653
<v 1>MMM.</v>

94
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.600
<v 0>I Dunno,</v>

95
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.210
but that's where we are because that's where we are because 8% of the fucking

96
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.470
best,
my rough as far as I can tell the people that I talk to,

97
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.980
everybody else was just like,
dude,
what is the big fucking deal?

98
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.333
<v 1>Okay.</v>

99
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.350
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,
it's fucking hilarious.</v>

100
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.020
Someday you're going to sound like you fucking grandparents.

101
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.480
Someday you're going to be in your fucking seventies.

102
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.140
And something you said in your forties is going to sound fucking ridiculous.

103
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.070
Like nobody's like,
it's,
nobody's allowed to,
like I don't,
I dunno.

104
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.150
I don't even,
I don't even fucking,

105
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.420
and I don't understand all of these fucking people that are going on social

106
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:43.850
media doing this.
It's just I was really,
what about you?

107
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.220
If I,
if anybody gave a fuck about you,
you know,

108
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:51.770
named Kent and went back into your fucking life.

109
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:54.830
They can't find somebody to say that you said something or did something.

110
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.830
It's called being a human being.
Jesus fucking Christ.

111
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.810
I told you that shit when I was in Scotland.

112
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:02.120
That woman lifts that wrote that fucking article.

113
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.790
Let's talk about crew member of statues and she's like,

114
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.740
nothing makes my heart sink.

115
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.910
Like when I hear they're going to put up a commemorative statue,

116
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:11.810
it's like nothing

117
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.710
be fucking a genocide child pornography.

118
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.680
Nothing quite makes you fucking heart drop.

119
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.590
Like the making of a commemorative statue.

120
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.353
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

121
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.630
<v 0>Oh,
Jay Z.
MMM.
Okay.</v>

122
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.643
Anyways.

123
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.960
Can you believe Christopher Columbus was actually a fucking asshole?

124
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

125
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.120
<v 0>New evidence shows.
It's just like,
where was that new evidence?</v>

126
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.540
What was it just sitting on somebody's desk for fucking 40 years?

127
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.213
<v 1>MMM.</v>

128
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.620
<v 0>He's a fan of all these fucking people compared to what?
Somebody in 2019 yeah.</v>

129
00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:57.550
I would like to think that people learn how to treat other people better each

130
00:07:57.551 --> 00:07:59.530
year.
So what we're supposed to be doing,

131
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.550
you know what I mean?
If you go back and watch an episode of solid gold,

132
00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:08.470
there's a lot of people dancing today that,
uh,

133
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:10.750
on that day that would get laughed out of the fucking club.

134
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.310
And that was the peak of dancing back then.

135
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.520
But it progressed and now all those moves that were unbelievable and now kind of

136
00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:25.600
basic,
that's what happens.
It just gotta,
you know?

137
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

138
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.480
<v 0>Can you believe the guy that won the Indy 519 55 wouldn't even really qualified</v>

139
00:08:33.031 --> 00:08:35.040
for the race in 2019?

140
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.570
I don't think this guy's a champion.

141
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.060
I think they need to rethink that chip.
Chip.

142
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.000
Do I bend?
We always draw going on and 40 miles an hour.
I mean,

143
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:56.970
the fucking pace guarded.
He goes faster than that.
Um,

144
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.990
I dunno.
And as such,
just,
I,
I,
it's uh,

145
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.520
all right.
If it does that do anything,
does it really do anything to say,
Hey,

146
00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:13.510
this guy who's,
who's been dead for 40 years is,
is actually this now?

147
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.380
So what am I supposed to do now?

148
00:09:17.381 --> 00:09:20.830
Go back and look at this person's sports career where they're fucking movie

149
00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:21.664
career

150
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.790
and look at them differently somehow and then sit there and look at myself like

151
00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:31.180
I'm this great fucking person just because I had the luxury of being born when I

152
00:09:31.181 --> 00:09:32.014
was born

153
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.670
and then be so fucking full of myself that I'm not looking at this guy being

154
00:09:36.671 --> 00:09:39.160
like,
well wait a minute.
Someday I'm going to be dead 40 years.

155
00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:43.180
And then people will go back and see the things that I said and in my mind like

156
00:09:43.181 --> 00:09:44.200
I'm going to survive that.

157
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.540
<v 1>Um,
all right,
bill,
I think you made your point.
All right.</v>

158
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.220
<v 0>You know,
a lot of people think Abe Lincoln's had good guy.</v>

159
00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.650
Apparently new evidence shows

160
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.210
he went to a fucking Sadie Hawkins dance and a,

161
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.920
he evidently he was fucking quite rude to his date that night.

162
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:16.380
Four score,
Hashtag four score and seven beers ago.
Drink much a boy.

163
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.280
I don't know.
Um,
anyways,
whatever.

164
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.920
Uh,
so I got one more.
One more fucking night.
See,

165
00:10:24.921 --> 00:10:27.680
this is what I want to open with tonight.
This is what I want to talk about.

166
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.520
Get this out of my fucking system,
but I,
I've,

167
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.640
I have to fucking document my jokes tonight,

168
00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:38.380
so I want to thank everybody that she came out in Manchester,
Glasgow,

169
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.030
and Birmingham.

170
00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.840
I had a great time and found out that I was not dehydrated.

171
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.590
I actually had a little bit of a stomach virus.

172
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.490
I can't believe it with this high quality food that I've been eating here for

173
00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:55.720
the last fucking 10 days old.
Jesus here.
Um,

174
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.200
oh my God.
I,
I just don't know if I'm,
I'm just,

175
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:00.870
I have to be going into the wrong places,

176
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:03.630
but what they do to what cheeseburger over here,
it's just like,

177
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.490
<v 1>Huh?</v>

178
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.910
<v 0>As an American it's offensive.
I feel like it's,
it's a,</v>

179
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:11.890
one of our signature dishes,

180
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.920
<v 1>what we added to the,
um,</v>

181
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.580
international culinary fucking whatever.
Right?

182
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.410
Sorry.
Let's try to be eloquent there.
Um,

183
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.620
<v 0>for them to just fucking make it the way that they make it,</v>

184
00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:28.150
about telling me it was just,
it's just something,

185
00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:29.200
there's just something wrong about it.

186
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:30.903
<v 1>Um,</v>

187
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.880
but I keep ordering them in hopes that someone's going to get it right.

188
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:37.843
Um,

189
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:41.790
<v 0>but anyways,
yeah,
it turned out I have a a,
I had like a stomach virus now.</v>

190
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:43.050
I think I'm past it.

191
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.810
<v 1>Um,
so</v>

192
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.500
<v 0>I can give my all to my dick and shit jokes tonight.
Uh,
rest in peace.
Luke Perry,</v>

193
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.550
um,
Jesus Christ,
52 fucking years old with kids.

194
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.920
That's a scary one man.
And the guy weighed like 130 pounds and I felt,
yeah.

195
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.590
And um,
so now I'm on the Internet.
I'm not trying to fucking,
you know,
early signs

196
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.950
of a stroke and how you can screen for it and yeah,

197
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:16.590
you can do this to screen forward,

198
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.140
but don't do it too many times because the scan isn't good for you and it's just

199
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:24.060
like,
so they had the uh,
all these lists here,

200
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.420
like the top causes.
This is for all old men like me.
All right,
here we go.

201
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:34.150
Top causes for stroke.
All right,

202
00:12:34.151 --> 00:12:37.690
here we go.
Come on hotel.
All right.

203
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.840
Is a hypertension high blood pressure.

204
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.710
I was psyched when the doctor came and took my blood precious that I have the

205
00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:48.700
blood pressure,
but 25 year old,
he goes,
do you work out a lot?
And I said,

206
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.440
I do work out a lot.
High cholesterol.

207
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.320
I don't have that,
uh,
diabetes.

208
00:12:56.321 --> 00:13:00.010
I don't have that central obesity.
That means having a belly.

209
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.120
I don't have that smoking.
I do that.

210
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.600
So that's the one I got to get out because a,
I'm not living for myself anymore.

211
00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:12.340
I live in for the Kiddos.
So,
and I've come to this,
this,

212
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.960
this realization

213
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.283
<v 1>of a,</v>

214
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.940
<v 0>if my posing,
I finally figured it out,</v>

215
00:13:21.941 --> 00:13:24.370
I figured out what kind of drinking at drinker I am,

216
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:28.060
why it's gone off the rails while of a sudden it became this guy that needed to

217
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:32.800
take breaks.
And um,
yeah,

218
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:37.450
the big thing that I liked how I fucked up was I brought it into the house.

219
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.950
All right.
And if I can give anybody any young man,

220
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.980
young woman out there fucking [inaudible] fucking transfer in a humanoid,

221
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:52.030
whatever the fuck you supposed to say.
One of those tr words.

222
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.333
<v 1>All right.</v>

223
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.260
<v 0>Yeah.
Listen to this little clip in 40 years.
Okay.</v>

224
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:01.190
We'll see if they take it down my fucking monument at the innovators of

225
00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:05.930
podcasting in the filthy wing at the podcast museum.

226
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.351
Right.

227
00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:10.790
See if they don't want to take down my fucking golden statue with the fucking

228
00:14:10.791 --> 00:14:13.720
orange leaf,
let over my balls.
Um,

229
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:19.830
you don't want to bring your vices home with you.
Okay?

230
00:14:19.831 --> 00:14:23.580
You want to have to go out and get them.
All right.
So,
uh,

231
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.720
the where I fucked up is I ended up getting,

232
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:30.720
having a booze collection at home and because I was buying some higher end

233
00:14:30.721 --> 00:14:34.440
stuff,
a,
you start to think,
oh,
well I'm like a collector.
I'm a connoisseur.
No,

234
00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:38.820
dude,
you're a fucking booze hound.
So,
um,

235
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.710
I'm just gradually just given bottles away.
I got some Pappy van Winkle.

236
00:14:43.711 --> 00:14:46.290
I'm not giving that away,
you know,
but I have some,

237
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.980
a couple nicer bottles of things that cost me whatever,

238
00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:54.080
80 a hundred bucks or but like to be,
um,

239
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.510
I still want my kids see me drinking.
Okay.

240
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.980
Obviously my kid can listen to the podcast,
know what I was.
But like I said,

241
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.860
I don't want to be doing that.
I don't want to be smoking cigars in front of her.

242
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:07.700
I don't be drinking fucking booze,
none of that shit.
She asked me about it.

243
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.970
I'll tell her what I did.
I'll be honest with them in the telehealth,

244
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.500
how fucking stupid was,
how much time I wasted and all that type of shit.

245
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.820
You know,
I did have a good time,
you know,
whatever.
But anyways,
I just say,

246
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:24.490
I just don't think it's a good look.
You'd be sitting at home fucking

247
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:27.163
booze.
It

248
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.710
not that I've ever done that in front of her.
I wait till she goes to sleep,

249
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.400
but there's been nights where I'm just like,
wow dude,
I am like,
you're like,

250
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.530
you know,
rolling the dice here.

251
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.800
Cause God forbid I'm down here legally fucking hammered.

252
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:48.080
And what if my wife had some sort of medical issue?
Now I'm drunk,

253
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:50.690
I got to get my kid and my wife.
Now I have,
what do I do here?

254
00:15:50.691 --> 00:15:53.870
I got to fucking call an Uber and all of this shit cause I'm too drunk to drive.

255
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.550
Or do you like just call the fucking ambulance?

256
00:15:55.551 --> 00:15:58.430
I'm going to be standing there fucking hammered as somebody chefs.

257
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:01.370
Not a good look.
That's not specified.
Something that dad does,

258
00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.920
but not the dad that I want to be.
So I'm getting the shit out of my house.
Uh,

259
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:10.100
I decided I'm taking the year off and then next year,
uh,

260
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:14.000
I'll see what I want to do.
But if there's anything that I want to do,

261
00:16:14.001 --> 00:16:18.380
I'm going to have to go out and go get it.
Um,
and that goes for the cigars too.

262
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.053
Um,

263
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:20.780
<v 1>yeah.</v>

264
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.870
<v 0>I'm,
I'm going to drastically cut that down.
And um,</v>

265
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.240
I don't know.
But then I remember hearing this quote that said,

266
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.980
be where the man with no vice or something like that.
Uh,

267
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.530
man with no vice saying,

268
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:45.560
let's see what it is.
What is this thing?
Show me a man.

269
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.810
Here we go.
Show me a man without vice

270
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.253
and where is it?

271
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:54.750
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

272
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:59.730
<v 0>show me a man without vice and I'll show you one without virtue.
Now,</v>

273
00:16:59.731 --> 00:17:01.920
you know that,
doesn't that just sound like some dumb shit.

274
00:17:01.921 --> 00:17:03.360
A drunk would say at a bar.

275
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

276
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.890
<v 0>Uh,
wait,
he doesn't js bucket doing something.
Um,</v>

277
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.440
for man,
let's see something here.

278
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.690
Vice is vice quotes.
I actually,

279
00:17:19.691 --> 00:17:23.950
I don't understand that.
It's like,
so if you live like a vizsla this life,

280
00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:25.570
then you have no virtue.

281
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:28.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

282
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:32.720
<v 0>What is a virtue?
What is the actual definition?
So on virtuous,</v>

283
00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:36.790
I am
behaviors showing high moral standards.
So if you,

284
00:17:36.791 --> 00:17:38.470
if you don't have any low moral standards,

285
00:17:38.471 --> 00:17:40.090
you won't have any high moral standards.

286
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:42.340
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

287
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:45.550
<v 0>So if you,
if you're not fucking blow ins a couple of rails,</v>

288
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.010
that means you're not going to help a fucking old lady across the street.

289
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.960
Why can't you be the guy who was not doing blow,
not boozing,

290
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.433
<v 1>eating,</v>

291
00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.690
<v 0>you know,
and a healthy way and being a family man and,
and also be a good person.</v>

292
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.553
I don't understand that.

293
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:03.613
<v 1>You know,</v>

294
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.570
<v 0>is it because if you meet somebody that's strong enough,</v>

295
00:18:07.571 --> 00:18:11.740
is this just insecurity by fucking people that have vices?
Um,

296
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.240
cause I gotta be honest with them.
Fight if I can,

297
00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.930
if I can get rid of if bows and I didn't smoke cigars,

298
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.880
I think that's it.
That's what I do.
I drink and smoke.
So now I'm not drinking.

299
00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.040
Since I've been over here,
I've had one cigar,
you know,
I barely smoke.

300
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.720
If I get rid of that,

301
00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.123
<v 1>you know,</v>

302
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.050
<v 0>then what?
Jesus Christ.
Well then the bill,</v>

303
00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:42.620
you have the most boring fucking podcasts in the history of podcasting,
I guess.

304
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.093
<v 1>MMM.</v>

305
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.350
<v 0>I Dunno.
I,
I got it.
I'll figure it out though.
But I,</v>

306
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:51.320
I don't want to be this guy just like,
you know,

307
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.080
I never have a drink or I never have a cigar.

308
00:18:54.081 --> 00:18:57.440
I just got to get it out of my fucking house.
All right.

309
00:18:57.441 --> 00:18:59.980
I feel like invited a vampire and you know,

310
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:04.880
like I'm in the lost boys except with booze and cigars.
Um,
sort of,

311
00:19:04.881 --> 00:19:05.690
I'll do that.

312
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.470
Then I'll just sit there and judge my wife every time she has a rosy,
nice,

313
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.210
nice example that you're setting.

314
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.390
<v 1>Um,
I've gotta be honest with you,
London,
I'm loving it.</v>

315
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.510
<v 0>You know,
I was never really a London of guy was more Paris guy.</v>

316
00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.050
I don't know what happened.
Now I'm starting to like London a little better.

317
00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:30.910
You know,
despite the fucking food,
Jesus Christ,

318
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:33.950
Jesus Christ at that,

319
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.740
do you know the amount of places that they conquered with all these spices in

320
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.590
there?
I always heard that they brought him back.
I could,

321
00:19:39.591 --> 00:19:44.460
God knows and I fucking use them.
I tend to be,
I don't know where to go.
You know,

322
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.290
they've got too many fucking celebrities out here.

323
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:50.930
All the spice girls to spice girls.
Right.
Where do they eat these?

324
00:19:50.931 --> 00:19:55.010
No way they put up with this food.
There's no way.
I know last time I came here,

325
00:19:55.011 --> 00:19:58.610
I went to this Indian,
uh,
restaurant that was fucking unbelievable.

326
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.900
And I also went to the ivy the other night and I had the best shepherds five

327
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.640
overhead.
Um,
so it hasn't been all bad,
but I'll just tell him,

328
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.720
oof.
Everything else I've gone to manage.
It's like comedy club,

329
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:16.730
Green Room Bad.
Um,
all right.
But we get it.
You don't like the fucking food?

330
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:21.560
I'm sorry.
So what's going on in the world of America?
I miss the good old USA.

331
00:20:21.561 --> 00:20:26.390
Let's see what,
when I want to go to search you s a news.
Let's see what happens.

332
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.470
President Donald Trump's serves fast food to another title team.

333
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.390
Yeah.
This is how broke we are after fucking these wars.

334
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.630
Why does he keep doing that?
Does he do this to anybody else?
Let's see.

335
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:50.260
President Donald Trump service food to another title team,
North Dakota State,

336
00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:56.190
another championship football team.
Well,
you know what?

337
00:20:56.191 --> 00:20:59.010
This is North Dakota state and there's a lot of white guys on there.

338
00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.690
He's still giving them fast food.
Dude,

339
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.610
I'd love to eat McDonald's in the White House.
It's kind of fucking cool.
Trump.

340
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:09.460
Welcome the football championships subdivision champions,

341
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.020
the North Dakota State Bison.

342
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.400
You get him some bison burgers there to the White House on Monday and according

343
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:18.280
to a pool report,
he served them a lunchtime spread,

344
00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:23.020
a big Mac chick filet sandwiches and French fries among other fast food items.

345
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.100
Trumps served a similar meal to the Clemson Tigers while they visited the White

346
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.650
House in January.
According to the pool report,

347
00:21:29.651 --> 00:21:33.730
Trump told the bisons that he couldn't serve them a meal prepared by the chef.

348
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.680
But I know you people,
several players laughed.
Oh,

349
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:41.200
that he could have served them a meal prepared by the chef.

350
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.880
But I know you people,
several players left according to the pool report.

351
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:51.520
A Trump said in January that he personally paid for Clemson's Whitehouse faced

352
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.880
it's a feast now because it's visit came in the middle of a partial government

353
00:21:57.071 --> 00:22:01.390
shutdown.
Is this?
Yeah.
Maybe it's just him trying to be cool.

354
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:02.760
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

355
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.730
<v 0>You know,
did he go to college to Trump even go to college?</v>

356
00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:07.123
<v 1>Okay.</v>

357
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.140
<v 0>It's amazing how little I know about this guy,
Donald Trump.</v>

358
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.340
Let's see where the fuck he went.

359
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.570
He probably went to college where his dad went to college

360
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:19.570
and that's why there's a legacy here.

361
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.250
He was one of the greatest students ever of this university.

362
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.253
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

363
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.310
<v 0>Oh,
of course.
This isn't going to show up.
I have no idea.
All right,</v>

364
00:22:29.311 --> 00:22:30.250

you want to do something about it first?

All right.

506
00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.890
And with that,
let's see if Donald Trump's Wikipedia page came up.
It did.

507
00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.260
He was born June 14th,

508
00:32:00.261 --> 00:32:05.120
Gemini 1946.
Uh,

509
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:10.010
his current president is born and raised in New York borough of Queens.

510
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:15.740
He got an economics degree from the Wharton School.
That's a good one.

511
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.740
You know,
I know that's a good ones.
I've never really heard of it,

512
00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.960
which means it's a high end one

513
00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.830
was not on my radar to be applied to.

514
00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:30.340
He was appointed president of his family's real estate business in 1971.

515
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:32.270
Look at that.

516
00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:36.410
He was only 25 years old and he took on that level of responsibility.

517
00:32:36.411 --> 00:32:40.640
Everybody else gets to go out to a fucking bar and drink,
you know,

518
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.820
sing some Karaoke.
And he had to take over the family's real estate business.

519
00:32:46.821 --> 00:32:50.210
See everybody thinks these rich kids have it easy.
You know,

520
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.190
you poor kids have no idea how lucky you are to be 25 and none of the pressures

521
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:59.970
of a real estate company that take over the company built a renovated skyscraper

522
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.050
skyscrapers to hotels,
casinos and golf courses.

523
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:07.460
Trump later stated various sides started various side ventures including

524
00:33:07.461 --> 00:33:11.930
licensing his name for real estate and consumer products.
Yeah,
that's the genius.

525
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:14.450
That's why when everybody's like giving the finger to a Trump hotel,

526
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:17.450
it's like it's not really his hotel.
Um,

527
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:21.580
early life education.
[inaudible]

528
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.170
conflicts of interest.
I mean this,
this is all here at do.

529
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:29.390
This is all what usually you have on a rich guy's Wikipedia page.
All right,

530
00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:32.870
let's get to the questions cause they're gonna fucking special to tip here

531
00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:37.300
tonight.
Um,
all right.
What's the first question?

532
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.250
Soccer playoffs.
All right.
So I mentioned,

533
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.180
I was saying how weird it is that they don't have a play off play off in the

534
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.860
premier league and how huge that would be.

535
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:49.220
So evidently this person's going to set me straight as to why they don't do it.

536
00:33:49.221 --> 00:33:50.600
Bill,
they don't have,

537
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.840
they don't have soccer in playoffs then playoffs and is what the person metric.

538
00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:01.130
But they happened to have various cup competitions that add a different dynamic

539
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:04.190
to the mix.
When you think about,
think about it,

540
00:34:04.191 --> 00:34:07.400
it's extremely stupid to have playoffs in the first place.

541
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:12.970
Why would the most consistent and best team to top a table in any sport over the

542
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:19.010
duration of a season not get recognized as the best team?
While easily.

543
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.250
Well that's easy.
While in our world,
you know,

544
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:26.480
you have people just the way shit lines up who was in your division,

545
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:30.890
you end up playing a tougher schedule than somebody else,
you know?

546
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:33.260
And it also depends like when you play somebody,

547
00:34:33.261 --> 00:34:36.710
if their best player was hurt and then the other team comes to play him and that

548
00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.340
guy's player is back.
You know what I mean?
All of a sudden,

549
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:44.670
you know there's so it just like you play a whole season in somebody,

550
00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.160
one point behind you,

551
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:51.760
you're the champion in there that I don't know.
I like playoffs.

552
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.920
And then also play offs ads like this pressure.

553
00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:00.050
Whereas the team that's supposed to when all of a sudden feels this pressure and

554
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:02.450
then they could choke and you have great stories,

555
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:07.970
there's plenty of reasons to have playoffs.
Um,
so I don't think it's stupid.

556
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:10.880
It's extremely stupid.

557
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.170
Well then why do you have the World Cup?
Isn't that stupid?

558
00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:18.020
Isn't that a giant fucking planetary fucking play off?

559
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.060
Why isn't everybody just fucking stay home?
Um,

560
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:26.930
anyways,
I don't understand this.
Well that's a cup competition.

561
00:35:26.931 --> 00:35:29.540
That's a different thing.
So you're,
you're,
you're into play playoffs.

562
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:34.160
As long as it's a cup,
it's extremely stupid.
I don't think it is.
Anyway,

563
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.990
hockey is the only sport,
uh,
where

564
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.530
<v 1>I understand and respect the league structure because the Stanley Cup is</v>

565
00:35:41.531 --> 00:35:43.870
arguably the most difficult trophy to win.
All right,

566
00:35:43.871 --> 00:35:45.160
you're all over the map here,
sir.

567
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.350
You can maybe get away with half asking in the regular season to clinch
playoffs,

568
00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.980
but you have a long way to go to hoist the cup.
Uh,

569
00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:57.340
they actually have a playoff format in the English championship,

570
00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:01.210
which is the League right below the premier league.
Uh,

571
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.890
first and second in the table,

572
00:36:02.891 --> 00:36:06.590
automatically advanced to the premier league while third to six,

573
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:11.090
have a two leg match up to get an a final for that third promotion spot.
Oh,

574
00:36:11.091 --> 00:36:14.620
that's cool.
So that's where you play off.
So it's very exciting because there are

575
00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.170
millions of millions of dollars on the line with that final game play off.

576
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:20.830
All right,
so now you like playoffs.

577
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:26.430
Also offside is when the attacking player is passed the final defender at the

578
00:36:27.371 --> 00:36:31.420
point the ball is played.
If you didn't have this in place,

579
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:35.860
players would just cherry pick,
get uh,
all game.

580
00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:40.330
And the beautiful game would be a shit show.
Rat Fest.

581
00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.210
Uh,
come back to um,
yeah,

582
00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:49.510
<v 0>Niagara,
Canada take care.
Um,
I get that shit that you can't just hang.</v>

583
00:36:49.511 --> 00:36:53.440
But my thing is is if somebody's going to run past you,

584
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.000
they're not just cherry pick and hanging down the other end of the field.

585
00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:01.180
If somebody's going to run fast to you and they're faster,

586
00:37:01.181 --> 00:37:04.540
you can just slow down and make them upside.
That's fucking stupid.

587
00:37:04.541 --> 00:37:08.680
That guy's faster than you.
We be you.
That's my problem.
I'm not saying that,

588
00:37:08.681 --> 00:37:09.514
you know.

589
00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:11.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

590
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.650
<v 0>You know,
look in hockey,
they have an off sides line.</v>

591
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.840
You've got to clear the fucking zone when the puck comes out.

592
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:18.570
But like if somebody blows past you with the pop,

593
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.790
they don't have to fucking wait til you get into the zone.

594
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.713
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

595
00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:27.230
<v 0>You know what I mean?
Sorry.
I know it sounds like I'm drinking.</v>

596
00:37:27.231 --> 00:37:31.910
I'm just drinking a giant bottle of water,
glass bottle.
Um,

597
00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.860
fancy man as Jim Norton likes to say.
Um,
all right,

598
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.210
well I get that sir.
I don't think,

599
00:37:38.211 --> 00:37:41.870
I actually think that you actually enjoy playoffs.
Um,

600
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.340
but you also enjoy the premiere league.

601
00:37:43.341 --> 00:37:46.730
So now you have to say that it's extremely stupid.
And of course,

602
00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:49.130
because you're from Canada,
you get it in the hockey.

603
00:37:49.131 --> 00:37:53.240
You understand those playoffs.
All right,
sending food back.
All right,

604
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.900
this is what I wanted to hear from people,
how you go about it.
And he says,

605
00:37:56.901 --> 00:38:01.901
I'm a 28 year old male living amongst you and all the other narcissistic

606
00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:06.980
transplant concept decided they were too good for their hometowns and needed to

607
00:38:06.981 --> 00:38:11.981
move to this coastal eaten that we call Los Angeles and attempt to achieve a

608
00:38:11.991 --> 00:38:15.230
dream of creating career.
Doing what I love.

609
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.910
Parentheses creating slash playing music.
Uh,
well,
sorry.

610
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.150
If you wanted to play music for a living,
you know,

611
00:38:23.151 --> 00:38:28.151
you probably would eventually moved to Los Angeles to get more in the mix or

612
00:38:28.281 --> 00:38:31.970
Nashville.
Don't you move where the industry is?

613
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.120
Um,
at any rate,
um,

614
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:41.750
I guess he's,
he's to be joking that that Los Angeles is an Eden.

615
00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.990
It's not an eat and you had to steal water to try and turn it into a fucking

616
00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.630
eaten.
It's a shit show that shouldn't be there.
But it is.

617
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.780
And what we've done with it is,
is amazing.
I mean,

618
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.560
am I saying we now with Los Angeles,
I've had been there that one.
Um,

619
00:38:54.561 --> 00:38:55.940
at any rate being a musician,

620
00:38:55.941 --> 00:38:58.970
I worked a number of side gigs including waiting tables.

621
00:38:58.971 --> 00:39:03.160
I've waited tables at cheap joints as well as fine dining establishment.

622
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.480
It's like award winning chef dudes.
Oh,
I,

623
00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.270
I think this guy was being sarcastic

624
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:13.290
<v 1>about,
uh,
la.
Um,</v>

625
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.940
<v 0>anyways,
at any rate,
uh,</v>

626
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:19.110
I think I can set you straight on sending food back basically and maybe

627
00:39:19.111 --> 00:39:22.920
obviously the chief of the restaurant,
the riskier it is to send your food back.

628
00:39:22.921 --> 00:39:26.970
Great Point.
Uh,
when I work fine dining,

629
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:31.140
you're primarily in a restaurant with a kitchen is actually open to the public.

630
00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:35.790
So sending food back is handled in front of the clientele and thus would never

631
00:39:35.791 --> 00:39:39.930
be subjected to being fucked with another great point.
Uh,
that being said,

632
00:39:39.931 --> 00:39:44.750
as you go down in price,
typically not always,
your kitchen is getting a little,

633
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.110
little bit more hidden.

634
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.620
You're employees are probably making less and on top of that,

635
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.900
they're probably always,
again,

636
00:39:51.901 --> 00:39:56.040
not always because I realized some cheaper restaurants are amazing quality,

637
00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.790
et Cetera,
not as passionate about what they're doing.
In that case,

638
00:39:59.791 --> 00:40:04.140
your food will possibly get fucked with.
Okay,
here's another person.

639
00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.470
Uh,
hey Billy,
sugar,
tits.

640
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.900
<v 1>MMM.</v>

641
00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:13.110
<v 0>Never worry about sending food back with social media today.</v>

642
00:40:13.111 --> 00:40:16.110
Any decent restaurant would rather you tell them.

643
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.420
Then tell the world that that a meal was poor.
If a Dick,

644
00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.970
if a Dick Ed works in the kitchen,

645
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.000
what if a dick,
he d like the name Ed of a Dick.

646
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.630
Ed Works in the kitchen for Dick head.
Oh,

647
00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:38.570
this person was texting and I guess there was some sort of weird,

648
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.530
you get the capital thing in a space button.
If a dick head works in the kitchen,

649
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:47.320
who's going to spit in your food?
You can guarantee the kitchen's a shithole.

650
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:51.780
Anyways,
see you at Royal Albert Hall on Monday.

651
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:56.510
Wait a minute.
Never worry about sending food back.

652
00:40:56.511 --> 00:40:59.670
And then you ended with,
if a dickhead works in the kitchen,

653
00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:00.770
who's gonna spit in your food?

654
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:03.400
You can guarantee the kitchen's a Shithole anyways.

655
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.320
Meaning it doesn't make a difference cause what's already in the food.

656
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.000
I don't know about that.
All right?

657
00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:15.110
It's not making me feel better.
Alright.

658
00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.920
Formula e a Billy burnout.
Uh,

659
00:41:18.921 --> 00:41:23.690
you mentioned on a recent podcast that the sports low between football and the

660
00:41:23.691 --> 00:41:28.220
start of Formula One,
uh,
March madness,
NBA players,
et Cetera,

661
00:41:28.221 --> 00:41:32.750
has you as you down,
have you tried to watch formula e to fill the,

662
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.420
I'm watching for the first time machine year and it's been great.

663
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:40.900
I got the hiccups now.
This is the all electric racing series.

664
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:45.940
It's real easy to get up to date since the races are time to have a maximum

665
00:41:45.941 --> 00:41:49.780
length of 45 minutes plus one lap.
Um,

666
00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:53.790
the first four races this season are all up on youtube and they're,

667
00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:56.980
they are carried live on Spock's Fox sports two in the US.

668
00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.320
There is no team or set of teams that dominate like in Formula One and there's

669
00:42:02.321 --> 00:42:04.420
been passing Galore and every race.
All right.

670
00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:07.810
And I like this including a photo finish and the last race.

671
00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.830
So it's not about getting to the first corner and blocking for the rest of the

672
00:42:11.831 --> 00:42:12.550
race.

673
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:16.750
There are no pit stops but the teams still have to strategize to conserve energy

674
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.260
so they don't run out of power.
Sure.
The car is don't go as fast,

675
00:42:20.261 --> 00:42:24.610
but the competition makes more,
uh,
more than makes up for it.

676
00:42:24.611 --> 00:42:28.990
In my opinion.
Bonus is in the last two races of the season,

677
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:33.610
seasons will be held back to back days in New York City in July.
Oh Shit.

678
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.580
I might be in New York in July.
Cheers and go fuck yourself.

679
00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.880
Well eventually I feel like those cars will be faster than the Formula One,

680
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:44.930
one cars because I'm just looking at how regular cars are in the street.

681
00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:47.943
You know what I mean?

682
00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:53.330
Like they can make like what a Tesla is shaped like the fact that zero to 60,

683
00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.440
you can beat a fucking Lamborghini.
Um,

684
00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.820
I would think that if you applied that same shit to like a race car and

685
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.540
absolutely no weight other than the battery,
all it comes down to is,

686
00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.650
is if the battery is going to be later than the fucking engine.

687
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:11.523
Um,

688
00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:14.830
and then you don't have all that bullshit under the car where air can get caught

689
00:43:14.831 --> 00:43:17.530
because you can just have that smooth fucking thing like they do underneath the

690
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:22.420
tests.
I don't know.
I would think that the cars are going to get faster.

691
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:27.070
Right.
I don't know.

692
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.760
I do think it's funny that people that are into gas combustion engines will

693
00:43:30.761 --> 00:43:34.180
think it's funny that they can only run them for 45 minutes and ignore the fact

694
00:43:34.181 --> 00:43:39.100
that the gas combustion engines also have to pull over and get gas.
You know,

695
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.200
it's also not a limitless energy source.

696
00:43:44.201 --> 00:43:46.100
What you're going to have is you've got to have solar power.

697
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:50.050
Gave somebody with Jane,
I could saw their panel duct tape to their fucking head,

698
00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.910
all right,
and a Jane magnifying glass above it.

699
00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:57.490
The driver days,
every race,

700
00:43:57.491 --> 00:44:02.020
but there's no pit stops and can still go 500 miles.
That's how I would do it.

701
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.740
All right,
baby name.
You just get people on death row to drive.

702
00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.180
So then also they won't give a fuck.
You know,

703
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:12.010
if there's space in not to go into the corner,
it'll be really fucking excited.

704
00:44:12.011 --> 00:44:16.750
He had death row inmates with a fucking satellite that a satellite or fucking

705
00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.510
what?
He'd done a stroke.
I just said it.

706
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:23.760
Solar panel on their head with the Jane magnifying glass.
All right,

707
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.580
right before they get in the car there,
eat their lead,
their last meal,

708
00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:29.650
whatever it is,
you know,

709
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.940
a little bit of hog and dies of turn up and some fucking chicken,

710
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:34.290
whatever the fuck it is they want,
you know,

711
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:39.510
and you get them in there and that set,
it's like,
all right,
and here's the thing,

712
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:43.350
if you win,
whoever wins doesn't get killed.

713
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.820
Play now because you'd already died.
Oh,
they got it.
Yeah.
Some bow.

714
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.040
Like if you win,
it's like the dirty dozen.
If you win,

715
00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.980
then they let you back out on the street.
Carolyn back on the street.

716
00:44:56.070 --> 00:45:01.020
The fucking murderers.
I don't know.

717
00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:03.330
It's got to be something he can do.
I don't know.

718
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:06.930
Well we ain't gonna let you get to see.
I don't have it all worked out.
All right,

719
00:45:06.931 --> 00:45:10.740
baby name negotiation strategy bell.

720
00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:15.240
My wife and I are having our first baby.
Congratulations.
A baby girl.
Oh,

721
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:17.570
you hit the lottery and we couldn't be happy.

722
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:21.360
Happy are the only issue is picking her name and then Gaucher patients are

723
00:45:21.361 --> 00:45:25.350
deadlocked.
Here's the negotiation positions.
All right.

724
00:45:25.351 --> 00:45:29.610
I'm going to tell you this before I go any further.
All right?

725
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.050
Never tell your daughter about this.
All right?
Whatever her name is,

726
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.250
that's her name.
If you lose or your wife loses on the debate,

727
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.810
do not fucking bring that up to your kid.
Whatever their name is.
The name.

728
00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:44.510
All right.
All right.
My wife's tastes.

729
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:49.370
The names could be best described as somewhere between Hollywood diva and in

730
00:45:49.371 --> 00:45:52.230
1960s,
flower child.
Oh my God.

731
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:57.210
Think names like apple and Moonbeam.
Uh,

732
00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.770
Layla like the Eric Clapton Song is their best idea to date,

733
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.370
but it wouldn't be my first choice.
No,
that song's too popular.

734
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:08.870
Um,
I dunno.

735
00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:16.530
Laila is not bad.
I don't know.
Okay.
I would like to get my grandmother's name

736
00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:22.860
for me.
Co and old Japanese name somewhere.

737
00:46:22.861 --> 00:46:27.660
That's got to be a middle name dude.
Anywhere in my daughter's name.

738
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:32.430
She died before I was born and it would really mean a lot to me and my side of

739
00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:36.060
the family to get that even as a middle name.
That's a middle name too.

740
00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:41.670
My wife doesn't like the name Foo Mikko.
Uh,

741
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:42.780
specifically.

742
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:47.760
She doesn't like the way it sounds and thinks it sounds too close to the word

743
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:52.110
Fumar which you as a scholar of French,
no.

744
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.830
Is the verb to smoke as a does smoke.

745
00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:00.030
Uh Oh uh,
in French.
No,

746
00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:03.470
I knew a rocket was something like that.
Um,

747
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:08.540
I am basically willing to concede the first name to get for me call as a middle

748
00:47:09.211 --> 00:47:11.760
name.
Well that's cool because if the kids like half Japanese,

749
00:47:11.761 --> 00:47:14.550
I don't know if you guys are full Japanese as cool as he get the little bit of

750
00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:19.410
that in there and the name [inaudible] people do that.
Um,
anyways,

751
00:47:19.411 --> 00:47:23.460
he said,
but I haven't gotten much headway in negotiation.
Again,

752
00:47:23.461 --> 00:47:27.870
I am willing to concede that the first name be something kind of weird to get.

753
00:47:27.871 --> 00:47:32.871
My grandmother's name is admittedly unusual but highly meaningful at as the

754
00:47:34.811 --> 00:47:38.200
middle name.
I have two questions.
All right.
First of all,

755
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:41.350
if your wife is going to go all hippy trippy dippy

756
00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:46.430
and then you know,
you can't be like fucking

757
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.310
like wheat grass shots school Mikko Johnson,

758
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:56.840
you can't have that.
I would think.
Oh man,

759
00:47:56.841 --> 00:48:00.590
this is tough because I have to question how did you win the lovely new Nia?

760
00:48:00.591 --> 00:48:02.150
Go about picking your daughter's name.

761
00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.970
What is my path to getting my wife to agree to

762
00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.870
Fomoco Amico as my daughter's middle name.

763
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.313
<v 1>MMM.</v>

764
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.823
<v 0>I think,</v>

765
00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:24.440
I think you guys need to stop thinking about yourselves and think about your

766
00:48:24.441 --> 00:48:28.280
daughter.
Okay.
As she's going to have to be this name,

767
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.330
somebody's going to have to say this name and she's going to have to be like,

768
00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:36.500
yes.
Present.
Okay.
So

769
00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:43.460
I would just say to my wife like,
listen,
all right,
I'm willing to concede.

770
00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:48.560
Pharmico all right.
But where she's not going to have some hippy,

771
00:48:48.561 --> 00:48:49.810
trippy fucking

772
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:52.733
<v 1>fucking</v>

773
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.560
<v 0>white celebrity kid fucking name can't have that.</v>

774
00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:58.690
Yeah.

775
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:02.890
You're not naming this kid after an emotion or a fucking fruit or vegetable.

776
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:10.020
It's just a fucking ass.
It's just a fucking asshole thing to do to your kid.

777
00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:14.610
It's so fucking self involved.
And it's so just like,
oh,
look at me,

778
00:49:14.611 --> 00:49:18.720
look how creative I am.
It's just like,
don't,
don't you remember going to school?

779
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.870
Don't you remember those,
those first brutal years?

780
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.720
If there was anything even remotely different about you,

781
00:49:24.721 --> 00:49:28.440
you were going to get the shit kicked out of you.
It's going to happen anyways.

782
00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:30.330
Why help the other kids out?

783
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:32.813
<v 1>Why</v>

784
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:35.760
<v 0>the kids going to hate the fucking name?</v>

785
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:39.023
<v 1>MMM.</v>

786
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:41.750
<v 0>Anyways,
so I would be thinking about the kid.</v>

787
00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:44.990
I wouldn't be thinking about my own family and all of that type of shit.

788
00:49:44.991 --> 00:49:49.040
Just give the kid a fucking cool name that sounds good with your last name and

789
00:49:49.041 --> 00:49:51.970
just let your kid be who they want to fucking be.
All right.

790
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.890
And don't force you fucking agenda on them from day one with some fucked up God

791
00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:01.490
damn name.
That's my 2 cents.
All right.

792
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.670
Um,
all right,
lady asked me to not Burp at the gym.

793
00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:08.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

794
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.870
<v 0>Okay.
Uh,
hey Bilbo saggy,
baggy and</v>

795
00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:18.130
uh,
I was at the gym the other day,
uh,

796
00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:23.090
in my building trying to get back in shape for this summer as I've been at Booz

797
00:50:23.091 --> 00:50:27.110
bag getting through this fucking winter.
Anyways,
I was on the elliptical,

798
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:32.120
a nice brisk pace,
um,
185 Rpms,

799
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:34.850
Jesus Christ and was listening to your podcast actually.

800
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:38.690
And there was one other woman on a treadmill,
three treadmills away,

801
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.260
uh,
walking at a slight incline

802
00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:48.130
and I'm guessing a speed of 2.3 and reading a novel.

803
00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.750
Oh yeah,
that's not working out.
Uh,
my family has acid reflux.

804
00:50:52.751 --> 00:50:56.170
So sometimes at the gym when I'm really pushing it,
I would

805
00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.540
inherently lightly burp every few minutes.

806
00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.510
At about 25 minutes into my session,

807
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.500
I hear something coming from my head phones and this late fifties,

808
00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:13.110
wish lady is waving at me out of my periphery.

809
00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:18.111
I looked and over at her and move my earpiece away to hear and she said nicely,

810
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.960
could you please not burp anymore?
It's distracting me.

811
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:27.900
Well Dude,
if you fucking belching while running 185,

812
00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:33.030
I mean,
it sounds like you're flying.
Just run a broad,

813
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.970
uh,
I mean,
what are you doing?
You're in public.
Um,
anyway,

814
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:43.470
built the amount of rage I was filled with for such an insane requests was

815
00:51:43.471 --> 00:51:47.640
unfathomable.
Well,
how loud will you burping?
Yeah,
J headphones on.

816
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.240
She put up with it for 20 fucking minutes.
He said,

817
00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:53.970
I thought about going to apologize to her,

818
00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:58.260
asking her name and giving her a fake name for myself and then telling the

819
00:51:58.261 --> 00:52:01.590
leasing off,
see office,
what a cunt though this lady was.

820
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:05.100
What is with you young people just wanting to tell on each other.

821
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.360
Did you want to make a video of it and then fucking uploaded?

822
00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:12.070
I just thought you guys are all just trying to get each other in trouble and

823
00:52:12.071 --> 00:52:16.730
kicked out of things.
The fucking rat generation.

824
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.960
Uh,
I refrain,
finish my workout and continue to have my day.

825
00:52:20.961 --> 00:52:22.520
My question for you is one,

826
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:27.050
am I just being completely,
uh,

827
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:32.290
am I just in just being completely flabbergasted by a lady walking on a

828
00:52:33.081 --> 00:52:34.310
treadmill,
reading a book,

829
00:52:34.311 --> 00:52:39.300
telling me not to burp when I have Gerd,
g,

830
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:43.840
r d and Two,
what,
what have you done in that situation to attitude?

831
00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:45.680
First of all,
you know,

832
00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:51.740
how the fuck does she know that you have acid fucking reflux and stop acting

833
00:52:51.741 --> 00:52:53.060
like you have leukemia?

834
00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:54.893
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

835
00:52:56.910 --> 00:53:00.150
<v 0>You know what I mean?
This is just right here.
This is what's wrong with,
with,</v>

836
00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:04.380
with what social media did to the individual.
You're in a public gym,

837
00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:05.640
you're belching,

838
00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:10.260
no one wants to listen to your fucking bourbon and you're a boozy fat fuck

839
00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.620
because of the winter.
I respect the fact you're trying to lose the weight.

840
00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:16.440
You know,
maybe if you ate better,

841
00:53:16.530 --> 00:53:19.800
you wouldn't have these dis wouldn't fuck wants to sit and listen to you burp

842
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:23.250
and it gives a fuck.
She's over there walking half a mile an hour at the book.

843
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.050
That's her loss.
She's not really working,

844
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:29.040
but she waited for fucking 20 minutes for you to belt should Outta your system

845
00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:33.690
and you didn't,
it's fucking gross.
No,
no.

846
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:34.171
I would take,

847
00:53:34.171 --> 00:53:38.670
I need a pack of fucking Rolaids and go for a walk around the block.

848
00:53:38.671 --> 00:53:39.390
But I mean you,

849
00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:43.830
you can't be like belching in public and then try and turn around and make

850
00:53:43.831 --> 00:53:48.000
yourself the victim because you got acid reflux.
You know

851
00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.590
what if she was really gassy and was just farting the entire time,

852
00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:59.090
you know,
and she says,
okay,
I have irritable bowel syndrome.
Well fucking,

853
00:53:59.091 --> 00:54:03.620
you know,
go drink some of that pink shit and fucking go for a walk.

854
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.390
They'll come in here and close the Goddamn door.
Yeah.

855
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:12.270
You have fucking gassy horror.
I mean,
I don't want to tell you

856
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:18.370
I,
I'd say,
yeah,
you're in the wrong there,
sir.
Yeah.

857
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.110
Um,
no one wants to go to the gym,

858
00:54:20.111 --> 00:54:23.470
listen to burping going 90 miles an hour and a fucking elliptical.

859
00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:26.610
And I don't,

860
00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:31.120
I don't care about your acid reflux and how it affects you as a person.

861
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.940
Um,
I think you need to take that into consideration.

862
00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:36.733
<v 1>No.</v>

863
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:40.280
<v 0>Why don't you just go get one of those TRX bands or just work out in the house?</v>

864
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:45.500
We can easily go for a walk.
You know,
it's better for the environment.

865
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:48.770
All the energy than an elliptical users.

866
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.570
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

867
00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:53.230
<v 0>Let's go walk up a hill.
If he can fucking Burp to your heart's content,</v>

868
00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.860
then you're not bugging her and she can sit there and fucking slowly walked to

869
00:54:56.861 --> 00:55:01.420
her grave while she reads the next Harry Potter
fucking novel.
Right.

870
00:55:01.421 --> 00:55:05.540
Does that work?
Just don't work for everybody.
I hope it does.
Um,
all right.

871
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.380
I am going to have to pull up a little bit short here.

872
00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.073
<v 1>MMM.</v>

873
00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.700
<v 0>I apologize.
I just have to,</v>

874
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:14.940
I gotta take this fucking thing tonight and then I'll be back in the states.

875
00:55:14.941 --> 00:55:17.010
Might be a little jet lag.
I know these last couple ones,

876
00:55:17.011 --> 00:55:21.390
I've been a little fucking scatterbrained and jet lag that just been a working a

877
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:26.370
little too hard.
But you know,
after tonight I'm on the other side of it and,
uh,

878
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:30.000
hopefully I'll go back to,
I'm not being as scatterbrained,

879
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:34.680
just the normal level of scatterbrain ish shit that I say.
All right.
That is it.

880
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:38.160
Go fuck yourselves.
I'll check in on your,
on Thursday.
And thank you from,

881
00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:42.930
from the bottom of my heart.
Everybody that showed up on,
um,
this run through,

882
00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.243
uh,

883
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:45.010
<v 1>yeah,</v>

884
00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:48.970
<v 0>the UK.
I've been having a great time.
All right.
That is it.
I'll see you Thursday.</v>
