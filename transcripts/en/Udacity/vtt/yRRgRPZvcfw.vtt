00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Look how much progress we've made. We've already filled up half of these values.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're learning a lot about the motion of this object.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In fact, we already talked about how the time over here is the same over here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
There's only one time in the problem.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I can fill that in here, and I've already told you that acceleration is only straight down.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If I drop an object, it doesn't spontaneously drift to the left or right.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It goes straight down, meaning the acceleration in the x direction is 0.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, can you, using only the numbers in this left-hand column and these equations

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
fill in these remaining two entries?

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answers here and here.
