1
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.700
You definitely shouldn't make those noises and start off a podcast,

2
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.880
Tom Papa that, what are you doing? You freaking be blind if, do you know what,

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.670
what is it called? PSM are. Do you know what that is? Yeah.

4
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:15.240
Like when you like you go like certain sounds. If you find them soothing,

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.580
I don't think that's one of them.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.730
That this is what I use to drive my kids crazy. I say it's Mac and cheese.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.260
It's a spoon and Mac and cheese.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.500
Oh my God. My Dad was funny professionally. This is ridiculous.

9
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.960
You're probably thinking this is crazy. My younger,

10
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.780
my younger one who's like comedian funny. This is her things.

11
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.371
She is so,

12
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.580
she doesn't care about parents or what we're doing or she's just out for

13
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:44.760
herself. Whenever I make a joke around the house.

14
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.710
She that I think is funny. She just goes, Huh? Jokes.

15
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.690
How old is she? 14 that's hilarious.

16
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.550
[inaudible] comic is she? Yeah, she could be. Wow. She definitely could be.

17
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.040
You have a healthy household. It is healthy.

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.660
That doesn't seem like a good recipe for comedy. Uh, right. Yeah.

19
00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:10.020
Well you know, it takes all kinds. It does take all kinds, you know?

20
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:15.000
Have you met anybody that came from a good childhood? That's really funny. Me.

21
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.140
You? Yeah. Really? I'm pretty funny. You're very funny.

22
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.410
But you came from no problems at all. I think every kid,

23
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.010
did you move around a lot? Oh,

24
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.920
I moved once one town over and traumatize me in third grade. Third Grade.

25
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.420
Yeah. I still can't, I'm still not over it. But I think that everybody has,

26
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.760
I think, I think as a child, even if it's not real heavy stuff,

27
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.830
it feels heavy to you. You know what I mean?

28
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:43.800
Like my father was super strict and like, you know,

29
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:47.460
spanked us and stuff and I was like this nervous. Oh, you know what I mean?

30
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:52.461
And so I think you can grow up pretty normal and be pretty funny.

31
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.740
You know? It's like a, there's a line with kids.

32
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.080
It's like you don't want to be mad at them,

33
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.370
but you can't let them get away with too much. Yeah. So you have to go, hey,

34
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.780
hey seriously, stop screaming at me. Stop this. Yeah. Like you can't do this.

35
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.650
Like, cause every now and then they'll, they'll test it totally.

36
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.830
Cause they fight amongst each other. Like I've dark, they're two years apart.

37
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:15.180
They'll fight amongst each other. That's what I,

38
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:18.830
every now and then they'll turn it on you and you're like, Hey, Yay,

39
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.240
I'm wearing your pants. Yeah, I'm the good guy. No it is,

40
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:25.470
it is a weird thing.

41
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:29.520
Especially when you know how you were as a kid and you know,

42
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:31.710
we've got daughters and I'm probably,

43
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.790
they're probably similar that where they're not as Nutso as we were when we were

44
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:36.480
little.

45
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.170
But you still have to bring the hammer down even though you think it's kind of

46
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:43.530
funny or you think it's not that big a deal. You have to,

47
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.200
you have to lay down the law.

48
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.050
Even if you don't feel it,

49
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.930
you have to enforce some guidelines and then you have to communicate about why

50
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:54.720
those guidelines exist. Yet I didn't get enough of,

51
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:58.260
I think when I was a kid is communication about why those guidelines exist.

52
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.070
Because in the moment the kids knock

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.130
<v 1>it, internalize it, they're going to be mad. I want him to do this.</v>

54
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.500
And I wanted to do that and they just have it in their head.

55
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.470
I want to play one more game. Why can't I just pay, what am I again?

56
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.730
They'll just get freaked out. But this what we heard was because I said so. Yes,

57
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.870
exactly. There was no reason there was nothing behind. Yeah. Just go to bed.

58
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:20.860
Why it's seven o'clock? Because I should show. All right. Yeah.

59
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.480
Well we don't put parameters on play though. Like as much we put parameters on,

60
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.340
you only have a certain amount of television time,

61
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.690
certain amount of video game time. But as far as like play, play,

62
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.400
like doing stuff like playing in the pool or do another,

63
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.750
like I don't feel like there's any that you could play in the pool all day.

64
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.260
All Day. Yeah. I'm happy for it, isn't it? It's interesting, right? Yeah.

65
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:44.020
Oh yeah, no. Yeah. Cause it's, and it's probably,

66
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.050
they're learning more from that than anything else that they would rather just

67
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.380
purely play. All play is not considered equal.

68
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:53.950
Like play when you're sedentary in front of a video screen and you're playing

69
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:57.900
some silly video game and you're just sitting there and you're just your brain

70
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.220
up to be physical. But it'd be out to be doing something.

71
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:03.520
But they do have this one game that I'll let them play for a long time.

72
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:06.310
It's this crazy dance game. Oh yeah. Dance Revolution.

73
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.610
I don't know what it's called, but they dance. They men's thing.

74
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.750
They dance to a, what's her face? Crazy. What's crazy face. Oops,

75
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:17.950
I did it again. Britney spears. They danced it, you better work bitch.

76
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.870
You want a Maserati? You better work your work passion, their journey.

77
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.950
They're dancing. It's hilarious.

78
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.180
But that's an exercise like have you done it with them? Yes. It's fun.

79
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.370
You have to, I've only done honestly a couple of times.

80
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.890
They probably played it a million times, but um,

81
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.360
you have to coordinate your movements to mirror the person on the screen.

82
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.640
But my instincts are to like, to not mirror, but to, to do what he's doing.

83
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:44.470
If his right arms going up my right growing up.

84
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.930
Cause like that's how you get taught in martial arts.

85
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.110
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be doing that or if I'm supposed to be just

86
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:50.944
mirroring him.

87
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.130
Like when he lifts up his right arm and my supposed to live up my left arm

88
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.410
because that's, that's the one that faces me.

89
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.510
Is that how you're supposed to know you do whatever you see. Yeah.

90
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.110
But you then you have to try. You have to switch it over in your head.

91
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.590
Why don't you show you that arm? Okay, we'll go with you. We'll do this. Well,

92
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:08.440
it seems like, well you shouldn't be that good option. It's with your children.

93
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:13.441
You should be the only way I'm going to do it seems like it would be easier for

94
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:19.321
all involved if he just had the mirror not do the same exact side of their body.

95
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.110
Is your body. I don't know. I've not,

96
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.780
I've never gotten that deep because I've done it and then quickly became

97
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:29.530
exhausted and just pretend that I thought it was stupid so I could lay down.

98
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.490
Well, it's critical in martial arts that you, uh,

99
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:33.940
like if you're learning something,

100
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.080
if you prefer a spiritually kickboxing for most fighters,

101
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.580
most fighters have one good side and one side that they're not so good at.

102
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.370
Right. And I'm like the really great fighters,

103
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:48.400
like one of the best in the world. Today's Terrence Crawford.

104
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.930
And one of the things about him is he can fight equally well from southpaw or

105
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:57.860
from Orthodox. Really just stance y'all. Yeah, he'll, he'll whatever he wants.

106
00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.360
Wow. He just fucks people up.

107
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.160
He doesn't everyone he fights really top shelf competition too. And he's just,

108
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.940
he's so technical and so, so clever at figuring people out.

109
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:12.710
But I think he has a giant advantage and that he literally as as good a southpaw

110
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.910
as he is an orthodox.

111
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:17.960
Like he can box the best boxers in the world orthodox and then just switch up

112
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.520
southpaw on them. And there's, you know,

113
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.010
he might be like a little better as a southpaw, but God damn, it's so clear.

114
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.490
It might, it might also be, Gee, he's a fucking their head up.

115
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.370
Cause they thought him one way and then he switched his stance and starts

116
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:32.210
fucking them up the other way. Is He born that way? No, no. It's a learn thing.

117
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.470
My point would be if you had a south part instructor and he was teaching you and

118
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:40.730
you were mirroring him, it would be weird. Right, right, right. You know,

119
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.560
if someone's teaching you something,

120
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.150
you want to see how their body's doing it and and mimic their movements.

121
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.610
You want to see it and mimic their movements. Right.

122
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:52.190
You don't want to mirror it. It would be too confusing. Yeah.

123
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.580
Which is interesting because it seems like the mirror room worked better if it

124
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.670
was the stupid video game, you know, cause like lift your arm up,

125
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.390
kick boxing or any, I think any martial arts style,

126
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.140
no, it's messed you up. You can't be a good dance revolutionary.

127
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.410
Someone's got to walk you through it too. Dance, dance, revolutionary.

128
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:15.650
I'm probably doing everything wrong. Probably risking all the joints.

129
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:17.020
Like there's certain moods,

130
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.230
you know who could dance like really dance for him for him. Do you know for him?

131
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.770
Anwar, you don't know him from the store? He's coming on Xeon tomorrow.

132
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.740
Him Tomorrow. He's hilarious. Really Funny Guy.

133
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.420
But his Instagram is filled with him dancing. Oh really? Yeah,

134
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.520
he me but he dances really good. Yeah. And I was watching this and I got,

135
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.070
um, I got a little self conscious watching this. I was like,

136
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.420
I don't think I could do any of this and if I had to do this, like watch,

137
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.980
watch him dance. I was like,

138
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:49.100
if I had to do this I would get so self conscious that I was doing this.

139
00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:51.650
Like look, he's really good. Yeah. There is.

140
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.100
I made a new year's resolution this year that I was going to dance more

141
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.600
and uh, I haven't done it because of the same thing. I come,

142
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.500
I always feel like someone, Carolee for one said to me,

143
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:06.410
you look like a guy who's never danced in his life. And I was like,

144
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.910
do you mean I've got some flow? Carol legals. She's fucking Hawaii. Yeah.

145
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:14.910
She seemed Venice, SAMHSA. Damn. But that first thing I just showed you,

146
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.560
if Fortnite took a video from his that was six years old on his youtube channel

147
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:22.250
and just put it in the game this last past week. Whoa.

148
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.790
And are charging people money for it. Well,

149
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.450
I don't get anybody making any money, most likely.

150
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:28.410
Now this has happened over and over to people with their dances.

151
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.940
Look how good he did. Great. That's really funny too.

152
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.230
I can't deal the funny guy. Super Cool guy too. He's filled with joy.

153
00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:37.250
Obviously you're not,

154
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.330
you're not like an asshole if you're dance like that could point. Right.

155
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.710
That's a happy, that's a happy fellow. That's a happy felon. He's super,

156
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.920
Super Nice Guy. Super Smart Guy Out. Cool. He had some sort of a technical job,

157
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.400
didn't he? Wasn't he like on, we'll figure it out. Someone,

158
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.020
someone told me he had some very, uh,

159
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:02.090
intellectually strenuous job and then decided to bail on that to be a comedian.

160
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.550
Which makes sense. That's interesting. I hope that's true story.

161
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.020
You never know with people, man. I know, you know, I know. I, uh,

162
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.450
I, uh, I think that we probably could take a dance class together.

163
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.430
Dude. I don't want to learn how to dance like that.

164
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.660
I'm worried about my wife can really move, have a meniscus issue. Oh yeah.

165
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:25.410
What's that tour or something to my meniscus. What's the meniscus in your knee?

166
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.850
Padding in between your knee in between your bones tore it. Yeah.

167
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:30.743
Not that bad.

168
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.510
Like it's a little tear and I've been trying to deal with it without surgery.

169
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.320
With stem cells. Oh boy. But the problem is I like kicking things.

170
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.730
You were thinking to favorite things, making things.

171
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.520
It's hard for me to not kick things for a long time. And when I,

172
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.530
when I don't kick things, I just don't feel as good. We all have our things.

173
00:09:48.531 --> 00:09:50.570
Some people dance, some people kick things.

174
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.810
I feel good when I hit that fucking bag. I like to smoke weed.

175
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.280
I smoke like two or three hits.

176
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.970
I get to the state of mind where I'm just,

177
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.550
I just feel like my tendance,

178
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:06.980
I feel my muscles and my bones and then I just like to fucking zone out.

179
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.310
I'll put on some led Zeppelin or something like that. [inaudible]

180
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:15.880
<v 2>ah,</v>

181
00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:20.270
<v 1>then I'll just stop. Just going off on the back bow and it becomes like,</v>

182
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.250
you feel like you're a,

183
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.180
like you're just riding like a wave of movement, right?

184
00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:27.320
You're not even thinking about it.

185
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:30.680
You're not thinking about anything other than making sure that you don't do

186
00:10:30.681 --> 00:10:34.910
anything stupid in terms of like launching a strike when the bag's in the wrong

187
00:10:34.911 --> 00:10:36.950
place where you could jam yourself or hurt yourself.

188
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.580
So it's like you just flown around the bag and it just like,

189
00:10:40.581 --> 00:10:43.740
you don't even have through a kid at your hardest. It's more like you're,

190
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.170
you're in there like a dance and you're expressing yourself with the movements.

191
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.290
But is there an age where that becomes like,

192
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.450
I'm going to start tearing stuff a lot? No,

193
00:10:53.451 --> 00:10:58.360
just turn 52 I think it's about 51 yeah, it might be time. Sure.

194
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.120
There's definitely trade on Yoga. I love the yoga too is good,

195
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:04.700
but it probably doesn't give you the same rush. It's a different rush.

196
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:07.580
You're all booked. They're both great rushes though. Yoga is a great rush.

197
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:08.443
Yoga is great.

198
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.110
The thing about the hitting things though that it like leaves nothing.

199
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:16.130
No violence in you. I talked to, I don't know if that's real or if that's just,

200
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.150
I've been doing it so long that it's just a normal part of my life when I don't

201
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:23.120
do it. I'm like a baby and I want, I want, I want no,

202
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.690
no aggression juice left in my body. I want to pound it all out.

203
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.150
Nothing pounds it all out. Like hitting the bag.

204
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.590
You just straightens your brain out. Yeah. It's more of a mellow thing.

205
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.160
It's put, it straightens you out more without like indulging you.

206
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:42.280
You know what I'm saying? Like if you were, um, it's,

207
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.330
it's like food, right? It's like if you were addicted to something,

208
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.290
if you are doing it so often that just, you just needed to gorge,

209
00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:55.930
that's all you did. But you just kept getting fat because of that. Yeah.

210
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.150
You'd have to stop in and you would realize you'd have this urge to gorge.

211
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.420
Right. So I always wonder like, when I want to do it,

212
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:06.460
is that like my urge to gorge?

213
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.210
Like do I just want to con go fucking crazy and be self-indulgent?

214
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:11.770
Is that what it is or is it,

215
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:16.771
is it that I'm really recognizing that there's a need that people have to have

216
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:21.100
some explosive movements and that if you get rid of the that need,

217
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:23.080
whether for me it's running up hills is a big one.

218
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.220
It's one of the reasons why I like it.

219
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.900
It's challenging and it leaves me completely spent and I feel like I'm a nicer

220
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:32.260
person. I feel like I feel nicer. I feel I want to be nicer to people.

221
00:12:32.261 --> 00:12:35.680
So that's not an aggressive hitting thing though. But it's explosive.

222
00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:39.480
It's just wow, cause you going up this fucking hill there.

223
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:40.750
They're heavy hills out here.

224
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.830
Would you feel the wrong way getting off of a treadmill or a no.

225
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.530
Or like when you do the elliptical? Yeah. That's great. I mean that feels great.

226
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:53.010
But m d there's something about an actual physical hill that's outside in

227
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:56.500
nature. You feel like, what if something was chasing me cause I get away.

228
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:58.750
How long could I do this for? What if I have to catch somebody?

229
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.320
How could I get them? Like, what if, you know, what if, you know,

230
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.600
horrible things happen if I don't reach the top of this hill.

231
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.090
<v 3>Yeah. When I always loved running through the woods. Ooh, scary.</v>

232
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.390
But it's exciting. There's something primal about it. There's something more,

233
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.950
uh, there's more at play than just I'm just running down the street.

234
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.470
But I think that, uh, I, I think to write something down or I'm gonna Forget it.

235
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.710
I think I have this thing about the woods that I keep forgetting to do.

236
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.840
I think that, uh,

237
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:32.020
it's what you're describing and like having the kick is equated to stand up.

238
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.100
It's like I'm no longer the same person when I'm not doing stand up for several

239
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.720
days. And I think it's because I learned it.

240
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.560
I created this addiction.

241
00:13:42.561 --> 00:13:47.210
I created this thing that I no longer am, uh, the same person without it.

242
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:51.000
<v 1>It became a junkie. Yeah. Yeah. We're for, we're all for sure laugh junkies.</v>

243
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:55.710
I think we are so lucky that regular people don't know what it feels like to get

244
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.370
a big laugh yet where they would do it.

245
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.560
It would be no one to do any other job. It'd be like,

246
00:14:01.561 --> 00:14:03.140
fuck these other jobs I want to kill.

247
00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:03.581
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

248
00:14:03.581 --> 00:14:07.120
I think about that every time I walk through Vegas and you see all these people

249
00:14:07.121 --> 00:14:11.350
like drinking and at the tables and they're trying to get a rush of trying to

250
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:16.000
get something and you walk around with this secret in your mind that like,

251
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.170
I'm getting something so much more potent than you're going to get out here just

252
00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:21.004
from being on stuff.

253
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.270
<v 1>Joey Diaz did this bit the other night in the,</v>

254
00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:27.350
in the original room and it was so hilarious and it was really fresh and you

255
00:14:27.351 --> 00:14:30.880
could tell cause it was making him laugh and he was laughing. He was, he,

256
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.650
you know, Joey's got [inaudible],

257
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.070
he's fucking dying laughing and I'm in the back of the room. I'm like,

258
00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:40.880
you can't get any happier than that. That just happy as a person can get. Oh,

259
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:44.510
I can. In that those bursts of moments of like the love of your children,

260
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.010
that is as happy as you can ever get a new line and clip wordings.

261
00:14:49.011 --> 00:14:52.070
The love family, love people you care about. That's

262
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.550
<v 0>the only thing that eclipses, yeah, no you're right. But everybody can get that.</v>

263
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.510
Everybody get the family loan so everybody can get the best kind of love. Yes.

264
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.430
But it all takes work. But I think that uh, I think when you have,

265
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:05.870
I mean it can be so small too.

266
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:10.540
It could be like one line that you added to an old joke that works. Ah,

267
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:15.170
your whole night is different. Yup. Your whole drive home is like, yes.

268
00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.390
Where if you don't try something and you just kind of go through it and it's not

269
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:21.650
as satisfying.

270
00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:25.220
So you constantly have to keep pushing to because you need that more potent

271
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:25.640
brush.

272
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.560
But the other side of it is if I am a set and everything's amazing except one

273
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:33.910
new line that I tried, that ain't shit. No one knew,

274
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.260
but I will haunt me for days. Yeah. Did I say it that way?

275
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.450
Yeah. Yeah. Idiot.

276
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.450
I know you're managing this weird thing, you know,

277
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.070
like you're acts as this weird thing that you're producing and managing it and

278
00:15:49.071 --> 00:15:52.940
yeah. Oh, constantly. Constantly, constantly. In your head constantly tweaking,

279
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.520
constantly trying to express, trying to,

280
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.970
trying to have something that you think, oh this is,

281
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.430
it's almost like the cocky or you are,

282
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.750
it's so rare when you feel like this is going to be a great one and you bring it

283
00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:08.760
up and it works. Like, you know what I mean? Like it,

284
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.890
it never matches expectations. But if you think like, ah, maybe this'll work.

285
00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.380
Those are the, those I love cause they surprise you.

286
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:19.310
It's like this is funnier than even I thought. Yes, those are interesting.

287
00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:22.040
Right? Well yeah, the set up is actually the funniest part of the joke.

288
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.300
People are dying laughing at something in the set up and you're like, oh yeah,

289
00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:29.600
okay. I said, oh my God, why didn't I see that? Yeah. And then you're like,

290
00:16:29.601 --> 00:16:32.750
yeah, that's funny or funny. Or that's the funnier part of it.

291
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.990
But that's one of the weird things about having to do it in front of people.

292
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.540
Like you have to do it in front of people. There's no other way.

293
00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:42.290
You can't like really practice stand up in a vacuum. Now I know. That's,

294
00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.550
I'm so cool. Back to the premise thing. Chris Rock said that to me once.

295
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:50.810
He said, that's when that's the greatest secret in comedy. He goes, it's the,

296
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:55.670
it's the setup. That's the real joke. He's at the, the punchline, you know,

297
00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:58.290
that's Kinda icing. But you really, you're,

298
00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.120
you're nailing the joke in the setup. Yeah. And if you fuck up a setup,

299
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.010
even if the rest of joke is good,

300
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.040
you always remember that fucked up part of the setup. Yeah.

301
00:17:07.041 --> 00:17:08.180
Why do you say it like that?

302
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:14.030
Do say that it's such a weird little dance you play with your head.

303
00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:18.170
I'm trying to put it all in line and get all the bits together correctly.

304
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:21.810
How big was that crowd you played? I saw on Instagram this weekend. Oh,

305
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.220
that was in Portland. Portland, Oregon. It was big. It looked huge.

306
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.550
It was like 10,000 people. Now what does that,

307
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.430
what is that doing to your act and your performance?

308
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.420
You have to slow down a little bit because it's so loud.

309
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:39.890
Like you have to give them more, a little bit more time because, uh,

310
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.910
I went to see Lewis black once, I didn't run,

311
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.850
I didn't even realize this [inaudible] had actually done theaters already and I

312
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:50.370
was even doing the very theater that he was in [inaudible] and Joey Diaz

313
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.650
<v 1>and I were sitting in the back of this, uh,</v>

314
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.070
this big theater that Lewis Black was playing in and we watched him, right.

315
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.660
And he would hit a punchline and all these people around us would be laughing

316
00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:05.340
really loud and then he hit the tag and I couldn't hear the tag cause there were

317
00:18:05.341 --> 00:18:09.750
so many people laughing at the punchline. I was like, oh,

318
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.600
really? Like cemented in my hand. I was like, oh,

319
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:16.750
this is a whole different feeling for the audience member than a club. Right.

320
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.710
One of the crazy things about like, if you like their original room, right,

321
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.010
or some small room like that, when you, when you hit a punchline,

322
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.030
when everybody's laughing,

323
00:18:24.031 --> 00:18:27.120
you could hit a tag and they're gonna hear it perfectly clearly because there's

324
00:18:27.121 --> 00:18:31.480
not enough people's laughter to overwhelm the sound of the speaker speakers.

325
00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.090
On the microphone when there's 10,000 fucking people. Yeah.

326
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.490
You gotta give that one a little bit of air, let it come back.

327
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.370
You've got to give those bits a little more air. Right. You adjust quickly.

328
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.480
But uh, but do you feel, are you happy doing it?

329
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:48.290
Like do you feel like fun? Cause I,

330
00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:53.040
I'm the only thing close is when I worked with Seinfeld and we did win the Fox

331
00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:55.750
theaters and that was a little over 5,000. Yeah.

332
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.380
And that's the Detroit Fox that started. Uh, it was, no,

333
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.400
it was Atlanta and that started to feel a little out of my control.

334
00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.260
How many Fox standards are there by the way? There's the a million of them.

335
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.050
There's Fox, La, Fox St Louis, but it's, yeah,

336
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.510
it was the same cow. Wow. I thought it was just a bunch of people naming their,

337
00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.410
their theater the fuck. No, no, no, no, no. It was like 20th Century Fox.

338
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.980
It was like if you decided on the salmon theater, do you own the salmon theater?

339
00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:27.970
Yeah. What can you own salmon? You can own out.

340
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.470
Fuck off. Come on. Like, if you have a band, you'd call your band salmon.

341
00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.340
You can't,

342
00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.340
you can't name your band after shit that everybody knows the words to or knows.

343
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.390
Uh, knows the like what it is. Right. But part of nature, it just seems weird.

344
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:46.590
Like it's gotta be like salmon work boots. You can't name you name. You're like,

345
00:19:46.591 --> 00:19:51.540
if you named your beef, Oh, if you had a, you had a band,

346
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:54.900
you named it beef, you don't own beef beef.

347
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.620
You can't say you can trademark beef. You could be for the name of a band.

348
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.810
It's just such a common name. It's like you can't own it with anything. Think,

349
00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.280
you know what I like. So, yeah. But I looked up yesterday, I was online,

350
00:20:05.281 --> 00:20:08.670
I was writing and I looked up fun.

351
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:13.570
Just w just the word fun somebody owns on and there's a band fun. Okay.

352
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:16.860
Everything that came up was fun. The band fuck off. You can't have that name,

353
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.470
war war. But that was a long time ago.

354
00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.860
That was when they were first making bands. It's got

355
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.190
two full, absolutely nothing dude.

356
00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:32.190
You know. Um, we were, um,

357
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:37.140
at that shoreline amphitheater and they have all these posters on the wall of

358
00:20:37.141 --> 00:20:39.900
different shows. And one of them was a,

359
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:44.460
it was Jimmy Hendrix and fuck, what was the other band?

360
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.160
Some other insane band. Oh, Jimmy Hendrix. Fuck

361
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.090
<v 0>was it? The birds was the birds and another band. But it was,</v>

362
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.280
it was so crazy like looking at this thing like, wow,

363
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:56.590
like this was a real show that you could have caught back then.

364
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.640
You could have walked into this theater and seen Hendrix to watch Hendrix.

365
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.370
It's crazy that it was right there. I'm like, wow,

366
00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:06.040
that and that night he was there. So they were all in front,

367
00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:09.840
like laughing and joking. Really? Someone snapped this picture slowly,

368
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.290
sometimes a photo and you go, Oh yeah, that's a photo from 1973, no big deal.

369
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.020
And sometimes one hits you and you go, Whoa, that's Ronnie van Zant. Right,

370
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.250
exactly. What do you want?

371
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.070
It was like to be around that guy that's miles Davis talking to Mick Jagger.

372
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.840
Jesus Christ. Yeah.

373
00:21:25.841 --> 00:21:29.170
Like someone was there with a fucking camera when that went down. I know.

374
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.990
It's crazy. So I think that, uh,

375
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.560
so when I back to the Fox thing, how big was it? Five Times.

376
00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.770
A little over 5,000 and that's started to seem like something different from

377
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:46.030
like even like 4,000 seemed like you're still in that club kind of,

378
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:50.710
you know, theater back and forth. At five it started to feel like, oh, this is,

379
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.400
this is bigger than I can control.

380
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.710
Do you feel like you couldn't control it and 10,000 have a good time. Yeah.

381
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.160
But do you feel like, you know what I mean? Like we did 25,000 in Tacoma.

382
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.660
Did you really? Dave and I did. Yeah. That's crazy. That's crazy.

383
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.020
That's a lot of people. It feels, it feels insane. It has to feel and say,

384
00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:15.160
oh my God, fucking roar of humans. But it's fun. You know?

385
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:16.630
It's like everybody was there to have a good time.

386
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:20.080
Like everybody's there for the same reason and people keep it together

387
00:22:20.081 --> 00:22:23.680
remarkably well. If you really stop and think about live events,

388
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.770
like how well people in like, we don't get enough credit.

389
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.430
I know every nutty person who does something crazy.

390
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.880
There's so many people that can keep it together. I know.

391
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.580
It's really unfortunate.

392
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.240
We view people the way we do sometimes because we concentrate on every single

393
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:42.490
bad thing that happens in the news and yeah,

394
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:45.700
there's a lot of bad things that happened in the news. But at scale,

395
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.040
if you just have the scale, the scale of people,

396
00:22:48.041 --> 00:22:50.470
I think we're looking at it completely skewed.

397
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.700
I think most people are really fine. Most people are cool.

398
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.520
They are nice, but that's why terrorism works, right?

399
00:22:57.521 --> 00:23:01.810
Because it's so spectacular that it scares the daylights out of everybody.

400
00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.270
But I think the same thing, it's like, okay,

401
00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:06.370
so this horrible thing happened on this night,

402
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.940
but think about how many people were out that night.

403
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:15.420
Think about how many people were filling amphitheaters and arenas and small

404
00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:19.870
shops and small clubs. I mean, in a month, just in America,

405
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.650
millions and everybody's cool. Everyone's getting along.

406
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:25.720
Everybody's doing the right thing. You're right.

407
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:30.100
There is definitely a lot of cool people, but it's the, it's the spectacular.

408
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.610
It's like a plane crash, right? There's been plenty,

409
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.850
there hasn't been a major plane crash in the u s in a long time,

410
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.340
but when it happens, it's, oh,

411
00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:43.750
it's so mind blowing because it's something fell from the sky. It's a big deal.

412
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.220
Yeah. It's a bigger deal than a train. A train crash.

413
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.390
<v 1>It kills the same amount of people.</v>

414
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:51.260
It doesn't shock us as much now it's on the ground. You know what I mean?

415
00:23:51.261 --> 00:23:53.630
It's like that thing fell from the sky. What happened?

416
00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:57.500
We've all fantasize about how horrible that would be. Oh,

417
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.460
it has a big impact. It has a real big impact. Yeah. No, but that's amazing.

418
00:24:01.461 --> 00:24:05.810
I mean to people there with 25,000 strange likeminded people just out that just

419
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.350
coming to laugh, didn't want to have a good time. That's amazing.

420
00:24:09.351 --> 00:24:12.530
That's the cool thing about, even when you're at the Improv, you know,

421
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:14.030
or the comedy store, you know,

422
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.300
there's a group of people that comes to have a good time. Yeah.

423
00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.710
But there's always, you know,

424
00:24:18.711 --> 00:24:21.950
occasionally someone who's drunk and doesn't get it and they want to yell out

425
00:24:21.951 --> 00:24:22.784
and ruin things.

426
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:26.270
But most of the clubs in town now are good at getting rid of those people. Yeah.

427
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.180
No, they're really good at it. The vast majority of people are cool. Yes.

428
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:34.910
But vast majority. Yeah. No, it's great. But it's when someone isn't cool,

429
00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:37.820
it's so disturbing. So we start,

430
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:41.140
we think about people in that regard. Yeah. You know,

431
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:45.890
we think about people like, cause uh, no. Yeah. The worst possible scenario.

432
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:50.270
Like, um, did you see once upon a time in Hollywood I did. So those flower kids,

433
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:54.680
right, the murderous flower, the Manson kids. That's like worst case scenario.

434
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.730
Sometimes we think about people just on, you know,

435
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.760
just cause that's a possibility. It's such a glaring one,

436
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.660
but it gets a disproportionate amount of energy and interest because for the

437
00:25:05.661 --> 00:25:10.340
most part, most people are super fine. Those people are great.

438
00:25:10.341 --> 00:25:11.330
Most people are friendly.

439
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:15.410
Most people just want to have a good time in this life, not assholes. Right,

440
00:25:15.411 --> 00:25:17.960
exactly. And even the Manson kids,

441
00:25:17.961 --> 00:25:19.490
there's probably a couple of them that were fun.

442
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:23.150
I bet there was the girl who took off the girl who was like, Hey,

443
00:25:23.151 --> 00:25:27.950
I'll be right back. Oh yeah. That girl, you know, she did take off. No.

444
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:32.060
Who is it in real life? Who Do you watch stranger things? Yes.

445
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:37.100
She's a the um, she's Ethan Hawke and Ooma Thurman's daughter.

446
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.990
What? Yes. Wow. Yes. She was the one in the,

447
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.870
the two worked in the ice cream shop. Oh, that's crazy. Yeah,

448
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.760
that's what I thought you were gonna say. The actual Manson kid didn't take off.

449
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.890
What's on it? The one in real life, you confuse the shit out of everybody.

450
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.480
So sorry. Sorry. Go around. When we were talking about the other day,

451
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.710
that story with the Bruce Lee, that was loosely based in reality.

452
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.530
You had to do with Jean labelle. Oh, Jesus.

453
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.900
Cruz was a stump man on like the Green Hornet or something. Okay.

454
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.750
Well let me tell you, he said it didn't, it wasn't real though.

455
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.550
Let me tell you this thing, because talking from gene, gene was always, I've,

456
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.520
I've known gene for years. He's always super respectful about Bruce Lee,

457
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.690
but he's also, he's okay, let me put it this way.

458
00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:28.380
If that actually did happen that way. If Bruce Lee fought Jean Labelle,

459
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:34.040
Jean labell would grab ahold to him and obliterate his brain on the concrete 100

460
00:26:34.491 --> 00:26:37.100
out of 100 times. Let me just say that for,

461
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.180
so I'm not talking about the movie and like there was a thing in the movie where

462
00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:44.070
I felt like they made Bruce Lee seem like a, and

463
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.140
<v 4>I'm like, Ooh, I don't think he was ever really liked that.</v>

464
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.590
This is like kind of an important historical figure for martial arts.

465
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:52.260
And I get it. It's just a crazy Quentin Tarantino movie and I can get it.

466
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.080
The end of the movie did not. I mean, spoiler,

467
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.100
I don't want to say what happened,

468
00:26:56.101 --> 00:26:59.430
but the make takes liberties for entertainment's sake with a lot of different

469
00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:01.590
things. Yeah. But with that one I was like, Ooh,

470
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.100
I'm just going to have some random dude that,

471
00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:09.180
that you know is a stunt man and Bruce Lee's a buffoon to him and he kicks his

472
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:12.060
ass on the set. But with that said, yeah, that guy,

473
00:27:12.061 --> 00:27:15.090
if that was a real life event with Jean Labelle and Bruce Lee,

474
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:16.560
Jean labelle would crush him.

475
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.280
So gene labelle piece of go rilla that would have been him in that scene.

476
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.640
Oh yeah. But it would have been quick. It would have been a different thing.

477
00:27:23.641 --> 00:27:25.770
Man. He's a gorilla. I mean,

478
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:30.771
he's like a judo champion with a severe arsenal of neck cranks and joint locks

479
00:27:33.331 --> 00:27:38.220
and he is strong like a fucking bear. I mean, dude, in his prime,

480
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:42.390
he was a tank of a man really far bigger than Bruce Lee.

481
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:46.290
And obviously he was small. He was a small guy.

482
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.920
But Bruce Lee was an innovator in martial arts. And one of my personal heroes,

483
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:55.140
he's like the most important early innovator because he was the first guy to

484
00:27:55.141 --> 00:27:59.160
think that you should combine the best elements of all these different styles.

485
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:00.570
When I was coming up, man,

486
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:05.850
I was doing taekwondo and you were brainwashed to think that taekwondo was the

487
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:07.110
best martial art.

488
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.410
Everything else was bullshit and you shouldn't even practice it.

489
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:12.270
So if I was practicing other stuff,

490
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:15.660
like I was doing some boxing or I was doing something like I'd get some frowns

491
00:28:15.661 --> 00:28:17.280
from some people. It was like a thing.

492
00:28:17.281 --> 00:28:21.090
And if you were in some schools that were less open-minded than mine, you know,

493
00:28:21.091 --> 00:28:23.760
my school was a little more practical than some of them,

494
00:28:23.761 --> 00:28:26.310
but some of them they would say Kang for death.

495
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.230
Like all they wanted to do is fucking con food.

496
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.330
They're doing this shit in the park and you couldn't say, hey man,

497
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.990
a wrestlers going to grab a hold of you and he's going just pound you into a

498
00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:37.650
fucking tree. And there's not a God damn thing you can do about, there's a geo,

499
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.860
there's Jean Labelle who was, he was, uh,

500
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.870
in a bunch of different movies as a stunt man that looks like Green Horn

501
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:46.360
friends. So that's,

502
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.800
they were very good friends and he had nothing but good things to say about

503
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.860
Bruce League. But he said he taught Bruce Lee a lot.

504
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.020
Like some of the moves that Bruce Lee, Bruce,

505
00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:59.040
Bruce Lee used an armbar and one of the early scenes in game of death.

506
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.630
That was from Jean Labelle. No, I guarantee you helped him here.

507
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.920
But look at this like if Jean labelle really wanted to grab ahold of Bruce Lee,

508
00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.490
Bruce Lee would be unconscious as would I, as with many, many,

509
00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:15.270
many other trained martial artists, not chambers who was a fuck.

510
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.720
I mean Bruce Lee was a fantastic martial artists and like I said,

511
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:20.400
one of the most innovative guys ever,

512
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.520
we don't even realize how much his style had a gigantic effect on making untold

513
00:29:27.181 --> 00:29:29.870
millions of people sign up for martial arts classes, including me.

514
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.620
And part of it was because he was a movie star, right. He had the looks and the,

515
00:29:33.621 --> 00:29:35.000
and the charisma. Yes.

516
00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:38.940
That allowed him to bring it onto film and show everybody he had everything.

517
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:40.140
He had philosophy,

518
00:29:40.141 --> 00:29:43.570
he had a deep understanding of all these different martial arts and he had the

519
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:47.170
courage to try to combine them, which was unheard of at the time.

520
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.320
We got an exercise from a lot of these kung fu like circles.

521
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.260
Where did he learn it? He learned it from a bunch of different places. I mean,

522
00:29:53.261 --> 00:29:55.240
he learned in the books. He learned it in China.

523
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:57.400
He learned different things from different people. I know he did.

524
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.670
He worked with a lot of different martial artists, including Jean Labelle,

525
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.760
of course, was a, what's Jean labelle's judo, uh,

526
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.640
credentials and I guarantee he was national champion.

527
00:30:06.641 --> 00:30:10.060
I think he was a world champion, but he was a whatever he was,

528
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.170
he's a fucking gorilla. I feel like Kung was more popular earlier.

529
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.820
Well the UFC changed all that shit. Yeah. Yeah. Dan, what is his,

530
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.220
but what is his a competition? Uh, accomplishments. Blue Belt. No

531
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:30.430
yell about he's, but if that,

532
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.560
that makes sense that they kind of base it on him.

533
00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:36.670
Cause he really was a legendary stunt man as well. Wouldn't that be cool though?

534
00:30:36.671 --> 00:30:40.000
If Tarantino had the inside scoop on that story?

535
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.250
Maybe Bruce Lee and him were friends.

536
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.750
I guarantee you like that didn't go down like that then fight. Right, right,

537
00:30:46.751 --> 00:30:49.540
right. If they did have a fight, if Jesus cried,

538
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.880
it would have been horrific. Yeah. That guy's a fucking gorilla.

539
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:59.680
Judo people is a different man. They have a different, they're their core Judah.

540
00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.260
Yeah, their course. So God damn strong.

541
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.910
There's only a few judo guys I've ever rolled with it or a lack of consequences.

542
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:08.710
[inaudible] was one of them. I think when I was a blue belt,

543
00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:11.320
I rolled with him and he was like rolling with the chimpanzee.

544
00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.350
It just threw me around so freely as Christ.

545
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.860
It's so disheartening when you grapple with like whole,

546
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.650
like a really good wrestler or a really good judo person.

547
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.820
They just have this insane ability to manipulate bodies. It's crazy. Okay.

548
00:31:24.821 --> 00:31:29.290
It says he won the national heavyweight judo championship and the u s, uh,

549
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.600
USA overall judo championship title.

550
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:35.260
So he won the national heavyweight title and he went on to win both to

551
00:31:35.261 --> 00:31:37.840
heavyweight and overall champion in 1955 as well.

552
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:43.050
So that's eight National Amateur Athletics Union. I think that's a, you know,

553
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.820
I think that's, that stands for it. So that's a, that's a big time judo title,

554
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:48.330
especially for back then in 1954,

555
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.130
there probably wasn't that many judo championships.

556
00:31:51.131 --> 00:31:55.510
It was probably fairly recent thing. Where's judo come from? Japan, Japan,

557
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:56.201
Japan,

558
00:31:56.201 --> 00:32:01.201
Jujitsu to even a Brazilian Jujitsu really came from Japan because I'm count my

559
00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:06.460
Ada who was this, uh, traveling judo master. Um,

560
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:09.280
he taught people in Brazil. He taught the Gracies.

561
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.470
So the Gracie family in Brazil,

562
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.370
they took that Jujitsu and they refined it and made it, made it much more,

563
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.600
much more emphasis on submissions cause of Carlos Gracie and Leo Gracie and

564
00:32:19.601 --> 00:32:23.890
Carlson Gracie and like the early masters. Really amazing,

565
00:32:23.891 --> 00:32:28.360
amazing story of one really one family that kind of revolutionized the way

566
00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:31.240
people fight on the ground and they just all focused on, right. I remember.

567
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.080
Yeah, they just were, they just were bad asses. Yeah.

568
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:36.250
They would just fight each other all the time and they were trying to figure out

569
00:32:36.251 --> 00:32:39.620
what works best and they, they just got it down to a fucking science.

570
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.250
There's the story

571
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:41.930
<v 1>about [inaudible] gene, the bell,</v>

572
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:43.820
but you could make this a little better so I can, can I read this?

573
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.070
You guys labelle said that when he got on the set,

574
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.960
Dob and sell the put Lee in a headlock or something,

575
00:32:47.961 --> 00:32:49.910
so labelle went up and grabbed Lee.

576
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.670
He started making all those noises and became,

577
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.550
they became famous for Labelle said, but he didn't try to counter me,

578
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.160
so I think he was more surprised than anything else.

579
00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.470
So he probably just grabbed him, got him in a headlock.

580
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.890
Then the belt lifted Lee onto his back. What's called a fireman's carry,

581
00:33:03.891 --> 00:33:05.540
a ran around the set with him and said,

582
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:08.720
put me down or I'll kill you Lee's cream. He said,

583
00:33:08.721 --> 00:33:12.770
I can't put you down or you'll kill me. Labelle said, hold the Lee there.

584
00:33:12.771 --> 00:33:15.950
As long as he dared before putting him down, saying, hey Bruce, don't kill me.

585
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:19.520
Just kidding. Champ, back on its feet again. Lee didn't kill the balance.

586
00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.620
Deadly recognized.

587
00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.140
His lack of grappling was deficiency in g style of martial arts that he was

588
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:28.640
developing c so there wasn't really a fight. But this is what I'm telling you.

589
00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:34.520
Labelle was so fucking powerful and such an amazing Judah God that if it was a

590
00:33:34.521 --> 00:33:36.680
fight it would have been really quick.

591
00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.760
So if that's who he was supposed to be portraying in the movie, like if that's,

592
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.830
if they showed that the Brad Pitt character was some judo champion that became a

593
00:33:45.831 --> 00:33:47.420
martial artists later. Okay.

594
00:33:47.421 --> 00:33:50.850
Maybe this guy was like a roofer while he was at peace.

595
00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.470
I was a fun part of the movie. It was great. Fucking liked that movie man.

596
00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:58.310
I love that. And it's so, it's a, it's like split camps on it.

597
00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.640
Like just in my circle of friends that I run into whatever,

598
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.200
people either loved it and,

599
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.800
and feel like they could have hung with it for two more hours or people were

600
00:34:06.801 --> 00:34:10.100
like, what's the point? What was the story? I don't get it. Those,

601
00:34:10.101 --> 00:34:14.590
I don't get it guys. Keep a real close on him.

602
00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.600
Like the Jeffrey Epstein, you're trying to keep alive. It's those people.

603
00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:22.880
I don't understand their thinking. I don't either. It was so enjoyed that,

604
00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.820
oh my God ass movie. Like, where are you not entertained?

605
00:34:25.821 --> 00:34:29.750
Like there was a lot of times in that movie. I was like, fuck yeah. Oh, ah,

606
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.510
great move. I could've just hung with it forever.

607
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:35.540
And especially being out here in la, it was just like that. Cool.

608
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:37.160
Musso and Frank's. Yes.

609
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.830
They didn't even have to do anything to make it look different.

610
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:44.270
I know that place. Like it's from 1969 are we supposed to go? Yeah,

611
00:34:44.271 --> 00:34:47.210
we're supposed to go. You and me and Joey, we've been talking about forever.

612
00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.010
We got to do it. Well, I'm in town this week.

613
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.180
There's a UFC in Anaheim this weekend. Oh really? La? Yeah, La all week.

614
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:54.470
I'm in la too.

615
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.300
This is the first two weekends in a row that I've been home I think in a year

616
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.133
and a half. Pull up Tom,

617
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.120
Papa's Instagram and took a look at that sweet elk meat.

618
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.060
Did you put it up on your Instagram? No, I didn't. Didn't here.

619
00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.690
I'll send it to you or I'll send it to Jamie. Why are you sending it to Jamie?

620
00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.340
Uh, oh my God. That was so good, dude. That shit's ridiculous.

621
00:35:13.341 --> 00:35:16.430
That's why I'm here today cause I run out of elk. You cooked it so well.

622
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.180
Hold on. I'm into food porn obviously. Yeah,

623
00:35:20.181 --> 00:35:21.830
I'm just going to bring you bread of course.

624
00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:23.870
But just an annoying thing about apple.

625
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:27.230
You want to take a photograph from a text message?

626
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.570
You can't search that person's name

627
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.280
because otherwise you can't get the photo. You know what I'm saying?

628
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:37.980
Like if I search your name, I have to actually send you a text

629
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.670
<v 0>once I'm doing something totally wrong. Swipe down.</v>

630
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:45.240
When you open up the messages at swipe down. Yeah.

631
00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:48.830
Look at that sweet breads search bar pops up. That does look sweet. Okay.

632
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.080
But it was uh, it was just, I couldn't, I couldn't give it to you.

633
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:56.430
It was just a little too stale and I'm like, I don't want to do it. Then. Yeah,

634
00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:00.980
next time you had stale bread, how has it, how, how many days is a,

635
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:05.010
an actual real bread go before it's stale? About four days. Wow.

636
00:36:05.011 --> 00:36:07.740
That's so crazy. So I make two at a time. So it depends how,

637
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:12.300
how much the ladies are eating. Wow. Yeah. Jamie, I just sent you,

638
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.770
I just sent it to you again, a photo of the meat. This was so good.

639
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.310
I just can't believe you cooked that PR, that per gas grill grill.

640
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:21.173
That's amazing.

641
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:25.470
Gas Grill on high and I flipped it four times.

642
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:30.390
What I'm cut was that, was that a roast? That was the tri tip. Oh Wow.

643
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:33.810
That looks good. Oh, so good. Damn, that looks good.

644
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.620
I know you're a really good cook. Thank you. You nailed that. Yeah,

645
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.220
try tip's a tricky one because there's not a lot of fat and I tried tip. No,

646
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:44.420
it's not doing that. You know, there was, there was, I, I remarked at that,

647
00:36:44.421 --> 00:36:45.960
that there were in a lot of flames coming up.

648
00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:49.130
It wasn't like dripping fat into the thing. It's a different cut. I mean,

649
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.470
but I just did it by feel and I was like, you, you know,

650
00:36:51.471 --> 00:36:54.960
you don't want it to be too, you know, stiff.

651
00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.650
And then he just pulled it off and uh, it's still nice.

652
00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.920
He does still have it waiting for me in the fridge. That's a plus right there.

653
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.370
Well, it's good stuff. So did you, you got another one you send it?

654
00:37:05.371 --> 00:37:09.960
Does that mean you hunted again or, I got a deer. You got a deer, deer. Lanai.

655
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:14.490
I'm going to give you some access tier two. Oh really? Ooh, boy. Boy was that,

656
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:18.630
is that, what's the taste difference? Um, it's uh, it's, it's different.

657
00:37:18.631 --> 00:37:21.470
It's definitely different, but it's really delicious. Yeah.

658
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.900
They're one of the fastest deer species on earth. They're crazy fast.

659
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.550
How big are they? Palo hundred and 3,050 pounds.

660
00:37:29.551 --> 00:37:33.660
Like Jamie size? No, Janie is bigger than that. Yeah.

661
00:37:33.661 --> 00:37:36.870
Like Tony Hinchcliffe sized. Right. Oh really? That's little

662
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.610
Tony. He's like, Hey, I'm here for meat,

663
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:47.040
ligaments and wise ass attitude. To put in perspective,

664
00:37:47.041 --> 00:37:50.880
you get about 400 pounds from an elk and you get about 40 pounds from a deer.

665
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:55.310
Oh my God. Yeah, definitely very different. The elk is so good. It's great.

666
00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.920
I don't buy it. You know, the last time you gave it gave me a bunch.

667
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:03.600
It's just been in the freezer to go and like buy like a steak at Gelson's or

668
00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:07.710
whatever. Or Ralph's. It's not happening. Well, I'm glad you enjoy it man.

669
00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:11.580
It's so cool to see that you like it and it's so good for you. You feel good.

670
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:15.690
Yes. Right. Crazy, right. That's not, yeah, it's not just a placebo effect.

671
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.140
I don't think so. No, I wasn't, I didn't get in the game to feel good.

672
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.710
I just wasn't because it was delicious. So many hunters say that. Yeah.

673
00:38:22.711 --> 00:38:24.600
So many hunters say that like you eat,

674
00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:28.710
you eat it and it like gives you like this boost event you'll you feel like

675
00:38:28.711 --> 00:38:32.250
energized cause it's so nutrient dense, so dark.

676
00:38:32.251 --> 00:38:36.190
And I mean it's an animal that like their main photo is

677
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:40.590
<v 1>wolves, mountain lions. I mean they're out there hustling. Yeah.</v>

678
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.470
If you can get, get ahold of that meat, that's, that's a meet of champions.

679
00:38:44.471 --> 00:38:49.360
It's good stuff. It's just they scream, they scream at each other like, boy,

680
00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:54.010
I mean you're eating like a mystical beast. That's what it feels like.

681
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.840
I respect it. But when you get into the store, a lot of times it's from farms.

682
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:00.880
It's from a farm in New Zealand, most likely.

683
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.330
I think they probably can do it at some places in the United States.

684
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.300
Maybe some places in Canada where they commercially farm elk,

685
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.160
but most elk that you get you actually get from New Zealand is really

686
00:39:12.161 --> 00:39:13.900
interesting. New Zealand's a weird place, man.

687
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:17.130
I've never been a lot of the lamb. Do you get it's from New Zealand. Oh yeah.

688
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:21.160
Yeah. The Dude New Zealand is really kind of crazy because they don't have any

689
00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:22.910
predators. Uh,

690
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.400
everything was brought over by a bunch of rich European guys. They're like,

691
00:39:27.401 --> 00:39:31.270
wouldn't it be great if we had sheep over here? They just brought sheep. Well,

692
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.160
it'd be great if we had stags.

693
00:39:33.490 --> 00:39:36.670
And so they brought over stags [inaudible] and antelope.

694
00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:40.160
I've ever seen a red stag. No. Beautiful, beautiful animal. Yeah,

695
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.670
they're all over the place in New Zealand. They brought them over there.

696
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.870
There was literally no large mammals in New Zealand and they brought all of them

697
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:49.990
over there. Jeez. See if you can get a photograph of a Red Stat,

698
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.840
New Zealand red stag. They're beautiful animals.

699
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.750
It's kind of like an elk and a lot of ways I think it looks like it's like the

700
00:39:55.751 --> 00:39:58.360
cousin of an elk. They have these gorgeous,

701
00:39:58.361 --> 00:40:02.020
gorgeous antlers and they're just these big crazy,

702
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.750
beautiful animals. Do you have another trip coming up?

703
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.830
I've never been in New Zealand. Um, are you going for elk again? Yeah,

704
00:40:08.831 --> 00:40:11.560
I'll be going in the fall. I was going to fall. It's nice.

705
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:14.800
You see you got a photo of one. Okay. That's a Scottish one.

706
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:19.210
Don't they have a New Zealand red stag? Okay, well that's the dark side.

707
00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:22.570
Click on that photo. Click it. No, no, the one. Okay. That's good too.

708
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:25.210
And the one below it. Let me see. You want to believe that huge people want,

709
00:40:25.211 --> 00:40:30.070
that's okay. This is the dark side c. Okay. Now what this is, Geez,

710
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.870
this is a New Zealand elk that's grown in a place where they,

711
00:40:33.871 --> 00:40:35.290
they grow them like this.

712
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:40.180
So it's probably a high fence operation and you probably feed these things.

713
00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:45.570
So they probably have like big bundles of food and the more food an animal like

714
00:40:46.871 --> 00:40:51.240
that gets, the more impressive Iraq though. That rack is insane. Yeah.

715
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.360
It's actually a really amazing podcast about,

716
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.370
oh see that looks like it's caught up in ropes or something.

717
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.370
What the hell is happening there? It's like in a tree or something.

718
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.610
What the fuck is going on? It looks like a volume.

719
00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.850
It must have got caught on something.

720
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:06.940
It looks like a vine wrapped around in there. That's so weird.

721
00:41:06.941 --> 00:41:10.290
I really don't understand what that is. I clicked on it. It's very abs.

722
00:41:10.291 --> 00:41:15.291
So it looks like the antlers are wrapped up in vines and then they shot it and

723
00:41:15.731 --> 00:41:19.450
left the vines on the head. They could have taken the vines off.

724
00:41:19.451 --> 00:41:23.450
Just out of respect. Out of respect. That does happen though. Like, uh,

725
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.120
sometimes deer will get um,

726
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.930
like barbwire and shit stuck in their antlers or bail wire.

727
00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.730
They'll get that shit stuck in their antlers.

728
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:34.160
They'll get trapped around their legs. Shit. [inaudible] man, that's

729
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.310
<v 4>awful. People always catch 'em deer 'em uh,</v>

730
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.820
or find deer rather that have been caught in fences. So like they,

731
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:43.420
they're jumping through fence and it gets twisted around and their leg gets

732
00:41:43.421 --> 00:41:47.660
stuck a, yeah, that's terrible. That's not cool. Oh, it's drag. It's a drag.

733
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:50.480
They find them. They're like coyotes, find them and they just eat them along.

734
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:54.650
You know, it's really good to is the sausage. Oh yeah. The sausage is fantastic.

735
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:59.300
Anyway, so that's why those antlers are so crazy. They're not, they don't,

736
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.570
if they were in the wild, that's not happening. You wouldn't get enough food.

737
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.110
Right.

738
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:06.110
There's a way I was going to say that there's a great podcast called the meat

739
00:42:06.111 --> 00:42:08.180
eater with my friend Steve Rinella.

740
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.260
There's an episode that there where they're talking about that, um,

741
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:15.380
that's out right now and find out which one it is.

742
00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:17.360
It's so much better to be interesting.

743
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.530
I just emotionally and mentally feel so much better eating it than I do.

744
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.400
Knowing that something came from like a big factory farm. It's just like,

745
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:30.580
it's called a episode one 80 teeth, horns and claws. And uh,

746
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.630
he sits down with, uh, a wildlife biologist and they're,

747
00:42:35.631 --> 00:42:40.580
they're talking about why animals grow things, why they grow, you know,

748
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.270
antlers and why they, why they let go with their antlers.

749
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.790
How you could take animals from one area where it looks like they have poor

750
00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:49.370
genetics as their antlers are small and they move into another place with more

751
00:42:49.371 --> 00:42:50.570
food, their antlers grow big.

752
00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.470
So it just seems to be a direct correlation between their diet and how much

753
00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:57.890
their antlers grow. So what they do with these, these animals most likely,

754
00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.860
and I don't know how all of them do it cause it they probably vary,

755
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:04.400
but I know um, in the United States, like when they have deer farms,

756
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:08.330
they feed them like a super high protein diet out of these feeders.

757
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.980
And so these animals eat this crazy high protein diet and their ambitious go

758
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:17.210
fucking filled with minerals. And like antler bone is a weird thing.

759
00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:20.360
It grows faster than any known bone on earth.

760
00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.600
So when you see a deer's antlers and they're gigantic,

761
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:28.160
that deer might have just grown those over the last three months. Really? Yes.

762
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:29.271
Geez. It's crazy.

763
00:43:29.271 --> 00:43:33.860
Especially Laz elk antler in particular because they let go their antlers very

764
00:43:33.861 --> 00:43:38.030
late. Like antlers fall off once they get done having sex.

765
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.690
They don't need the antlers anymore cause the antlers are mostly to like show

766
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.230
dudes. That's what I was gonna ask like a bird. Like it's floral,

767
00:43:45.231 --> 00:43:46.250
it's to attract.

768
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.600
But it also helps them in fights with each other because like the males will

769
00:43:50.601 --> 00:43:54.050
fight and they wind up for the lady. Yeah. They kill each other all the time.

770
00:43:54.051 --> 00:43:54.884
Especially elk.

771
00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.270
You'll find elks with like puncture wounds in their sides where they just jab

772
00:43:59.271 --> 00:44:00.610
each other and then yeah,

773
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:03.600
one of them will trip and the other one will run his fucking antlers through his

774
00:44:03.601 --> 00:44:07.310
body cavity. So when these people are feeding them this high protein stuff,

775
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:11.360
is it for the inlays or it's just for them too? For the antlers? It is, yes.

776
00:44:11.361 --> 00:44:15.620
It's so they developed these freakish antlers cause then it's a trophy. Yes.

777
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:18.830
But it's, there's two schools of thought on this.

778
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.050
There's people that think that's great. Look at the antlers.

779
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.500
And then there's people who are the purest people that would be in the Steve

780
00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:28.310
Vanilla camp that would find it grotesque. And we find it a direct,

781
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.140
direct evidence of a person meddling with it. Like almost like, yeah,

782
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.840
<v 1>that's what it kind of feels like. Right?</v>

783
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:37.290
Like almost akin in a way to like an animal.

784
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:39.850
That's where our color [inaudible] like why,

785
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.860
why is so obviously manipulated by a person like wild.

786
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:47.010
They don't have likes and wants to see worldly crazy shit that grows all over

787
00:44:47.011 --> 00:44:47.760
the place. Yeah.

788
00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.910
If you find one in the wild that has anything remotely like that,

789
00:44:50.911 --> 00:44:52.230
it's a freak of all freaks.

790
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:56.610
They do exist in places that have like amazing food and it would be more special

791
00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:59.060
because it's out there and it just happens. Right?

792
00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.590
Whereas these all take place inside a fence. It's kind of sketchy.

793
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:06.710
It's a little sketch but a little meddlesome.

794
00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:10.920
It's troublesome because they also have to hunt them. Right. So what,

795
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.840
so one of the problems is they will do these purges where they fly over and

796
00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:20.010
helicopters with certain species and they just got them down and they rank them

797
00:45:20.011 --> 00:45:22.680
to rock. Why? Because they tip, they have too many of them.

798
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.640
They're devastating to the local flora, all the different plants.

799
00:45:26.641 --> 00:45:29.070
And that is eat through everything. There's no predators.

800
00:45:29.071 --> 00:45:33.120
So credit goes right and my name port wolves and start some crazy gang wars.

801
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:36.750
Sounds Fun. There's a coyote.

802
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:41.460
Coyotes in my neighborhood are going nuts right now. They ripped apart a cat,

803
00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:46.140
three of them on one cat and somebody else lost one with the two coyotes.

804
00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:48.240
They gang up together and they go after these.

805
00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:53.100
My cat is a stay inside a lot because that's how the terrible life in the,

806
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.610
in the Hollywood area. Yeah. It's good. This, yeah.

807
00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:00.450
Cats are real trouble with these coyotes everywhere. I know their tricks.

808
00:46:00.451 --> 00:46:03.120
Smell your cat. You know where your cat is, right?

809
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.520
They know when you count there and they know when your cat's not there.

810
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:10.200
You don't even have to see him really. The winds coming down, like say if your,

811
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.740
if your cat's in your backyard and there's a coyote a mile away on the street

812
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:19.140
and the wind hits that cat and blows towards that coyote that coyote might be

813
00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:21.010
able to smell it. She's [inaudible].

814
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:25.710
They can smell some insane amount of distance.

815
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.430
Wow. And you know if, if the wind is blowing right,

816
00:46:29.431 --> 00:46:30.540
so it's blowing towards them,

817
00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:33.430
they can pick up these little things and next thing you know they're there

818
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:36.270
knowing that you've got something in your yard. Jeez Louise,

819
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:38.520
I want to help with the effective distance.

820
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:43.290
The way it was relayed to me was like you should consider the way a coyote could

821
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:48.270
smell or a bloodhound or any kind of crazy dog smell. The way you smell a skunk,

822
00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:52.110
you smell skunk like a skunk could be like blocks away,

823
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.810
but you fucking smell it so strong.

824
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:58.710
You could smell it like almost a mile away maybe. Yeah, maybe half mile. Yeah,

825
00:46:58.711 --> 00:47:01.560
probably a little less. That's how dogs are with everything. With everything.

826
00:47:01.561 --> 00:47:06.450
With your feet. It's a little smell. Your feet or guy that far away or puppy.

827
00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:12.540
Imagine they could smell another dog taken a lead block away. Like what? Yeah,

828
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:13.121
mother fucker.

829
00:47:13.121 --> 00:47:15.330
Is it funny when you're hanging with your dog and all of a sudden they just hit

830
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:16.570
their head goes up. Oh my God,

831
00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.870
this is purely out of smelling something in the distance.

832
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:21.270
I was taking my dog out today and it was amazing.

833
00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:25.710
The stuff he stops for what fucking going on with this Bush?

834
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.070
Just freak out. Like what the fuck is he smells man.

835
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.910
You smell it like I have zero idea what he smells like.

836
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:38.320
There was a possum here five hours ago. That's what they say about bears.

837
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.990
That bears can not only smell you,

838
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:46.320
they can smell you hours later and know how long it was that you pass through.

839
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:52.160
So no, whether or not it's worth going after you. Geez. Oh,

840
00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.140
why is it the best? They just have, they have a multiple,

841
00:47:56.230 --> 00:48:01.230
I think I want to say a bear's nose is nine times stronger than a bloodhounds.

842
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.790
What? Yes. I think that's the case really.

843
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.880
I think it's like nine times stronger than the bloodhounds. That's amazing.

844
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:14.380
Yeah, so think about insane bloodhounds nose. Yeah. See if that's true.

845
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.540
What does it say gen? Why they're so manic?

846
00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:19.470
I just looking at smell ranges and I typed in bear smell orange.

847
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:23.710
It says it can smell a carcass from up to 20 miles away.

848
00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:28.150
Jesus. Wow. It's 20 miles. Yeah, let's, let's bring those back.

849
00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:30.800
What a good idea. You fucking assholes.

850
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.880
You know California used to have a lot of them. Oh, grizzlies, man. Really?

851
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:39.670
Oh yeah. We killed them all. Or not us, but people in 18 hundreds right.

852
00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.940
That's our state flag, Bro, and push them up up north,

853
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.240
but let's not pushed him off. They murdered them. There's no pushing.

854
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.490
They killed them all. Geez. Yeah.

855
00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:53.020
The last time a guy died at the hands of a grizzly bear that was documented in

856
00:48:53.021 --> 00:48:55.810
California was a guy, I think his name is Steven Laveck,

857
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.780
and there's a town up on the way to Bakersfield.

858
00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:01.870
If you ever got to go do a gig up in big Bakersfield, you have to Bakersfield.

859
00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.750
It's great out there. It is nice I to get out there. That fun peep.

860
00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:07.850
It's got that cool desert vibe. You instantly, you're in the country somehow.

861
00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.660
But anyway, on the way up there,

862
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:14.710
there's a town called the VEC and Laveck was named after the last man to get

863
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:18.400
killed by a grizzly bear. Oh really? Yeah. And they, they, they go,

864
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:23.460
they zoomed him many years later to see if the story was true and his body was

865
00:49:23.801 --> 00:49:28.480
destroyed like something bit through his tiny bones and mauled through J. Guys,

866
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.630
you get tore apart by a bear. There is a, in New Jersey right now,

867
00:49:31.631 --> 00:49:34.830
they're having a, in North Jersey, they're having a black bear problem. Yeah.

868
00:49:34.831 --> 00:49:38.050
You know why? Because their government stopped the hunting on bears.

869
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:42.490
The governor decided to stop the bear hunt. It was a part of him being elected.

870
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:44.020
But these people,

871
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:47.500
you're going to come face to face with the consequences of not managing

872
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:52.150
dangerous wildlife. Black bears are dangerous wildlife. They're beer all over.

873
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.450
Yes, they a problem. Beautiful. They're amazing.

874
00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.690
It's definitely good to have them around,

875
00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.650
but you cannot let them overpopulate without a management plan.

876
00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:07.000
And that's what I think was the difference between the way this guy was

877
00:50:07.001 --> 00:50:09.940
approaching it and the way wildlife biologists were approaching it.

878
00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:11.470
They're approaching it from an emotional issue.

879
00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:14.860
They don't want people to kill bears, right, but you have to take if,

880
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.470
if the bear becomes something that kills you,

881
00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:19.660
which it could at one point in time, I mean,

882
00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:22.570
there was a kid from Rutgers that got killed by a bear couple years back.

883
00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.620
It's not, it's very rare. It's very rare that a person gets killed by a bear,

884
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:30.380
but that can happen more often and that very rare. It's not going to,

885
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:32.930
do you have any comfort? It's if your kid turns up missing, right?

886
00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.870
You know your kid can't be in the backyard because bears might get your kid.

887
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:38.230
That's real. You guys out of your fucking mind, right?

888
00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.570
Like bears are giant wild dogs that again, like Jamie said,

889
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:45.380
can smell a carcass 20 miles away. Get the fuck Outta here. Kill them all

890
00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:49.880
gun, gun them down. Don't let them, don't let them overtake your neighborhood.

891
00:50:49.881 --> 00:50:52.340
I'm not saying they shouldn't be in the woods. They should,

892
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:57.110
but they should stay the fuck out of like suburbs, suburb, neighborhoods.

893
00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:01.640
What the problem also is that it's just growing. There's so many humans.

894
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:04.100
Every year, more and more humans, more and more developments.

895
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:07.850
There's really not much land for these animals. That's an interesting argument.

896
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:12.020
Not that good though, but it hasn't expanded that much.

897
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:14.930
What's what's happened is the populations of the animals is arisen,

898
00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:17.390
but isn't it the, but there is sprawl.

899
00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:22.420
There's more developments and certainly sprawl in comparison to like the fifties

900
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.100
the sixties seventies eighties and nineties what is happening now with these

901
00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.130
overpopulations of animals is there's no one doing anything about,

902
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:31.520
see if you have bears, they don't have a fucking,

903
00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:35.360
there's no predators for bears. They occasionally eat each other.

904
00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.300
They do it all the time. Actually. They're killing each other all the time.

905
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:41.960
Especially cubs, maleZ , cubs females or eat their own cubs.

906
00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:43.643
Where did they get to do that?

907
00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:47.930
We were in Alberta and one of the guys that I was with, my friend John,

908
00:51:47.931 --> 00:51:52.931
his son saw a bear kill a cub and then the mother or the cub ate it.

909
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:58.670
Jeez. Yeah. It's with these guys. This is the life they live, man.

910
00:51:58.671 --> 00:52:03.320
They're not movie characters. They're wild predators and they're enormous.

911
00:52:03.321 --> 00:52:05.150
These are several hundred pounds.

912
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:08.520
And if you think it's cute to have millions of them, and it's like,

913
00:52:08.521 --> 00:52:12.650
do you know that New Jersey has the densest population of black bears in all of

914
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:15.650
North America? Yeah. New Jersey. Right?

915
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.240
Bananas that is the most densely populated for humans.

916
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.940
It really, really is the most populated state because densely populated state.

917
00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:26.480
Yeah. Cause it's not, but it has on, there's a lot of people,

918
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.400
there's a lot of woods still a lot of woods.

919
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:30.050
There's a lot of places for these things to live.

920
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:33.710
But if you have bears and there's nothing, there's no wolves and there's no,

921
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.590
there's no mountain lines. There's nothing taken the bears out.

922
00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:41.300
Let's just bears deer too. Yeah, a crazy amount. I was just there.

923
00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.210
I have family there and we were just driving around the summers,

924
00:52:44.211 --> 00:52:46.490
like they were just popping up everywhere.

925
00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.620
I mean the bears probably eating the shit out of them too.

926
00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.630
They're responsible for the death of 50% of all deer fawns bears.

927
00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:54.830
There's, yeah.

928
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:57.950
They just go around and eat the half of the deer fawns getting eaten by bears.

929
00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:02.330
Wow. Yeah. They did do the study, like where were deer fawns getting jacked?

930
00:53:02.331 --> 00:53:04.380
It's like mostly bears there. I mean,

931
00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:08.390
mountain lions get them to luxury funds hanging out at the mall,

932
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:11.000
eating at a Chick-Filet, but there's no mountain lines in New Jersey,

933
00:53:11.001 --> 00:53:14.870
so there's all bears. The Fonz there, they're all getting jacked by bears. Well,

934
00:53:14.871 --> 00:53:17.120
that was the big debate, I believe when I was there,

935
00:53:17.121 --> 00:53:21.500
was they were thinking about a allowing bear hunting. Well,

936
00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:24.890
why was it legal? It was a big kerfuffle,

937
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.630
or whether or not it's been leaked. It was legal.

938
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:31.170
This new government made it illegal. Right, right, right.

939
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:34.770
But the people that live there think it's terrible idea to make it illegal,

940
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:37.980
to make it illegal. I get it. I get, people don't want bears to die,

941
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:40.470
but you just have to understand management.

942
00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:44.250
You have to manage wildlife numbers when you're around people. I mean,

943
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:48.300
this idea that you shouldn't do that because they sh they should be here because

944
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:51.360
they were here first and we're taking over their land. You're right.

945
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:55.380
You're right about all those things. You're right. But we're teen people. Okay.

946
00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:58.860
We're dealing with, right, exactly. You can't let many,

947
00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:01.560
many bears move into your area. It's a fucking disaster.

948
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.080
They're gonna eat your garbage. You're going to get scared.

949
00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:06.910
Someone's gonna get bit, someone could die. Yeah. I mean, and,

950
00:54:06.911 --> 00:54:11.040
and it accelerates with the population increase, right? Whatever it is. I mean,

951
00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:14.220
there's a wild video from 'em.

952
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:18.540
Fuck what far Rockaway, which is oh, really? Yeah.

953
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:23.130
And these two bears, it's like, it's like Queens, New York.

954
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:27.870
These two bears get in a, they start duking it out. Shit. No,

955
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:31.250
that's not the far Rockaway one. Um, there's a, is that far walkway?

956
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:34.560
Is that what it says? Okay. Far Rockaway, New Jersey. Okay. This is,

957
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:38.760
this is a different one, but it's so same is brand new. Oh, Jesus Christ.

958
00:54:38.761 --> 00:54:41.820
A couple of cheese. So like Grizzly Jews, these are big bears.

959
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.520
Picture them smaller. These are more than 200 pounds.

960
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:48.690
That's what it looks like to me. I'm looking at them 200 plus pound bears.

961
00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:51.360
It's like Jamie Times two. Well, there's another one where these,

962
00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:54.960
these bears fight where I'm not bullshitting the bears look like 400 pound

963
00:54:54.961 --> 00:54:58.710
bears. They're fucking enormous. And they knock over this, uh,

964
00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:02.700
they knock over this, um, a mailbox and they crash into some garbage.

965
00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:06.390
They're so big dude, and they spill out onto the street. Why cars are there?

966
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:09.850
Oh my God. Cars are watching this and you get a real, uh,

967
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:13.720
perspective sense of how big they are with the cars, right?

968
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:17.670
I'm guessing 300 pounds plus maybe 400 pounds.

969
00:55:17.671 --> 00:55:21.420
They gotta be fast to it out with each other in front of everybody in New Jersey

970
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:26.880
and people's yard. God, another one with two giant bears in the same area.

971
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:31.410
Oh my God. From earlier this year. We're up a few times.

972
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:33.380
So this is another one. Yeah. God plan.

973
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:37.550
My sister had a whole family just walking down her street. Dude, this,

974
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:41.550
this is going to be a problem and they're going to have to hire people to go and

975
00:55:41.551 --> 00:55:42.384
kill these things.

976
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:47.700
Understand is one person getting eaten well at the Taco Bell and could be a lot

977
00:55:47.701 --> 00:55:49.830
of different things. Can Be People's dogs. Yeah.

978
00:55:49.831 --> 00:55:51.960
This was the original video that I saw. So these do,

979
00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.950
they're fighting right outside these people's house and then they Duke it out.

980
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.790
They Duke it out. They uh, they eventually crash into the mailbox.

981
00:56:00.450 --> 00:56:03.750
It's Shaked on camera work. Yeah. Well this cause he's, he's terrified of this.

982
00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.420
The Duke Bobby also though,

983
00:56:06.421 --> 00:56:10.410
this is like a good sign that these were a old ass fucking cameras.

984
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.580
This is like before they really had stabilization on cell phone cameras.

985
00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:18.660
The size of these fucks chaise and they're just fighting.

986
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:22.980
It's on the streets, on all these peaks. Oh Man. Oh Man.

987
00:56:23.020 --> 00:56:25.520
This is what happens when you don't let people hunt them. Wow.

988
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:27.250
Or this is what happens when you don't hunt them enough.

989
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:31.510
You gotta manage approach. Yes. Dude, it's fucking dangerous, man.

990
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:35.650
These are wild animals and these people that live there are soft ass

991
00:56:35.651 --> 00:56:39.640
domesticated people. They, they're not, they're not like us.

992
00:56:39.641 --> 00:56:42.340
They don't know how to fight back these things.

993
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:47.350
That is massive. These are big. They're big. Those are big bears.

994
00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.620
That's not what I pictured. Like you ever go to the black bear diner?

995
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:54.400
They have what they am out here looking at tape like all these wooden bears.

996
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:57.550
That's really cool. Look at this. They make them look so adorable.

997
00:56:57.551 --> 00:57:00.970
They wear hats. They've got vests on. I didn't see them crashing anything.

998
00:57:01.090 --> 00:57:04.150
Maybe I was wrong about that. Maybe there's another one. Wow.

999
00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:08.590
This is many of these videos of bears fighting God.

1000
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:11.830
You Know Alaska takes it one step further though. One of my favorite videos is,

1001
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.670
I'll say they did knock in the sun. No, that's, no, no, no. Well they didn't.

1002
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:19.450
They slipped in Alaska say you can shoot them in their den now. I don't think.

1003
00:57:19.451 --> 00:57:22.270
It wasn't that big thing. I don't think that's what I heard.

1004
00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.670
Unless they're trying to get rid of a certain number of them.

1005
00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:27.460
What I was going to talk about was moose and people's driveways.

1006
00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:30.820
There's this crazy fight where this guy sitting in front of his car in the

1007
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:31.211
morning,

1008
00:57:31.211 --> 00:57:33.640
sitting in his car in front of his house in the morning and he's filming and

1009
00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:37.660
he's just Moose duking it out on the front lawn.

1010
00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:44.110
They are fucking enormous and they're smashing antlers right on this guy.

1011
00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:47.680
It. It's look at this, look at this man. Whoa, this is fucking crazy.

1012
00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:51.940
They're so big. They crash into that car. God, I fucked that car up.

1013
00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:57.090
But imagine this is your house and you watch in two huge moose do like this.

1014
00:57:58.181 --> 00:58:01.270
This would like to live in a place like that. Well, you can move to Anchorage,

1015
00:58:01.271 --> 00:58:03.820
Alaska. This can happen to you. It would be fun.

1016
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:07.930
You'd move right next to Sarah Pailin. My caption. Cat's fucked.

1017
00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:11.620
My cat wouldn't make it. Cat becomes an indoor cat locker in the house.

1018
00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:15.370
When you open the door, don't let her out because everything jacker. Yeah,

1019
00:58:15.371 --> 00:58:19.450
look at these things, man. They don't Bro. Oh, got him on his back.

1020
00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:23.560
Take down there. So big man. These are so, so you,

1021
00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:28.600
this guy's running the cameras. This is just how you put it in perspective,

1022
00:58:28.601 --> 00:58:32.350
right? A deer is like maybe a hundred like a,

1023
00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.500
like a access to you was like maybe 150 pounds. An Elk,

1024
00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.330
a big one is like closing in a thousand pounds. Yeah, 800 900 pounds.

1025
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:44.080
A Moose is twice that big. Twice that twice, that bet.

1026
00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:47.470
1800 2000 pounds sometimes. Oh my God.

1027
00:58:47.471 --> 00:58:49.360
Big male moves like those moves right there.

1028
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:54.130
She easily could have been 600 1600 pounds 17 they're so big.

1029
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.470
And those were big ones, man. They had giant antlers.

1030
00:58:56.850 --> 00:58:58.120
See how wide their antlers are.

1031
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:03.370
You see one that's like a fully mature Moose fool man. Fucking normal.

1032
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:07.450
I came around a bend on my motorcycle in Maine once and there was just a moose

1033
00:59:07.451 --> 00:59:11.170
just standing there in the middle of the road like this. It was like a wall.

1034
00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:11.561
It was like,

1035
00:59:11.561 --> 00:59:15.400
I think there's a wall in the middle of the road and it was a gigantic moose.

1036
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:17.800
Greg Fitzsimmons did this Gig in New Hampshire and they told you,

1037
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.500
told him that he couldn't swear. So Greg,

1038
00:59:20.501 --> 00:59:23.840
when he was young as he is today was a smart ass. But yeah,

1039
00:59:23.841 --> 00:59:26.030
today's professionals back then,

1040
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:28.010
he was just kind of learning the smart ass crap.

1041
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:32.390
So he immediately opened up with, hey, what's going on? Fuckers? Like,

1042
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.760
and then of course it doesn't, it doesn't clean up his act at all.

1043
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:40.430
And they sent him home.

1044
00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:44.660
But what was crazy was on the way up there, they were telling them,

1045
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:48.190
do not drive at night because of the Moose, cause you could hit him.

1046
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:52.390
But he goes after my show, they were so mad at me. They like, fuck you go drive.

1047
00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:58.860
They sat in the dark in New Hampshire with the Moose out.

1048
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:04.430
I just love the picture of a young Fitzsimmons. Who was he? Hilarious.

1049
01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:07.130
I'm such a smart ass. Such a smart ass.

1050
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.490
I've known Greg since we literally started out like within a week of each other.

1051
01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:14.000
Oh really? An Open Mike night. Wow. I met him early in New York.

1052
01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:18.170
Did we did so many shitty gigs together. He was, he was a, he was,

1053
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:22.940
he was mean. Greg

1054
01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:29.000
is cutting. I mean I always got along great. Nice. But no, but he had that,

1055
01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.330
you know, he had Fitzsimmons attitude where if he, if he locks it on you,

1056
01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:35.180
you're toast. Oh yeah. If he thinks you suck. Yeah.

1057
01:00:35.181 --> 01:00:38.810
If he thinks you suck and you know him, especially if you know, if you're not,

1058
01:00:38.811 --> 01:00:42.800
if you're cocky, you don't know me.

1059
01:00:42.801 --> 01:00:46.980
Mother fucker. Here. It's, you hear that joke is, that's hilarious.

1060
01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:49.700
It's a hilarious bit. I tell him a lot of hilarious.

1061
01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:52.580
I tell him every time I see him, it's the best. It's the best bit of the year.

1062
01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:57.620
Yeah. I think Greg and I probably we,

1063
01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.080
I don't how many gigs we did together,

1064
01:01:00.081 --> 01:01:04.880
but for like the first few years of our comedy when we're really starting to get

1065
01:01:04.881 --> 01:01:09.070
like road gigs. Yeah, yeah. We did a shit ton of them together, but Mike,

1066
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:11.630
nice man. We'd just drive all the way down to Rhode Island.

1067
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:13.820
We'd drive to Providence, Rhode Island to work.

1068
01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.700
They'll do like 10 minutes for free. Wow. Of course.

1069
01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:21.170
We're so excited. Maybe no great. Might have been five minutes.

1070
01:01:21.171 --> 01:01:24.220
Who would drive whoever whoever's fucking car worked. Right.

1071
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:31.300
I remember one time me and Greg and this other dude were in a car and the other

1072
01:01:31.551 --> 01:01:36.551
dude starts talking about vibrators in his ass and about how much his girlfriend

1073
01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:42.851
likes to put vibrators in his ass and we're maybe saying this another comment

1074
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.320
[inaudible] this comic is telling us this crazy story.

1075
01:01:45.321 --> 01:01:50.030
I mean we're trapped with this guy all the way to Maine driving and he's in the

1076
01:01:50.031 --> 01:01:53.060
back seat talking about taking in the ass with vibrators and I'm like, what?

1077
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:56.000
We didn't get that close like this is,

1078
01:01:56.670 --> 01:02:00.340
it's a weird time to bring up the subject. It's his opening conversations.

1079
01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.920
Like I'm not averse to that subject. I'm not adverse to you discussing.

1080
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:06.650
I don't think but play. First of all,

1081
01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:09.770
I don't think there's anything wrong with being gay and I don't think,

1082
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.220
but play makes you gay, so let's, let's just like, it's just, it's intimate.

1083
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.080
It's an intimate opener. That's what I'm saying.

1084
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:18.020
Let sued all those worries right there.

1085
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:20.570
I'm whatever you are.

1086
01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:23.610
No problem with you getting your butt touched and I have no problem with you

1087
01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:25.530
being gay. This is just not what I'm talking about.

1088
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:29.490
This is like why you're driving. Hello? Yeah, my girl, she loved it.

1089
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:34.020
Put vibrators in my asshole. Like what? Hello, how are you? Nice to meet you.

1090
01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:38.250
My girlfriend and we knew this guy, but we didn't know this guy. Like, no,

1091
01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:39.180
this guy. How did you know him?

1092
01:02:39.181 --> 01:02:42.720
As much as I knew Greg and if Greg was telling me that with in a car with

1093
01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:45.510
somebody else, I'd be like, why are you telling me what this other dude is here?

1094
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.820
This is something you don't want everybody to know. Yeah. IX,

1095
01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:50.550
nay on the ass play.

1096
01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:54.210
This doesn't seem like I would want to broadcast that to just random strangers.

1097
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:57.360
This Tony wanted us to know that a,

1098
01:02:57.361 --> 01:03:01.300
his girl liked to put vibrators in his asshole and we were going to,

1099
01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:06.420
we're trapped with this guy and sadly he wasn't that good of a comedian.

1100
01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:10.290
He's a boy. Yeah. Neither were any of us back then,

1101
01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:13.950
but we were a little better than him. He was in this,

1102
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.420
he was in his range.

1103
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:20.850
There's a range that happens with early comedy when young comics coming up where

1104
01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:22.440
you're like, Ooh, I don't know if you're ever going to get out of it.

1105
01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:26.420
<v 3>Yeah. Now you can see pretty quickly like sometimes some of us,</v>

1106
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:30.770
you suck in the beginning, but you have a hint. Yeah. There's something there.

1107
01:03:30.771 --> 01:03:33.110
Something there. Yeah, no, exactly. Yeah.

1108
01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:40.740
Kyle Dunnigan and I did a show early on for a high school in New Jersey and we

1109
01:03:41.301 --> 01:03:44.100
drove out there and they'd, same thing, just be really clean,

1110
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:47.920
make sure it's really clean, it's gotta be clean. And, uh,

1111
01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:52.580
Kyle went up, I went up and I, you're bombing because it's high school kids.

1112
01:03:52.581 --> 01:03:56.540
You don't have a great act to begin with and it's all high school children and

1113
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:59.630
you have nothing to relate to them and they don't want to listen to a man

1114
01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:03.100
talking. And how old are you at the time? Uh,

1115
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:07.160
probably 32, something like that. I don't know. 35.

1116
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:12.470
And uh, I'm just bombing and just trying to get through it. And then,

1117
01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.790
uh, and then Kyle comes out and he's the whole time backstage. He's like,

1118
01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.840
do I do my songs? Do I do my songs? I'm like, well, you know, I don't know.

1119
01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:24.690
Whatever it works, you know, just try and keep it clean. He comes down,

1120
01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:28.550
he sings the song. Uh, it was about the, uh,

1121
01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:33.200
Irish parade, the Saint Patrick's Day parade sung like in an Irish brogue.

1122
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.430
And one line was if it was about, oh with the, they were allowing,

1123
01:04:37.431 --> 01:04:40.700
they were debating whether or not homosexuals could march in the parade.

1124
01:04:40.701 --> 01:04:45.010
That was a big thing in New York for for like a decade and Kyle had a,

1125
01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.470
a funny song about it and the line was if your ass,

1126
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:54.260
if you're, if, if my cock is, if my cock is the ladle,

1127
01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:58.310
your ass be the Stu, like the song is like an iron.

1128
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:59.930
If your cock be the ladies,

1129
01:04:59.931 --> 01:05:04.830
let me ask me the stew and I just hear him like starting to get to it and he

1130
01:05:04.831 --> 01:05:07.790
goes into it. It's the first thing that the audience loves.

1131
01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.660
The kids are so excited by it. Fast forward, the show's over,

1132
01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:16.580
we're going to get paid and a high school principal is livid.

1133
01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:21.760
He's got a, he has a Winnie the Pooh and there's two girls there.

1134
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.800
There's cheese, got a Winnie the Pooh Thai,

1135
01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:28.600
he's he so angry and he's yelling at us, what are these?

1136
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:32.490
Our children, your assets, your caucus,

1137
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.860
the ladle and there's two and there's two girls.

1138
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.850
They made us cupcakes and had construction paper saying thank you for performing

1139
01:05:39.851 --> 01:05:43.750
at our school with stars and Mules and they don't know whether they should give

1140
01:05:43.751 --> 01:05:47.230
us the treats or not because the principal is just yelling at us.

1141
01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.310
But these are high schools.

1142
01:05:49.310 --> 01:05:52.970
<v 0>So funny. These are high school kids though. We got the cheque. Yes.</v>

1143
01:05:52.971 --> 01:05:56.870
High school kids. There are new those things. That's why they laughed. Oh,

1144
01:05:56.871 --> 01:06:00.320
of course. Of course. But he couldn't sanctioning. But Kyle just, you know,

1145
01:06:00.321 --> 01:06:03.490
you're dying and yet you have no, you have no material.

1146
01:06:03.491 --> 01:06:05.690
So what else is it going to do? He had to break out the song.

1147
01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:10.430
There's nothing else he can do. He just tried to survive and get paid.

1148
01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.300
You can get out of there. Yeah. You got to survive.

1149
01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:17.540
You've got to take it on the chin. Hey, you got to come on my radio show.

1150
01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:22.130
I got to, yeah. Did you say you do it at seven in the morning? Seven to nine.

1151
01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:26.210
Why do you gotta do that? Well, I don't know.

1152
01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:29.270
You should do it when you're awake. I know. She wants to be good.

1153
01:06:29.271 --> 01:06:33.710
It's really early. Does it stream live or something? Yeah, it's on serious.

1154
01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.140
It's Netflix is a joke. Radio, you know they have,

1155
01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:40.670
they took all their specials and they run them on so confused on the Netflix

1156
01:06:40.671 --> 01:06:45.350
radio. I was thinking that Netflix was going to have its own radio channel.

1157
01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:50.000
Like you have a Netflix Channel v a and their own radio channel.

1158
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:53.270
That's why I was thinking like, oh you'd like, there's gonna be an a comedy,

1159
01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:56.000
like an app, like a new thing that they're doing.

1160
01:06:56.030 --> 01:07:00.540
It's like raw dog on Sirius XM or comedy rates of serious to listen to him now.

1161
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:01.820
Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

1162
01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.950
That you could listen to it on the Netflix app. Cause you know,

1163
01:07:03.951 --> 01:07:07.880
so many people listen to Netflix on their phones now. Oh read a lot. Yeah.

1164
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.350
So many people watch specials.

1165
01:07:09.351 --> 01:07:12.230
I think they said that like 50% of the people that watch my Netflix special

1166
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:14.720
watch on a phone. Wow. Yeah. They're actually,

1167
01:07:14.721 --> 01:07:19.721
even many people are formatting their specials to make them better to watch on

1168
01:07:20.031 --> 01:07:22.510
phones. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Like their,

1169
01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:26.030
the way they're shooting it in terms of like how they zoom in on the shot,

1170
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:29.550
what shots they choose, how they're doing it. So you can look at it on,

1171
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:33.700
you know, fucking Samsung Galaxy. That's interesting. Plus or something,

1172
01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:36.530
you know. So they have all these specials from all these people.

1173
01:07:36.531 --> 01:07:41.531
So like started their own channel and I have the first radio show on it and it

1174
01:07:41.661 --> 01:07:46.040
runs seven to nine out here. And then, uh, and then two to four.

1175
01:07:46.041 --> 01:07:50.450
So it's drive time here in the morning and drive time in New York in the

1176
01:07:50.451 --> 01:07:55.280
afternoon. And you and fortune, fortune, fortune Feemster. Yeah. She's so funny.

1177
01:07:55.281 --> 01:07:58.400
He's very funny. I love her. Very cool person. Yeah. They were like,

1178
01:07:58.401 --> 01:08:01.400
who do you want, you know, to do this with you? And,

1179
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:04.130
and she was on this short list. I was like, oh done.

1180
01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:08.540
She always seems very friendly. She's really fun. She just merged two murders,

1181
01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:11.360
murders on stage. She's so funny. She's very, very funny.

1182
01:08:11.361 --> 01:08:16.040
Her Instagram's really funny. She dances, she does ice cream dances. She always

1183
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.530
<v 1>gets an ice cream cone and dances along with it.</v>

1184
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.020
We need to get her and Faheem together. Yeah. Work out.

1185
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:22.670
But it's cool cause it's all comedy.

1186
01:08:22.671 --> 01:08:25.400
It's all comedians coming in talking about their specials,

1187
01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.890
talking about comedy and yeah, it's pretty fun. But it's early. It's early.

1188
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:32.570
[inaudible] I'm not sure if it's really necessary. Yeah,

1189
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:33.411
you got to put your foot down.

1190
01:08:33.411 --> 01:08:36.780
You could do it the night before and have it run in the morning cause we're not

1191
01:08:36.781 --> 01:08:38.240
like doing hard news.

1192
01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:42.080
You could just bypass that system and do a podcast.

1193
01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:44.840
And I do have a podcast. I know you do,

1194
01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:48.380
but do it like do it in the podcast form. Yeah,

1195
01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:53.270
just do a successful podcast specific contract for a certain amount of time.

1196
01:08:53.271 --> 01:08:57.350
I'm not trying to get you out here a yeah,

1197
01:08:57.351 --> 01:09:01.670
we're going to do it for a year and then um, it is fun.

1198
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:04.130
I am enjoying it, but it's good. But you know what,

1199
01:09:04.131 --> 01:09:07.360
it's gonna mess with my spots during the week. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1200
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:08.271
That's what we were saying.

1201
01:09:08.271 --> 01:09:10.390
I was saying if you wanted to do the Improv to one night,

1202
01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.280
you said you really can't because you got to get up early in the morning.

1203
01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:16.730
I could do an early show. I can't do late shows. Tough Shit.

1204
01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.800
Show starts at 10 30 I don't know what to tell you.

1205
01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.140
We're not gonna move everything back for you Tom.

1206
01:09:24.141 --> 01:09:26.510
Why you thought we were friends? Shouldn't have a job like that.

1207
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:30.680
Preposterous job. You're up at seven in the morning talking. It's crazy. Yeah,

1208
01:09:30.681 --> 01:09:33.890
it's doing morning radio all the time. If I'm up at seven in the morning,

1209
01:09:33.891 --> 01:09:38.360
I'm exercising. I'm not. I want to get things done first.

1210
01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:43.430
I don't want to just wake up and talk. Hey Ho can't remember names.

1211
01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:47.990
My Batman memory is 50% is good when I first wake up. I'm really, yeah,

1212
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.460
50% Starks sucks. It's terrible. You hit me with a pop quiz.

1213
01:09:52.461 --> 01:09:55.480
How long does it take you to dust off the cobwebs? I don't know. I'll,

1214
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:56.790
I often thought about that. Right?

1215
01:09:56.791 --> 01:10:00.460
I often thought about like how dumb I am during the day. If there was like a,

1216
01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.970
a meter you could like see like now I should make some good decisions.

1217
01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:07.130
Just getting smarter, getting two in the afternoon,

1218
01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:11.110
I'll feeling pretty fucking good, you know, but somewhere around, uh,

1219
01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:14.450
late at night and everything starts to fall apart and early in the morning,

1220
01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:19.030
everything falls apart. It's late at night for you. Like one ish, one 30,

1221
01:10:19.050 --> 01:10:21.590
like I don't work out at one 30 in the morning.

1222
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.220
I really don't have the energy to workout physically working.

1223
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:29.840
Like sometimes I'll be writing at one 30 in the morning and I can right at one

1224
01:10:29.841 --> 01:10:32.920
30 in the morning. But if I had to go through one of my workout routines,

1225
01:10:32.921 --> 01:10:36.790
like a physical activity, like a real work, I can't do it now.

1226
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:39.650
Well you shouldn't, it's one o'clock in the morning. Right.

1227
01:10:39.651 --> 01:10:43.520
But that fee that's letting you know that there is a cycle to where you have

1228
01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.680
energy. Right. And where you don't have energy when you're awake,

1229
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:47.210
when you're not awake. Yeah. Yeah.

1230
01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:52.280
But some people they perform way better late in the afternoon. Like a,

1231
01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:55.760
I used to feel that way about Jujitsu class, like early morning Jujitsu classes.

1232
01:10:55.761 --> 01:10:59.470
I was terrible. I just couldn't get my body warmed up. It's really, yeah,

1233
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:04.280
I didn't like them but the evening ones, like an eight 30 class I was peaking.

1234
01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:09.230
Oh, interesting. I'm better working out early. Yeah. Yeah.

1235
01:11:09.410 --> 01:11:12.950
It's like after lunch. What does a typical Tom Papa,

1236
01:11:13.210 --> 01:11:14.043
like how do you start your day?

1237
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.090
<v 3>Um, radio day or no radio day. Regular Day off parts.</v>

1238
01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:23.450
I don't want to get a little, well I guess we're fast forward into noon.

1239
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:29.930
Okay. Give me a radio. Non Radio Day. Non Radio Day.

1240
01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.700
I get up at seven. I get up at seven. I go upstairs, a soldier,

1241
01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:39.170
I make coffee, I get one cup of coffee. Do you play classical music softly?

1242
01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:43.310
Once in awhile? Yeah. Usually a picture you OCD butter on your toast.

1243
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:46.670
That's sort of weird. No, I don't, I don't eat straight away.

1244
01:11:46.671 --> 01:11:49.790
It's just straight black coffee into the office.

1245
01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:54.320
I have an office and I try and write. I sit at the desk,

1246
01:11:54.321 --> 01:11:55.670
I call it going into the shop,

1247
01:11:56.270 --> 01:12:01.270
and I sit there and I write and I make sure that there's no appointments until

1248
01:12:02.121 --> 01:12:05.570
noon. Anything I'm going to do, I don't do it until noon,

1249
01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:09.410
except if I'm going to go for a run or workout,

1250
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:14.540
I'll put in a couple of hours and then when I start to fade, I'll, uh,

1251
01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:19.760
I'll, uh, go for a run and then come back and continue. Oh, I skipped something.

1252
01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.960
I'm sorry. Uh, before the coffee.

1253
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:27.110
If I'm up early enough and the house isn't up,

1254
01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:30.840
I'll meditate first for 20 minutes before,

1255
01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.400
even right before I coffee, before I write. Really? Yeah.

1256
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.440
Wake up water in the face,

1257
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:41.470
maybe brushed teeth up into the office and then take 20 right away because it's

1258
01:12:42.711 --> 01:12:44.240
more restful than sleep.

1259
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:47.930
So even if you had like a bad night's sleep or your tossing or whatever was

1260
01:12:47.931 --> 01:12:52.670
going on, you're now ready to go through the day.

1261
01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.360
<v 4>What kind of meditation are you doing? TM.</v>

1262
01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:00.470
[inaudible] meditation, but transcendental meditation there.

1263
01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:04.210
There's a weird thing about that, right?

1264
01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:07.780
To some people think it's kind of culty. It's not cult-y. It's not called,

1265
01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:11.560
there's no, there's no leaders. Right, but is it wasn't there,

1266
01:13:12.670 --> 01:13:16.600
wasn't there some controversy with TM a while back? Think so. No.

1267
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:18.460
My misconstruing it was something else.

1268
01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:22.390
<v 3>Yeah, no. T that's why I like, I don't, I'm, I'm very into it.</v>

1269
01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:26.530
I'm doing it for a long time. It's great. I, but I,

1270
01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.920
I like yoga. I like all that kind of stuff. [inaudible] less.

1271
01:13:29.921 --> 01:13:34.600
You get a little hippy dippy with it and a little too preachy and then I'm out.

1272
01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:39.490
Yeah, me too. And this is totally basic, simple.

1273
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:43.270
When I was taught it, there was nothing, you know, like hippy dippy flake.

1274
01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:47.130
<v 4>No. It's meant that hippy dippy flaky shit. It's only,</v>

1275
01:13:47.131 --> 01:13:51.150
it only feels shitty if the person's not really live in that life.

1276
01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.780
And you can kind of feel it to kind of bullshit.

1277
01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.080
There's this guys to take classes from seeing it was Peters from South Africa

1278
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:59.790
and I only took his classes a few times,

1279
01:13:59.791 --> 01:14:03.300
but he was like one of those genuinely spiritual people.

1280
01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:07.560
And he would say these things and you could tell he wasn't trying to manipulate

1281
01:14:07.561 --> 01:14:12.040
you or Namaz Day you are [inaudible] or he wasn't trying to bullshit you.

1282
01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:15.250
That's, yeah, and then there was another guy that used to take classes with it.

1283
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.950
It felt like he was always bullshitting, always.

1284
01:14:17.951 --> 01:14:22.180
It was so annoying and he ended up banging in this other dude's wife and he came

1285
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:23.014
a giant disaster.

1286
01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:26.560
Was that guy with the acoustic guitar making eye contact with so funny you say

1287
01:14:26.561 --> 01:14:29.020
that he would sing sing in clashes.

1288
01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.670
<v 3>Of course. Of course. No, there's, you can,</v>

1289
01:14:31.671 --> 01:14:35.300
you can smell it and that's why I had a hard time with yoga until I found this

1290
01:14:35.301 --> 01:14:38.530
one teacher and she was just great. And it's the same thing with it.

1291
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:42.620
<v 4>Controversy. Here it is called controversy or something. Yeah.</v>

1292
01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:47.200
While ago with them. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. With 10 can we make that a little larger?

1293
01:14:47.201 --> 01:14:49.390
I can barely read that shit. Yeah. That's really small.

1294
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.990
What side of the organization organizations had been the subject of controversy

1295
01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:57.970
is labeled a cult by several parliamentary inquiries or anti cult movements of

1296
01:14:57.971 --> 01:15:01.000
the world. Some also suggest that TM,

1297
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:05.470
its movement or not a cult and TM movement has been characterized in a variety

1298
01:15:05.471 --> 01:15:08.740
of ways, has been called the spiritual movement. A new religious movement,

1299
01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:13.990
a Millennia Arion, nobody Arion. Hmm.

1300
01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:18.400
Okay. World affirming world affirming movement, social movement,

1301
01:15:18.401 --> 01:15:19.690
a guru centered movement.

1302
01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:23.530
How a new book exposes the dark side of transgender education.

1303
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:27.430
<v 3>I don't even understand where you would have like where it would happen.</v>

1304
01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.810
Like there's no place to go, honestly ignorant of it. So explain it to us. Yeah,

1305
01:15:31.811 --> 01:15:34.120
there's nothing, it's very, you know,

1306
01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:36.430
I tried meditating and all these different ways and this was,

1307
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:41.310
this kind of made it very simple. It's doesn't just Seinfeld do this too. Yes.

1308
01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:45.280
Yeah. He's actually the one that that got me into it and for a long time I was

1309
01:15:45.281 --> 01:15:47.380
thinking, well I meditate, I count breaths,

1310
01:15:47.381 --> 01:15:51.630
I'd kind of do it then I wasn't really feeling, maybe I was, I was,

1311
01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.800
I always had in my head that maybe TM is different.

1312
01:15:53.801 --> 01:15:58.801
Maybe maybe going and learning that would kind of dial it in to a little bit on

1313
01:15:58.970 --> 01:16:02.930
it. So I took four classes. You went and saw this guy, um,

1314
01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:08.400
here in California and just go for an hour for four days in a row and he teaches

1315
01:16:09.821 --> 01:16:14.560
you what to do it. And the analogy is that, uh, there's this,

1316
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:19.300
the reality is just in this tumultuous ocean,

1317
01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:23.020
waves were on the top or on the surface. That's where we live.

1318
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:28.350
And this is just a way through a mantra to get you down below the waves to sit

1319
01:16:28.661 --> 01:16:33.370
for 20 minutes. And it's very freeing because there's no,

1320
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.230
there's no controlling your mind.

1321
01:16:35.231 --> 01:16:39.580
There's no forcing it to come back and count breaths is no, you're never,

1322
01:16:39.581 --> 01:16:43.480
you're not, you're not thinking about what you have to do.

1323
01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:46.480
You just do the mantra, do the mantra and then let it go.

1324
01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.650
And if your brain starts thinking about work and thinks about work,

1325
01:16:49.670 --> 01:16:54.490
if it starts thinking about your wife, it's like we just let it be. Let it be,

1326
01:16:54.491 --> 01:16:55.324
let it be.

1327
01:16:55.570 --> 01:17:00.570
And 20 minutes you pop out of it and you feel not right away.

1328
01:17:02.561 --> 01:17:06.790
I don't feel changed immediately. Like, I'll feel, I, you know,

1329
01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:09.890
I have an apple watch and my heart rate is low.

1330
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:14.450
<v 0>Like it's 40 to 50 all the time or when you do that, when I'm doing that,</v>

1331
01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:18.150
how much does it normally? Probably like 80 right now.

1332
01:17:20.490 --> 01:17:23.060
[inaudible] how long does it take to find that out? It's going to take awhile.

1333
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:28.390
Hey Siri, it's at 80 80 yeah. And you get down to 40 when you get him? Yeah.

1334
01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:29.420
Oh yeah.

1335
01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:34.420
It's very calming and it just Kinda like gives your nervous system a respite

1336
01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:37.070
that's pretty heavy. It's pretty great.

1337
01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:41.030
It gives me a lot of energy activate Siri by saying,

1338
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.450
Hey Siri something. So yeah, my series,

1339
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:46.460
I didn't catch this area is a pain.

1340
01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.840
No people right now screaming at me because their car is going.

1341
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:53.600
What would you like me to do? Yeah, but I don't feel it like right away but,

1342
01:17:53.690 --> 01:17:58.460
but like I'll notice it hours later that I have more energy.

1343
01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:02.330
Like I'm still going. What is the process? How do you do it? I just sit.

1344
01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:06.320
And what's the mantra? Everyone has an individual mantra tells you much.

1345
01:18:06.321 --> 01:18:10.400
I can't come on, bro. What if someone's a gigantic Tom Papa Fan,

1346
01:18:10.401 --> 01:18:13.370
they want you to want to do everything that you do. Oh, that's true.

1347
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:16.040
It's jelly beans. That's what you say. No,

1348
01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:20.060
it's just the noise.

1349
01:18:20.061 --> 01:18:24.630
Pretty much be weird if you just kept saying Jerry Seinfeld, Jerry Terry's

1350
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.100
sour, sour,

1351
01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:36.050
sour dough would be cool. Is Howard's a delicious food,

1352
01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:41.630
but it wouldn't be nearly as weird. Something about Brad Garrett.

1353
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:42.613
Yeah,

1354
01:18:46.010 --> 01:18:49.040
Brad Garrett. Yeah, it would be weird. Right?

1355
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:53.450
So I'm told, so I do it first thing in the morning,

1356
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:57.260
20 minutes and then sometime in the late afternoon. So can you explain?

1357
01:18:57.290 --> 01:19:02.060
All you do is you sit and you just chant your mantra in my mind and you don't

1358
01:19:02.061 --> 01:19:03.470
say it out loud. Don't say now. Okay.

1359
01:19:03.471 --> 01:19:07.250
So as you're just repeating the mantra in your mind,

1360
01:19:07.251 --> 01:19:09.470
you just try to stay on path of just keeping.

1361
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:12.890
I just keep saying it and when I don't try and stay on a path,

1362
01:19:12.891 --> 01:19:14.990
I don't force anything. I just keep saying it.

1363
01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.420
But if your brain tells you to trick you, Hey Tom,

1364
01:19:17.421 --> 01:19:20.870
I just got a great idea for a new bit. Do let it happen. Let it go.

1365
01:19:21.190 --> 01:19:25.760
It's okay to write the bit down or do you no. Whoa.

1366
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:28.570
You're risking at all. I'm not that great of a comedian. So those,

1367
01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:33.340
those don't happen. [inaudible]

1368
01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:37.270
fucking been laying in bed and I was too tired to get up and I'd wait.

1369
01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:41.630
I'd say I'm going to out remember that. Yeah. I definitely didn't. No.

1370
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:44.510
And uh, and yeah,

1371
01:19:44.511 --> 01:19:48.230
20 minutes and I'm telling you it, it,

1372
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:53.660
my one friend described it as it's adds another four hours to your day. Wow.

1373
01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:57.420
And it's really true when I, when you call me today,

1374
01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:01.790
last minute to come in, I took 20 before I came cause I was dragging.

1375
01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.590
I went for a run this morning.

1376
01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:07.680
I meditated this morning but then I went for a run. I came back, I was writing

1377
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:12.060
<v 3>and you call and you're like, can you come on over? I was like, yeah,</v>

1378
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:17.061
that's cool but let me drop for 15 minutes before I get in the car.

1379
01:20:17.210 --> 01:20:20.670
And he did, he meditated for 15 minutes. Yep. Wow. Do you do that before sets?

1380
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:22.410
If I'm tired, yeah.

1381
01:20:22.530 --> 01:20:25.530
If like it's towards the end of the day and I've got something that you know at

1382
01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:30.240
night that's a little later. Does it help you make decisions? Yes.

1383
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:33.990
How did you still make the decision to do a radio show at seven in the morning?

1384
01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:39.710
Because I'm not afraid of it because I know that I can meditate and I'll have

1385
01:20:40.351 --> 01:20:41.400
energy. How many days a week?

1386
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.720
I don't have to worry about getting a good nights sleep ever. No, that's crazy.

1387
01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.110
I can meditate and then I'll be okay for the show. That's crazy.

1388
01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:53.700
I can't do that. Yes you can. You should go. You should go.

1389
01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:56.460
Okay. Really? Yeah, I'd love to. I'll hook you up with the guy.

1390
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:59.160
I just watched a youtube video. Is that good enough? Now?

1391
01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:02.730
I've learned so much from youtube though. Have you? Yes, it's true.

1392
01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:08.010
Why can't you learn transcendental meditation from Youtube? You know what?

1393
01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.670
There is this mystery about it and I would research it and I was like,

1394
01:21:11.671 --> 01:21:15.490
maybe what? Like why can I just learn it? Mystery. The only differences,

1395
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:19.920
having this man explain it to you, it kind of dials it in.

1396
01:21:19.921 --> 01:21:24.360
And I went back once since I learned initially just to kind of tune up,

1397
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:27.600
tune up. There's not that much, but it's just, you know,

1398
01:21:27.601 --> 01:21:28.950
they give you a little bit, you know,

1399
01:21:28.951 --> 01:21:30.570
it's like playing tennis or something and they're like, no,

1400
01:21:30.571 --> 01:21:33.980
just hold it like this. Oh, right. Okay. Or like in Yoga they like,

1401
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:38.310
you think you're doing this but your elbows are out. Just kind of bring them in.

1402
01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.960
<v 4>That's big in Yoga. Like sometimes the instructor will give you one thing,</v>

1403
01:21:41.961 --> 01:21:43.370
she'll say one thing about your,

1404
01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:46.100
with the way you're standing or the way you keep your weight and you're like,

1405
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:50.510
oh man. And then you just change it just slightly. Yeah. I like, oh my God,

1406
01:21:50.511 --> 01:21:51.380
it's so much harder.

1407
01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:54.130
<v 3>I know, which you never would have learned at home.</v>

1408
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:58.990
So it's kind of a similar thing and uh, it just, uh,

1409
01:21:59.830 --> 01:22:04.510
an over time. So that's what it is on a daily basis. But over time it,

1410
01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:08.140
uh, it makes you more chill.

1411
01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:12.790
Things don't bother me the way they used to bother me.

1412
01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:17.290
Just day to day aggravations were stuff with normal bullshit.

1413
01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.940
There's, it's, I, there's, it's, um, you're,

1414
01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:25.780
you slowly transform without realizing it. Do you know who Dan Harris is?

1415
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:30.220
Sam Harris. Dan Harris. Dan Harris from a, no,

1416
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:32.710
from, what is the show Nightline?

1417
01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.393
Is that what he's on?

1418
01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:39.880
<v 4>Anyway, he'd been on the podcast for a really nice guy. He's got a Nightline.</v>

1419
01:22:40.210 --> 01:22:45.210
He's got an app called 10% happier and it's just a meditation app and he wants

1420
01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:50.320
people to know that it's been super beneficial to him.

1421
01:22:50.321 --> 01:22:51.370
So he talks about it often.

1422
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:54.850
He talked about on my podcast and he actually used the tank. He's the only guy.

1423
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:56.980
Yeah, he's the only guy other than me that's overused that tank.

1424
01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:58.780
I want to use the tank. Okay.

1425
01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:01.270
This was a weird thing for it to fucking everybody.

1426
01:23:01.271 --> 01:23:03.700
But Dan Harris is the only one who said, I'm in. Let's do it.

1427
01:23:03.730 --> 01:23:08.650
When you called me today, I was online, uh, looking at tanks.

1428
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:14.140
Do you have room in your house for one? No. That thing's big. It's big.

1429
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:18.370
It's big. It's hotter than I thought. Oh, you don't wanna be cold in there? No,

1430
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:22.060
that's true. It's 94 degrees. 94. Yeah, that's what you want.

1431
01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:25.690
That's about the s about the temperature of the surface of your skin.

1432
01:23:25.691 --> 01:23:28.720
Somewhere in that range. How did he like it? How long do I stay in there?

1433
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:31.150
As long an hour. You can stay as long as you want the most.

1434
01:23:31.151 --> 01:23:35.290
I ever do those two hours I've done more on edibles. Oh really?

1435
01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:40.190
Couldn't move. I just had to stay put for real. Yes.

1436
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:45.160
I've gone on to eight edibles and went in there oh many times. Really? Oh,

1437
01:23:45.161 --> 01:23:49.090
for sure. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds kind of crazy. It's crazy.

1438
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:54.100
Edibles have a unique visual quality when you're in the sensory deprivation tank

1439
01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:57.730
because the tank enhances any sort of, um,

1440
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.010
any sort of sensory experience.

1441
01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:04.090
Any psychedelic experience is enhanced by the tank because the tank removes the

1442
01:24:04.091 --> 01:24:06.150
environment. It removes the world. Right.

1443
01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:09.460
And it puts you in this place where you don't see anything or hear anything or

1444
01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:12.760
feel anything. You're just flying through space with the ear things in. I don't.

1445
01:24:13.210 --> 01:24:16.690
I just let salt water get in my ears. That's what I saw online. They put little,

1446
01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.560
I just rinse my ears out after it's over and it seems to be fine and just float.

1447
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:22.870
You don't have to keep your head up. I like my ears in the water.

1448
01:24:22.871 --> 01:24:25.570
It doesn't bother me. My, I put my ears in the water when I swim too.

1449
01:24:25.571 --> 01:24:29.560
I was like, yeah, I mean not you're wearing earplugs. When I swim in the ocean,

1450
01:24:29.561 --> 01:24:31.900
why am I wearing earplugs when I lay in this tank?

1451
01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:36.520
I thought it was in a audio thing that you're trying to shut out noise and you

1452
01:24:36.521 --> 01:24:37.031
can't do it.

1453
01:24:37.031 --> 01:24:40.900
But I'm always aware of the plugs that kind of fuck with the balance of your

1454
01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:42.670
head. Yeah, I get that.

1455
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:48.310
But if you had something over the ear, well anyway, you get in, you can do it.

1456
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:51.600
But some people like it that way. Some people use the white don't to, no,

1457
01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.490
you don't have to. And some people actually get them form fitted to their ear,

1458
01:24:54.491 --> 01:24:57.490
so they slide in really easily. So you barely even notice that they're there.

1459
01:24:58.300 --> 01:25:03.040
And my understanding is that you lay like you're floating,

1460
01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.680
but you don't have to support yourself. You don't have to do shit. Your neck,

1461
01:25:05.681 --> 01:25:08.320
your head, anything, nothing. Just yeah, you have to do it.

1462
01:25:08.321 --> 01:25:11.440
I can't believe you'd never done it before. Yeah, no, I'm really super easy.

1463
01:25:11.441 --> 01:25:13.930
It's right here. And you tell me when. All right, we'll open it up.

1464
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.680
That'd be great. So there's a shower in that room, so it's really easy.

1465
01:25:17.681 --> 01:25:22.060
You just have to lay there and just slow down and just concentrate on your

1466
01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:25.690
breathing. And if you already have your a TM routine,

1467
01:25:26.710 --> 01:25:30.250
I'm sure you could do it in there. Just do it in there. I'd probably be amazing.

1468
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:34.990
You'd want to buy a house with an extra garage bay.

1469
01:25:34.991 --> 01:25:38.050
So you say hey yo, guy had one. Like he actually,

1470
01:25:38.051 --> 01:25:39.940
I knew a guy who had one in a sh.

1471
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:41.920
I didn't know him but I knew the guy who installed it.

1472
01:25:42.190 --> 01:25:46.780
The guy installed a shed in his backyard just so we out of the tank. Really?

1473
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:48.360
Yeah. So we bought like a, you know,

1474
01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.820
like a tool shed that you could buy and build. So he built this shed,

1475
01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:55.390
had electricity plumbed out to it, got like, you know,

1476
01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:59.860
must've got some sort of a building permit and then a plug this fucking tank

1477
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:03.070
into the shed. And uh, that's where, you know,

1478
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:05.630
cause he wanted one so bad and his house and he didn't have any room in his

1479
01:26:05.631 --> 01:26:09.470
actual house. How often do you do it and what does it give you? Well,

1480
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:12.860
I do it whatever I can. It's what I like is once a week.

1481
01:26:12.861 --> 01:26:15.320
If I get once a weekend, that'll be awesome. Wow. That's a lot.

1482
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:19.470
Lately I haven't been lately. It's been more like once a month. Right. But, um,

1483
01:26:19.550 --> 01:26:24.470
when I do get in it, I just, uh, I just can have a better perspective.

1484
01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.060
It makes me, it calms me down.

1485
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:31.490
It puts me into this place where things, I'm not connected to the world anymore.

1486
01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:34.550
So I feel like I can look at the world from an outside perspective.

1487
01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:38.420
And you can do carry that with you when you leave. You mean you carry something?

1488
01:26:38.421 --> 01:26:40.250
I mean, I think all these things are cumulative.

1489
01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:45.410
You know all the books you read, the documentaries, you watch,

1490
01:26:45.411 --> 01:26:47.780
all the conversations you have with insightful people.

1491
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:52.010
All those things have in an accumulation effect. Right? Like you,

1492
01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.750
as you become exposed to more things and talk to more cool people and listen to

1493
01:26:56.751 --> 01:27:00.850
more cool ideas and have these cool conversations with people, your,

1494
01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:05.600
your perspective enhances. Yeah. It just does now. It does. It seeps in. Yeah.

1495
01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:07.100
Yeah. No, I totally buy it.

1496
01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:09.860
I think we should think of your perception the same way you think.

1497
01:27:09.861 --> 01:27:13.940
We think about other skills that like some people are really good at running

1498
01:27:13.941 --> 01:27:16.360
with a football, right? Super hard to take them down. They just,

1499
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:20.740
they're so good at anticipating your moves and getting out of the way and they

1500
01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:22.850
have, they have everything down, right? Yeah.

1501
01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.330
I think that's the same way with everything.

1502
01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:30.620
Everything including your own perceptions of life and your own,

1503
01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:33.830
the way you view and the way you manage your own life.

1504
01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:37.190
I think you can get really good at it where things come in your way.

1505
01:27:37.191 --> 01:27:39.800
You just whoop out, not today, motherfucker. Oh Shit,

1506
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:44.360
not me and ain't getting me. And then, or you could be that person who's like,

1507
01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:49.310
uh, you know, super uncoordinated, unathletic kid. All rejection. Yeah.

1508
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:52.460
Who is trying to tackle super athlete. Right.

1509
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:59.410
You know right now 100% but I think we talked about it that way because the one

1510
01:27:59.961 --> 01:28:03.860
way is thoughtful. The other way is thoughtless. Yes. That's the,

1511
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:07.250
I think that seems to be like kind of the key physical,

1512
01:28:07.251 --> 01:28:10.070
just paying attention to that aspect of your life.

1513
01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.720
That definitely has an effect on it.

1514
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:15.380
But what I'm saying is also that that is definitely true.

1515
01:28:15.381 --> 01:28:19.700
But what I'm saying is also that I think the way you interface with life is a

1516
01:28:19.701 --> 01:28:22.610
skill and I think we don't think of it as a skill.

1517
01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:26.160
I think we don't think of it as something you get better at or that we even try

1518
01:28:26.161 --> 01:28:30.170
to get better at. And this includes the way you communicate with people.

1519
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:35.660
This includes like the friendships that you have and the making sure your

1520
01:28:35.661 --> 01:28:36.680
friends know that you love them,

1521
01:28:37.010 --> 01:28:39.650
making sure your friends know you care about them. Like all these things are,

1522
01:28:39.950 --> 01:28:43.400
this is a part of the way you live life, like and you,

1523
01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:46.010
you get better at this as a skill.

1524
01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:49.280
We only think of skills as things that we decide to do.

1525
01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:51.890
Like I want to play piano. Oh my God, you have a skill at playing piano.

1526
01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:54.410
I'm a really good golfer. Oh you have a golfing skill,

1527
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:58.340
but you don't think of like the way you interface with people and the way you

1528
01:28:58.341 --> 01:29:02.430
don't think of that as a skill. No, I know we should. Yes, absolutely.

1529
01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:06.570
<v 0>That's what I always think of that in terms of like the interpersonal stuff,</v>

1530
01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:08.520
just in basic manners.

1531
01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:13.230
Like there used to be real guidelines for how you said hello to somebody and

1532
01:29:13.231 --> 01:29:17.190
when you took your hat off and how you said goodbye and all those little,

1533
01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:21.450
all those what were perceived as stuffy, mannerly,

1534
01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:25.290
things that people had to do stuck up, people had to do.

1535
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:28.980
They're helpful. They're really like how to act at a funeral,

1536
01:29:28.981 --> 01:29:33.690
how to act at a birthday party. All those little rules. Etiquette. Exactly.

1537
01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:38.190
And it used to teach core courses in etiquette. Yes. And without it.

1538
01:29:38.191 --> 01:29:42.030
It's kind of like, it's stupid not to play with it because we all,

1539
01:29:42.031 --> 01:29:45.540
we need a bit of all this stuff we're talking about is creating your own little

1540
01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:46.890
guidebook to get through life.

1541
01:29:47.190 --> 01:29:50.610
Do you think they still teach etiquette in any high schools?

1542
01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:54.330
Is that a set on a focus of study? We have no,

1543
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:57.540
we have such little money for schools. They're getting rid of art.

1544
01:29:57.541 --> 01:29:59.010
They're getting rid of Jim. There's probably,

1545
01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:00.510
this is probably not a lot of etiquette.

1546
01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:05.040
That seems like a critical life skill though. It is really.

1547
01:30:05.050 --> 01:30:09.990
It really is because how you, the one of the things that's true is how people,

1548
01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.940
how much people enjoy being around you.

1549
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:16.470
That makes your life more enjoyable and people don't think of it that way.

1550
01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:21.390
They oftentimes think, I want to be the one that's joining life.

1551
01:30:21.570 --> 01:30:25.690
Like especially selfish people, right? Think of what they want. Right?

1552
01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:30.180
But if people enjoy being around you, right,

1553
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:33.850
you'll enjoy everything more. This is what they don't understand. Like the,

1554
01:30:33.851 --> 01:30:35.760
the solo effort that's right.

1555
01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:39.630
Of going through life like with a narcissistic perspective.

1556
01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:43.560
What are the major problems with that is there's no one to share it with cause

1557
01:30:43.561 --> 01:30:46.410
you're all out for yourself. That's right. Even if you get there,

1558
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:50.490
you're going to be filled with sadness and despair. That's right.

1559
01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:53.550
It's not what you want, what you want it to be happy. Right. Well,

1560
01:30:53.551 --> 01:30:57.180
I know you think that you have to be all about yourself to be happy,

1561
01:30:57.181 --> 01:31:02.040
but in fact that is a way to insure unhappiness regardless of success.

1562
01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:05.340
That's the mind fuck. Yeah, exactly. That's the mind fight. Well,

1563
01:31:05.341 --> 01:31:09.630
you think that these small things wouldn't have a big effect on you, right?

1564
01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.670
You think that, well, like uh,

1565
01:31:12.090 --> 01:31:15.090
having a sense of community going to the same shops all the time,

1566
01:31:15.091 --> 01:31:17.190
you would think that's just me doing Aaron's. No,

1567
01:31:17.610 --> 01:31:20.400
you're now connected to the woman that works at that pharmacy.

1568
01:31:20.401 --> 01:31:23.250
You're connected to that bagger at the grocery store.

1569
01:31:23.251 --> 01:31:25.620
You're connected to that person at the church,

1570
01:31:25.621 --> 01:31:27.480
whatever it is in your little world,

1571
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:30.240
and you think you're just going about your day, but you're not.

1572
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:32.130
You're getting enriched by these,

1573
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:37.530
by these interactions with people dealing with the other human beings. In a,

1574
01:31:37.531 --> 01:31:42.531
in a nice manner is rewarding and it gives you a sense of place.

1575
01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:46.860
It gives you a sense of belonging is a sense of love, all of those things,

1576
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:49.620
but you have to learn that yourself. That's the province trip.

1577
01:31:49.621 --> 01:31:52.710
But that's yet nobody guides you along the path.

1578
01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:56.430
It's an important perspective. I mean it really is. Yeah.

1579
01:31:56.520 --> 01:32:00.160
It's an important angle on

1580
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:00.580
<v 4>life.</v>

1581
01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:05.350
They look at it this way and you'll benefit greatly and you also bring up those

1582
01:32:05.351 --> 01:32:08.650
around you. Right. That's an also bring up those around you,

1583
01:32:08.651 --> 01:32:11.200
benefits you greatly. That benefits everybody. Yeah,

1584
01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:16.360
and when you're in a position where you can help your friends in that way and

1585
01:32:16.361 --> 01:32:18.250
you support each other and you build each other up,

1586
01:32:18.251 --> 01:32:21.370
when that person has success, you get great joy.

1587
01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:25.340
Like great satisfaction from seeing your friends succeed. Right, exactly.

1588
01:32:25.341 --> 01:32:27.430
I have a hard time, especially, I mean,

1589
01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.950
I don't know how it was when you were starting out, comedian,

1590
01:32:29.951 --> 01:32:33.400
but I had a hard time with other people's success when I first started out and I

1591
01:32:33.401 --> 01:32:37.330
think we all did because nothing was happening for me. I was like, God damn it.

1592
01:32:37.331 --> 01:32:39.950
How did he get that show? Oh my God, how did he get this right?

1593
01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:44.260
It's a dumb way to look at it. And I had to recognize that it was dumb.

1594
01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:47.410
I had to learn me too, just by paying attention to myself going,

1595
01:32:47.411 --> 01:32:48.640
why don't what is wrong with you?

1596
01:32:48.641 --> 01:32:52.770
Like I w I will occasionally talk to myself as if I'm me outside of me going,

1597
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:54.370
what the fuck is this? He's like,

1598
01:32:54.371 --> 01:32:58.720
sometimes it's the only way to really look at yourself, right? It's hard to do,

1599
01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:02.260
but if you just, how would I feel if I wasn't me?

1600
01:33:02.261 --> 01:33:05.380
If I was outside of me watching me, I'd be like, what do you,

1601
01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:08.140
what are you bitching about that guy? Get a thing that fucking idiot.

1602
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:10.930
You're not even working on yourself. You sitting here complaining about stuff.

1603
01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:12.940
But that's default for so many people.

1604
01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:15.300
<v 3>Well, that's envy, right? Right.</v>

1605
01:33:15.301 --> 01:33:18.870
And it's very easy to have when you're discovering yourself and trying to make

1606
01:33:18.871 --> 01:33:22.260
your way and as, as a comedian and you're like, well,

1607
01:33:22.261 --> 01:33:24.330
I'm doing all the right things. People laugh at me.

1608
01:33:24.630 --> 01:33:28.080
Why did that guy just show up? And he's on MTV and I'm not sure

1609
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:32.890
<v 4>or I mean, and that also exists in in haters, right? Like when you see someone,</v>

1610
01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:35.090
especially when it comes to sports teams,

1611
01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.780
you see some of the guys that are like sports haters or they'll call this guy a

1612
01:33:38.781 --> 01:33:42.450
pussy and this guy fucking sucks and he's a bum and he's a this. And he's like,

1613
01:33:42.610 --> 01:33:45.730
yeah, how much effort are you putting into your own life? Right?

1614
01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:48.140
How much are you putting into shitting on this guy?

1615
01:33:50.010 --> 01:33:54.170
<v 3>Well, it's easier to do that. So much easier. Instantaneous. Yeah,</v>

1616
01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:58.800
it's right there. Instant gratitude or gratification rather. I remember I had,

1617
01:33:58.830 --> 01:34:01.140
I had the same thing that you did. I was in New York,

1618
01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:04.560
I was working at the comedy cellar and I was just getting angry and frustrated.

1619
01:34:04.561 --> 01:34:06.990
I couldn't get on Conan. I wanted to get on Conan.

1620
01:34:06.991 --> 01:34:08.190
I just wanted to get on Conan.

1621
01:34:08.730 --> 01:34:11.880
And it wasn't until I stopped paying attention to what everyone else was doing,

1622
01:34:11.881 --> 01:34:16.320
consciously like told myself, don't even go in the room, don't even,

1623
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:20.010
don't read about other people. Just blinders put blinders on.

1624
01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:21.750
This is just you and your little path,

1625
01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:25.770
enjoy yourself and go about it and try and really shut it out.

1626
01:34:26.370 --> 01:34:29.670
And that's when everything got correct and when it got correct,

1627
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:30.810
that's when I got Conan.

1628
01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.660
That's when all these things started happening because I was only worried about

1629
01:34:33.661 --> 01:34:37.710
myself and then later on now you have perspective.

1630
01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:41.700
You can watch other people and actually have joy that these people are doing

1631
01:34:41.701 --> 01:34:44.940
these things. Conan is the nerd seal of approval.

1632
01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:48.090
Your inner Canadian yet? I mean not in a good way.

1633
01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.200
Like if you're a smart comedian and you get Conan, that's like damn,

1634
01:34:52.201 --> 01:34:55.380
you nailed it. You got the smart show. That's the smart show. Yeah,

1635
01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.750
it was always, I did it. Yeah, isn't a, the first one was in New York.

1636
01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:00.520
<v 4>Yeah. When he was in New York.</v>

1637
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:04.060
My one of my friends was writing for him and the early, early, early, early,

1638
01:35:04.090 --> 01:35:04.610
early.

1639
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:08.930
<v 3>Yeah. Well he was so creative. Like he had such a, he's a writer. Yeah.</v>

1640
01:35:08.931 --> 01:35:13.220
He was a real funny writer and then everything came from that.

1641
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:15.500
So you want it to be a part,

1642
01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:19.550
like if you couldn't be hacky and get on the show.

1643
01:35:19.551 --> 01:35:23.210
So like you had to be working, you had to be try and be unique.

1644
01:35:23.211 --> 01:35:27.530
Like it was a seal of approval that you were comedically unique and that was

1645
01:35:27.531 --> 01:35:28.364
important.

1646
01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.780
<v 4>I knew a couple guys who worked for him. Um, Brian Kiley,</v>

1647
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:35.210
I think he's still there. Yeah, he's still there. Yeah. Yeah.

1648
01:35:35.211 --> 01:35:39.770
Brian and Laurie Martin. Oh, I don't know Laurie, but uh, I knew another guy,

1649
01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:42.790
uh, Amir, Amir Golan. He uh,

1650
01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.310
his stage name was stage name was James Lemur. Funny Dude.

1651
01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.750
But he worked for him.

1652
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:50.510
And when he and I were friends and I went to one of the early tapings,

1653
01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:55.340
it was weird to see because they had scripted conversations and eventually that

1654
01:35:55.341 --> 01:35:58.790
he went on to become so comfortable on stage where he just would ask questions

1655
01:35:58.791 --> 01:36:00.230
and then play off and riff. And,

1656
01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:04.490
but in the early days they have their conversation scripted. What do you mean?

1657
01:36:04.491 --> 01:36:08.510
The conference? So like him and the guests and, no, and what's his face?

1658
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.230
The guy is sidekick. Andy Richter. Him and Andy Richter would have,

1659
01:36:12.850 --> 01:36:15.290
there'd be reading off Cue cards. Oh really? Yeah. So they have to,

1660
01:36:15.710 --> 01:36:20.600
they would know what they were going to say. Basically doing like a sketch.

1661
01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:22.250
That's a writer, right? Yeah.

1662
01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:25.550
It's like they had written out the jokes but it was like,

1663
01:36:25.551 --> 01:36:28.520
of course the network wanted that because they wanted to make sure it was funny.

1664
01:36:28.521 --> 01:36:31.570
How do you know it's not fun? Write it funny. Right.

1665
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:34.070
Don't take a chance that you guys are going to be funny.

1666
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:38.140
<v 3>It's just so funny because they seem like such naturally funny like,</v>

1667
01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:42.550
but it's hard when you have all these people on your back to free yourself up to

1668
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.950
let

1669
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:43.730
<v 4>to fail.</v>

1670
01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:48.730
Well the early days of any kind of a new talk show are so risky.

1671
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:54.120
It's like who the fuck knows where this is going to go? Hey Yeah Sydney.

1672
01:36:54.121 --> 01:36:59.121
Oh he was one of the only guys that like figured out a way to to break into that

1673
01:37:01.221 --> 01:37:04.280
system. Right. Like George Lopez did for a little while.

1674
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:08.840
But that late night system, it's the, it's all fucking hard thing to do.

1675
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:11.300
It's a grind. It's a grind.

1676
01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:16.660
Cause everybody does a version of the same show that Jack Paar did in like 19

1677
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.600
zero and yet and yet like trying to do something completely different fails a

1678
01:37:23.241 --> 01:37:25.550
lot of the time. Yeah. But they all have a desk.

1679
01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:28.280
You sit at the desk to get desk sits next to them at the desk,

1680
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:29.323
which is a fucking

1681
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:34.820
<v 3>wholly weird way. You have a conversation. He came over a guy's house. Yeah.</v>

1682
01:37:34.821 --> 01:37:39.260
And he's above you in a desk. It's an elevated desk. If they're elevated,

1683
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:43.190
I know. Elevated. But you know what's weird is like when James Cordon does it,

1684
01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:46.580
like they're all on chairs and there's no desk and it's just like leaning into

1685
01:37:46.581 --> 01:37:49.970
each other. That's weird. Or weird or, yeah, I don't wanna see your legs.

1686
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.140
I watched it once and it was like three people on the couch together. I'm like,

1687
01:37:54.141 --> 01:37:56.160
what the fuck happening? What's going

1688
01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:00.120
<v 1>on? Strange. She, yeah, it's, it's weird. Well,</v>

1689
01:38:00.121 --> 01:38:03.600
I'm so spoiled by podcasts.

1690
01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:06.300
I'm so spoiled by no time constraints.

1691
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:11.070
I'm so spoiled by all of it. But you know it's a,

1692
01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:16.470
it's kind of, yeah, you spoiled is when Bernie was on last week,

1693
01:38:16.471 --> 01:38:17.760
I listened to your Bernie episode.

1694
01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:21.570
It was so good because I never got to hear him.

1695
01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:25.850
Just brief. Yes to just hear him talk. Yes,

1696
01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:27.090
he's super reasonable.

1697
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:32.010
Anybody just to hear them just go for a length of time.

1698
01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.030
You really get to know who they are when you're trying.

1699
01:38:36.031 --> 01:38:39.510
Even in these late night shows, it's just boom, boom, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop,

1700
01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.280
soundbite, soundbite, soundbite.

1701
01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:44.880
You don't really get a sense of who these people are. It's impossible.

1702
01:38:44.910 --> 01:38:47.520
I'm sure some people listening right now wish this was Tom.

1703
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.510
It's a soundbite but no, but it's like if you were on a show right now,

1704
01:38:51.570 --> 01:38:53.940
like one of those panel shows with his five people on,

1705
01:38:53.941 --> 01:38:56.510
they come to you real quick and you have like 15 seconds of talking.

1706
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:59.700
You're worried that someone else is going to jump in and try to stomp on your

1707
01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:01.680
punch line, which does happen.

1708
01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:04.710
Have you tried to do a show and it was like just us and our friends, right?

1709
01:39:04.711 --> 01:39:05.120
It's like,

1710
01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:08.340
it's like crystal Lee who was in the air and Brian Cowen was in here and we were

1711
01:39:08.341 --> 01:39:12.530
all talking like, man, you, you, you better get something out quick. Right?

1712
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:15.870
How many other people in the room? Yeah. This is what those debates are like.

1713
01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:20.640
It's like a condensed version of a conversation and you also have an actual

1714
01:39:20.641 --> 01:39:24.260
physical time limit. Like you have x amount of seconds to respond and that,

1715
01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:28.740
and then they start talking over you and I know time is up, Susie, MR, senator,

1716
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.830
Mr Senator, your times up, it's your center. It's not like, okay,

1717
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:35.040
I know it's the sentence you fuck. It's no way.

1718
01:39:35.130 --> 01:39:39.480
It's no way to really understand people and you have to be a forceful moderator,

1719
01:39:39.630 --> 01:39:41.250
but then when you are a forceful moderator,

1720
01:39:41.251 --> 01:39:43.970
you're like injecting yourself into this conversation. Yeah.

1721
01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:46.440
America doesn't want, that's a good way for people to hate.

1722
01:39:46.441 --> 01:39:50.940
You want people to hate you. Yeah. It'd be a g, a shitty moderator.

1723
01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:52.920
Your laundry, you're on a presidential debate.

1724
01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.140
Everybody's going to fucking hate you. Everyone's going to hate your guts.

1725
01:39:56.700 --> 01:40:01.700
It's one of those weird ancient holdovers from the past that is wholly and

1726
01:40:03.061 --> 01:40:07.890
completely unnecessary and in fact probably kind of fucking dangerous because

1727
01:40:08.130 --> 01:40:08.550
you're, you're,

1728
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:11.880
you don't ever get a chance to see what a person's actually like.

1729
01:40:11.881 --> 01:40:13.620
You just get a set chance to see their show.

1730
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:17.790
Will you also Donald Trump show like Donald Trump and his show? I'd lock you up.

1731
01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:20.520
You'd be in jail like that kind of shit. Right, and everybody cheers.

1732
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:23.540
Roids that's a show. It's who's best at television. Right, right, right.

1733
01:40:23.670 --> 01:40:26.880
And he's a fucking television guy. He's a television star.

1734
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:28.800
Then those clowns star. Yes.

1735
01:40:28.890 --> 01:40:32.820
It was like watching Jane salting when he came through and was debating against

1736
01:40:32.821 --> 01:40:37.410
the Republicans in the, in that run up to in, in all those debates,

1737
01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:42.210
he got up there like a comedian. He was like, I'm going to talk about,

1738
01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:44.880
I'm in the moment. I'm going to call everything out.

1739
01:40:44.881 --> 01:40:48.120
I'm not going to play this bs of all your little etiquette that you've got going

1740
01:40:48.121 --> 01:40:52.140
on. And he, he was a star. He was a star. He knows how to work.

1741
01:40:52.141 --> 01:40:53.740
It still does.

1742
01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:58.260
This Biden thing that he's doing now is he's constantly making fun of Biden,

1743
01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:59.770
calling him sleepy Joe Biden,

1744
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:03.670
and he shows like some misquote that Biden said,

1745
01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:07.000
does anybody that's something about we're, we're here for the facts,

1746
01:41:07.001 --> 01:41:08.300
not the truth or something like that.

1747
01:41:08.590 --> 01:41:11.770
What is the crazy Biden quote that he had that everybody's been making fun of?

1748
01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:15.580
Well, listen, this, I say stupid shit all the time. Everybody does,

1749
01:41:15.581 --> 01:41:17.320
who talks a lot. But if they talk a lot,

1750
01:41:17.321 --> 01:41:21.580
you're gonna Jumble your words together. You're right. I do it all the time,

1751
01:41:21.581 --> 01:41:23.710
of course. But if you're running for president, man,

1752
01:41:23.711 --> 01:41:26.470
they find something like that. A jumble here, a jumble there.

1753
01:41:26.471 --> 01:41:30.050
You better be ready to defend yourself. That's right. And he does a thing. He,

1754
01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:33.340
someone has to act the way he acts. Exactly. You've got to be in the moment.

1755
01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:35.950
You gotta call things. I gotta be honest. You gotta be a comment.

1756
01:41:35.951 --> 01:41:39.880
You gotta be a comic. Yeah. Trump, when he was running,

1757
01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:44.920
he reminded me of like the comics from Long Island, big, loud insult comics.

1758
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:49.780
Biden tells I words we choose truth over facts. What, uh,

1759
01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:50.860
what does that mean?

1760
01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:55.150
That he might've wrote that truth over facts to see what he said.

1761
01:41:55.151 --> 01:41:57.140
How he said it. How did he say it?

1762
01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:00.490
Cause he might've been like we true suit truth.

1763
01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:03.490
Choose truth over facts and that's not good.

1764
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:07.150
<v 5>What were you together? And Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to get up.</v>

1765
01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:11.560
Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Even his supporters know who he is.

1766
01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:15.490
We got to let them know who we are. We choose unity over division.

1767
01:42:15.670 --> 01:42:20.110
We choose science over fiction. We choose truth over facts.

1768
01:42:20.980 --> 01:42:24.250
And so folks, if you're interested, join me.

1769
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:26.341
<v 1>Look,</v>

1770
01:42:26.341 --> 01:42:30.300
we all mess up a line here in this seems like a remote control with a shitty

1771
01:42:30.301 --> 01:42:32.910
battery where you're like,

1772
01:42:32.911 --> 01:42:35.920
it's kind of getting the volume but not quite. Yeah,

1773
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:39.120
high and changes the channels. You got to move it around Bro.

1774
01:42:39.121 --> 01:42:41.070
He's got so little juice left in a tank.

1775
01:42:41.730 --> 01:42:44.100
Donald Trump will chew him up unless he gets a good doctor.

1776
01:42:44.490 --> 01:42:46.890
You need a good doctor used to get on steroids immediately.

1777
01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.600
Don't you think Trump take something for sure. Yeah.

1778
01:42:49.650 --> 01:42:51.750
You can't be with age and not be able,

1779
01:42:51.930 --> 01:42:53.940
you got to take something and he's got billions of dollars.

1780
01:42:53.941 --> 01:42:56.640
Why wouldn't he take something? Of course he's supposedly,

1781
01:42:56.641 --> 01:43:01.440
he has been on some sort of form of amphetamine prescribed by a doctor in the

1782
01:43:01.441 --> 01:43:03.810
past. I was like this, that gives him the sniffles.

1783
01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.440
That's why snuffling all the time. But that, but he also got to have a cold,

1784
01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:10.200
I mean he's fucking eight years old and he's the president United States,

1785
01:43:10.201 --> 01:43:13.620
I'm sure. Fairly stressful job. But he um,

1786
01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:18.240
there was a journalist that was claiming that he had some sort of diet pill,

1787
01:43:18.390 --> 01:43:22.580
prescription and even brought up the pharmacy where you got it fulfilled. Right.

1788
01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:24.770
Who knows if it's true. Who knows if it's true or not. Right.

1789
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:29.400
But so many people were on Adderall today, so. So have you ever taken it? No,

1790
01:43:29.401 --> 01:43:32.740
I have not. I'm scared. Jamie came. He saw me throw it away. That gave me some,

1791
01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:34.770
allegedly I would like to try,

1792
01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:38.490
cause he's not a criminal and I don't have a prescription. I would like,

1793
01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:42.870
I imagine it's probably pretty fun to write with.

1794
01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.590
I would imagine it would, it would kill a lot of your creativity. You think so?

1795
01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:50.700
Yeah. Because I think it would be great to organize with, that's how, um, uh,

1796
01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:53.660
the late great Robert Schimmel, that's how he described it to me. He,

1797
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:57.800
I loved him. I loved him too. Um, he, uh,

1798
01:43:57.830 --> 01:44:01.510
he gave me my first Starbucks ever did. He really? Wow.

1799
01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:03.090
And you guys were on the road together or something? Yeah,

1800
01:44:03.190 --> 01:44:05.900
we were in New Jersey and I'm like, no, you know,

1801
01:44:05.901 --> 01:44:08.960
I stopped drinking milk and stuff. He's like, come on, come on, come on.

1802
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:13.460
He was always a sweet guy. I, I miss him really bad. He was so funny.

1803
01:44:13.490 --> 01:44:18.350
He was a great person too. So sweet. Super Nice. Fucking hilarious.

1804
01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:22.580
So funny. Do you ever hear his Siegfried and Roy Jokes? Yes. Yes.

1805
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:25.940
Yeah. This shit ends tonight.

1806
01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:33.020
Oh my God. What? I'm, he had a heart condition, right? You know,

1807
01:44:33.021 --> 01:44:35.960
that accidentally took an Adderall once.

1808
01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.710
[inaudible] he thought he was taking some other medication.

1809
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:43.130
I forgot what he accidentally took the Adderall and he goes,

1810
01:44:43.131 --> 01:44:45.350
I fucking freaked out. I called my doctor. I'm like, Hey,

1811
01:44:45.351 --> 01:44:47.750
I'm talking to you was telling me what the milligrams is. How much did you take?

1812
01:44:47.751 --> 01:44:49.730
So I took one of these. He said, don't worry about it,

1813
01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:53.540
but you're going to be wide awake for like the next 12 hours. Wow.

1814
01:44:53.770 --> 01:44:56.660
It's not going to kill you. It's not that bad. You're not dying. And he goes,

1815
01:44:56.661 --> 01:45:00.830
I went over all my notes and he goes, I started organizing things.

1816
01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:03.260
That's what I've heard from people and they take Adderall.

1817
01:45:03.261 --> 01:45:06.260
It makes them like want to organize Sha, which is weird,

1818
01:45:06.261 --> 01:45:09.200
but not create necessarily. If you give me speed,

1819
01:45:09.201 --> 01:45:11.230
I'm going to want to go run up a hill or something, but I'm like,

1820
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:14.180
I want to do something stupid at your desk. I want to organize.

1821
01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:19.020
I want to be like [inaudible]. It would explode. I just said, imagine if I'm,

1822
01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:23.000
if I'm on some kind of speed, I'm going to want to do something stupid. Yeah.

1823
01:45:23.390 --> 01:45:27.260
You know, I always have, you want to be physical. If I drink coffee,

1824
01:45:27.261 --> 01:45:30.570
if I drink too much coffee, I'm just start jumping up and down somewhere.

1825
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:36.710
I've been drinking a tone aid with coffee, with caffeine,

1826
01:45:36.711 --> 01:45:38.630
and I forget it makes it, it's like this little drink.

1827
01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:42.850
I'm one of the ketone companies that sends me Shit. Oh,

1828
01:45:42.930 --> 01:45:46.310
it's a bunch of Quito companies. Nope. They'll send you a send you stuff.

1829
01:45:46.810 --> 01:45:49.040
HR stuff. I apologize to the company,

1830
01:45:49.041 --> 01:45:53.240
but they make this shit that has caffeine and ketones together.

1831
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:57.770
Fucking the wonderful before exercise. When you're grinding your teeth,

1832
01:45:57.771 --> 01:46:01.970
just talking about it makes you want to go crazy if you want to.

1833
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:06.200
Real good weight lifting exercises. Right. It's good.

1834
01:46:06.230 --> 01:46:09.800
Just kinda good at this stuff. I don't know. Caffeine is good to workout on.

1835
01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:14.630
Fuck. Yeah. It's great for lifting. It opens you up. Yeah. Opens up the vessels.

1836
01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:18.730
Yeah. Makes you shit your brains out though. You gotta be careful on correctly

1837
01:46:20.290 --> 01:46:24.370
the worst the way. When I go for a run and a half mile and you're like, oh,

1838
01:46:24.490 --> 01:46:28.310
ketone aid probably. Oh, is that it?

1839
01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.420
Is it his company? I'm looking at me. He's probably just doing,

1840
01:46:32.421 --> 01:46:36.830
I looked it up on the ball with them. No, that's not the same stuff. No,

1841
01:46:36.831 --> 01:46:40.010
it looks different, but I think he's giving me some of that too.

1842
01:46:40.130 --> 01:46:42.230
I think it's very similar. Does that have caffeine in it?

1843
01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:45.880
You still eat that way predominantly? No, no, no, no.

1844
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:50.700
It was too rigid and it wasn't enjoying as much. But I do eat a very low carb.

1845
01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:55.050
Um, high protein, high fat diet. That's your balance. Yeah, but I fuck off.

1846
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:57.120
I'll have a brown butter and jelly sandwich if I want one.

1847
01:46:57.210 --> 01:47:00.780
We're going to have so much fun at Busan. Frank's whoo join it.

1848
01:47:00.810 --> 01:47:05.580
But I will eat like cream of corn, stuff like that. But it's like for me,

1849
01:47:05.581 --> 01:47:07.710
I try to think of it as an 80 20 thing.

1850
01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:12.650
I eat 80% super healthy and 20% I'll allow myself questionable choices.

1851
01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:17.660
That's good. Yeah. Not, not like sugar. I mean, I know that's not, yeah,

1852
01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.760
but not like 20% dessert. You know what I mean? Right.

1853
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:22.790
If there's not 20% of my diets on ice cream or candy or something like that,

1854
01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:27.900
I might have spaghetti with clam. Right, right. You know what I mean? Yeah.

1855
01:47:27.930 --> 01:47:32.100
Which is not the good food, right. Vegetables, meat.

1856
01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:36.630
That's what I mostly eat. No fruit. Yeah. I for sure in the morning mornings,

1857
01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.950
usually before first workout, I like, uh, I like fruit and hydrates. Yeah.

1858
01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:42.090
It's easy to,

1859
01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:45.180
it's easy on your body and you can work out on fruit with no problems at all.

1860
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:50.990
I could run like hills with like a couple peaches in me that's not gonna be

1861
01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:56.020
sick. How greater peaches right now? Right now, peaches hitches or, ah.

1862
01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:59.760
How did Georgia gets so connected with peaches? Think about that shit. Right?

1863
01:47:59.761 --> 01:48:01.320
If you think about peaches, you think about Georgia.

1864
01:48:01.321 --> 01:48:05.930
This is not God damn events. Maybe Hawaii and coconuts, but no, right.

1865
01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:10.020
Is Georgia and peaches and peanuts. Oh, that's what Jimmy Carter, right? Yeah,

1866
01:48:10.230 --> 01:48:14.970
but what other Florida oranges, I guess Florida oranges, but I think Georgia.

1867
01:48:14.971 --> 01:48:19.230
Wisconsin cheese. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, but that's like dairy. Yeah.

1868
01:48:19.290 --> 01:48:24.210
That's a process. Food you're making like build up a fruit that grows in Jersey.

1869
01:48:24.211 --> 01:48:28.250
Tomatoes. Yeah. That's like if you were playing family feud, dub

1870
01:48:30.570 --> 01:48:35.570
jazzy tomato. Let me see. [inaudible]

1871
01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:36.693
long

1872
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:43.310
survey says I'm still doing the voice from the Hogan's Heroes Guy as family feud

1873
01:48:43.591 --> 01:48:48.000
off. He just noticed that the Dawson, Richard Dawson, he's the original,

1874
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:52.140
I stick with him in 80 90 Onco. Steve Harvey. Nope. Well,

1875
01:48:52.141 --> 01:48:55.020
there was a guy in between him and Steve Harvey, the Guy Committed Sanderson.

1876
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:59.130
No, there was going to kill them, so yeah, that's right. Ah, smell that guy.

1877
01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.020
Yes. Yeah. Dead on the feud. Yeah. What did he do?

1878
01:49:04.050 --> 01:49:06.740
Did he die while he was hosting it or did he quit and then kill him?

1879
01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:11.280
So I don't remember who he hung himself. All right. Yeah, I think so.

1880
01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:16.170
He was the host of family feud, right? Yeah. Yeah. But I think he had,

1881
01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:20.910
I think it was c, the second host, I think it was over rake homes. Brick homes,

1882
01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:23.280
homes. He was the second host. Correct.

1883
01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:27.150
Probably couldn't live up to the shadow over at your doctors. Yeah. Yeah.

1884
01:49:27.151 --> 01:49:32.040
That's the guy man telling me sappy. Tell me that couldn't be a great movie.

1885
01:49:32.041 --> 01:49:35.280
Right? Like there's something about that Gig, that smile.

1886
01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:38.010
Go back to that first picture with his hands up in the air. I could,

1887
01:49:38.190 --> 01:49:42.840
I could see, I could play that role. I could. I could see you playing that role.

1888
01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:47.890
If I was going to go with Steve Carell, but see he's not available.

1889
01:49:47.891 --> 01:49:49.740
I'm trying to make some money here.

1890
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:56.720
Crazy movie about a guy like,

1891
01:49:56.740 --> 01:50:00.290
do you remember what movie they did about Hogan's heroes? Guy About the, the,

1892
01:50:00.370 --> 01:50:04.910
the elite of Hogan's heroes. Now the guy who was with, um,

1893
01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:09.250
Richard Dawkins on Hogan's heroes, one of the guys who's with it.

1894
01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.640
What the fuck was his name? There was a movie called Gong Shot.

1895
01:50:13.170 --> 01:50:17.170
No movies called autofocus. Autofocus. Willem defoe. Yes.

1896
01:50:17.171 --> 01:50:18.640
Willem defoe was one guy,

1897
01:50:18.641 --> 01:50:21.160
but then there was another guy who played the Hogan's Heroes Guy.

1898
01:50:21.850 --> 01:50:26.230
What the fuck's his name? Bob God.

1899
01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:30.520
Oh yes. Yeah. Crane. Bob Craig. Thank you.

1900
01:50:31.130 --> 01:50:34.890
Bob Crane's Greg Kinnear. Yes. Brass. Yeah. Right.

1901
01:50:34.990 --> 01:50:39.430
You can hear it was excellent. Yeah. And it was a real porn habit, right?

1902
01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:42.760
He would make porn and he would make it with Willem defoe.

1903
01:50:42.761 --> 01:50:47.080
Apparently they'd be filming girls and then they think the Willem defoe

1904
01:50:47.081 --> 01:50:51.160
character killed them. But I don't think they ever solved the crime really.

1905
01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:53.710
I think it was one of those murders where they never totally solved the crime.

1906
01:50:54.190 --> 01:50:56.410
I'm not true. I'm mashing two movies up.

1907
01:50:57.130 --> 01:51:01.450
Cause Greg Kinnear also played chuck Barris from the gang show who did,

1908
01:51:01.451 --> 01:51:04.810
he was in the CIA. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1909
01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:09.280
That was questions of a dangerous mind. Was that it?

1910
01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:12.640
So I'm feeling like that wasn't him though. God wasn't that him.

1911
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.930
Who the fuck remembers anything too much? My stupid head butt.

1912
01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:22.810
Sam Rockwell. Sam Rockwell. That wasn't [inaudible]. Right, right, right.

1913
01:51:22.811 --> 01:51:27.510
You know, it's an amazing Sam Rockwell moving the moon. Oh yeah. Oh my God.

1914
01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:29.500
He's a, he's the whole movie. It's so good.

1915
01:51:29.740 --> 01:51:31.990
I'm telling you folks like this is all I'm going to tell you.

1916
01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:36.250
All I'm going to tell you is it's only Sam Rockwell for a whole hour and a half

1917
01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:40.030
and it's fucking amazing. I saw that in the theater in New York. Oh good. Yeah.

1918
01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:43.180
Is there even another actor? Is there one other actor in the movie? Maybe?

1919
01:51:43.650 --> 01:51:46.030
I think you're right. I think we're halfway through or something.

1920
01:51:46.031 --> 01:51:49.750
Someone shows out anymore. It's good. Fucking great.

1921
01:51:49.810 --> 01:51:52.730
It's a fucking great movie. He's such a good actor to watch.

1922
01:51:53.590 --> 01:51:58.540
Fossey Verdun he played Bob Fossey. It was a on FX. No,

1923
01:51:58.541 --> 01:52:01.600
it was a TV show. Yeah. About Bob Fosse, you know,

1924
01:52:01.601 --> 01:52:06.601
the choreographer and his wife Holly Tell you did that Verdun just like Chicago.

1925
01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:13.300
You did a version of jazz hands. It's really good.

1926
01:52:13.301 --> 01:52:16.720
He played, he's, yeah, he's really good at it. He's a great actor, man. Yeah,

1927
01:52:16.721 --> 01:52:21.400
he's really good. He was dating Leslie Bibb when Leslie Bibb.

1928
01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:25.810
Uh, I did a movie with Kevin James and Leslie Bibb was playing Kevin James,

1929
01:52:25.811 --> 01:52:27.550
his girlfriend, and my ex-girlfriend.

1930
01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:32.020
We're like competing for her love and I got to meet rock. What was the movie?

1931
01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:37.230
It was called zookeeper. Oh, cute kids movie. Yeah. Yeah. To our ball.

1932
01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:41.950
Thailand. Everything Kevin James does, which just makes me laugh.

1933
01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:46.400
It's a great guy too. Yeah. Mall Cops. Come on. Yeah, he's a,

1934
01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:47.713
I mean,

1935
01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:52.730
are there modern pratfall type super physical comedians and movies today?

1936
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:56.540
I know. Like who is, he might be the last, yeah,

1937
01:52:56.600 --> 01:53:00.320
he was very athletic. He was very light on his feet. Oh,

1938
01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:03.450
he was a martial artist, is he? He's a very talented, oh really? Yeah,

1939
01:53:03.650 --> 01:53:06.830
he's very good. I heard he was really good at basketball. Really? Yeah,

1940
01:53:07.130 --> 01:53:11.660
I believe that. I mean he eats a lot for sure. He would not be denying that.

1941
01:53:11.661 --> 01:53:16.130
But he, a martial arts technique is excellent. Really. He's got serious power.

1942
01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:21.260
He's got really good punches. Really good kicks. He had a, a bunch of different,

1943
01:53:21.630 --> 01:53:26.150
um, different styles of martial arts that he, he trained when he was coming up.

1944
01:53:26.210 --> 01:53:29.210
Oh, interesting. Some of the, I think some of it was Kung Fu.

1945
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:32.960
Some of it was karate, but it was, um, but he's, he knows what he's doing.

1946
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:36.650
He played, uh, he, he played a mixed martial artist in that movie.

1947
01:53:36.651 --> 01:53:39.260
Here comes the boom. Right, right. Yeah.

1948
01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:43.640
He played a guy who was like a high school coach that was trying to raise money

1949
01:53:43.670 --> 01:53:47.930
for school. So he had some UFC fights. He's physically just so funny.

1950
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:52.820
He is fine. Remember you like at the comic Strip early on watching him?

1951
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:54.830
He, I think he was, he was famous already,

1952
01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:58.400
but he had a bit about picking out greeting cards,

1953
01:53:58.401 --> 01:54:01.460
being in front of the greeting card aisle. Yes. Yes, right.

1954
01:54:01.730 --> 01:54:06.050
Would like pick them all out and yeah, just physically without a word at times.

1955
01:54:06.051 --> 01:54:09.560
Just looking at the cards. So damn funny. He had a,

1956
01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:11.420
one of my favorite pits ever about,

1957
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:15.920
it was back in the day when you had automatic locks on a car and when someone

1958
01:54:15.921 --> 01:54:19.250
would try to open the door while you were hitting unlock,

1959
01:54:19.410 --> 01:54:20.570
they would cancel each other out.

1960
01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:25.160
So you had this whole super frustrated bit about his girlfriend reaching for the

1961
01:54:25.161 --> 01:54:27.310
door and you know, and it,

1962
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:30.620
it and it keeps canceling out and he's getting more and more frustrated.

1963
01:54:30.650 --> 01:54:34.910
It's no, I mean there's so many moments of that and kings, kings, queens,

1964
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:40.940
all of his like physical, just frustration and, but like physical guys,

1965
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:44.180
like I'm, if you really stop and thinking about, there's so few.

1966
01:54:44.181 --> 01:54:46.970
Like Chris Farley of course, was a giant physical town.

1967
01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:51.710
He was very rough crammed in that way. Jackie Gleason a big guy, but very,

1968
01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:56.360
very graceful. Yeah. Like, um, he was,

1969
01:54:56.870 --> 01:55:01.310
he was like an accelerated version, right? Yeah, yeah.

1970
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:04.820
Of like John Belushi, like a larger, bigger,

1971
01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:07.940
more spastic, more crazy.

1972
01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:11.720
I mean he would fucking get sweaty and scream and right.

1973
01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:13.880
Whereas Belushi was like really physical too,

1974
01:55:13.881 --> 01:55:17.180
but they didn't get to that because it was wrong.

1975
01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:21.200
Like Farley is more in that Kevin James kind of lightness.

1976
01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:24.350
You know what Belushi had? Belushi had like this weird,

1977
01:55:24.351 --> 01:55:28.840
hilarious feeling of danger. Yeah. Like he was dangerous, but it was funny,

1978
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:32.840
like in Animal House, he was dangerous. It was reckless. It was rock and roll.

1979
01:55:32.841 --> 01:55:36.230
It was like off kilter. Yes. When he smashed that guy's guitar,

1980
01:55:36.231 --> 01:55:37.160
when he was playing songs,

1981
01:55:38.530 --> 01:55:42.860
there's this danger through him and like blues brothers. Yes.

1982
01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:43.860
That is dangerous.

1983
01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:48.240
<v 0>Yeah. That off-kilter kind of thing. No, Kevin James Farley.</v>

1984
01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:53.040
They had a sweetness. Yep. It wasn't danger. It was,

1985
01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:57.920
it was energetic, but always you weren't in danger. But here's a quote, like,

1986
01:55:58.170 --> 01:56:03.170
I'm sure someone could do that Belushi thing without drugs.

1987
01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:07.470
Oh yeah. I'm sure. But no one has

1988
01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:10.620
<v 6>no</v>

1989
01:56:15.110 --> 01:56:15.810
[inaudible]

1990
01:56:15.810 --> 01:56:18.810
<v 0>so sure that someone can do it. Drugs. Yeah.</v>

1991
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:24.040
Is that just being cocky? I was like, no, you don't need vitamins. Just, uh,

1992
01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:27.120
eat bread and lift weights. Yeah. No, you need vitamins.

1993
01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:30.240
But what was that was fueled by, yeah, that was cocaine, right?

1994
01:56:30.241 --> 01:56:34.530
That was probably a lot of it, but I think he was doing speedballs. Right.

1995
01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:37.890
So he's doing cocaine in heroin. Oh Man. How he died. Yeah.

1996
01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:42.510
That's how we're Chateau Marmont. Oh yeah.

1997
01:56:42.511 --> 01:56:44.010
I don't know. I don't know.

1998
01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:49.020
That's one of the things about like great wild people who's, who's,

1999
01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:53.790
who's really wild now like that. Nobody really, right.

2000
01:56:53.930 --> 01:56:55.620
I know that we want to throw into the bus.

2001
01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:00.240
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2002
01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:03.240
<v 0>Like cocaine wildness doesn't like,</v>

2003
01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:06.810
or just like that reckless like danger, I guess.

2004
01:57:06.811 --> 01:57:10.960
What's his name has a little of it in his acting. Um,

2005
01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.410
Tom [inaudible] played Tom Hardy. Yeah. Yeah. He's pretty reckless.

2006
01:57:15.411 --> 01:57:19.980
He's got that kind of thing. Like, I mean, he did two movies. He did the,

2007
01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:21.150
um,

2008
01:57:21.150 --> 01:57:26.150
Dunkirk and Batman with his face completely covered and he still was able to

2009
01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:31.350
emote danger and, and like,

2010
01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:36.610
he was just able to express so much with half of his face. Yeah. Guys,

2011
01:57:36.690 --> 01:57:40.620
pretty serious. He's, he's a bad motherfucker. Yeah, for sure.

2012
01:57:40.621 --> 01:57:42.030
And good in that movie warrior.

2013
01:57:42.090 --> 01:57:45.330
You ever see that movie warrior said when he played two characters? No,

2014
01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:49.860
he played a fighter. Him and his brother, they wanna it was an MMA movie.

2015
01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:54.900
They want up fighting and seeing that um, um, Nick Nolte, he's in it.

2016
01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:58.140
He has this incredible performance. Nick,

2017
01:57:58.380 --> 01:58:03.380
no d completely steals the movie as this guy's alcoholic father who was a

2018
01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:09.420
formerly trained both of them. That's a wild man. It's, it's so good.

2019
01:58:09.450 --> 01:58:10.680
You forget how God damn good,

2020
01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:14.010
good Nick Knowlton like whether or not it's drug fueled or not,

2021
01:58:14.011 --> 01:58:19.011
there is something to actors who have some manic part to their personality that

2022
01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:24.810
the camera that they can harness, but still,

2023
01:58:25.500 --> 01:58:28.950
so it's not, it's not bullshit when they, when they film it,

2024
01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:30.630
you know what I mean? Who's,

2025
01:58:30.631 --> 01:58:34.290
that guy doesn't come off as fake and like melty phenom.

2026
01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:39.360
Mickey Rourke. Oh, it's him from different movies. So we're saying, okay,

2027
01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:42.070
I'm warrior and then Bronson. I, yeah, Bronson

2028
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:45.850
<v 1>was like his first big break. Have you seen the pictures of him playing Capone?</v>

2029
01:58:45.970 --> 01:58:49.060
But the warrior one, look at the one in the middle. That's what's crazy, dude.

2030
01:58:49.061 --> 01:58:51.660
He got fucking Jack. Yeah.

2031
01:58:51.670 --> 01:58:55.530
When you see him in the movie mean he looks like a professional fighter.

2032
01:58:55.990 --> 01:59:00.070
I mean w there's no if, ands or buts. Nope. I mean, he really does.

2033
01:59:00.071 --> 01:59:02.440
He looks like a guy who could fight in the UFC physically.

2034
01:59:02.530 --> 01:59:06.840
He got his body into that form. That's hard to do, man. Didn't it?

2035
01:59:06.841 --> 01:59:11.260
Didn't Hanks get a diabetes from going up and down so much? Who?

2036
01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.470
Tommy Hanks. Tom Hanks went up and down and wait. Yeah.

2037
01:59:14.500 --> 01:59:18.790
How dare you compare a Tom Hanks to Tom Hardy? First of all, fuck.

2038
01:59:19.290 --> 01:59:23.010
We're good by Tom Hardy. Didn't do his fucking body. [inaudible] done that. No,

2039
01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:25.150
he didn't. Just not a fucking Joe. He didn't. The other thing,

2040
01:59:25.151 --> 01:59:29.170
he got real big and fat. Did you know who else did that? Like cast away?

2041
01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:32.020
He was really scrawny and then he was like a regular dude.

2042
01:59:32.050 --> 01:59:34.760
Maybe he fucked his body over starving himself to death. Jamie,

2043
01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:37.960
is there a picture of hardy is al Capone that's coming out.

2044
01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:44.320
It's not a great shot. Yeah. Do you know who else did that for?

2045
01:59:44.321 --> 01:59:48.070
A movie who got super jacked and they're like kind of a crazy way.

2046
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:51.820
Jake Glulam Hall. Oh Wow. Look at that. Look at fucking score.

2047
01:59:51.850 --> 01:59:56.400
Robert or Albert Chino Rather Dick Tracy villain. Yeah.

2048
01:59:57.250 --> 02:00:01.330
Wow. Oh, they're saying he looks like a,

2049
02:00:01.810 --> 02:00:05.350
he looks like they're making fun of them. They're making fun to open shop. Yeah.

2050
02:00:05.351 --> 02:00:07.930
Al Capone. And that's a bad shot. Tracy.

2051
02:00:08.290 --> 02:00:11.350
That's Al Pachino playing a Dick Tracy character, right? Yeah.

2052
02:00:11.490 --> 02:00:14.820
He's playing out component Dick Tracy. Oh, that's what it was. Okay.

2053
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:20.980
Know Jake Lillian Hall. It's pronounced. Huh?

2054
02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:25.160
Google that guy from the movie South Paul, the movie southpaw.

2055
02:00:25.190 --> 02:00:30.070
He was fucking jacked, Bro. He played a boxer. I mean,

2056
02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:34.060
fucking Shakey's look dude, look at that. I mean,

2057
02:00:34.061 --> 02:00:38.110
he looks like wow. Andre Ward in his prime. I mean,

2058
02:00:38.111 --> 02:00:42.190
that's how shredded he is. Oh my God. It looks like Roy Jones jr almost.

2059
02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:45.340
He doesn't look like a metal off bro. He's so shredded.

2060
02:00:45.610 --> 02:00:49.750
But how much of that is three animations? Oh yeah. Yes.

2061
02:00:49.930 --> 02:00:51.790
You just take steroids and luck. Yeah.

2062
02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:54.790
I mean maybe they've three d animated them. It's possible.

2063
02:00:54.850 --> 02:00:58.900
But he looked so good. Well, I mean, well maybe we should Google that. How?

2064
02:00:59.290 --> 02:01:01.000
Kayla, why don't you go back? Go back to that picture.

2065
02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:06.010
Go back to the picture you just had. How did Jake Willenhall get so ripped?

2066
02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:09.630
Okay. The man man blog. Click on that shit. Yeah.

2067
02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:12.790
I think he probably took some Mexican supplements and worked out look a

2068
02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:15.130
motherfucker. But either way,

2069
02:01:15.190 --> 02:01:20.190
there's no way you get that ripped without insane work.

2070
02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:24.310
Insane. Because it's too late all the time. Right.

2071
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:27.920
All steroids are doing is helping you recover, makes you recover. You'll,

2072
02:01:27.921 --> 02:01:29.890
you'll develop more muscle quicker cause,

2073
02:01:29.891 --> 02:01:31.960
but you have to break down the muscle for the muscle to grow.

2074
02:01:32.110 --> 02:01:35.140
So you have to go through the workout. So it doesn't stimulate the growth of it.

2075
02:01:35.170 --> 02:01:40.000
Yes. But you can't be lazy and have that body fucking impossible. Right.

2076
02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.800
<v 4>Since for five months long, you've been working out twice a day.</v>

2077
02:01:42.801 --> 02:01:46.010
Even on Sundays. His workout regime was about four to six hours a day.

2078
02:01:46.250 --> 02:01:47.510
He started training as a fighter,

2079
02:01:47.511 --> 02:01:50.600
sparring with real opponents and taking in some real punches.

2080
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:53.840
His boxing workout consisted of all the things that a boxer would do.

2081
02:01:53.841 --> 02:01:58.310
Shadowboxing heavy bag, speed, ball sparring, focus pads, double end rounds.

2082
02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:01.070
He says, I was sparring and really getting hit.

2083
02:02:01.071 --> 02:02:03.860
It helped me understand the sacrifice it takes to be a fighter.

2084
02:02:04.130 --> 02:02:06.650
You can't play a boxer and just look like a boxer.

2085
02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:10.130
You have to believe that you can exist in that world. Well,

2086
02:02:10.330 --> 02:02:14.150
that's a good character. He's amazing actor, but he is always dedicated.

2087
02:02:14.330 --> 02:02:16.730
He's always been an amazing actor. He's really good in everything.

2088
02:02:16.731 --> 02:02:20.060
I know there was something together recently. I just saw he was in,

2089
02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:26.030
I forget, he broke back mountain now playing games. That's what you're watching.

2090
02:02:26.630 --> 02:02:30.920
All right, Dave. He's um,

2091
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:32.690
that's a rare person that can do that.

2092
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:36.230
I don't care what he was taking that I don't care if you're working out six

2093
02:02:36.231 --> 02:02:36.651
hours a day,

2094
02:02:36.651 --> 02:02:40.810
there is not a fucking drug in the world that gets you that discipline. Right?

2095
02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:44.570
You have to do that. You have to do that yourself. You have to force yourself.

2096
02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:48.530
It's mostly willpower. Well, I'm pals with the, with um,

2097
02:02:49.730 --> 02:02:53.660
Jason Borne. Oh and he, Jason Bourne isn't a real person. It's not,

2098
02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:58.190
I'm sorry. What, who do you think Jason Borne is? It is,

2099
02:02:58.191 --> 02:03:02.390
he's a character in a movie. No, he's a, he works for the government.

2100
02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:08.380
Wait, how do you stay on pals with the Bourne identity? Yeah.

2101
02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:11.660
Why don't you stay on pals with Superman. Makes just as much sense.

2102
02:03:12.290 --> 02:03:14.720
Jason Bourne's on a real person. Wait, what?

2103
02:03:15.230 --> 02:03:19.940
Who he saying you're friends with Jason Bourne? Um,

2104
02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:21.633
he's,

2105
02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:25.940
he's seen Matt Documentary Friends of Matt Damon.

2106
02:03:27.110 --> 02:03:28.970
Oh yeah. Okay.

2107
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:33.080
Matt Damon was at the end probably the night he was. Yeah.

2108
02:03:33.530 --> 02:03:35.840
I didn't get a chance to say hi if he hears this. Hi Matt Damon.

2109
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:39.680
I love that guy. I'm very impressed with him. He's great.

2110
02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:42.290
He seems like a really interesting person too. It was like his very,

2111
02:03:42.291 --> 02:03:45.020
very wise person. He is, he's very smart anyway,

2112
02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:49.740
but watching him for the last born movie, he knows how to fight. Yeah,

2113
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:52.700
he's got a great trainer. Matt [inaudible]. Oh,

2114
02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:58.520
[inaudible] his name. He has legit Angela Dundee and I really? Yeah,

2115
02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:01.370
this is legit. He's a great guy. And, uh,

2116
02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:05.090
but watching the two of them train all the time and it was like when he dials

2117
02:04:05.091 --> 02:04:06.950
in, it's like that's their life. Well,

2118
02:04:06.951 --> 02:04:10.280
you can tell when you watch someone doing something in a movie,

2119
02:04:10.281 --> 02:04:14.600
whether or not they put the time in, right. Keanu Reeves in John Wick, right.

2120
02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:18.860
That motherfucker put in the time. I'm, I'm buying everything line and sinker.

2121
02:04:19.130 --> 02:04:22.220
I'm buying him kicking people's asses. I'm finding shooting people.

2122
02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:25.310
He shoots guns. Like a guy who's been tactically trained.

2123
02:04:25.311 --> 02:04:28.160
Like the guy's a real assassin. I buy every fucking second,

2124
02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:31.030
even though it's cartoonish and over the top and crazy. Sure.

2125
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:33.290
But you can tell when you can't ask people,

2126
02:04:34.030 --> 02:04:36.680
flips them on their head and breaks her arm and stomps their head and then shoot

2127
02:04:36.681 --> 02:04:38.100
someone they're, I'm in.

2128
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:41.250
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah, he did it. He did it right. Legit.</v>

2129
02:04:42.210 --> 02:04:44.600
That's why I do more comedic roles. Good move.

2130
02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:47.550
Do way less powerful pounding on the joints.

2131
02:04:50.290 --> 02:04:53.730
That's fucking when you, I like my friend Tate Tate Fletcher.

2132
02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:56.230
He just got a concussion from, uh,

2133
02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:59.580
doing a scene in a movie where he was doing some stunt work.

2134
02:05:00.090 --> 02:05:01.140
His Tate does a lot of acting,

2135
02:05:01.141 --> 02:05:06.141
but he also does a lot of stunt work to [inaudible] and he hit his head and hurt

2136
02:05:06.361 --> 02:05:07.290
it real bad, you know?

2137
02:05:07.291 --> 02:05:11.660
And like he's real light-sensitive right now and it's CVD and yeah, and Tate,

2138
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:13.890
you know, Tate had a career as a fighter as well,

2139
02:05:14.630 --> 02:05:18.690
so he fought in the UFC. He had uh,

2140
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:23.730
quite a few professional fights and a lot of sparring in between the

2141
02:05:23.731 --> 02:05:25.530
professional fights, not sparring rounds, you know,

2142
02:05:25.531 --> 02:05:28.080
so he's Kinda sensitive to getting hit in the head anyway.

2143
02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:31.530
It doesn't want to get hit in the head anymore for him to fall like on the set

2144
02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:34.590
white like that, that world of like a stunt man,

2145
02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:37.110
like we're talking about gene labelle, Brad Pitt character,

2146
02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:41.070
those are the toughest fucking people. Holly man, come on toughest animals.

2147
02:05:41.730 --> 02:05:42.900
That's a hard way to make a living man.

2148
02:05:42.901 --> 02:05:45.870
You're always falling out of the back of trucks and wreck and motorcycles on

2149
02:05:45.871 --> 02:05:49.530
purpose and yeah, exactly man. I wonder if the numbers,

2150
02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:54.620
the number of stumped man has gone down since animation 3d stuff has started to,

2151
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:57.870
that's interesting is improved. I bet there's a lot less of it.

2152
02:05:58.230 --> 02:06:01.380
I bet you're right. But for some things, you need a stop person.

2153
02:06:02.070 --> 02:06:05.940
You need someone also to tell you what those guys are. So wild though.

2154
02:06:05.941 --> 02:06:10.620
Like we had stunt guys that developed a lot of the uh,

2155
02:06:10.770 --> 02:06:13.530
events on fear factor. They developed a lot of 'em.

2156
02:06:13.531 --> 02:06:15.990
Like a lot of times what would happen was like the producers would come to the

2157
02:06:15.991 --> 02:06:18.600
stunt man and the stock man and they would say, hey,

2158
02:06:18.601 --> 02:06:22.080
this is what we want to do when to take a helicopter and throw someone off and

2159
02:06:22.140 --> 02:06:25.200
I'm fucking Bungee cord in between these two mountains. Like,

2160
02:06:25.230 --> 02:06:26.910
can we do this without killing me? Yeah.

2161
02:06:26.970 --> 02:06:29.130
And then the stunt guys has to look at it and say, okay,

2162
02:06:29.131 --> 02:06:32.490
let me see how we can make this so that no one dies. Right.

2163
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:36.720
But they are willing to take so much more risks that regular person,

2164
02:06:36.721 --> 02:06:38.520
like their idea of like, you getting hurt,

2165
02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.180
they're not worried about getting hurt like a normal person right now.

2166
02:06:42.530 --> 02:06:46.590
Like Alex Honnold, right. The guy doesn't, he really doesn't have fear. No, no,

2167
02:06:46.591 --> 02:06:49.560
no, no. He's, that's different isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.

2168
02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:52.710
That's different because the stunt man, if that would be,

2169
02:06:52.711 --> 02:06:56.220
if Alex Honnold was telling you, you can climb that wall. Right,

2170
02:06:56.530 --> 02:06:59.370
because he's doing it himself. He knows he's really good at it.

2171
02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:02.340
The same thing about the stunt guys is this dunk guys,

2172
02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:05.490
they're not trying to get anybody hurt,

2173
02:07:05.491 --> 02:07:08.000
but they're not worried about getting hurt themselves. Like their,

2174
02:07:08.010 --> 02:07:12.450
their idea of getting hurt is slightly different than a regular person cause it

2175
02:07:12.451 --> 02:07:15.300
just so fucking tough. And they're used to doing it.

2176
02:07:15.680 --> 02:07:19.200
He used to jump it off fucking horses and shit. And Yeah.

2177
02:07:19.201 --> 02:07:21.690
So we had this one event where they were,

2178
02:07:21.810 --> 02:07:24.870
they were making the contestants ride bulls and it was,

2179
02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:28.170
there's only two times in the history of that show was like, don't do this,

2180
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:32.700
don't do this. And that was a big one. And I was like, you guys are crazy.

2181
02:07:32.701 --> 02:07:35.680
These are bulls and this is, this is really what he said to me.

2182
02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:38.920
The stock guy said, he goes, oh don't worry about it bu these are stunt bowls.

2183
02:07:39.820 --> 02:07:42.700
I go there, stunt bowls. He goes, yeah, they're less aggressive. I go,

2184
02:07:42.701 --> 02:07:45.580
does that bowl? No, he's a stunt bowl. I bet he thinks he's a bull.

2185
02:07:46.090 --> 02:07:47.860
I bet he thinks he's a ball and I bet he's not.

2186
02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:50.830
Gonna like the fact that all these fucking people are riding him cause you're

2187
02:07:50.831 --> 02:07:53.590
having like eight people riding him or I don't know if he looks like six,

2188
02:07:53.591 --> 02:07:55.840
six people. Right. It wasn't a stent stunk ball.

2189
02:07:55.841 --> 02:08:00.841
I'd be so pissed right now that both launched these people through the fucking

2190
02:08:01.211 --> 02:08:03.130
air launched them.

2191
02:08:03.131 --> 02:08:06.310
The way you would shake a tennis ball off your forehand,

2192
02:08:06.620 --> 02:08:08.950
like if you had a tennis ball in your hand and you would just do like that

2193
02:08:09.170 --> 02:08:09.880
you're flying.

2194
02:08:09.880 --> 02:08:13.570
That's what those people did with these w w that's the bolded with these CPAs

2195
02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:17.740
literally hurt a ball and just underhanded it people would fly.

2196
02:08:17.770 --> 02:08:21.170
Did anyone get really hurt in the taping of that show at all? No, not one.

2197
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:24.340
Just that. That is come on seven. That's what that was.

2198
02:08:24.660 --> 02:08:28.570
It was a lot of that for sure. With the bowl one, because the bull one,

2199
02:08:28.650 --> 02:08:32.170
the bull kicked in the air and was just barely missing people's heads.

2200
02:08:32.171 --> 02:08:35.040
She's dude, I was watching, I was like, this is fucking car.

2201
02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:38.620
I told everyone to not do it. I was like, damn, do people like, well I want to,

2202
02:08:38.621 --> 02:08:42.610
I want to get that 50 grand ago. I mean man, I get, I get what you're saying,

2203
02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:47.260
but this is not the time for you. He weighed 98 pounds. This is a fucking visit.

2204
02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:48.430
Another way to get this money.

2205
02:08:48.850 --> 02:08:51.880
It just seems like a way to get injured for the rest of your life.

2206
02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.290
What about the uh, uh, Mark Wahlberg? You see all his videos?

2207
02:08:56.290 --> 02:09:00.850
He gets up at two 30 and goes into the gym. You ever see his Instagram?

2208
02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:04.640
I have not. I did see a thing with him and James Corden though. Oh yeah.

2209
02:09:05.050 --> 02:09:09.460
James tried to do the workouts with him. Oh really? Yeah, Ma, he brought,

2210
02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:12.030
they went over to Marcie Mark's basement. Yeah,

2211
02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:16.270
they worked out together but he keeps posting like he gets up at two 30 were in

2212
02:09:16.271 --> 02:09:17.830
the gym, is a gym, gym,

2213
02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:22.870
credible and then he goes to bed at seven o'clock and cause he's up at two and

2214
02:09:22.871 --> 02:09:27.460
he's obviously working for him. Super disciplined guy. Yeah.

2215
02:09:27.490 --> 02:09:29.070
And he's in great shape. But uh,

2216
02:09:29.710 --> 02:09:31.420
James Corden tried to do the workout with him is pretty funny.

2217
02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:35.800
He's got a gym in his house. It's like a, like a gym. Gym. Oh, go into the gym.

2218
02:09:36.050 --> 02:09:38.470
Right. That's his whole house. So like his,

2219
02:09:38.530 --> 02:09:42.340
this section of his house where the gym is, is epic. So you know,

2220
02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:44.380
they had all these crazy workouts that were doing. Wow.

2221
02:09:44.500 --> 02:09:49.490
I guess if those are the roles that you're always doing, do it bad asses. Yeah.

2222
02:09:50.100 --> 02:09:53.830
Someone's doing lucky. Played a Mickey Ward and that movie, the fighter.

2223
02:09:54.130 --> 02:09:58.630
Never that. Yup. Yeah, he's got it. So he's doing those action roles.

2224
02:09:58.930 --> 02:09:59.770
Yeah. But you know,

2225
02:09:59.771 --> 02:10:04.771
you could sleep in to still work out at 10 why do you have to meet him at two 30

2226
02:10:05.231 --> 02:10:08.050
in the morning? No, that's not healthy for him.

2227
02:10:08.051 --> 02:10:13.051
Anything that's big about that is that you know that you are getting up early.

2228
02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:15.880
You'd know like my friend Jocko,

2229
02:10:16.150 --> 02:10:20.260
he gets up every day at four 30 in the morning and his entire Instagram is

2230
02:10:20.261 --> 02:10:21.490
photos of his watch.

2231
02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:27.270
Four 30 in the morning and crazy workouts that he's doing or shooting his bow or

2232
02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:30.340
you know, he's, when do you wake up? Jitsu?

2233
02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:33.880
I usually wake up around seven or eight. Seven or eight. Yeah.

2234
02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:35.810
That's how I like to do different things.

2235
02:10:35.811 --> 02:10:39.800
Early in the morning I have to take yoga. Some mornings I like to lift weights.

2236
02:10:39.801 --> 02:10:43.580
Some mornings I don't generally like to do Jujitsu at eight in the morning.

2237
02:10:43.610 --> 02:10:46.810
I like to do Jujitsu around noon to wake up. Right.

2238
02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:49.160
I like to eat something too cause it's so ruthless.

2239
02:10:49.610 --> 02:10:53.600
I don't want to be hungry in class. I want to be like at that right.

2240
02:10:54.050 --> 02:10:58.850
Hydrated and fueled like two hours after a workout, after a meal.

2241
02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:00.320
That's what we want to go into. Something like that.

2242
02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:04.100
But like something where I can just push myself and I don't worry about being

2243
02:11:04.101 --> 02:11:07.810
strangled and you're like, yeah, kettlebells or something.

2244
02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:10.190
I'll do a brutal kettlebell workout first thing in the morning.

2245
02:11:10.191 --> 02:11:13.820
I'll just have like a caffeine drink and maybe a couple pieces of fruit and just

2246
02:11:13.821 --> 02:11:17.750
go, yeah, it's good. I you,

2247
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:22.310
you do spots late at night. So do you shut it down at some point during the day?

2248
02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:27.590
Do you nap? No. No, no. You never nap? No. No,

2249
02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:31.830
I don't think that I need it. Interesting. I don't feel it ever helps. Right?

2250
02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:35.600
Yeah, I'd rather power through but I get it if you need it.

2251
02:11:35.630 --> 02:11:36.830
If I felt like I needed it,

2252
02:11:36.831 --> 02:11:39.500
like I definitely took a bunch of naps when I got back from Italy cause I was

2253
02:11:39.501 --> 02:11:42.980
whacked out cause I would see chain fucked me up man.

2254
02:11:42.981 --> 02:11:46.250
I would sleep for like three hours and then I would wake up and I'd be like,

2255
02:11:46.251 --> 02:11:49.730
why am I wide awake around two in the morning? This is so stupid.

2256
02:11:49.731 --> 02:11:52.970
And then I would be up and then I'll get really sleepy around six I tried to

2257
02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:54.840
sleep for an hour, I had to wake up,

2258
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:57.620
then I woke up again and that would take a nap in the afternoon.

2259
02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:02.870
It took like a good four or five days before that leveled out.

2260
02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:06.620
And I started sleeping on a normal schedule, but you work out so much,

2261
02:12:06.621 --> 02:12:10.310
you don't, you're burning energy like usually when you're really in shape,

2262
02:12:10.311 --> 02:12:14.960
you don't need naps. You shouldn't use TM for your, for your brain. Yeah.

2263
02:12:14.961 --> 02:12:17.870
That sounds like I should do it. Launch. Just give me a mantra.

2264
02:12:17.900 --> 02:12:19.200
Why don't you come up with a mantra for me?

2265
02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.040
I don't want you to become an instructor. You've been doing it long enough.

2266
02:12:22.610 --> 02:12:26.870
I don't want to go to some other dude. Diaz does Diaz. Yeah. Which one?

2267
02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:31.430
Nick or Joey. How about Nate? Nate.

2268
02:12:32.090 --> 02:12:35.720
Nate Diaz. Now Joey. Joey, Joey Diaz. Just think Joey Diaz.

2269
02:12:36.160 --> 02:12:39.740
Joey's doing the dia. Joey do ideas. You could just do it.

2270
02:12:39.770 --> 02:12:43.880
You could just create it. Just use ohm. I mean, I don't understand why. Yeah.

2271
02:12:43.881 --> 02:12:47.210
Why do you have a mantra? What to tell us your mantra. I can't.

2272
02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:54.650
I can't. I'm not allowed. You can come and get me.

2273
02:12:54.680 --> 02:12:58.850
That's so not true. That's so not true. Now they won't come and get me,

2274
02:12:58.851 --> 02:13:02.990
but it's kind of a personal thing because it has no meaning. If I say it,

2275
02:13:02.991 --> 02:13:05.720
then you're going to say something back. Now there's something attached to it.

2276
02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:09.110
That's why you don't say, oh, okay. You know what I mean?

2277
02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:11.480
It's of your word.

2278
02:13:11.481 --> 02:13:16.481
It's just a pure sound that has no mental attachments to it in the earliest days

2279
02:13:18.590 --> 02:13:19.550
of religion.

2280
02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:23.600
Wasn't it a problem if you said God's name,

2281
02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:29.840
aren't there like certain sex of religion that don't think that you should say

2282
02:13:29.841 --> 02:13:32.160
God's name? [inaudible] whatever

2283
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:37.020
<v 4>God's name is, whatever. It's a tod Yeshua or whatever it is,</v>

2284
02:13:37.230 --> 02:13:40.370
whatever the name of God is, isn't it? Oh,

2285
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:44.670
why am I re trying to remember this sounds like a Jordan Peterson thing. No.

2286
02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.620
Yeah. He would know. He would know the answer to it.

2287
02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:50.990
<v 0>Yeah. Well obviously, well,</v>

2288
02:13:50.991 --> 02:13:54.500
obviously I like the way he says. Obviously that's pretty good.

2289
02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:59.630
That's very Canadian. He might be a Canadians by, well,

2290
02:13:59.631 --> 02:14:02.390
obviously you can't, you can't.

2291
02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:07.900
How you say you can't talk about the name without it coming back at you,

2292
02:14:08.121 --> 02:14:11.630
obviously. Is that for, that's pretty good, right?

2293
02:14:11.950 --> 02:14:16.480
<v 4>He's one of the most misinterpreted guys I think I've ever met.</v>

2294
02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:21.760
Not just willfully misinterpreted where people take the words and the things

2295
02:14:21.761 --> 02:14:25.420
that he's saying willfully misconstrue them.

2296
02:14:26.210 --> 02:14:31.210
They purposefully change what he's saying to make it more offensive,

2297
02:14:31.931 --> 02:14:36.250
more unreasonable. People are angry. Well,

2298
02:14:37.240 --> 02:14:38.140
it's hard to say.

2299
02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:43.170
I think part of it has to do with the way he initially came onto the scene. Oh,

2300
02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:45.340
because of the transgender thing is yes.

2301
02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:50.380
Was he was very concerned that they were forcing people to use certain language,

2302
02:14:50.770 --> 02:14:53.470
new pronouns, and people were saying like,

2303
02:14:53.471 --> 02:14:57.490
why do you have a problem with people's pronouns? And he's saying,

2304
02:14:57.520 --> 02:14:58.780
that's not what I'm saying.

2305
02:14:59.800 --> 02:15:03.340
The problem is not whether or not I would have a problem with someone's

2306
02:15:03.341 --> 02:15:03.881
pronouns.

2307
02:15:03.881 --> 02:15:08.500
A problem is being legally compelled to use these new words that someone's

2308
02:15:08.501 --> 02:15:10.810
inventing. He's like, I am not doing that.

2309
02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:13.990
<v 0>Right. The government telling me how I can speak.</v>

2310
02:15:14.120 --> 02:15:14.661
<v 4>Exactly.</v>

2311
02:15:14.661 --> 02:15:18.020
Not just that the government also being influenced by people who want you to be

2312
02:15:18.021 --> 02:15:21.100
legally compelled to say they're there, they're pronouns.

2313
02:15:21.500 --> 02:15:23.390
It's a slippery slope of control.

2314
02:15:23.391 --> 02:15:28.391
More than it is a thing of culture or of of morals or compassion or for being

2315
02:15:30.471 --> 02:15:31.304
progressive.

2316
02:15:31.340 --> 02:15:36.080
He's not saying that he's saying it based on his very deep understanding of

2317
02:15:36.081 --> 02:15:38.330
history and of, uh,

2318
02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:43.360
some communist dictatorships that have gone horribly wrong and some Marxist

2319
02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:47.630
philosophies that he's aware of that he thinks horribly, dammit,

2320
02:15:47.631 --> 02:15:50.990
damaging and dangerous if implemented on a large scale.

2321
02:15:51.170 --> 02:15:55.470
Like if you allow large groups of people to control language and to,

2322
02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:58.700
to legally compel people to say these new words, you're inventing,

2323
02:15:59.210 --> 02:16:01.760
this is not good. This is a bad path for humans.

2324
02:16:02.210 --> 02:16:06.680
Just historically it's a bad path. And so that's how he broke onto the scene.

2325
02:16:06.681 --> 02:16:10.940
And in that time period, all these people who opposed what he was saying,

2326
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:15.440
they were labeling him as transphobic, they were labeling him as homophobic,

2327
02:16:15.441 --> 02:16:17.420
all these different things that are not true. Right?

2328
02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:21.410
Then he gets connected to this pepe, the frog thing, right?

2329
02:16:21.411 --> 02:16:24.980
Because he thinks it's kind of hilarious that the Internet has taken on pepe the

2330
02:16:24.981 --> 02:16:28.220
frog as like this meme. The feels good man.

2331
02:16:28.221 --> 02:16:32.200
Frog I know gets you didn't know the whole thing. The frog. Wow.

2332
02:16:32.201 --> 02:16:33.034
Where are you been living?

2333
02:16:33.100 --> 02:16:35.340
Then you stop meditating and read the fucking newspapers.

2334
02:16:35.930 --> 02:16:39.190
You know what I listened to all the time. I didn't know any of this.

2335
02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:43.350
I didn't know pepe. The frog is racist. No. Okay. This is serious. Okay.

2336
02:16:43.390 --> 02:16:44.880
You have to know this because there's,

2337
02:16:44.890 --> 02:16:48.250
somebody wants you to take a picture with his fucking pepe. The frog thing.

2338
02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:51.580
There are a certain group of people out there who will decide Tom Papa is some

2339
02:16:51.581 --> 02:16:56.440
sort of all white white nationalist white supremacist Nazi person.

2340
02:16:56.770 --> 02:17:00.100
No bullshit. A fucking frog. A frog. Yeah. You know why? Why?

2341
02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:04.300
Because some people have used that frog in a negative way. Some people,

2342
02:17:04.301 --> 02:17:08.980
most people use that f frog as a joke, like feels bad man.

2343
02:17:08.981 --> 02:17:13.030
The frog is like mm. And then it's an animated thing. Just a frog,

2344
02:17:13.450 --> 02:17:17.050
a cartoon of a frog. But the alt right,

2345
02:17:17.530 --> 02:17:19.180
or I shouldn't even say the outright,

2346
02:17:19.390 --> 02:17:24.390
people on Internet forums would constantly and consistently use that frog as a

2347
02:17:26.141 --> 02:17:30.910
joke about everything. Like they had, they had Donald Trump's hair on that frog.

2348
02:17:31.480 --> 02:17:35.410
But it's more humor and mocking and making fun of things.

2349
02:17:35.411 --> 02:17:37.510
And as the British would say, taking the piss.

2350
02:17:38.030 --> 02:17:39.400
So he's taking the piss with the frog.

2351
02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:45.000
But there were a few that would have the frog with like a swastika armband and a

2352
02:17:45.550 --> 02:17:49.180
fucking Nazi hat on. Why? Because they, cause they're internet people.

2353
02:17:49.590 --> 02:17:53.350
Like if you leave something on the Internet eventually long enough,

2354
02:17:53.351 --> 02:17:55.110
someone's going to put a Nazi flag. Yeah.

2355
02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:58.450
It doesn't mean that it's a symbol of Nazis,

2356
02:17:58.910 --> 02:18:01.090
but it's a symbol of white supremacy because that's not what it was.

2357
02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:05.950
And so he dared logically argue this. People were very,

2358
02:18:05.951 --> 02:18:10.940
very upset. He was defending. Yes. These defending white nationalists. No,

2359
02:18:11.250 --> 02:18:14.050
it's a fucking cartoon frog guys. And it's not only that,

2360
02:18:14.051 --> 02:18:18.250
it's a cartoon frog written by a guy who specifically sued people to get them to

2361
02:18:18.251 --> 02:18:20.170
stop using the cartoon flag.

2362
02:18:21.220 --> 02:18:26.220
Even Alex Jones had a pay out of lawsuit because Info wars used an image of that

2363
02:18:27.041 --> 02:18:29.650
cartoon flat. Can you see if that's true? I'm pretty sure that's true.

2364
02:18:29.880 --> 02:18:33.840
I put it was a nominal amount. It was like he lost it in corporate.

2365
02:18:33.850 --> 02:18:38.350
It was like a very small $15,000 to pay for Alex.

2366
02:18:38.351 --> 02:18:40.420
That's not a lot of money settlement. It's a settlement.

2367
02:18:40.570 --> 02:18:45.460
So I'm sure he paid way more in legal fees to deal with something like that.

2368
02:18:45.460 --> 02:18:49.930
I'm sure they had to put together some sort of a defense for $15,000 I'm sure

2369
02:18:49.931 --> 02:18:51.280
that probably cost a shit load of money.

2370
02:18:51.430 --> 02:18:55.420
But the point is that this frog has like all these different meanings.

2371
02:18:55.870 --> 02:18:59.050
So as soon as it gets connected though to an awful thing,

2372
02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:01.990
then immediately like you got to go, okay,

2373
02:19:01.991 --> 02:19:04.870
well you can never use that frog again. Right now. The frogs corrupted.

2374
02:19:05.230 --> 02:19:08.950
Now given what we know and here's where it gets really weird,

2375
02:19:09.370 --> 02:19:14.370
given what we know about the Internet and specifically foreign influence on

2376
02:19:15.970 --> 02:19:17.950
memes like Russia,

2377
02:19:18.670 --> 02:19:23.670
there was factories that were making funny memes about Hillary Clinton,

2378
02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:29.160
funny memes about all kinds of things and doing so in order to get people upset

2379
02:19:30.350 --> 02:19:35.350
or to laugh or to mock mock certain ideas and and push the narrative one way or

2380
02:19:36.891 --> 02:19:39.350
another through humor. And they made some really funny ones.

2381
02:19:39.350 --> 02:19:41.750
There's a woman named Renee de Resta. She came on the podcast,

2382
02:19:41.751 --> 02:19:43.400
was explaining shit for a project.

2383
02:19:43.401 --> 02:19:46.100
She had to go through hundreds of thousands of these things. She's like,

2384
02:19:46.101 --> 02:19:49.310
some of them were really funny and these were ones that they know are made by

2385
02:19:49.311 --> 02:19:53.070
Russians, were made to try to get people upset about certain things because she,

2386
02:19:53.130 --> 02:19:58.030
how many of those pepe the frog things came from came from that, right?

2387
02:19:58.400 --> 02:19:59.630
How many, because if you,

2388
02:19:59.631 --> 02:20:04.631
if you had a frog that was mocking everybody and the frog like was a really good

2389
02:20:05.811 --> 02:20:08.210
symbol to make someone think that you're a fool.

2390
02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:11.720
So like you say something ridiculous and you're trying to push for something and

2391
02:20:11.721 --> 02:20:14.900
then that frog is a meme with you, what you're saying,

2392
02:20:14.901 --> 02:20:15.920
but he looks like an idiot.

2393
02:20:16.310 --> 02:20:19.130
All of a sudden you look like an idiot and the frogs mocking you.

2394
02:20:19.330 --> 02:20:22.760
Like you can't beat the frog. Right? But you can turn the frog into a Nazi.

2395
02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:24.520
So then when you turn the frog into a Nazi,

2396
02:20:24.540 --> 02:20:29.330
anybody uses the frog is now a nutsy [inaudible] so he got caught up in this.

2397
02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:33.230
Yeah, he took a photo with these guys and he's talked about pepe the frog.

2398
02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:35.360
I'm on my podcast,

2399
02:20:35.420 --> 02:20:39.440
I talked about and explained the whole thing to me depth.

2400
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:45.070
And yet I've seen articles connecting him to white nationalists because there's

2401
02:20:45.231 --> 02:20:46.670
a photo of him with the frog.

2402
02:20:46.910 --> 02:20:51.910
She's Louie pull up photo of Jordan Peterson with pepe the frog cause he took a

2403
02:20:52.191 --> 02:20:57.191
photo with these guys where they had like a f a frog flag and he thought it as

2404
02:20:58.041 --> 02:21:00.830
what we're just saying that cause these guys that are taking the Piss,

2405
02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:05.240
it's like a flat Stanley or something sack. Right. It's like thinking innocent.

2406
02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:10.360
A man's Internet version of Flat Stanley and it's primarily a four Chan thing,

2407
02:21:10.910 --> 02:21:13.850
right? Is that really, Jamie knows this shit more than I do honestly.

2408
02:21:14.250 --> 02:21:18.020
There he is. So see he's standing there with these guys.

2409
02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:22.220
Those two fellows are holding up this pepe, the frog flag.

2410
02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:25.520
Jordan's laughing and smiling with them and one of them has a,

2411
02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:28.690
I think it's a make America great again hat on. Look,

2412
02:21:28.760 --> 02:21:32.390
these kids are human trolls. They're alive.

2413
02:21:33.220 --> 02:21:37.400
Troll on the Internet and then think of one that thinks it's hilarious to be out

2414
02:21:37.401 --> 02:21:41.990
there in public trolling with pepe the frog flag and make America great again

2415
02:21:41.991 --> 02:21:45.680
hat. Oh my God, he's fucking with people. This is what this is.

2416
02:21:45.890 --> 02:21:49.190
This is why obviously it's a lot of what internet culture trapped.

2417
02:21:49.450 --> 02:21:53.960
So he Jordan understands this and talks about it and discusses it in length and

2418
02:21:53.961 --> 02:21:55.510
he makes it make sense. Right?

2419
02:21:55.940 --> 02:22:00.940
So that's one other reason why people were upset at him and it's just very easy

2420
02:22:01.551 --> 02:22:03.410
to label people in certain ways.

2421
02:22:03.411 --> 02:22:07.490
Today it's very easy to label someone as a massage dentist. Right? There's no,

2422
02:22:07.491 --> 02:22:10.040
I know. If you listen to the breadth of his work, yeah.

2423
02:22:10.041 --> 02:22:13.460
This is not a bad person. He's a very good person. Very enlightening.

2424
02:22:13.461 --> 02:22:17.930
Like there's a lot of like real practical ways to,

2425
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:20.990
you know, as he says, clean up your room and live right.

2426
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:26.090
A personal friend of mine, I like him very much. Obviously you,

2427
02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:30.060
<v 1>you, you, you, uh, how do you, how do you say you, you,</v>

2428
02:22:30.330 --> 02:22:34.700
you think about these things you're trying to, you're trying to,

2429
02:22:34.900 --> 02:22:38.820
to Ah, you know, when you're trying to have a conversation,

2430
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:42.900
it shows how actually articulate he is because you can't come up with things and

2431
02:22:42.901 --> 02:22:46.530
he would say that makes sense. Well, I know it's hard, right?

2432
02:22:46.650 --> 02:22:49.490
There's no catch phrase for him. Yeah, obviously.

2433
02:22:50.050 --> 02:22:54.810
But clean up your damn room. Clean up your damn room. Let's see.

2434
02:22:55.710 --> 02:23:00.390
He's got a lot of great advice and he's also a very, very insightful person.

2435
02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:04.190
What about all of his on a bad guy at all? Now he's just,

2436
02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:08.160
people have this horrible thing that they do today where and when they want to

2437
02:23:08.161 --> 02:23:10.860
dismiss someone instead of, instead of listening to them,

2438
02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:15.930
they're listening to them and debating the points that they have or analyzing

2439
02:23:15.931 --> 02:23:18.900
them in a, an objective kind way. They try to attack.

2440
02:23:18.901 --> 02:23:21.900
Everybody's attacking everyone. Everything sucks. Everybody sucks.

2441
02:23:21.901 --> 02:23:24.360
Everybody's stupid. Everybody's racist. Everybody's dumb.

2442
02:23:24.690 --> 02:23:28.760
Everybody's ridiculous. Everybody's a liar. Everybody, everybody's,

2443
02:23:28.770 --> 02:23:31.080
you're not on my team. You're on someone else's team.

2444
02:23:31.140 --> 02:23:33.730
There's just so much of that today. There's so much.

2445
02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:38.600
<v 3>So yeah, I really enjoy listening to him. I enjoy all those, um, those biblical,</v>

2446
02:23:39.450 --> 02:23:44.180
uh, speeches that he gives about trying to interpret the old testament and stuff

2447
02:23:44.181 --> 02:23:47.810
like that. It's a, it's, it's very, very interesting. It's very,

2448
02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:51.200
I've never heard somebody connect our practical,

2449
02:23:51.350 --> 02:23:55.040
trying to find our way through the woods to those writings.

2450
02:23:55.130 --> 02:23:58.760
Like you always just heard of it is growing up as a Catholic kid,

2451
02:23:59.150 --> 02:24:01.910
you can just kinda heard them as like their stories and their obviously,

2452
02:24:01.970 --> 02:24:03.470
you know, they're metaphors and whatever,

2453
02:24:03.471 --> 02:24:07.070
but I never heard somebody really say no, it's B.

2454
02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:09.530
It's how you treat your father and now the wait,

2455
02:24:09.531 --> 02:24:12.710
you're trying to figure out your way through life.

2456
02:24:12.711 --> 02:24:15.470
That's what these things mean. Like, you know, yeah. He is a,

2457
02:24:15.730 --> 02:24:17.570
it's a very fascinating listen.

2458
02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:21.640
<v 1>Yeah. He's got a very unusual way of um,</v>

2459
02:24:22.180 --> 02:24:26.890
interpreting biblical verses and stories from the Bible stories from, you know,

2460
02:24:26.891 --> 02:24:27.970
other religions as well,

2461
02:24:27.971 --> 02:24:32.971
where he's explaining like what and how it sort of interfaces with man's search

2462
02:24:33.251 --> 02:24:34.040
for meaning.

2463
02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:36.440
<v 3>Right? Yeah, yeah, exactly. It's like,</v>

2464
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:41.270
like a practical way to kind of, you know, approach the world.

2465
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:45.350
She'd gotten to two in a time when we have nothing to hang on to.

2466
02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:47.660
It's kind of interesting stuff to think about.

2467
02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:47.971
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2468
02:24:47.971 --> 02:24:50.880
And that's one of the reasons why some people think that it's survived as long

2469
02:24:50.881 --> 02:24:54.140
as it has, that there is some merit in using it as a,

2470
02:24:54.270 --> 02:24:56.190
like a framework for living your life.

2471
02:24:56.320 --> 02:24:58.360
<v 3>Yeah. You know, there's like some Prac,</v>

2472
02:24:58.390 --> 02:25:02.170
like we were saying earlier of having some kind of a guidebook, you know,

2473
02:25:02.171 --> 02:25:05.680
to get you through life, like even just in the etiquette manner stuff. So,

2474
02:25:05.860 --> 02:25:10.420
so the big stuff, it's like, you know, I had a friend who's, um,

2475
02:25:10.900 --> 02:25:13.450
who's a father passed away and it's like,

2476
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:15.910
it's a hard thing when you don't have a framework,

2477
02:25:15.911 --> 02:25:19.360
a guidebook to help you deal with that and get through the woods and you just

2478
02:25:19.361 --> 02:25:24.110
kind of out there on your own. It's just difficult in heaven. Right. You know,

2479
02:25:24.210 --> 02:25:27.400
and I watching my, watching my grandparents, my,

2480
02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:32.460
my two grandmothers who went to church all the time and they didn't muddy

2481
02:25:32.591 --> 02:25:36.490
themselves with whether or not this was, you know, the, the answer,

2482
02:25:36.730 --> 02:25:40.420
but it gave them structure and it gave them, okay.

2483
02:25:40.421 --> 02:25:43.900
So the neighbor died and we go to the church and we go to the wake and we go to

2484
02:25:43.901 --> 02:25:48.650
the thing and then we have cake. And then we sit and, and pay visit to,

2485
02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:53.050
to his widower, uh, to the widow, you know, the next week.

2486
02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:55.150
Like these things, these roots,

2487
02:25:55.151 --> 02:25:59.760
these pathways made them very happy people. It, yeah.

2488
02:25:59.830 --> 02:26:02.740
It wasn't like kind of overthinking well, is the church bullshit?

2489
02:26:02.770 --> 02:26:06.910
They didn't care about that. They didn't get into. Maybe it is, maybe it's not.

2490
02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:11.560
Is it that, is it all the answers? They didn't get that far. They just got,

2491
02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:16.480
this is how you deal with this funeral of your neighbor. You know what I mean?

2492
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:19.750
There's like that practical little guidebook stuff that,

2493
02:26:20.570 --> 02:26:24.600
<v 1>uh, we kind of lack right now. Like Wild West Christianity, right?</v>

2494
02:26:24.990 --> 02:26:28.560
One of the things about wild west films, maybe it's accurate, maybe it's not,

2495
02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:32.220
but one of the things that I always enjoyed is simplistic way that they

2496
02:26:32.221 --> 02:26:35.280
interface with the world. The way they discuss the way things are. Well,

2497
02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:37.140
I guess we're just gonna have to go do that.

2498
02:26:37.210 --> 02:26:41.850
Then there wasn't a lot of Hammond in Hawn and everybody just got stuff done.

2499
02:26:42.210 --> 02:26:46.290
And they had that sort of pioneer mentality, right?

2500
02:26:46.350 --> 02:26:47.910
Like they were rough folks.

2501
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:51.870
So if they were talking about Jesus and what Jesus would a good God fearing

2502
02:26:51.871 --> 02:26:52.704
Christian would do,

2503
02:26:52.830 --> 02:26:56.250
they had a very clear and distinct framework for where they would operate.

2504
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:59.640
You know? And like they played by Christian rules. Yeah. I'm a good Christian,

2505
02:26:59.850 --> 02:27:02.190
so this is how I feel. And like you'd be like, wow,

2506
02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:05.130
there's simplicity and ruggedness of this Guy's vision.

2507
02:27:05.210 --> 02:27:09.830
<v 3>Yeah. Yeah. And then, you know, is it corrupted by people? Yeah.</v>

2508
02:27:09.831 --> 02:27:13.880
Is it, you know, going, do they use that to go attack some native Americans?

2509
02:27:13.970 --> 02:27:15.680
What's hotter? You know what I mean?

2510
02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:18.340
<v 1>A pioneer woman who's hot,</v>

2511
02:27:18.850 --> 02:27:23.530
who like a pioneer type woman who's actually hot,

2512
02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:26.890
who can like do chores and Shit and works hard. You know what I mean?

2513
02:27:26.891 --> 02:27:30.100
Like she survived and like you're out there, both of you clawing and scratching.

2514
02:27:30.130 --> 02:27:34.120
She's hot as fuck. Oh, hot as fuck. But yet a pioneer woman.

2515
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:38.260
Something sexy as fuck about that. Right. It's a good one. Yeah.

2516
02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:41.740
That's a good one. And they had those big fluffy things.

2517
02:27:41.741 --> 02:27:45.070
They were in their legs under the dresses. Yeah. Like fucking

2518
02:27:46.570 --> 02:27:48.790
robbers or trying to take over the wagon shooting at them.

2519
02:27:50.930 --> 02:27:54.910
The masks on the first season of Westworld. Yeah, like that girl.

2520
02:27:54.940 --> 02:27:58.330
I got you Paul. That's right. That girl from Westworld hot as fuck.

2521
02:27:58.660 --> 02:28:02.200
She's so hot. There she is. God Damn Dude. That's the perfect world.

2522
02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:07.780
That's the perfect woman. A really, really hot, Bad-ass Western chick.

2523
02:28:07.781 --> 02:28:09.970
What does that woman's name again? She's really good too.

2524
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.960
I don't think that she, whatever her name is as an actress.

2525
02:28:13.961 --> 02:28:17.620
What's her name is an actress chick. Would she like an an La comedian though?

2526
02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:23.600
Um, what's that? Would she like an la comedian? She wants some, only a Baldwin.

2527
02:28:23.601 --> 02:28:27.800
Who makes bread? Evan. Evan. Rachel Wood. She's hot.

2528
02:28:28.250 --> 02:28:32.510
She's not just hot. She's a really good actor. Yeah, really good.

2529
02:28:32.511 --> 02:28:34.910
Like you believe she's a struggling robot.

2530
02:28:34.911 --> 02:28:36.890
Trying to figure out if she's real or not,

2531
02:28:36.891 --> 02:28:39.800
and trying to figure out what these memories that she has are.

2532
02:28:39.890 --> 02:28:43.300
But she's also hot as the sun. Wu is

2533
02:28:45.050 --> 02:28:49.490
beautiful. She's a very specific kind of beautiful, like an uncorrupted beauty.

2534
02:28:49.700 --> 02:28:52.430
Right? She ain't like a Ho. Right.

2535
02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:56.990
She's not out there with like [inaudible] ass sticking out like washing a car.

2536
02:28:57.050 --> 02:29:01.670
She's high dignity. Well, she's a robot.

2537
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:05.720
She's a robot, but don't show that one. That's not a good picture of her.

2538
02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:07.530
Get one of her, which is a

2539
02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:14.300
very personal relationship with your mouth, Bro. She's my hot robot friend.

2540
02:29:17.010 --> 02:29:20.840
Robot. If robots were that close to people,

2541
02:29:21.200 --> 02:29:23.510
like if you could actually make love to a robot,

2542
02:29:24.650 --> 02:29:26.210
that Westworld concept,

2543
02:29:26.211 --> 02:29:29.840
the freakiest part of that is that they fuck these things and kill these things.

2544
02:29:30.250 --> 02:29:32.990
It's not that these things become sentient and they realize it and they try to

2545
02:29:32.991 --> 02:29:37.670
escape the parks by. Do they feel like they've got skin like Kim or Simpson?

2546
02:29:37.760 --> 02:29:41.330
You can distinguish. They don't even know sometimes if their robots,

2547
02:29:41.390 --> 02:29:44.090
how about that? That's how good it is. That's pretty great.

2548
02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:47.570
I think that have sex with a robot. Fuck yeah, you would. Yeah.

2549
02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:50.300
He'd probably have sex with a balloon. I was going to say there's not much.

2550
02:29:50.301 --> 02:29:52.370
I wouldn't probably accept a lot of stuff.

2551
02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:58.280
It's just a matter of like what if someone said, don't have sex with this thing.

2552
02:29:58.281 --> 02:30:01.640
Your whole family dies. You'd have sex with it when someone says, oh,

2553
02:30:01.641 --> 02:30:06.440
I would never fuck a pineapple. Yes you would if your life depended on it.

2554
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:08.070
Someone had a gun in your fucking head,

2555
02:30:08.720 --> 02:30:12.110
you fucked that pineapple or I'm going to kill your dog. Fine.

2556
02:30:12.200 --> 02:30:15.350
You'll fuck the pineapple. You have to just reach a breaking point, please.

2557
02:30:15.530 --> 02:30:19.160
Yeah, I do it again. So have you been,

2558
02:30:19.250 --> 02:30:21.980
have you paid attention as Jeffrey Epstein's tough. Yeah,

2559
02:30:21.981 --> 02:30:26.440
a little bit way things going on. I think a, Ah,

2560
02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:30.200
I think he, uh, if you had to guess,

2561
02:30:30.470 --> 02:30:34.520
I think the too many very powerful people, he had stuff on too many.

2562
02:30:34.521 --> 02:30:38.870
Very powerful people. Likely, right? Probably, yeah. Yeah.

2563
02:30:38.871 --> 02:30:41.870
They took the guy off suicide watch even though he's one of the most important

2564
02:30:41.871 --> 02:30:43.580
witnesses. Yeah. Weird.

2565
02:30:43.650 --> 02:30:48.650
A really creepy high profile case that might have connected a bunch of really

2566
02:30:49.821 --> 02:30:52.820
powerful people. This is, don't, I'm not, I don't,

2567
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:56.570
I don't necessarily believe that it's, you know,

2568
02:30:56.750 --> 02:31:00.320
the people from like it's Trump or it's the democrat.

2569
02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:04.110
I think there's other very powerful people that would've wanted this guy to go

2570
02:31:04.290 --> 02:31:05.270
out for sure. You know what I mean?

2571
02:31:05.271 --> 02:31:08.270
No idea how many very powerful people wants to got to go away. He could sing,

2572
02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:11.720
right? He could sing for his freedom. My question is, is there,

2573
02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:15.620
didn't they give like a whole bunch of evidence and stuff from him that like

2574
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:19.170
these powerful people would have? Oh yeah, yeah. Where's all that stuff? Yeah.

2575
02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:20.033
Yeah. You said

2576
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:22.980
<v 4>he didn't know that he had a cellmate. This is the guy that was a cellmate.</v>

2577
02:31:23.580 --> 02:31:27.480
Well, what? How hard do you think that guy fucked him? Former cop,

2578
02:31:27.900 --> 02:31:31.020
Jeffrey Epstein reported he wasn't checked on for hours before his appearance

2579
02:31:31.021 --> 02:31:33.710
suicide, that that guy found him there. Like cab ID.

2580
02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:36.990
We think that that guy didn't kill him. They left a rope in there.

2581
02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:38.850
That guy could definitely kill him without leaving.

2582
02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:42.330
That guy looks like he could do some damp look at the guy's arms.

2583
02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:47.340
That guy could just wrap Jeffrey Epstein up in a bear hug and hang him himself.

2584
02:31:47.520 --> 02:31:49.140
Maybe he just choked him. Yeah,

2585
02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:53.220
I mean he could put that noose around Epstein's neck and then squeeze his arms

2586
02:31:53.221 --> 02:31:56.340
together and just pull on it until the guy hangs to death and then go home.

2587
02:31:56.341 --> 02:32:01.160
I got a phone, I'm hugged. How did that guy's jacked? It's huge.

2588
02:32:01.320 --> 02:32:05.550
Imagine you go to jail and high profile case and they throw you in there with a

2589
02:32:05.551 --> 02:32:09.620
giant bald guy, but it's like gross burger pictures. I'm stir crazy.

2590
02:32:09.740 --> 02:32:12.540
But look at this. This is like caricature of the guy.

2591
02:32:12.541 --> 02:32:15.090
You don't want to be stuck at [inaudible]. Exactly.

2592
02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:18.150
Literally is the guy in the bad movie. That's the guy you're waiting for.

2593
02:32:18.151 --> 02:32:22.170
You in the cell. Next Cop. Yeah. He looks like, what is his name?

2594
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:25.590
Would he go to jail for it? Look at his name.

2595
02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:32.790
Cause West Chester county charge color's start Taglio the deaths of four men

2596
02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:36.450
stepping from an alleged cocaine drug conspiracy and bro,

2597
02:32:36.451 --> 02:32:38.340
he's that big and he's 51.

2598
02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:42.300
How many cops are smuggling steroids in their asshole to get to get to this guy?

2599
02:32:43.170 --> 02:32:46.460
How is he staying in that baby? So how he hung himself. So,

2600
02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:49.590
so they had like a belt or a rope left in there with him.

2601
02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:52.500
This guy probably said, listen, if you keep good and we need the Jewish,

2602
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:57.470
I'll keep this fucking guy on ice. Right? They didn't. Uh,

2603
02:32:57.540 --> 02:32:59.820
they said this is the one conspiracy secrets.

2604
02:32:59.821 --> 02:33:04.821
This is the one conspiracy where no body believes the true store that I've

2605
02:33:05.731 --> 02:33:10.170
talked to. No, nobody except Michael Shermer who?

2606
02:33:10.200 --> 02:33:13.500
Michael Shermer, the guy runs skeptics magazines, friend of mines. Nice guy.

2607
02:33:13.890 --> 02:33:15.540
I couldn't disagree with him more.

2608
02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:20.490
He thinks that things just happen and people kill themselves. Oh, he,

2609
02:33:20.491 --> 02:33:23.670
that's his take. This guy's a concern. He likes a lot of conspiracy. No, no.

2610
02:33:23.671 --> 02:33:27.640
He silences conspiracy conspiracy. He likes. Oh,

2611
02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:32.820
it doesn't like any conspiracy. Oh, okay. And this one is almost predictable.

2612
02:33:33.210 --> 02:33:35.490
He's right. And we still like, no, he's right in a way.

2613
02:33:35.491 --> 02:33:38.370
And I think his concept is pull up his tweets so we can read what he's saying.

2614
02:33:38.490 --> 02:33:40.170
I mean, you're not in a good place.

2615
02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:43.170
You could see wanting to kill yourself for sure. You know,

2616
02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:46.730
make that a larger please. I don't know where he like he started it, but just,

2617
02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:50.310
just make it larger. It just seemed just like no scroll.

2618
02:33:50.350 --> 02:33:52.320
Scroll down a little bit there. Okay.

2619
02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:55.290
A new conspiracy theory development and upstanding regarding suicide.

2620
02:33:55.350 --> 02:33:59.940
They made it happen on purpose. This is for a sledding. Here it is. Here it is.

2621
02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:03.750
Scroll down. If some no name, pedophile dob by suicide in prison awaiting trial.

2622
02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:05.370
Anyone would anyone bother?

2623
02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:08.880
Concocting conspiracy theories about him being murdered,

2624
02:34:08.910 --> 02:34:13.590
murdered by clan to Stein, outside forces. Of course not as with JFK,

2625
02:34:14.220 --> 02:34:18.490
Diana, Maryland at all. Fame warps perspective in fuels.

2626
02:34:18.550 --> 02:34:22.930
<v 1>Unwarranted speculation. First of all, [inaudible]. This is not unwarranted.</v>

2627
02:34:23.290 --> 02:34:26.410
Second of all, if you don't think that powerful people have people killed,

2628
02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:30.700
your hilarious like that is willfully naive.

2629
02:34:31.490 --> 02:34:33.040
Yeah, they do do it says,

2630
02:34:33.041 --> 02:34:37.810
remember the adage regarding conspiracy theories never attribute to malice what

2631
02:34:37.811 --> 02:34:42.350
can be explained by incompetence or chance. True? Sure,

2632
02:34:42.370 --> 02:34:46.000
you shouldn't do that. It is possible, but what? What are the odds?

2633
02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:48.790
There's something. There's, this is something intriguing,

2634
02:34:48.791 --> 02:34:53.320
stinks so bad because he's in so many circles and touched so many super powerful

2635
02:34:53.321 --> 02:34:56.510
people. It's different powerful people. It's,

2636
02:34:56.590 --> 02:34:59.050
he's not just a pedophile like this. He keeps saying,

2637
02:34:59.110 --> 02:35:04.110
gave him a $70 million house in New York City,

2638
02:35:04.270 --> 02:35:07.000
gave him, give him one of his clients, gave he signed.

2639
02:35:07.030 --> 02:35:10.150
He was the power of attorney at the time. So he signed it over to himself.

2640
02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:12.130
But the guy let him do that.

2641
02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:16.660
That's the question is whether or not he knew it was happening. Oh, come on.

2642
02:35:16.661 --> 02:35:19.270
Like he just stole the house from the guy who's in control of a lot of stuff.

2643
02:35:19.271 --> 02:35:22.380
That's where it was coming out now. [inaudible] 70 games coming.

2644
02:35:22.570 --> 02:35:25.750
That's what's coming out right now. How would the guy who he signed it off on,

2645
02:35:25.751 --> 02:35:28.360
how would the guy not know this guy stole his house and not sue him?

2646
02:35:28.361 --> 02:35:31.090
He was in control of all of his finances. Right. But the guy was,

2647
02:35:31.210 --> 02:35:35.200
he was living in the house. Who? The Guy Wexner no,

2648
02:35:35.470 --> 02:35:38.290
I've seen [inaudible]. He bought the house for him basically.

2649
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:42.420
That's what I'm saying. The Guy bought it for Epstein, right? Yeah,

2650
02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:45.880
but he who fucking buys you a $70 million? Hey, I don't know.

2651
02:35:45.970 --> 02:35:48.240
No one's bought me nothing. There's,

2652
02:35:48.430 --> 02:35:52.960
there's so many questions that this guy's about where his wealth was and then

2653
02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:54.580
the color of his house.

2654
02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:58.960
Didn't he own the eyeballs on the entrance and set the shit about the house?

2655
02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:01.870
That's crazy too. There's like cameras inside the house and Shit.

2656
02:36:01.871 --> 02:36:05.200
But the other thing was the house that's on the island that is the same color,

2657
02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:09.520
it's painted in the same way. These rarely flag is [inaudible] and this,

2658
02:36:09.521 --> 02:36:10.720
there was an idea,

2659
02:36:10.850 --> 02:36:14.710
people are wondering like how far this guy's influence goes and where it comes

2660
02:36:14.711 --> 02:36:17.260
from. And look at this house, Bro.

2661
02:36:17.320 --> 02:36:20.040
That was his house as his house on this fucking island island.

2662
02:36:20.110 --> 02:36:23.500
It's like a building there. That's a template here out on his island, Bro.

2663
02:36:23.501 --> 02:36:26.800
That's a dope dump. Oh, by the way, I think it looks awesome. Shay's,

2664
02:36:26.930 --> 02:36:30.220
I'd love that. If that was my house. Come on. God, how'd he get so much money?

2665
02:36:30.221 --> 02:36:34.000
Exactly. No one really knows. You have something to do with Victoria's secret.

2666
02:36:34.300 --> 02:36:39.180
Yeah. He um, he managed some money for the veterinary secrets guy. Correct?

2667
02:36:40.130 --> 02:36:43.150
He's the guy who gave him the house. Oh yeah. You know,

2668
02:36:43.151 --> 02:36:48.040
Bill Clinton flew on his private jet. No little son 26 times. Well, whatever.

2669
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:51.550
No big deal. He was hung out of our logo. Yeah. But I mean,

2670
02:36:51.580 --> 02:36:56.140
I flew with them six times. I've never flown with it.

2671
02:36:56.470 --> 02:36:59.380
It'd be have to be my very best friends that I tour with all the time.

2672
02:36:59.650 --> 02:37:04.420
Have I flown with you 26 times? Maybe four or five when I made me really ever.

2673
02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:07.320
Maybe if we flew together it might be a little more informed.

2674
02:37:07.350 --> 02:37:10.480
Five it might be 10 it might be 10 I mean I've known you for years.

2675
02:37:10.780 --> 02:37:15.320
It's not been 26 times. So Bill Clinton swollen with his one guy. Why?

2676
02:37:15.321 --> 02:37:18.490
He's the president of United States, I think. Was he still president then or no,

2677
02:37:18.550 --> 02:37:20.650
it was afterwards. We went afterwards. I'm done.

2678
02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:25.340
I flew with Jeremy Probably 20 times and I'm making money. I like fly,

2679
02:37:25.341 --> 02:37:26.750
whichever. I don't have to pay.

2680
02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:31.370
I mean that's a lot of times to be partying with a dude.

2681
02:37:31.430 --> 02:37:36.430
You would think that you would find out about how that guy fucks said that when

2682
02:37:36.531 --> 02:37:39.740
he hadn't planned on the plane was sort of when he fucked up because he was,

2683
02:37:39.741 --> 02:37:41.180
that's when he stopped flying under the radar.

2684
02:37:41.450 --> 02:37:43.280
Who did Jeffrey up to when I went that day?

2685
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:48.050
[inaudible] he's been like hiding ever since because that was like 2003 or four.

2686
02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:49.670
Oh really? That's when he got busted,

2687
02:37:49.671 --> 02:37:53.930
was shortly after that and he's been on the run since then. It wasn't a,

2688
02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:57.140
it wasn't Trump talking about it with Howard Howard Stern.

2689
02:37:57.170 --> 02:38:00.420
What was he talking about? Oh, about some young ladies? Yeah.

2690
02:38:00.620 --> 02:38:04.610
Like why were they talking about him? I don't know cause he was, uh,

2691
02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:08.810
I guess he was arrested or something. No, he was just in the news.

2692
02:38:08.810 --> 02:38:12.980
The arrest was later and that was part of the problem was that with the arrest,

2693
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:17.690
the arrest was for some sexual thing with underage girls and you got a really

2694
02:38:17.691 --> 02:38:20.270
light sentence and then you still have to, we're freaking out about.

2695
02:38:20.271 --> 02:38:22.460
And then one woman pursued this pretty heavily.

2696
02:38:22.461 --> 02:38:25.780
She was a journalist and she produced pursue this story. That's where I was,

2697
02:38:26.710 --> 02:38:29.780
I tried to find out the Miami Herald, but that book I was telling you,

2698
02:38:29.781 --> 02:38:31.100
I just read about James Patterson.

2699
02:38:31.101 --> 02:38:33.260
He said everything that kind of came out in that story,

2700
02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:37.700
they already wrote about about 2016 and for some reason the media didn't really

2701
02:38:37.701 --> 02:38:41.000
pick up on it. He said he wrote letters to everyone. Well, yeah, that was when,

2702
02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:44.450
that was when this guy got that really light sentence was around there.

2703
02:38:44.451 --> 02:38:47.950
But this one woman kept writing about it and this is one of the things,

2704
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:52.970
pull up the name of this woman because this one woman really doggedly pursued

2705
02:38:52.971 --> 02:38:55.280
this story is because of her.

2706
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:59.730
And I think a lot of it had to do with her recognition that this guy had gotten

2707
02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:04.490
this creepy lights on. Yeah. Not to be confused downtown Julie Brown,

2708
02:39:05.090 --> 02:39:09.140
never friendly yet. Julie K. Brown. She was great. Like Michael B. Jordan

2709
02:39:11.230 --> 02:39:13.280
doctor. Not the, not the world's greatest.

2710
02:39:13.281 --> 02:39:17.100
No one wants their name is even close to this story about James Brown,

2711
02:39:17.120 --> 02:39:21.080
the fucking sportscaster. Well, that guy. Nice guy.

2712
02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:24.710
James Brown sportscaster. Yeah. How the fuck do you call yourself James Brown,

2713
02:39:25.890 --> 02:39:30.440
dare you? Like he owns that, right? Oh yeah. Michael Jackson.

2714
02:39:30.470 --> 02:39:34.940
If you're Michael Jackson and you're a singer, yeah, you're right. Right.

2715
02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:39.140
Yeah. Don't you have anyone in your camp telling you this is a bad idea,

2716
02:39:39.200 --> 02:39:42.470
isn't there to have those cuts like a knife? Guys? What's that guy's name?

2717
02:39:42.500 --> 02:39:43.430
The guy from Canada?

2718
02:39:44.460 --> 02:39:46.300
<v 7>Nah, Nah, Nah, Nah. Nah.</v>

2719
02:39:47.700 --> 02:39:51.500
<v 1>Ryan. Ryan Adams. Brian Adams. There's Brian and there's Ryan. Ryan. Ryan. Yeah.</v>

2720
02:39:51.660 --> 02:39:54.870
I can't write your fucking name right. You got in trouble too.

2721
02:39:54.900 --> 02:39:59.350
How about Ricky Adams? He'd be Ricky Adams. Ricky Adams. Well,

2722
02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.730
whatever happened to Bryan Adams. Man, that cuts like a nice guy.

2723
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:07.920
That guy was awesome. Summer of 69 yeah. It's some great jams.

2724
02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:11.940
I think he's still playing casinos. Yeah, I really,

2725
02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:16.570
I've seen him in a tonight. Bristow, Virginia. They should,

2726
02:40:16.830 --> 02:40:19.950
I'll go to see him. We should make a road trip. He best. Yeah. Lube lie.

2727
02:40:19.970 --> 02:40:24.040
I'm sure it's a good show. We really have to start doing stuff like that. Yeah.

2728
02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:28.650
Road trips just to go to see ridiculous shows. Yeah. Dev Leopards out there.

2729
02:40:29.370 --> 02:40:32.430
Journeys out there. Did journey with the Japanese mayor. Yeah.

2730
02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:33.900
That's what that guy is. Bad Ass.

2731
02:40:36.930 --> 02:40:38.040
Fuck Steve Perry ever did in his prior.

2732
02:40:38.130 --> 02:40:41.910
I know some amazing Steve Perry still out there. I don't think he's performing,

2733
02:40:41.911 --> 02:40:46.320
but he's still around. What are you playing right now? Just try and crop. Wow.

2734
02:40:46.350 --> 02:40:50.430
Look at that line. Adams. That's all. Yeah. That was a star.

2735
02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:54.670
Post-Menopausal chimps at the summer of man.

2736
02:40:54.830 --> 02:40:57.780
What does he look like these days? I stretching here. He's working.

2737
02:40:58.140 --> 02:41:01.350
He's fucking that. He's ramps fit. Stretched out back.

2738
02:41:01.351 --> 02:41:05.730
He says Brian Adams. Yeah, Tim.

2739
02:41:06.010 --> 02:41:10.380
It's a weird black and white photos. He's got some snapchat filter on him too.

2740
02:41:10.650 --> 02:41:15.420
He's obviously a spiritually sound. He looks healthy working out. Well,

2741
02:41:15.421 --> 02:41:18.750
listen man, that guy was a, he was a rockstar when I was in high school.

2742
02:41:18.780 --> 02:41:21.960
That's right. And if he looks that good today, that's incredible.

2743
02:41:21.961 --> 02:41:25.350
He's taking care of himself. Must Be. Yeah. He's doing something right.

2744
02:41:25.620 --> 02:41:29.160
It's not running around after teenage girls live in a good life.

2745
02:41:29.161 --> 02:41:32.960
Floozies flying them or Bill Clinton's hook.

2746
02:41:34.890 --> 02:41:39.240
Absolutely. What are we doing today? Yeah, it's, yeah.

2747
02:41:39.270 --> 02:41:42.390
For conspiracy theorists right now, like for a Sam Tripoli,

2748
02:41:42.850 --> 02:41:47.770
you know Sam Tripoli Tin Foil Hat podcast man, who's going, oh God.

2749
02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:50.760
Couldn't be happier, but he's taken it to another level.

2750
02:41:50.970 --> 02:41:55.140
He thinks he's not really dead, that they faked his death. Ah, of course.

2751
02:41:57.720 --> 02:42:01.080
Jeez Louise. For conspiracy theory, conspiracy theory is obvious.

2752
02:42:01.230 --> 02:42:03.750
They look for the non obvious possible cause.

2753
02:42:03.751 --> 02:42:06.710
They do the exact opposite of what Michael Sherman was talking about.

2754
02:42:07.170 --> 02:42:10.770
[inaudible] theorists never attribute to mouse everything, right?

2755
02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:13.600
Everything is malice. All of it.

2756
02:42:14.910 --> 02:42:19.830
If it looks obvious, this is something more. It's so creepy.

2757
02:42:20.010 --> 02:42:24.690
God. Well got good. Who Cares how, what? It's good. He's gone.

2758
02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:29.040
Maybe not man. Maybe not. He's gone. Maybe not. Maybe if he stayed alive,

2759
02:42:29.041 --> 02:42:31.830
he could have told us some stuff about some terrible people that are still alive

2760
02:42:31.831 --> 02:42:36.110
doing things. He's the worst one. I don't know about that. He's a creepo.

2761
02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:39.660
How do we know that? We know he's a creep most likely. What?

2762
02:42:39.661 --> 02:42:43.020
We definitely don't know if he's the worst out of all those people that he was

2763
02:42:43.021 --> 02:42:45.720
creeping with. Yeah. The thing is,

2764
02:42:45.721 --> 02:42:48.990
if the guy really did film a bunch of people that are super powerful people

2765
02:42:48.991 --> 02:42:53.210
doing crazy shit, there's gotta be some stuff, right? Um,

2766
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:57.060
if I was leading the investigation, I'd go after the hard drives.

2767
02:42:57.850 --> 02:43:00.030
That's where they keep it all on the hard drive.

2768
02:43:00.140 --> 02:43:03.890
They did find hard drives filled with stuff that he had. They did, yeah.

2769
02:43:03.930 --> 02:43:07.350
That he had with the very young girls and suggestive poses.

2770
02:43:07.351 --> 02:43:09.720
And I don't know if it was pornography,

2771
02:43:09.721 --> 02:43:14.721
but they were talking how many different photos of young ladies around on this

2772
02:43:15.491 --> 02:43:17.770
computer. All right. Enough with this guy.

2773
02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:20.770
But I don't know if they were young like illegal or young, like 18.

2774
02:43:21.370 --> 02:43:25.060
You know there's something weird about when you watch some porn where they're

2775
02:43:25.061 --> 02:43:27.550
pretending to be schoolgirls, you know, like,

2776
02:43:27.551 --> 02:43:30.880
you know the girl's 30 but she's pretend they always put them in an outfit

2777
02:43:31.690 --> 02:43:34.900
that's, there's something weird about those porns like what is happening there?

2778
02:43:35.230 --> 02:43:39.640
No, exactly. One guy's a Milkman, the other guy, you know, and he's just

2779
02:43:39.970 --> 02:43:44.830
<v 3>comes over. I must, you bring up my fetish Milkman porn. He knocks on the door.</v>

2780
02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:47.890
Girl answers. She's got pink tails.

2781
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:53.450
<v 1>My Dad's not home right now. Um, I guess, I guess you can come inside.</v>

2782
02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:55.970
Next thing you know, mom,

2783
02:43:58.130 --> 02:44:00.170
how about watching the baseball game? You know,

2784
02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:03.620
and another thing that's weird about porn, there's a lot of step sister,

2785
02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:05.030
step mother porn,

2786
02:44:05.620 --> 02:44:10.620
step mother stepmother and step-sister dude with his stepmother or dude with his

2787
02:44:12.140 --> 02:44:15.050
stepsister. Exactly like dad marry some new floozy.

2788
02:44:15.800 --> 02:44:18.590
Dad's off at work and the sun, Sun's like 19.

2789
02:44:18.591 --> 02:44:21.470
He wakes up and he's got a boner and next thing you know step-mom's sucking his

2790
02:44:21.800 --> 02:44:24.530
deck. Now those are fun,

2791
02:44:27.410 --> 02:44:28.610
but it's very popular.

2792
02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:33.240
<v 3>Well, there's a, you know, that's human. Uh, sexuality. There's, you know,</v>

2793
02:44:33.241 --> 02:44:34.650
everybody has something they're into.

2794
02:44:34.651 --> 02:44:36.420
So I guess they make a movie for all of it.

2795
02:44:36.520 --> 02:44:41.140
<v 1>Yes. But also they're always looking for a new forbidden thing.</v>

2796
02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:43.540
So some regular porn is not forbidding enough.

2797
02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:47.350
It's not just two people that are hot that are getting it on. No, no, no, no.

2798
02:44:47.380 --> 02:44:49.840
It's gotta be something that shouldn't be doing. Oh my God,

2799
02:44:49.841 --> 02:44:53.040
we shouldn't be doing this. Right. That's a thrill for a lot of people. Right.

2800
02:44:53.050 --> 02:44:56.020
They feel sexually suppressed. So when they watch porn, like, oh my God,

2801
02:44:56.100 --> 02:44:59.170
it's a step mom. She going to do it. She got to take a picture of her.

2802
02:44:59.290 --> 02:45:02.440
So it's right. So it's like forbidden. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2803
02:45:02.590 --> 02:45:06.730
Like you with the Westworld thing. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

2804
02:45:06.731 --> 02:45:08.350
that's the thing with people, right? They like,

2805
02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:13.030
especially when people get told what to do too much when they're young and then

2806
02:45:13.570 --> 02:45:17.530
develop this desire to do forbidden things, to be rebellious,

2807
02:45:17.610 --> 02:45:21.570
<v 3>right? Yeah. I mean,</v>

2808
02:45:22.380 --> 02:45:25.290
yeah, but it's all important.

2809
02:45:25.650 --> 02:45:28.190
<v 1>Pushing the envelope thing too, right? You get bored. People,</v>

2810
02:45:28.191 --> 02:45:32.630
if people like outrageous things and does outrageous things are not outrageous

2811
02:45:32.631 --> 02:45:34.930
enough anymore than they get more outrageous somehow or another.

2812
02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:39.280
<v 3>Right. That's right. That's why he shouldn't go down the path. Right.</v>

2813
02:45:40.370 --> 02:45:41.061
You should start.

2814
02:45:41.061 --> 02:45:45.590
That's why you're healthier working out like crazy or being obsessed with cars

2815
02:45:45.591 --> 02:45:49.400
or being obsessed with sports. It's like it's,

2816
02:45:49.730 --> 02:45:53.450
you want to get more and more extreme with it. What you're dealing with tires.

2817
02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:57.440
You're not dealing with human beings that are being trafficked through Florida

2818
02:45:57.710 --> 02:46:01.190
with the idea that they might have some fame. You know what I mean?

2819
02:46:01.250 --> 02:46:05.750
That'd be Florida. That's where it all happens. Right? All bad things were,

2820
02:46:05.751 --> 02:46:06.710
was that Epstein Guy,

2821
02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:09.950
<v 1>Florida? Yeah. Mar-A-Lago Florida. You</v>

2822
02:46:10.250 --> 02:46:13.970
<v 0>ever see Rashida Jones, his documentary on porn? No.</v>

2823
02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:17.630
It's pretty a devastating. Who's Rashida Jones again?

2824
02:46:18.230 --> 02:46:22.910
She was Quincy Jones daughter. She was on the, um, she's very funny, talented.

2825
02:46:22.911 --> 02:46:24.170
She was in, um,

2826
02:46:24.710 --> 02:46:29.710
parks and rec and the office and she made a documentary on just like all these

2827
02:46:30.291 --> 02:46:34.850
young girls that especially now with social media and wanting to be liked and

2828
02:46:34.851 --> 02:46:35.600
wanting to,

2829
02:46:35.600 --> 02:46:39.230
having all these promises of fame and that what you think is amateur porn and is

2830
02:46:39.231 --> 02:46:40.064
harmless.

2831
02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:45.520
There's really a very high percentage of these people are being exploited and

2832
02:46:46.490 --> 02:46:49.100
uh, yeah, it will make you look at porn very differently.

2833
02:46:49.490 --> 02:46:50.900
I'm sure I recommend it,

2834
02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:55.850
but is there any kind of acceptable porn? Yeah.

2835
02:46:55.940 --> 02:47:00.550
Like what if it's like 35 year old ladies that are just freaks or freaks just

2836
02:47:00.700 --> 02:47:02.240
they just wanna fuck on camera. They get,

2837
02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:05.300
they get a thrill out of people watching them. Fuck. Is that possible?

2838
02:47:05.810 --> 02:47:08.660
I don't know if it's possible. What happened? Question. Right. But yeah,

2839
02:47:08.940 --> 02:47:12.530
that is, yeah. Questions. You always worry if, but do you,

2840
02:47:12.531 --> 02:47:13.520
what happened to them?

2841
02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.720
Put them in that mind space because we don't have a fear about men. Well,

2842
02:47:17.850 --> 02:47:21.440
could you worry about men who are 35 years old who are having sex with women on

2843
02:47:21.441 --> 02:47:25.220
camera does do those trouble? You know, I'm not,

2844
02:47:25.280 --> 02:47:27.550
I don't think about them at all. Concerned about them. Right?

2845
02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:31.970
So we're concerned about the women. Is that right? Wait for it.

2846
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:34.940
Because we're sexist. Are we,

2847
02:47:35.090 --> 02:47:39.650
are we putting standards on the females that we don't put on the males because

2848
02:47:39.651 --> 02:47:42.050
we don't think the women can handle it or that you don't,

2849
02:47:42.051 --> 02:47:43.610
we don't think they can make that choice.

2850
02:47:44.090 --> 02:47:45.980
We don't think that they should be allowed to make that choice.

2851
02:47:45.981 --> 02:47:47.000
Or if they do make that choice,

2852
02:47:47.001 --> 02:47:49.040
we think there has to be something wrong with them and they need to be

2853
02:47:49.041 --> 02:47:53.780
protected. Whereas we don't have those feelings about a man. I just know that.

2854
02:47:53.781 --> 02:47:58.610
So I think that when you're thinking about what leads you to that place,

2855
02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:03.760
there's a high probability that some man did something awful to that girl when

2856
02:48:04.580 --> 02:48:05.360
she was young.

2857
02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:10.360
And we don't think that such a high percentage of people that have had all women

2858
02:48:10.551 --> 02:48:14.360
have had to deal with some creepo at some point in their life. For sure.

2859
02:48:14.390 --> 02:48:18.320
And so I think it's built on that. It's like, well, you know,

2860
02:48:18.800 --> 02:48:22.370
I'd rather help her in some other way than watch these porn.

2861
02:48:22.371 --> 02:48:26.420
So is that something we inherently know and how do we know that?

2862
02:48:26.690 --> 02:48:30.830
Yeah. Yeah. Because men are big and aggressive and can do, no, no, no,

2863
02:48:30.831 --> 02:48:33.590
that's not what I'm saying. When you see someone that's in porn,

2864
02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:36.950
do we inherently know that they've been molested? Did we just know or do,

2865
02:48:37.250 --> 02:48:38.480
I mean we don't know,

2866
02:48:38.481 --> 02:48:43.481
but I think what have we investigated that like there is a high percentage of

2867
02:48:43.491 --> 02:48:46.820
women that do porn. This is a fact that have been sexually molested.

2868
02:48:47.060 --> 02:48:49.160
What I'm saying is your distaste for it,

2869
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:53.360
is it based on the knowledge of that or is this an inherent perception that a

2870
02:48:53.361 --> 02:48:56.300
woman who would do that must be damaged? So something must be,

2871
02:48:56.630 --> 02:49:00.050
must have had happened to her when she was younger. That was awful.

2872
02:49:00.110 --> 02:49:01.550
Otherwise she wouldn't be doing this. Well,

2873
02:49:01.551 --> 02:49:04.640
it's like going to a strip club and you know,

2874
02:49:04.700 --> 02:49:09.700
probably 80% of the guys are just seeing somebody dancing in 20% of the guys are

2875
02:49:10.981 --> 02:49:15.090
thinking, wait, you shouldn't be doing this. You know what I mean?

2876
02:49:15.091 --> 02:49:19.930
I don't think 20% it's trip clubs. I don't know. Maybe higher.

2877
02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:23.850
I just maybe like, um, you know what I mean? I don't think we,

2878
02:49:23.851 --> 02:49:27.390
I think we're able to, I'm sorry to cut you off, but I think we're, uh,

2879
02:49:27.750 --> 02:49:31.230
I think human beings are able to not see everything that they want to see

2880
02:49:31.231 --> 02:49:33.990
because they're enjoying what's before them. I think you're right. For sure.

2881
02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:38.070
We definitely make rationalizations, right? But I'm wondering like, why,

2882
02:49:38.071 --> 02:49:39.540
if it's a man, we don't have any,

2883
02:49:39.541 --> 02:49:43.140
I guess it's because we don't think of a man of being, you know,

2884
02:49:43.141 --> 02:49:47.490
if a guy is a a s an object of sexual desire for women,

2885
02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:49.920
we don't think of him as a victim ever. I know,

2886
02:49:49.921 --> 02:49:53.640
which is unfortunate because there are a lot of things happen to young boys,

2887
02:49:53.641 --> 02:49:57.750
you know? But did you hear about this guy two in Katy Perry, you about the song?

2888
02:49:57.780 --> 02:50:00.540
No, no. She says maybe she, he's not suing her,

2889
02:50:00.541 --> 02:50:03.450
but he's accusing her of sexual assault. What he's calling sexual assault.

2890
02:50:03.930 --> 02:50:08.910
She pulled down at sweatpants and expose his dick to some people. Right, right.

2891
02:50:08.911 --> 02:50:11.550
And then that knee jerk reaction is, well, you're a dude.

2892
02:50:11.590 --> 02:50:16.500
You would love Katy Perry pulling your pants off. That's right. And uh,

2893
02:50:16.501 --> 02:50:18.850
but maybe he was really hurt by it. Who knows?

2894
02:50:18.851 --> 02:50:22.410
He needs to grow up here and get that. I Love Katy Perry. Yeah.

2895
02:50:22.680 --> 02:50:27.450
The pucks the problem. She pulls her pants down, but he gets to see your Dick.

2896
02:50:27.810 --> 02:50:31.070
Even when I was a young boy, there wasn't like I was,

2897
02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:35.220
it sounds to me like Katy Perry's trying to fuck you.

2898
02:50:35.221 --> 02:50:37.710
Leave Katy Perry cause that we think she was doing now.

2899
02:50:37.711 --> 02:50:40.750
Sounds like she pants them for fun. Yeah.

2900
02:50:40.890 --> 02:50:43.230
That's what sounds like Lucy sweatpants. Now,

2901
02:50:43.260 --> 02:50:47.690
if that was a guy doing it to a girl, I would say that it's sexual assault. Yes.

2902
02:50:47.820 --> 02:50:49.080
Think of it very differently. I would too.

2903
02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:52.260
If a guy was there and a girl bent over in front of a bunch of guys to pick up

2904
02:50:52.350 --> 02:50:55.770
her keys and someone pants during her vagina was exposed to all these strangers.

2905
02:50:56.190 --> 02:50:57.510
I would say that guy's a piece of shit.

2906
02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:00.680
Like imagine if that was your daughter or your wife, right? Some,

2907
02:51:00.900 --> 02:51:04.680
some guy pulls your wife's fucking sweatpants down in front of a crew of people

2908
02:51:05.250 --> 02:51:08.460
because I think we see the men as a threat, as a physical threat,

2909
02:51:08.790 --> 02:51:13.590
but if Katie Perry does it to a guy, I'm like, Huh, yeah, I know.

2910
02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:16.650
Yeah, and you can the judge. I'm like,

2911
02:51:16.651 --> 02:51:19.650
get the fuck out of it without explaining it or coming up for reasons why that

2912
02:51:19.651 --> 02:51:22.590
is the knee jerk reaction. A woman got arrested in New Jersey.

2913
02:51:22.650 --> 02:51:25.350
She blew a 14 year old boy.

2914
02:51:25.650 --> 02:51:28.410
They gave her a 10 year,

2915
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:33.240
like a suspended sentence, so 10 years. She's on 10 year probation,

2916
02:51:33.570 --> 02:51:36.390
no jail time, and she keeps her teaching certificate.

2917
02:51:38.050 --> 02:51:41.690
Oh really? She was allowed to keep her certificate.

2918
02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:46.080
Stop blowing kids you crazy. Yet she probably blew the cop. Blew the judge.

2919
02:51:46.770 --> 02:51:47.490
God.

2920
02:51:47.490 --> 02:51:50.880
That's my thought on that always is if a woman's willing to blow a 14 year old,

2921
02:51:51.330 --> 02:51:54.540
she'll blow you two girls fucking crazy.

2922
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:58.800
She's just love sucking Dick. She's, Oh my God, she,

2923
02:51:58.820 --> 02:52:02.010
you could talk her into it. It's all, and she's gotten standards. I mean,

2924
02:52:02.011 --> 02:52:06.650
I think every cop that the rest of 14 a lady blows 14 year every cop thing.

2925
02:52:06.651 --> 02:52:10.420
She'll suck his dick too, right? Don't you think they're crazy,

2926
02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:15.550
crazy woman? Yeah. Well, you don't think so. Do I think she's crazy?

2927
02:52:15.551 --> 02:52:19.720
Yes, for sure. But it's on a, so I think every crazy doesn't scare me.

2928
02:52:20.020 --> 02:52:21.700
Now there's something, you know, look, we all,

2929
02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:26.320
there's a lot of different ways to be damaged, right? And that's her damage.

2930
02:52:26.770 --> 02:52:29.380
But now what I'm saying is like, that's not hurting. What is she doing?

2931
02:52:29.381 --> 02:52:31.960
She's a grown adult. See how even you're looking at that,

2932
02:52:32.250 --> 02:52:33.400
there's a lot of different ways to be damaged.

2933
02:52:33.401 --> 02:52:36.250
But if that was a grown man having sex with a 14 year old girl,

2934
02:52:36.251 --> 02:52:38.410
you wouldn't worry about what fucking damage he has.

2935
02:52:38.710 --> 02:52:42.070
You'd be worrying about what damage he's doing. See, even in that situation,

2936
02:52:42.071 --> 02:52:43.750
you're worried about her being damaged.

2937
02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:47.460
I'm not worried about her being a damn man. But that's what you said. Your,

2938
02:52:47.720 --> 02:52:49.690
your, what you were thinking about was her being damaged,

2939
02:52:50.050 --> 02:52:53.830
not her victimizing the boy. Right.

2940
02:52:54.010 --> 02:52:57.280
Cause we don't think of it that way now. I know, I know, like right.

2941
02:52:57.310 --> 02:53:00.670
I mean when these stories started coming out when we were younger,

2942
02:53:00.820 --> 02:53:04.210
they've always existed. I know, but it, and it was, I always like, you know,

2943
02:53:04.211 --> 02:53:08.230
with your buddies it was like, oh I wish my Spanish teacher did that. You know,

2944
02:53:08.500 --> 02:53:10.600
there's been freaks throughout history. Yeah.

2945
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:14.950
Crazy women that blow boys from as long as time memorial. Yeah.

2946
02:53:14.951 --> 02:53:18.610
There was word time, memorial, you know, time, time in Memoriam.

2947
02:53:19.330 --> 02:53:23.140
Memoriam yeah. Sexuality is such a weird, bizarre thing.

2948
02:53:23.141 --> 02:53:26.800
That's why they have to make all these laws about it, you know, to keep some,

2949
02:53:26.830 --> 02:53:31.390
again, back to the guidebook, right. I was reading,

2950
02:53:32.110 --> 02:53:36.850
um, about a country, I think fuck. There was,

2951
02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:39.970
I want to say, is it cashmere? Google this,

2952
02:53:40.600 --> 02:53:45.600
that 20% of all marriages start with kidnapping.

2953
02:53:49.090 --> 02:53:52.540
Yes. 20% of marriages in this country, in that country,

2954
02:53:52.670 --> 02:53:57.670
there was a country where 20% of all marriages start to kidnap today,

2955
02:53:59.320 --> 02:53:59.950
and that's not,

2956
02:53:59.950 --> 02:54:03.940
not in the 12 hundreds not during the gang has caught administration.

2957
02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:06.700
Is it like prom? It's like no,

2958
02:54:06.730 --> 02:54:10.060
they just kidnapped women and then they're forced to marry their kidnappers so

2959
02:54:10.061 --> 02:54:13.150
they don't get shame. Oh Man. Google,

2960
02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:18.780
20% of all marriages begin with kidnapping.

2961
02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:23.540
Just Google that. Google that, that sent.

2962
02:54:23.740 --> 02:54:25.840
Not the weirdest thing that's ever been googled.

2963
02:54:25.900 --> 02:54:29.290
That's a fucking crazy statistic. If I remember it correctly,

2964
02:54:29.291 --> 02:54:32.020
I would imagine is crazy. I think I wrote it down somewhere.

2965
02:54:32.380 --> 02:54:34.570
I'll pull out my laptop to find it.

2966
02:54:36.520 --> 02:54:41.190
Headline one in five girls and women kidnapped for marriage and Kurgastan

2967
02:54:41.230 --> 02:54:45.160
Kurgastan hers. One of the things was one and five where guys, cashmere,

2968
02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:48.840
cashmere is Pakistan. Besides the led Zeppelin Song. Todd

2969
02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:50.770
is it?

2970
02:54:50.770 --> 02:54:55.720
So it's only Kurgastan according to a study published that spot,

2971
02:54:55.750 --> 02:55:00.250
but see bride napping also occurs in places like Armenia, Ethiopia,

2972
02:55:00.251 --> 02:55:01.660
Kazakhstan, South Africa,

2973
02:55:01.661 --> 02:55:04.940
and particularly common rural parts of Central Asian country,

2974
02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:07.880
kidnapping. Just grabbing people. Well,

2975
02:55:07.881 --> 02:55:11.690
there's so many people and making them marry you. Geez Louise still doing that.

2976
02:55:12.240 --> 02:55:17.240
So 2019 but just stop and think about one out of five and that's with them

2977
02:55:18.380 --> 02:55:21.350
trying to keep it on the download. So what was it a hundred years ago?

2978
02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:25.350
A hundred percent a hundred percent nobody ever got married. Great.

2979
02:55:26.270 --> 02:55:28.340
There's a thing called groom nap, kidnapping.

2980
02:55:28.341 --> 02:55:32.330
That also happens where the eligible bachelors are abducted by a ride's family

2981
02:55:32.331 --> 02:55:36.020
and forced to marry. It happens the other way around. Oh my God,

2982
02:55:36.021 --> 02:55:39.020
these people are living like movie characters. So weird.

2983
02:55:39.140 --> 02:55:43.160
This is happening today. Yeah, we are so fortunate.

2984
02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:46.490
God. Yeah, here. Well, not just that.

2985
02:55:46.491 --> 02:55:50.210
There's some people in the western world. What do you see?

2986
02:55:50.211 --> 02:55:52.990
2009 in this place had been B, B hard.

2987
02:55:52.991 --> 02:55:57.020
B I h a r 1,220 for kidnapping,

2988
02:55:57.021 --> 02:55:58.100
for marriage were reported.

2989
02:56:02.800 --> 02:56:06.530
1200 kidnappings from marriage. People live there.

2990
02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:10.660
1,259 the Lord. It's just,

2991
02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:14.630
everyone's just kidding. Kidnapped. You know, we say we don't.

2992
02:56:14.810 --> 02:56:18.920
That's horrible dude. Imagine that that is fucking horrible.

2993
02:56:18.980 --> 02:56:23.060
Men are damaged and that part of the world, you know what I mean?

2994
02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:26.090
They have a long tradition of doing creepy shit with women.

2995
02:56:26.270 --> 02:56:28.070
That was one of the weird things about history.

2996
02:56:28.071 --> 02:56:31.510
The further you go back in history, the worst women are treated right. You know,

2997
02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:35.000
universally, you know, we say that again.

2998
02:56:35.090 --> 02:56:39.260
The further you go back in history of the worst women, the worst, worst women,

2999
02:56:39.261 --> 02:56:42.950
worse women are treated and treated worse the further you go back in history.

3000
02:56:42.951 --> 02:56:44.720
Yeah. Yeah. I mean of course.

3001
02:56:44.750 --> 02:56:49.750
What's the original image that we always got of caveman and cave woman dragging

3002
02:56:49.970 --> 02:56:53.510
over the head, drag Ragnar higher hair. Right? Right. Exactly.

3003
02:56:53.511 --> 02:56:56.180
How do we know that archetype? Yeah, why do we know that archetype?

3004
02:56:56.570 --> 02:56:59.870
That's a weird one. Yeah. Hitting her in the head and dragging her by her hair.

3005
02:57:00.050 --> 02:57:01.320
What? Where are we getting that from? Right.

3006
02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:03.470
Just taking cause is how it went down. Again,

3007
02:57:03.530 --> 02:57:07.860
why do you and I know that same image, same cartoons, is that what it was? Yeah.

3008
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:09.710
Mine's a cartoon image of it. Right?

3009
02:57:10.430 --> 02:57:14.960
But why did that cartoon image it by that become so prevalent that we both like

3010
02:57:14.961 --> 02:57:18.110
where'd you grow up? New Jersey. I lived there too,

3011
02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:20.560
so maybe we both got it from the same part of the world.

3012
02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:25.190
Maybe we both watched zoom and then it was Boston, Boulder and San Francisco.

3013
02:57:25.191 --> 02:57:28.070
But that was a thing you thought of when you thought of cave men.

3014
02:57:28.071 --> 02:57:31.370
You thought of the man clubbing the lady over the head and dragging her by her

3015
02:57:31.371 --> 02:57:35.660
hair. Crazy. Men have a long way to go. Sure.

3016
02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:36.980
A long way to go.

3017
02:57:36.981 --> 02:57:41.981
The hangups that men have over women that turn into violence is still at this

3018
02:57:44.450 --> 02:57:48.710
late date in our human development is still batshit crazy.

3019
02:57:48.980 --> 02:57:51.200
There is such a violent,

3020
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:54.830
they don't understand how to even like be around women.

3021
02:57:54.831 --> 02:57:58.190
They don't understand when they're rejected by women and it all is culminates

3022
02:57:58.191 --> 02:58:02.460
still in such a violent nature. It's bizarre.

3023
02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:04.710
Wasn't that what happened to the guy who owned the stand?

3024
02:58:05.970 --> 02:58:07.200
I don't know what happened.

3025
02:58:07.230 --> 02:58:11.550
I know what I didn't hear stands for what it's been explained to me that the,

3026
02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:13.620
the ex ex husband,

3027
02:58:13.870 --> 02:58:18.150
right of his old pair of riding to kill her and he was there and wound up

3028
02:58:18.151 --> 02:58:22.560
killing him too. So he was just coming up. That's true. I don't know.

3029
02:58:22.650 --> 02:58:24.060
I don't know what the, the whole story was,

3030
02:58:24.061 --> 02:58:27.480
but apparently I didn't know him well, but apparently it was super awful.

3031
02:58:27.481 --> 02:58:32.130
Like I know he was a nice guy. I met him a couple times. Terrible Maplewood,

3032
02:58:32.131 --> 02:58:35.520
New Jersey. It's a, you know, a man man. Again,

3033
02:58:35.550 --> 02:58:38.940
men crazy if it, if that is the case, if that's the story,

3034
02:58:38.941 --> 02:58:43.410
a man trying to kill his ex wife or killing his ex wife. It's just like man,

3035
02:58:44.460 --> 02:58:48.600
talk about lack of guidebook. Nobody teaches young men, frustrated men.

3036
02:58:48.900 --> 02:58:51.030
That's the story. So

3037
02:58:51.210 --> 02:58:55.070
<v 4>I was correct. I was accurate. That's m says a</v>

3038
02:58:57.290 --> 02:59:01.410
dad of two kill the crimes with stand owner, David Kimmel,

3039
02:59:01.850 --> 02:59:06.050
wits 40 year old married dad of two and the family's Colombian. All pear.

3040
02:59:07.970 --> 02:59:08.803
Karen Bermudez Rodriguez 26

3041
02:59:10.600 --> 02:59:13.240
<v 8>yeah. Wow.</v>

3042
02:59:14.060 --> 02:59:18.590
<v 0>So there was nothing going on between the nanny and him. Fuck</v>

3043
02:59:20.120 --> 02:59:23.300
man, man stabbed and all parent and her boss.

3044
02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:26.350
<v 8>Horrible. [inaudible].</v>

3045
02:59:27.380 --> 02:59:31.820
<v 0>Yeah. Hey Man, nobody teaches these men like how to, how to be a man,</v>

3046
02:59:32.060 --> 02:59:36.970
right. Of how to curb those appetites and deal with it and your violence towards

3047
02:59:36.971 --> 02:59:41.270
something else. You know, it's, it's still a big hole.

3048
02:59:42.210 --> 02:59:45.120
<v 4>But also they were saying Colombian. She was Colombian.</v>

3049
02:59:45.660 --> 02:59:48.900
I Dunno if she's from Columbia and if he was from Columbia too. I mean, look,

3050
02:59:49.230 --> 02:59:51.690
there's every culture all around the world,

3051
02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:56.370
but extreme violence and a lot of parts of South America and certain places.

3052
02:59:56.710 --> 03:00:00.070
<v 0>Yeah, a lot here. I mean, it's everywhere. Anywhere there's dudes,</v>

3053
03:00:00.160 --> 03:00:02.340
they get frustrated and they, yeah, but

3054
03:00:02.340 --> 03:00:06.570
<v 4>more so, more so in a, in a lot of places in South America,</v>

3055
03:00:07.490 --> 03:00:11.070
you know, and some areas that are like, you know,

3056
03:00:11.320 --> 03:00:15.870
I had this guy on who's an expert in Mexico. He worked in the, uh,

3057
03:00:15.960 --> 03:00:17.850
ed Calderon. He worked, um,

3058
03:00:18.300 --> 03:00:22.770
dealing with cartels and for the Mexican government. And you know,

3059
03:00:22.800 --> 03:00:26.130
the stories of this kind of tell you about the violence that's happening in

3060
03:00:26.131 --> 03:00:30.870
Mexico. It's fucking terrifying. And how many kids grow up,

3061
03:00:31.200 --> 03:00:35.400
like sort of enamored with this cartel life and get drawn into it and sucked

3062
03:00:35.401 --> 03:00:39.240
into it and just wind up these people wind up taking people to kill people and

3063
03:00:39.241 --> 03:00:42.240
showing them how to cut people up and getting them accustomed to doing it.

3064
03:00:42.330 --> 03:00:43.163
Oh my God. Yeah.

3065
03:00:43.470 --> 03:00:46.260
And did they seem so normal when you meet them and then you realize that they're

3066
03:00:46.290 --> 03:00:50.700
literally training kids to murder people and chop them up and you're like, what?

3067
03:00:50.790 --> 03:00:53.190
Yeah, yeah. Dark out there.

3068
03:00:53.310 --> 03:00:57.950
So if you fuck that guy's old pair or rather if, um, you, uh,

3069
03:00:57.990 --> 03:01:00.070
live with that guys or if she just decided

3070
03:01:00.070 --> 03:01:00.850
<v 0>to leave him.</v>

3071
03:01:00.850 --> 03:01:02.830
<v 4>Yeah, I mean, I don't think he was, I don't think anybody's,</v>

3072
03:01:03.130 --> 03:01:06.490
I'm saying that he was having an affair, but if the guy thought he was,

3073
03:01:06.491 --> 03:01:07.870
because the guy was, you know,

3074
03:01:08.110 --> 03:01:13.110
if you're a man and your ex wife is living in a house and there's a man in the

3075
03:01:13.121 --> 03:01:15.310
house, you assume like you're a piece of shit,

3076
03:01:15.311 --> 03:01:18.520
you assume that they're having an affair, even if they aren't. Right.

3077
03:01:18.521 --> 03:01:20.290
And you would just, if you were trying to kill her,

3078
03:01:20.291 --> 03:01:21.490
you'd probably try to kill him too.

3079
03:01:21.520 --> 03:01:25.200
Or maybe he was trying to kill her and the other guy just happened.

3080
03:01:25.490 --> 03:01:27.940
<v 0>He'd be there and he killed him. Either way,</v>

3081
03:01:27.941 --> 03:01:30.550
that guy went to the house with the idea, I'm going to kill you. Right.

3082
03:01:30.670 --> 03:01:33.700
<v 4>My point was like, if you could, if you have a dangerous person like that,</v>

3083
03:01:33.730 --> 03:01:38.730
and that dangerous person is trying to go and get his ex wife and kill her and

3084
03:01:38.741 --> 03:01:39.730
you have to be, you have it again

3085
03:01:39.780 --> 03:01:43.710
<v 0>caught in the cross fairs with a knife. Right? Yeah. That's terrible. Awful,</v>

3086
03:01:43.890 --> 03:01:46.980
horrible, terrible, horrible. Be careful out there.

3087
03:01:46.981 --> 03:01:50.130
Kids be kind to each other. I know, but nice.

3088
03:01:50.131 --> 03:01:52.590
That's the other thing about the way the world really works.

3089
03:01:52.700 --> 03:01:56.430
You have to recognize there are really people like that out there on time.

3090
03:01:56.490 --> 03:02:01.290
That's a real thing. Yes. Yes, yes. Yeah.

3091
03:02:01.890 --> 03:02:06.030
It is a it, you have to be aware. You can't be naive that there's,

3092
03:02:06.031 --> 03:02:10.770
that this stuff doesn't exist. You can't pretend that it's not around now.

3093
03:02:11.400 --> 03:02:14.370
Yeah. But how do you, uh, how do you defend against something like that? Right.

3094
03:02:14.371 --> 03:02:19.350
If you don't know how to fight and even if you do, if he's do the knife, yeah.

3095
03:02:19.351 --> 03:02:23.220
Your back is turned, you know? Yeah. Who knows.

3096
03:02:23.730 --> 03:02:26.410
A lot of it's left to chance. Fuck.

3097
03:02:26.450 --> 03:02:31.200
It's such a horrible way to leave this world. Someone stabbing, draining out.

3098
03:02:32.130 --> 03:02:37.050
Just terrible. Someone's trying to get back and his ex wife stabbing you.

3099
03:02:37.110 --> 03:02:38.640
Yeah. You're sitting there and your nice little house.

3100
03:02:38.641 --> 03:02:42.630
You're running a comedy club. Just having a nice time. People laughing,

3101
03:02:42.631 --> 03:02:46.350
you're managing some other comedians. You, you're making your way.

3102
03:02:46.351 --> 03:02:49.980
You've got your wife and your kids you're providing for them and then just,

3103
03:02:50.290 --> 03:02:53.580
you've no idea that morning when you wake up and making coffee,

3104
03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:57.870
what's headed your way? Horrible.

3105
03:02:58.290 --> 03:03:00.060
If you had someone close to you get murdered before?

3106
03:03:03.810 --> 03:03:06.000
Um, no, not close to me.

3107
03:03:06.540 --> 03:03:10.500
Close to me was Phil Hartman and his wife shot him and then shot right.

3108
03:03:10.530 --> 03:03:14.610
Shot herself. Right. It's terrible.

3109
03:03:15.540 --> 03:03:19.320
You think there's ever going to be a time, there's no violence, no violence.

3110
03:03:19.540 --> 03:03:22.140
We evolved past this [inaudible] to some new thing.

3111
03:03:22.380 --> 03:03:24.810
I don't know if we evolve cause there's so many people.

3112
03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:30.000
I think it would have evolved not to that. I don't think he would take Ian's.

3113
03:03:30.150 --> 03:03:33.180
We're still like, do you think so many parts of yeah,

3114
03:03:33.181 --> 03:03:37.590
there's so many parts of the globe are still, you know, way behind.

3115
03:03:37.620 --> 03:03:40.500
I think it would have to be like putting the water or something.

3116
03:03:40.501 --> 03:03:42.300
Like we'd have to medicate it out of us.

3117
03:03:42.350 --> 03:03:46.250
<v 4>That's a real interesting perspective, right? Because amongst us,</v>

3118
03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:48.740
amongst the people that we know,

3119
03:03:48.741 --> 03:03:52.790
what are the odds that we could get through this life with no violence?

3120
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:56.150
Like to say if we all, all the people that we knew, we all live together,

3121
03:03:56.840 --> 03:03:58.100
I could, I would bet a lot

3122
03:03:58.100 --> 03:03:59.480
<v 1>of money. Nobody would murder anybody.</v>

3123
03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:04.190
[inaudible] so what happens when you get from that to large groups of people and

3124
03:04:04.191 --> 03:04:06.500
then you get to large groups of people,

3125
03:04:06.501 --> 03:04:11.501
like you're talking about Kurgastan where one out of fight women gets fucking

3126
03:04:11.620 --> 03:04:14.770
kidnapped. That's how marriages get started. Yeah.

3127
03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:18.260
They're wild and out there to live in crazy. Yeah.

3128
03:04:18.620 --> 03:04:21.040
Or a karate Haraj would,

3129
03:04:21.230 --> 03:04:25.220
what does that one city that I'm in a,

3130
03:04:25.700 --> 03:04:29.210
there's one city in Pakistan. Is it Karachi? What does that city,

3131
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:33.180
why can't I remember the name that uh, is that it is,

3132
03:04:33.530 --> 03:04:36.480
that was one of the cities that I'm uh,

3133
03:04:36.530 --> 03:04:40.820
Shane Smith from vice was saying was one of the most terrifying places on earth

3134
03:04:41.530 --> 03:04:44.420
because the, the, the sheer cheapness of murder,

3135
03:04:44.690 --> 03:04:48.560
how cheap it is to get someone murdered and how much murder and crime goes on

3136
03:04:48.561 --> 03:04:53.540
over there. Just a totally different metric for how you view the world.

3137
03:04:53.540 --> 03:04:58.480
Totally different perception of what life is worth and what life is like and

3138
03:04:58.490 --> 03:05:00.440
what kind of violence you have to deal with on a daily basis.

3139
03:05:00.890 --> 03:05:04.820
I know there's a lot of very dark places. That's why I don't like to travel.

3140
03:05:05.390 --> 03:05:07.970
You don't like to travel at all? I do like to travel, but I don't,

3141
03:05:08.480 --> 03:05:13.090
I'm starting to cross off a bunch of places that to sketch, you know,

3142
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:17.600
between getting parasites that make you have to poop in a bag and send to your

3143
03:05:17.601 --> 03:05:22.601
doctor or anything up in like real violent places that don't have the same kind

3144
03:05:22.671 --> 03:05:26.180
of uh, rules that we do. It's, you know,

3145
03:05:26.240 --> 03:05:29.630
my friend Justin wren who runs a fight for the forgotten charity,

3146
03:05:29.660 --> 03:05:34.010
he was just wearing a shirt at the beach yesterday. Awesome. Best guy ever.

3147
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:34.550
Yeah.

3148
03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:39.470
He has a new intestinal parasite that's draining him and he doesn't know what

3149
03:05:39.471 --> 03:05:41.420
the fuck. Oh yeah, yeah.

3150
03:05:41.421 --> 03:05:44.630
He's got something that he'd caught when he was over there. No,

3151
03:05:44.660 --> 03:05:47.570
that's what I'm afraid of. He's really sick. Easy. Really? Yeah.

3152
03:05:47.571 --> 03:05:49.220
He's really just going to be okay. I don't know.

3153
03:05:49.850 --> 03:05:52.700
They're going to have to hopefully identify it.

3154
03:05:52.910 --> 03:05:53.870
They have to figure out what it is.

3155
03:05:54.750 --> 03:05:58.160
Figure out how he got it figured out what's going on. It's no joke.

3156
03:05:58.220 --> 03:06:00.230
What happened in the Dominican Republic, didn't they?

3157
03:06:00.590 --> 03:06:03.800
People died because they were drinking from the mini bars. You hear that story?

3158
03:06:03.860 --> 03:06:07.470
Yes. Yes. Last sketch.

3159
03:06:08.090 --> 03:06:10.880
They were saying that people were putting stuff in the minibar that wasn't

3160
03:06:10.881 --> 03:06:12.440
actually alcohol. Yeah.

3161
03:06:12.470 --> 03:06:16.190
The story that I had heard was that they would put cheap substitutes for

3162
03:06:16.191 --> 03:06:19.130
whatever the alcohol was supposed to be so that people would, uh,

3163
03:06:19.460 --> 03:06:22.460
pay for it and then, you know, they would steal the actual liquor,

3164
03:06:23.390 --> 03:06:24.350
replace it with something else,

3165
03:06:24.351 --> 03:06:26.780
and then people would drink and it was like poisonous and they were dying.

3166
03:06:27.080 --> 03:06:30.230
People really die now. That's terrible. I hope he's,

3167
03:06:30.231 --> 03:06:31.700
I don't know what the actual story was,

3168
03:06:31.730 --> 03:06:33.680
but somebody else described it saying like,

3169
03:06:33.750 --> 03:06:37.280
one thing is you concentrate on statistics, and I don't know if this is true,

3170
03:06:37.730 --> 03:06:40.760
we should find out, but if you concentrate on statistics,

3171
03:06:40.761 --> 03:06:43.910
and it seems like a lot of people die in the Dominican Republic when they were

3172
03:06:43.911 --> 03:06:44.301
over there.

3173
03:06:44.301 --> 03:06:47.630
But the reality is that it's just the way we're looking at it because we've

3174
03:06:47.631 --> 03:06:50.180
chosen to start focusing on people die over there.

3175
03:06:50.330 --> 03:06:53.960
But in fact it's like commensurate with people that die over here when they're

3176
03:06:53.961 --> 03:06:56.340
on vacation. Right. But

3177
03:06:56.930 --> 03:06:57.540
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

3178
03:06:57.540 --> 03:07:01.590
<v 0>that is really only a certain number go to that resort, you know what I mean?</v>

3179
03:07:01.700 --> 03:07:06.060
In a year one resort. I believe it was. Yeah, I think so. Well,

3180
03:07:06.120 --> 03:07:08.190
a lot of people go to the Dominican. Not now,

3181
03:07:08.220 --> 03:07:11.040
but a lot of people I there last year. Yeah.

3182
03:07:11.160 --> 03:07:14.340
So would you go back after all this? No. First of all,

3183
03:07:14.341 --> 03:07:18.990
I saw a story about a couple that went there and got hookworm in their feet from

3184
03:07:18.991 --> 03:07:23.010
the beach that I was already like, maybe I'm not going back.

3185
03:07:23.370 --> 03:07:26.190
And now that you can't even drink from the Minibar, I'm like, you know what?

3186
03:07:26.400 --> 03:07:30.420
There's nice places in Laguna beach. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Look,

3187
03:07:30.421 --> 03:07:31.140
going up.

3188
03:07:31.140 --> 03:07:35.640
Did you know that hookworms responses to beach hookworms responsible for the,

3189
03:07:36.150 --> 03:07:36.600
um,

3190
03:07:36.600 --> 03:07:41.340
<v 4>the stereotype of the southern dummy? No. Yeah.</v>

3191
03:07:41.460 --> 03:07:44.940
What do you mean people walking around the south barefoot?

3192
03:07:45.270 --> 03:07:50.270
We're getting hookworm and mass and hookworm has a detrimental effect on your

3193
03:07:51.061 --> 03:07:54.010
ability to think. Ah, yeah.

3194
03:07:54.090 --> 03:07:57.840
It really compromises your mental ability. It makes you dumber.

3195
03:07:58.180 --> 03:08:02.920
<v 0>So like the trope of like a hillbilly walking oriel. Yup. Yeah. Oh,</v>

3196
03:08:02.921 --> 03:08:03.754
weird. Yeah.

3197
03:08:04.590 --> 03:08:08.790
<v 4>Yep. Did we find out about that from Peter Hotez is that who told us that?</v>

3198
03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:12.900
And I had a beard. How a worm gave the south a bad name.

3199
03:08:13.320 --> 03:08:15.910
Oh my God. Hookworms whatsapp.

3200
03:08:16.080 --> 03:08:20.340
The American south of it's health and few realize that they continue to afflict

3201
03:08:20.400 --> 03:08:21.233
millions.

3202
03:08:22.060 --> 03:08:26.250
<v 0>Jeez. Ah, you look so creepy. It fucks with the way you think. Ah,</v>

3203
03:08:26.520 --> 03:08:28.390
makes you tired. The fatigue.

3204
03:08:29.630 --> 03:08:32.670
<v 4>Yeah, it's [inaudible] or exhaustion. Listen,</v>

3205
03:08:32.690 --> 03:08:37.570
this week's later victims to come to an insatiable exhaustion and impenetrable

3206
03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:42.260
haziness of the mind that some called stupidity adults neglected their fields

3207
03:08:42.261 --> 03:08:47.090
and children grew pale and listless victims developed grossly distended bellies

3208
03:08:47.091 --> 03:08:48.170
and angel wings.

3209
03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:53.640
Amazing aided shoulder blades accentuated by hunching all gazed out Delhi from

3210
03:08:54.021 --> 03:08:57.380
sunken sockets with a tail tail, fish eyes stare.

3211
03:08:57.620 --> 03:09:01.440
That is the stereotype of people from the south and we just always thought they

3212
03:09:01.520 --> 03:09:03.890
were just living in hot weather and they're just stupid.

3213
03:09:04.530 --> 03:09:09.530
What it really was was worm was fucking hookworm and none.

3214
03:09:09.531 --> 03:09:13.710
Amazing. This podcast started off, we were having describe,

3215
03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:16.220
we were talking about looking at you though.

3216
03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:21.290
The culprit behind the germ of laziness as the south affliction was sometimes

3217
03:09:21.291 --> 03:09:21.651
called,

3218
03:09:21.651 --> 03:09:26.651
was Netcom tour Americanas the American murderer better known as the hookworm.

3219
03:09:28.160 --> 03:09:30.800
It's called the American murder. Are they still out there?

3220
03:09:30.830 --> 03:09:34.700
Millions of those blood-sucking parasites lived fed. Yeah, for sure.

3221
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:39.710
And died within the guts of up to 40% of the population stretching from

3222
03:09:39.711 --> 03:09:41.780
southeastern Texas to West Virginia.

3223
03:09:41.810 --> 03:09:46.810
Can you imagine 40% of the population of the south and these places from Texas

3224
03:09:48.291 --> 03:09:51.050
to West Virginia was infected.

3225
03:09:51.051 --> 03:09:55.630
40% of the population with a fucking worm. That makes you dumb.

3226
03:09:55.700 --> 03:10:00.500
<v 0>I'm never going anywhere ever again. Incredible. That's this. That's insane.</v>

3227
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:05.120
But that's what the stereotype came from. Wow. How wild. Fucking crazy.

3228
03:10:05.570 --> 03:10:06.500
That's insane.

3229
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:11.690
You know how many people are getting right now getting Lyme disease and Lyme

3230
03:10:11.691 --> 03:10:14.510
disease, all that doesn't make you lazy. It's wrecks.

3231
03:10:14.511 --> 03:10:18.030
Your health devastates your health for years. Yep, Yep, sure.

3232
03:10:18.140 --> 03:10:20.960
This happening right now in the east coast, it's, it's all over these,

3233
03:10:21.200 --> 03:10:23.900
cause my kids were back there working on a farm over the,

3234
03:10:24.320 --> 03:10:27.920
over the summer and my daughter had a tick on her. We freaked out.

3235
03:10:28.230 --> 03:10:29.120
[inaudible] it should freak out.

3236
03:10:29.590 --> 03:10:34.040
You got to get it off as okay for 24 hours and you know, but you also,

3237
03:10:34.041 --> 03:10:36.980
if you do get infected, you have to get on antibiotics really quickly,

3238
03:10:36.981 --> 03:10:39.250
super fast. There's a woman who wrote about

3239
03:10:39.290 --> 03:10:41.720
<v 4>a book about um,</v>

3240
03:10:42.170 --> 03:10:47.170
Lyme disease possibly being a military biological weapon that accidentally was

3241
03:10:48.831 --> 03:10:51.410
released. Really? Yeah.

3242
03:10:51.530 --> 03:10:56.530
Apparently this is a popular thought that there's something about Lyme disease

3243
03:10:57.231 --> 03:11:02.231
that Lyme disease doesn't necessarily make sense how quickly it came from this

3244
03:11:02.331 --> 03:11:04.070
one area like this Lyme,

3245
03:11:04.071 --> 03:11:09.071
Connecticut area and how rapidly it spread and how devastating its impact was.

3246
03:11:10.461 --> 03:11:15.461
And there is apparently there's has been some research that's been done about

3247
03:11:15.970 --> 03:11:16.700
not some,

3248
03:11:16.700 --> 03:11:21.260
quite a bit of research has done on various biological weapons and various

3249
03:11:21.261 --> 03:11:22.550
distribution methods.

3250
03:11:22.551 --> 03:11:27.410
And one of the thoughts of a lot of these distribution methods is a infecting

3251
03:11:27.411 --> 03:11:32.411
bugs affecting bugs with some designer disease and then infecting the

3252
03:11:34.071 --> 03:11:34.970
population. Like,

3253
03:11:34.971 --> 03:11:38.360
if you release the bugs on this area that you wanted to attack,

3254
03:11:38.810 --> 03:11:43.100
like at a certain point in time and you infected giants chunks of the

3255
03:11:43.101 --> 03:11:43.934
population,

3256
03:11:44.300 --> 03:11:48.170
then you would be able to go back there 10 years later and everybody would be

3257
03:11:48.171 --> 03:11:50.090
fucked. Wow. Yeah. But this,

3258
03:11:50.390 --> 03:11:54.560
this is something that biological diseases, whether it's anthrax,

3259
03:11:54.650 --> 03:11:57.110
like things along those lines, they are terrifying,

3260
03:11:57.140 --> 03:11:59.940
but they've made those forever. You know, they'd be,

3261
03:12:00.010 --> 03:12:02.570
they've had that and people been aware of that forever.

3262
03:12:02.990 --> 03:12:06.480
But the idea of it being something that's in a bug and they can infect.

3263
03:12:07.580 --> 03:12:10.880
<v 0>Geez Louise. That's terrifying. Yeah. Are you trying to make it,</v>

3264
03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.650
are you trying to make it that I don't go out of my house trying to freak you

3265
03:12:13.740 --> 03:12:17.190
out? No, it's weird that it's, I mean, we,

3266
03:12:17.750 --> 03:12:21.350
I don't remember being around when we were getting around east coast and I think

3267
03:12:21.351 --> 03:12:24.380
it took a while for anybody to figure out what the fuck it was. Um,

3268
03:12:24.410 --> 03:12:28.220
how about the new mosquitoes that we have? Yes. Well, there's also,

3269
03:12:28.221 --> 03:12:29.810
we never had these mosquitoes before.

3270
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:34.710
<v 4>There's a recent case of a horrible disease breaking out in the east coast.</v>

3271
03:12:35.010 --> 03:12:37.830
I think somewhere in Massachusetts. There are some, uh,

3272
03:12:38.220 --> 03:12:41.010
horrible mosquito borne disease. What did that,

3273
03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:45.750
what does that a thing say about the techs? About Lyme disease? What is the book

3274
03:12:47.340 --> 03:12:48.960
called? Bitten. Yes.

3275
03:12:49.880 --> 03:12:54.110
<v 0>Bitten Chris. Newbie K with k. R I. S. Chris. Is that a man or a woman?</v>

3276
03:12:54.320 --> 03:12:55.580
It's a woman, I believe. Yes.

3277
03:12:55.581 --> 03:12:59.390
She discovered circumstantial evidence liking the outbreak of Lyme disease in

3278
03:12:59.391 --> 03:13:02.090
the 1960s the u s military send people to say, this is bullshit,

3279
03:13:02.091 --> 03:13:04.700
but some people say it's just a conspiracy theory

3280
03:13:04.980 --> 03:13:06.800
<v 4>who's some people put up the articles so we can see it.</v>

3281
03:13:07.860 --> 03:13:10.790
It's the middle of the key. Give me a, spread it out so I can see it.

3282
03:13:12.770 --> 03:13:16.790
Scroll down. Okay. The Dod, go back up. Stop.

3283
03:13:17.270 --> 03:13:19.370
The dod takes extreme care involvements,

3284
03:13:19.371 --> 03:13:22.940
research programs to ensure the protection of our personnel and the community.

3285
03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:27.800
What does that, when Smith announced his amendment, okay, this is just too much.

3286
03:13:27.801 --> 03:13:28.990
There says a,

3287
03:13:29.030 --> 03:13:32.450
there's just too much evidence for a reasonable man or woman to just turn the

3288
03:13:32.451 --> 03:13:36.110
page and say, put on your tinfoil hat. This is just a conspiracy theory.

3289
03:13:36.111 --> 03:13:39.050
Smith said, and yet people with credentials will say that.

3290
03:13:39.080 --> 03:13:42.110
Which begs the question, why would they even say that?

3291
03:13:43.550 --> 03:13:44.383
Chris Newbie wrote the book.

3292
03:13:44.960 --> 03:13:49.130
Bitton said she discovered circumstantial evidence linking the outbreak of Lyme

3293
03:13:49.131 --> 03:13:53.300
disease in the 1960s that's what you said from the u s military as proof new,

3294
03:13:53.301 --> 03:13:58.301
besides an interview that she had stopped right there with will Burgdorfer

3295
03:13:59.390 --> 03:14:01.970
American scientist who discovered what causes Lyme disease,

3296
03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:05.630
who told her shortly before his death that he had been instructed to keep his

3297
03:14:05.631 --> 03:14:09.200
research and a possible cause for Lyme disease. A secret.

3298
03:14:09.440 --> 03:14:13.580
My hypothesis was is that the biological weapon,

3299
03:14:13.850 --> 03:14:15.950
they were trying to cover up that, oh,

3300
03:14:16.010 --> 03:14:19.940
my hypothesis is that was the biological weapon they were trying to cover up

3301
03:14:20.420 --> 03:14:25.280
said Newbie, a science writer at the Stanford School of Medicine in California.

3302
03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:26.713
<v 0>I don't believe it.</v>

3303
03:14:28.070 --> 03:14:30.710
<v 4>Hmm? It seems like a lot of Malarkey. She said,</v>

3304
03:14:30.711 --> 03:14:34.550
I can't connect the dots right now. Says me. Who survived Lyme disease.

3305
03:14:34.820 --> 03:14:37.640
My theory is that it was a genetically engineered.

3306
03:14:38.060 --> 03:14:42.470
Rick kept c a bacteria, but as a journalist,

3307
03:14:42.471 --> 03:14:44.330
I can't prove that. So when she saying then

3308
03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:49.670
<v 0>she's just pulling stuff out. She wrote a book. Yeah. Yeah. I ain't buying it,</v>

3309
03:14:49.970 --> 03:14:53.030
but that's not to say that that does worry me more than anything.

3310
03:14:53.210 --> 03:14:55.970
I think she's a hoser. I don't know her personally,

3311
03:14:55.971 --> 03:14:59.570
but if you had to guess probably, but I think that a, it's your bread.

3312
03:15:00.650 --> 03:15:04.690
Yeah. I would never give her my bread. Ah,

3313
03:15:05.090 --> 03:15:09.050
that scares me more than anything though. Play a plague of some sort.

3314
03:15:09.770 --> 03:15:13.970
I always feel like we should be keeping some medicine in the house.

3315
03:15:14.720 --> 03:15:17.420
Plagued medicine. Yeah. I don't know.

3316
03:15:17.710 --> 03:15:21.050
Tetracycline duck good for plague. I don't know

3317
03:15:23.430 --> 03:15:26.450
what to take something. What the hell could be good for plaque?

3318
03:15:26.690 --> 03:15:28.820
Depends what the plague is willing. If it's the flu,

3319
03:15:29.060 --> 03:15:33.080
there's certain things you can take. If it's not, it's crazy.

3320
03:15:33.800 --> 03:15:35.150
War bugs probably nothing,

3321
03:15:35.390 --> 03:15:40.250
but there's so many people and it's so gross and you could see how people just

3322
03:15:40.251 --> 03:15:44.840
coughing in the airports without covering their mouths. That's going to happen.

3323
03:15:44.870 --> 03:15:46.170
There's a story I was reading this morning,

3324
03:15:46.230 --> 03:15:49.050
<v 4>morning, Jamie, about mosquito borne illness in</v>

3325
03:15:50.310 --> 03:15:53.970
<v 0>some new, some like legionnaires' disease type. Jeez.</v>

3326
03:15:54.160 --> 03:15:56.580
We have these nasty mosquitoes here in Los Angeles.

3327
03:15:56.581 --> 03:15:59.670
We're not supposed to have them. These mosquitoes around your neighborhood?

3328
03:16:00.260 --> 03:16:01.500
Yeah, they have a near my house,

3329
03:16:02.010 --> 03:16:06.360
my now sometimes neighbors don't take care of their pool. I know that's bad.

3330
03:16:06.450 --> 03:16:09.030
It is bad. They were saying, I read an article about it.

3331
03:16:09.031 --> 03:16:12.560
They said even like a crumpled up chip bag filled with it gets, yeah,

3332
03:16:12.630 --> 03:16:15.270
it gets water from a sprinkler. That's enough. It's crazy.

3333
03:16:15.300 --> 03:16:18.440
And there are these black and white little guys and they just shoot them and

3334
03:16:18.441 --> 03:16:22.650
they go from your knee down dirty a little bit. They're nasty.

3335
03:16:22.651 --> 03:16:24.900
We never had screens before in my house.

3336
03:16:25.200 --> 03:16:29.640
When I first moved to La I a rented house that someone had a pool in the

3337
03:16:30.060 --> 03:16:34.140
backyard that they didn't take care of really like really bad. When I got there,

3338
03:16:34.141 --> 03:16:37.980
the pool was green, the water was green, and there was things swimming in it.

3339
03:16:38.450 --> 03:16:42.900
Ah. I was like, what the fuck is that? It was mosquito larva. Oh my God. Yeah.

3340
03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:46.320
Yeah. See, so I had a contactable, here it is.

3341
03:16:46.321 --> 03:16:50.490
Massachusetts confirmed human case of mosquito borne virus.

3342
03:16:50.730 --> 03:16:55.200
First human case since 2013 of e e what is that?

3343
03:16:55.430 --> 03:16:57.810
See you scroll, Scroll down so we can read that.

3344
03:16:58.080 --> 03:17:02.910
Equine Encephalitis, that's horse. That's horse stuff.

3345
03:17:03.090 --> 03:17:07.980
The first human case since 2013 at least nine towns are critical risk of

3346
03:17:07.981 --> 03:17:12.660
exposure to a rare but potentially fatal virus can cause brain swelling.

3347
03:17:12.661 --> 03:17:15.600
How come on? According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health,

3348
03:17:15.601 --> 03:17:19.390
Fuck Dude. I remember when I was a kid, um,

3349
03:17:19.660 --> 03:17:23.550
me and this check made out in the woods and wound up taking her pants off and

3350
03:17:23.551 --> 03:17:28.080
stuff and I got fucking lit up by mosquitoes.

3351
03:17:28.081 --> 03:17:31.830
So bad. We had to stop fooling around. I was like, this is crazy. I mean,

3352
03:17:31.840 --> 03:17:36.110
I had welts all over my leg. That was crazy. I was like, Jesus,

3353
03:17:36.150 --> 03:17:39.480
what happens if you try to pull around the woods? Some shit.

3354
03:17:39.780 --> 03:17:43.230
Meet in beds, terrible cold areas.

3355
03:17:43.231 --> 03:17:47.700
The mosquitoes are way more aggressive. Yes, I know the whole east coast, Maine,

3356
03:17:47.701 --> 03:17:51.930
forget it. Oh, Maine is, Janet is worst. Rudel.

3357
03:17:52.260 --> 03:17:54.330
I've never seen mosquitoes like Alaska though.

3358
03:17:55.460 --> 03:17:57.990
Last is heaters are fucking bonkers. Are they big?

3359
03:17:58.020 --> 03:18:01.650
They're huge and they're super aggressive. They don't have any time.

3360
03:18:01.680 --> 03:18:06.240
They come in and they move in quick and just swarm on. This is what happens.

3361
03:18:06.270 --> 03:18:10.920
This is why I'm so aggravated in La. We were, we didn't have this.

3362
03:18:11.210 --> 03:18:14.460
We did. It did not exist until a year ago. I think it's your neighbor.

3363
03:18:14.920 --> 03:18:16.800
You got a neighbor with them. You don't have them by your house.

3364
03:18:17.220 --> 03:18:21.660
Really saw bobcat fight with a rattlesnake though. See that?

3365
03:18:21.661 --> 03:18:23.430
I can handle my buddy sent me a video,

3366
03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:28.140
which you see in the middle of the street with a rattlesnake on Twitter. Oh,

3367
03:18:28.141 --> 03:18:29.700
was it on Twitter? Who put it on Twitter?

3368
03:18:30.900 --> 03:18:35.420
My buddy got it from his neighbor who saw it happen. Oh Wow. Yeah.

3369
03:18:35.680 --> 03:18:40.500
Pull the one up. Maybe the same one versus a rattlesnake. Yeah.

3370
03:18:40.680 --> 03:18:42.670
That's a good fight. You didn't admit the brown snakes.

3371
03:18:42.671 --> 03:18:46.890
A big fucking rattlesnake to bobcat's trying to eat it hard out there. It's,

3372
03:18:47.290 --> 03:18:50.710
it's hard out there. I know. That's why the coyote is your eating cats. Yeah.

3373
03:18:50.711 --> 03:18:53.620
They'll just take whatever they can get. I know everyone's hungry. It's hot.

3374
03:18:53.890 --> 03:18:56.160
You got to get through this month. But the thing about it,

3375
03:18:56.190 --> 03:18:57.300
<v 1>coyotes and cats,</v>

3376
03:18:57.840 --> 03:19:00.930
I think we can relay this to the thing about bears and deers that we're talking

3377
03:19:00.931 --> 03:19:01.764
about New Jersey.

3378
03:19:02.250 --> 03:19:06.330
You don't want all the bears dead because then there'll be so many fucking

3379
03:19:06.650 --> 03:19:09.120
dears. It'd be slamming into him with your cars. Right?

3380
03:19:09.840 --> 03:19:13.590
You want some of them alive? It's called management. Yes.

3381
03:19:13.770 --> 03:19:17.010
And you gotta manage the fucking deer too. To think about the deer too.

3382
03:19:17.011 --> 03:19:21.070
That's particularly offensive is a, you know, when people like, uh, well,

3383
03:19:21.210 --> 03:19:24.120
you know, there's too many deer. What do we do? Um, they're made out of food.

3384
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:27.510
Yeah. You know, shoot them and eat them. They're fucking delicious.

3385
03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:31.420
<v 0>So my brother-in-law does, does he? Yeah. He gets two or three,</v>

3386
03:19:32.410 --> 03:19:35.920
get some put in the freezer. And that's their meat for the year in New Jersey.

3387
03:19:36.130 --> 03:19:39.640
What do you got, Jamie? Yup. That's it. That's it. Look at this. Whoa.

3388
03:19:40.570 --> 03:19:45.520
Look at that motherfucker. Oh Bitch. The fuck. Oh Man.

3389
03:19:46.150 --> 03:19:49.240
<v 1>Um, e bitch, I'm going to fucking eat. Yeah, he's trying to eat him.</v>

3390
03:19:49.241 --> 03:19:53.620
He's trying to bite him. We got got him. Dang. That doesn't look good.

3391
03:19:53.621 --> 03:19:57.570
That cat is God damn quick. He got him tried to bite him. Yeah.

3392
03:19:57.680 --> 03:20:01.440
He didn't let it, but we get it. His moves. He's so relentless too. Yeah.

3393
03:20:01.570 --> 03:20:05.770
It keeps going back out of it. Jeez. It's hard out here in the west.

3394
03:20:05.870 --> 03:20:09.530
<v 0>Yeah. [inaudible] rattlesnake.</v>

3395
03:20:10.940 --> 03:20:13.880
Yeah, it's tough. There's a lot of nastiness going on.

3396
03:20:14.060 --> 03:20:16.070
It's the wild wild west singer I was telling you about.

3397
03:20:16.280 --> 03:20:20.030
Got Bit in the foot [inaudible] across the country. My Posner is fucked up,

3398
03:20:20.031 --> 03:20:22.730
right? Yeah. Can't walk for weeks. He's got to like relearn how to walk.

3399
03:20:23.180 --> 03:20:24.830
What from being bit by rattler.

3400
03:20:26.260 --> 03:20:29.300
<v 1>It really hurt you. Bad Man Chaise. There's a lot of them out here.</v>

3401
03:20:29.750 --> 03:20:32.690
They can cause your, um, your tissue to deteriorate.

3402
03:20:33.190 --> 03:20:37.730
He caused neck cropsey causes like the death of tissue,

3403
03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:41.060
like where we got bite is especially, you don't get it treated really quickly.

3404
03:20:41.540 --> 03:20:45.290
I've seen a guy who, uh, I was looking at this picture online,

3405
03:20:45.291 --> 03:20:49.010
this guy got bit and wound up going to the hospital and his cane had rotted

3406
03:20:49.011 --> 03:20:53.300
away. Where the bone was exposed. Ah, yeah. For how long?

3407
03:20:53.330 --> 03:20:55.040
How much time? I don't know. I don't know.

3408
03:20:55.041 --> 03:20:58.700
