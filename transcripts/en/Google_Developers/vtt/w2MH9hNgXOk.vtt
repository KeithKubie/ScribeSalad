[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.470
JEN PERSON: Hello.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.475
I'm Jen Person for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:04.475 --> 00:00:06.600
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.790
news from Google.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.350
We recently launched
the Security

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.410
in GCP Specialization, our
latest on-demand training

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.280
course.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.870
It introduces you
to Google's approach

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.460
to security in
the cloud, and how

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.150
to deploy and manage components
of a secured GCP solution.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.160
Some background and a
list of the focus areas

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
are on the post linked
in the description below.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.560
Handling large
amounts of deletes

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.200
is an important part
of scaling a database.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.670
We've just made
this a lot easier

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.530
with the Firebase
Realtime Database

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.840
by introducing a new way
to efficiently perform

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.370
large deletes.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.690
Examples and a link to
the docs are on the post.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.080
You can now sign into Firebase
Auth using Microsoft and Yahoo

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.360
as new federated
identity providers,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.120
joining Google,
Facebook, and Twitter.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.490
Links to get started
are on the post.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.160
Google's Science
Journal app enables

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.140
you to use sensors in
your mobile devices

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.680
to perform science experiments,
and it's now open-source.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.200
For some screenshots and
a link to the GitHub repo,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.720
check out the post

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.340
We are now accepting

from university students
who want to participate

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.162
in Google Summer of Code 2019.

00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:15.120

your software development

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.640
