00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.580
&gt;&gt; Michelle Cadoree Bradley: Hello.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.880
I'm Michelle Cadoree Bradley.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.790
A Science Reference Specialist
here in the Science, Technology,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.690
and Business Division of
the Library of Congress.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.300
I'd like to welcome you to the
10th season of our collaboration

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.290
with NASA Goddard and today is
the third lecture of the eight

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.870
that we have planned
for this season.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.310
There's a list available outside
of the theater -- of the room.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.440
And you can always check
our website or subscribe

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.750 position:56%
to our blog to see what's coming up.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.150
Today, Dr. Jason Dworkin, Chief
of the Astrochemistry laboratory

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.490
at NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.630
Maryland will discuss
the OSIRIS-REx --

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.740
I'm making lots of
eye movements here.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.040
Cut that one out.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.650
Anyway, it is the first U.S.
mission that will return samples

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.450
from an asteroid to Earth.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.530
The findings will highlight the
physical and chemical properties

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.340
of material from asteroid Bennu.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.220
The Asteroid is a remnant
of the early solar system

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.480
and should contain
clues to its formation.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.580
Online, I found a description that
said it was "born from the rubble

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.020
of a violent collision, hurled
through space for millions of years

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.980
and dismembered by the
gravity of planets."

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.340
Isn't it just thrilling
to think of it.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.390
[ Laughter ]

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.900
Dr. Dworkin has a Ph.D. in
Biochemistry from the University

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.900
of California - San Diego.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.860 position:56%
And his research objective is to
assess the organic species available

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.210
for the origin and
early evolution of life,

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.300
with a focus on understanding the
extraterrestrial input and origin

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.270
of molecules relevant for life.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Dworkin.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.860
[ Applause ]

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jason Dworkin: Thank you so much.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.470 position:56%
What a great summary of the mission.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.770
I think I'm done.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.660
[ Laughter ]

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.530
So, OSIRIS-REx is the first mission
to return samples from an asteroid.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.310
It's also the largest sample return
of any object since Apollo 17.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.700
I'll be happy to talk
to you about that today.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:49.790
As you may know, planets and
stars are born from nebula.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.380
And within those, protoplanetary
disks form and out

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.740
of which, planets condense.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.200
These are vast disks of
gas and dust, ice and rocks

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.050
and organic material
that then coalesce

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.970
into planets and leave
behind rubble.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.940
Some of these rubble is large
and which is responsible

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.490
for the formation of the moon.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.240
Other bits are still there
in the form of asteroids.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.990
This is the view that you've
often seen of the solar system

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.380
with the sun and the planets
and the asteroid belts

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.820
and the other planets
and the Kuiper belt.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.640
And there was a presentation
recently about the flyby Pluto.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.690
And even further away from
that are the Oort cloud

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.870
where some comets come from.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.110
Now this is not scale.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.090
On this scale -- this is a fun
little website -- 1pixelmoon --

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.090
and this is the scale of
that same solar system.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.100
You can see how far
things are apart.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.110
And space is vast.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.700
Anyway, so planets accrete
and life somehow forms.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.660
And from that, all life
on the Earth is related.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.250
And so, you are here and your
close ancestors are slime molds

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.550
and fungus.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.850
[ Laughter ]

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.120
And we're distant ancestors --
are bacteria and actinobacteria.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.760
But we all share the
same fundamental biology.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.930
The same fundamental
architecture of how life works.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.040
And that is all hidden somewhere in
the ancient history of the Earth.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.870
This is an excerpt from a --
[inaudible] cartoon from XKCD.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.330
It's a cartoon you should read.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.970
If you don't, you really should.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.200 position:56%
Nearly four and a half billion years
ago, Earth was -- had liquid water.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.180
All but the crust older than 3.5
billion years has been recycled

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.010
into the mantle by subduction.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.900
A billion years of the
stratigraphic record,

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.520
the memory of the hills,
is forever lost to us.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.850
What was it like four
billion years ago?

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.900
Earth, what secrets do you have?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.200
Come closer.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.500
I'll never tell.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.800
[ Laughter ]

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.610
All we have are these stupid
tantalizing zircons to tell us

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.010 position:56%
that the -- about four billion years
ago, there was oceans on the Earth

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.200
and scars on the face of
the moon that tells me

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.670
about the bombardment
history of the ancient Earth.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.770
The Earth is mute on its early
history so we have to look

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.980
to asteroids and comets, meteorites
which delivered water and organics.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.030
But the problem is -- I mean,
you search for meteorites.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.560
You find them on the ground.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.050
In the dirt or on the ice.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.030 position:56%
You don't know where they came from.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.310
And they become contaminated.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.350
So, if you're afraid of
getting the rotten apple,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:49.650
don't go to the barrel.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.950
Go to the tree.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.640
From the Untouchables.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:01.370
And so, send a mission out to find
a connection between the left-overs

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.280
of the early formations
of the solar system --

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.240
meteorites which are disconnected
from their origins on the ground.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.200
You can send a robot.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.220
NASA is known for human exploration

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.710
which is very exciting
and very important.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.380
But robotic exploration
is a little bit easier

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.010
because robots don't
insist on coming back home.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.450
[ Laughter ]

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:33.260
And it's -- if a robot dies,
it's sad but not tragic.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.590
And they are smaller, cheaper, and
they don't require an annual salary

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.490
when they're out exploring
the cosmos.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.550
And so, we know -- I
showed you a little bit

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.210
about how the clouds are formed

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.530
from diffuse medium,
condensed into planets.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.620
And from that you have
information on the preserved

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.530 position:56%
in the form of asteroids and comets.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.290 position:56%
And so, what we know about the
[inaudible] medium from observations

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.560
and simulations in the laboratory.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.860
We know about the ancient Earth --

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.960 position:56%
we know from simulations because the
Earth is mute on its early history.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.540
To get a real understanding
about what was there,

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.210
you have to have sample
return from objects.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:21.740
And sample return are -- this
is every sample return mission

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.640
that has ever been flown.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.780
Starting in Apollo 11 up through
OSIRIS-REx was launch just

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.380
in September.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.630
And these are missions which
bring back samples to the Earth

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:35.600
to be studied for generations.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.110
So, for example, in my
laboratory, I have a woman

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.610
who recently published a paper
on Apollo 16 and 17 samples.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.040
She was not yet born when the
samples were collected using

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.430
techniques that were not designed;
asking questions thought unaskable

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.500
when the missions were
conceived of in the 1960s.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.620
And so, that is the
power of sample return.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.320
That you can interrogate
samples using instruments

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.280
that have either not
yet been invented.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.240
And so, I ask young
people where they --

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.530
what they will be doing when the
sample comes back in seven years.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.560
Would they be making decisions
that could set themselves

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.940
in positions to analyze the sample?

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.120
They can think about
questions that we are not

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.230
yet smart enough to ask right now.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:26.970
You can also fly instruments
which cannot be miniaturized.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.860
Excuse me.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.300
So, for example, this is
a synchrotron beam-line.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.600
And here is a scale bar.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.550
This is a car.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.120
And so, it's very hard to imagine
how you can miniaturize something

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.250
like that to fit into a five-meter
ferrying -- to fly to space.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.990
Other instruments give
you the analytical power

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:52.480
that you can see tremendous
detail that you can never see

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.100
on an actual flight mission.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.530
Probably because once
you design a mission,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.290
the instruments become static.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.570 position:56%
You cannot change them as you come
up with new ideas and new questions.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:10.360
You can if you bring a sample back
and can interrogate it on Earth.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.660
So, we're going to an asteroid.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.500
This is every asteroid that's
been visited by a spacecraft.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.320 position:56%
Some are large like the dwarf planet
series down to something very small

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.230
like Bennu -- which is
the one we're going --

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.530
which is half a kilometer across.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.370
And there are a lot of asteroids.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.690
This month, there have been 95
near Earth asteroids discovered.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:39.680
There are 714,000 asteroids
known as of yesterday.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.730
And so, we can see that -- this
is the main belt of asteroids.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.690
Here is Jupiter and there --
here's the Trojan asteroids.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:50.990
Mars. Earth.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.040
Venus. Mercury and the sun.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.330
These red ones are Earth
crossing asteroids.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.630
Again, the green ones.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.930
The main belt.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.230
And blue ones, Trojans.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.580
And then, of course,
other objects further out.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:06.450
How do you pick an
asteroid to get to?

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.190
Well, when we were
conceiving of OSIRIS-REx,

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.200
at the time there were
only 500,000 asteroids.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.710
Not the 700,000 we have today.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.010
Of those, 7000 are
near Earth crossing

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.080
which means you have the chance of
getting to and from the asteroid

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:27.390
within the lifespan of a scientist
or of a NASA program executive.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.940
Of those, 192, you can get there
and back again with a rocket

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.990
that we can conceivably
build and fund.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.950
Of those, 26 have diameters
greater than 200 meters.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:43.730
That's important for two reasons.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.900
One is asteroids with diameters
that are smaller than that.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.240
I've got a model out
there you can play with.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.500
Smaller than that,
they spin very fast.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.720
Up to one revolution per minute.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.020
And that has two problems.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:00.290
One is that the loose regolith on
the surface get thrown off and lost

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:02.500
which means it's very hard
to sample the loose rock

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.830
on the surface because
it's not there.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.510
Even more important,
it spins so fast

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.310
that you can imagine the proximity
operations of a spacecraft trying

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.420
to match orbits -- match spin
rate with an object spinning

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.220
at one revolution per
minute is challenging.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.910
Of those 26, five are carbon rich.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.450
We're interested in
the origin of life.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.880
The early solar system.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.640
The organic inventory.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.240
And so, we need an object
that is especially very dark

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.550
and has evidence of
organics and volatiles.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.510
Of those, Bennu is our choice.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:47.820
And that's because Bennu is a class
B object which is similar to Themis

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:54.030
which is a main belt asteroid
that has ices and organics.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.350
[Inaudible] albedo,
very low density.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.690
Lots of evidence of loose rocks.

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:01.420
Very well understood
orbital parameters.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.260 position:56%
And, by the way, it is a potentially
hazardous object with chance

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.850
of hitting the late 22nd century.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.550
So, lots of time to prepare.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.090
Not to worry.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.990
But the most important
reason is it's --

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.460
the most extensively
characterized object

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.380
that a spacecraft has
never been to yet.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.640
We had a long campaign starting in
1999 when it was first discovered.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.060
And it was observed by numerous
ground and space based telescopes

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.500 position:56%
so we have a very good understanding
of what this object is so that,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.810
that was we can plan a
mission that is low risk

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:38.530
and has a high chance of success.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.350
The model that's out on the table,

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.150
you can play with is
from Arecibo data.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.540
That's the giant telescope
in Puerto Rico.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.760
That generated the shape model

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.960
and that's what the 3D printed
model is, is this very shape.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.950
And in contrast, the Comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko --

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.870
the comet which the Rosetta
mission is orbiting --

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:08.930
it was too far away
to have radar imaging.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:14.700
So, it had -- light curves
that could give a model --

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.380
turned out to be -- the shape was
actually quite different from --

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.880
we could get from light curves.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.620
We'll know when we get there
but we have high expectations

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.510
that it will be basically
round shaped.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:28.850
Very much like this.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.630
There could be some
stretching in either direction

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.610 position:56%
but will not have these crazy lobes.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:37.120
So, it will be -- it should be
a very safe object to orbit.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.710
And a very safe object to sample
from within the usual risks

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.970
of doing something in
space which is hard.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.320
OSIRIS-REx is a large team.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.580
It's lead by PI Professor
Dante Lauretta.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.510
Right here with mascot, Pen-REx.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.040
[ Laughter ]

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.340
This is just the science team.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.470
There's an even larger technical
team of engineers and technicians

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:07.620
who have built and
designed the spacecraft.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.100
OSIRIS-REx -- the name is an
acronym as most things in NASA are.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.290
It stands for Origins,
Spectral Interpretation,

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:20.540
Resource Identification,
Security, Regolith Explorer.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.820
This in animation --
which I pause for some --

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.770
of the sampling device and
sampling action happening.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:33.660
The most important thing is
to return a pristine sample

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:39.970
which is extremely difficult
because pristine is impossible.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.820
Totally clean is impossible.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:50.410
But you can focus on what matters
to you and minimize contamination

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.770
within a reasonable cost

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.180
and not waste your time cleaning
things that don't matter.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.310
And not waste your efforts

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.550
by letting things become
dirty that do matter.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:07.160
Contamination studies
start on day one.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.040
And so, from the start of
the concept of the mission,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.370
we were concerned with making sure
that we have a pristine sample.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:17.520
But, at the same time, the
spacecraft has to work.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.240
I like to say that
if the sample fell

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.540
in the toilet, it wouldn't flush.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.110
[ Laughter ]

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:25.390
So, having a contaminated sample
is better than having no sample,

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.910
but I really, really
want a clean sample

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:32.680
to understand the questions
related to the origins of biology.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.480
So, I asked the science team.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.920
Give me a list of the elements
that you really care about

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.940
and we shouldn't get
on the spacecraft.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.240
And they gave me these ones in red.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.060
[ Laughter ]

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:46.140
So, I put this up and
someone said, "Oh, actually,

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.530
polonium is really cool too.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.060
So, don't put any polonium
on there either."

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.360
Like, okay.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.660
Come one. We're going to make
the spacecraft out of neptunium

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:56.300
and then, I'll violate our thermal
requirements so we can't do that.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.690 position:56%
Plus, it would be too expensive and
dangerous and horrible in every way.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.790
Plus, you ask the organic
people what do you want?

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:06.500
Well, basically, anything that is
an organic compound, we can't have.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.260 position:56%
So, what we did is we took this and
came up with representative species.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:17.050
Amino acids, limiting hydrazine,
carbon, potassium, nickel, tin,

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:22.390
nonindium, and lead as indicators
of other [inaudible] elements

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:26.560
for geological processes
of our chemical processes.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.170 position:56%
Came up with a limit that made
sense to science based on meteorites

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:34.920
and then turned that limit into
engineering -- which makes sense --

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.570
people who actually
built the spacecraft.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.540
Beyond having a limit
on contamination,

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.050
we also have contamination
control --

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:47.560
that lead to contamination
knowledge.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.770
If you have a spacecraft that
meets our control limits,

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.510
you can still have some dirt.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.590
Understanding what that
dirt is is important.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.230
And so, we have monitor in
place that are on the spacecraft

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.960
that we analyze when it comes back.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.610
And [inaudible] in the clean room
that the science team is analyzing

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:05.870
and [inaudible] the bill so we
can understand the low levels

00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:07.170
of materials that are present

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:10.930
and that being launched
and sent back to Earth.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:16.030
We also have an archiving
campaign of materials that are used

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.990
in the production of the
spacecraft so we can --

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.380
the science team can
analyze it when it comes back

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.830
in parallel with the samples.

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.070
We can understand if
they were an issue.

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:28.110
So, for example, I worked
on the Stardust mission.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.550
And turned out -- to the
surprise of the science team --

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.310
that something called
Synlube was used

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.970 position:56%
as a demolding agent in the aerogel.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:41.170
Stardust had these
gelatin-like molds of aerogel

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.230
that captured the comet dust.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:47.790
And to get out of the mold, they
had to have an unmolding agent.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.580
Nobody mentioned that.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.450
And that turns out to be
something like brake fluid

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.700
which is this horrible
mixture of organic compounds.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:02.520
It turned out that -- Synlube
100 was used on stardust.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.440
The company changed names.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.560
The records were lost to arson.

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.670
Products rights were
sold from the company.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:13.510 position:56%
And the -- it was actually, I think,
the owner's son was interviewed

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:18.410
and suspected that Synlube 1000
was actually the same formulation

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.440
as what was used on Stardust
which was launched years before.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:27.860
So as a result, the science team
spent six months studying Synlube

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.950
instead of studying
cometary material

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.180
to understand what it
was doing to our samples.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.510
And even so, there's
still some uncertainty.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.650
And so, this is a mistake that
we have learned from and so all

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:42.450
of these, we have very tight
controls over what is being used,

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.120
good communication
between the science team,

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.230
the engineering team,
and the technical team.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.140
And things like these
that you have to have

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:52.910
to make your spacecraft work --
we have an archive in Houston,

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.780
the [inaudible] Harbor lab where --

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.990
so when you write a proposal to
get some of the OSIRIS-REx sample,

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:05.230
you get one milligram of
OSIRIS-REx sample, and I would also

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:10.180
like one milligram of
[inaudible] to understand

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:14.090
if that could have contributed
to these things I'm seeing.

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.390
So, we have all of that.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:16.690
It's being analyzed by
the science team now.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:21.760
And just like the sample, 75% is
preserved for future generations.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.380
Anyway, enough on contamination.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.860
My pet little thing
on the spacecraft.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:32.750 position:56%
Our primary goal is to return and
analyze a sample -- pristine sample.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:38.030 position:56%
The sample comes back in a
stardust like sample return capsule.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.330
Shown here.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:44.680
Returns in Utah September
24, 2023 at 8:53 a.m. --

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.510
in time for the Sunday
morning talk shows.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.080
[ Laughter ]

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.920
Actually, that time is
dictated by orbital mechanics.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.220
We have nothing to do with that,

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:55.740
but it just happens
to work out that way.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:59.000
But anyway, set your [inaudible].

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.680
Number two is to understand
how the sample fits in context.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.570
So, for that that, we'll be imaging

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.650
and especially analyzing
the sampling site

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:14.970
down to the sub centimeter so we
have a good idea of -- excuse me.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.160
Of how the sample that we
got back to Earth compares

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.230
with the immediate location
and the context of that sample.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.190
Something that has
not been done before

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.660
on any sample return
mission since Apollo.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.670
We will also understand
Bennu as a geologic object

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.950
by understanding the
geology and dynamics

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.970
and spectroscopy of
the entire satellite.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.340
We also understand the interaction

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.720
between the asteroid
and thermal properties.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.870
And so, this is a light mill
which you may have played with.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.660
I think they sell them in gift
shops around here as well.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.990
This is like -- not quite
the Yarkovsky Effect --

00:20:58.990 --> 00:21:02.880
where light hits a dark surface.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.920
And in space, what happens
is the light pressure hits,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.730
the dark surface is absorbed,
the object is rotating,

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.670
and the light is emitted on
the night side and that acts

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.170
as a low intensity thruster.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.690
And that changes the
orbit of the object away

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.030
from its Keplerian predicted orbits

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:24.020
which is why we'll give impact
probabilities for asteroids --

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.700
there's this error
associated with it --

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.860
that's because of this extra
term that's related to the color

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.810
and topography of the asteroid.

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:36.150
And light now is a little bit of a
cheat because -- or radiometer --

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.700
because there's actually
a rarified atmosphere

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.830
so what's actually happening is the
light is hitting the black surface,

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.970
it's warming up the gas in front of
it, and that acts as the thruster.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.340
Because otherwise, it
wouldn't spin nearly

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.750
as fast using just purely
the Yarkovsky Effect.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:56.010
And finally, there are
700,000 asteroids --

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.900
NASA is not spending a
billion dollars to go

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.320
to every single one of them.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.370
We're going to go to one
object and try and understand

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:07.610
that from a point source
down to the molecular level.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.130
And so, by using that
information, we can then apply

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:14.120 position:56%
with what we can see with
telescopes the other 700,000 objects

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.140
and understand how they behave.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:22.320
When the sample comes back, we'll
be using a hypothesis based study

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.310
to understand -- to try and pull
back to the pre-solar history,

00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:31.570
protoplanetary disc, geologic
activity, the evolution of Regolith

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.380
as the object has moved
through the solar system,

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.160
through it's dynamical
history and then finally,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.410
the impact that the spacecraft
has had on the sample,

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.690
including the contamination impact.

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:46.550
We have a spacecraft.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.880
It's like most spacecraft,
it has a science deck

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.720
that has various cameras
and spectrometers.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.100
We have solar arrays
like most space crafts.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.520
What most spacecraft don't
have is a sample return capsule

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.430
and a three-meter long arm
that collects the sample.

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:12.920 position:56%
The payload contains a number of
instruments that scan from the X-ray

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.290
to the radar wavelengths.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:19.770
From the high-end antenna to
the student built experiments.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:25.890
OVIRS is -- this is the
image of the spacecraft.

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:29.810
It is built, it is shipped
to Kennedy Space Center.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.830
And this is -- the orientation
of the flight deck here is OVIRS.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.280
It's a spectrometer.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.860
OTES is a different spectrometer.

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.140
We have a camera suite
that will give us --

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:45.100
from telescope image down
to a microscopic imager.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.400
Well, almost microscopic.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.020
We have a light arm which
would give us the topography.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.640
Student experiments
for X-ray mapping --

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.530
to give us elemental composition.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:01.970 position:56%
And the high gain antenna which will
provide our gravity field mapping.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.090
The core of the mission
is [inaudible] the sample.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.470
This is the sampling
mechanism called TAGSAM.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.930
It is essentially like
a car air filter.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.160
The initial design was
actually called Muucav,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.750
which is vacuum spelled backwards.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:26.450
Us of the vacuum of space and blows
a jet of nitrogen gas and instead

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.310
of -- like in a vacuum cleaner,
you have vacuum getting sucked --

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.230
vacuum sucks material out.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.650
You have the nitrous gas
blowing into the [inaudible] it

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.320
and getting sucked out into
space through the air filter.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.530
It has been tested extensive
-- this is fine -- extensively.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:48.780
From having a simulated
spacecraft and an air bearing --

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:52.770
this is, kind of, like an air
hockey table impacting surfaces

00:24:52.770 --> 00:25:00.710
at different slopes and thicknesses
to see how the sampling occurs,

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:04.910
to operating the sampling
mechanism on a microgravity flight

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:10.200
on the KC 165 vomit comet to
make sure that the sampling works

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.620
under microgravity, to using the
same air bearing table to make sure

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.140
that we can stow the sample head
into the sample return capsule.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:24.330
And then there is a video of
the sampling head being locked

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.940
in the samples return capsule with
three switches and then back off

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.210
to make sure that it is in place.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.040
This will be a very
similar image as we'll get

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.780
from the cameras onboard
the spacecraft to make sure

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:41.300 position:56%
that the head is actually locked in
place because once we stow the head,

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.750
we sever the joint,
cutting it off so that

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:49.550
when we close the sample return
capsule up to bring it home,

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:53.450
this is a one-time only action.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.680
Now we have nitrene bottles we
can actually collect three times

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.980
if we need to.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.280
We only want to collect once.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.250
But if there's an anomaly,
we can go back and try again,

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:05.720
and then again if we have to.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.950
But we want to collect
once to get our 60 grams

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.180
and as much as two kilograms.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:18.060
And these test flights, we've
[inaudible] at least 150 grams.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.790
Usually, more like half a kilogram.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:25.560
And the two kilograms is based on
packing the head entirely full.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.300
That's how much we can carry.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.970
And that's happened on occasion.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.990
The OSIRIS-REx has been
through a lot of history.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:38.350
The first concept was in 2004.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.420
That's when I started
working the project.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.020
And wrote a proposal,
and was not selected.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.320
In fact, no one was
selected that year.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.190
And then, we regrouped and
wrote a better proposal

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.250
with a better concept.

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:55.500
And that went to a first
cut-off selection, and then wrote

00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:00.080
up a more detailed proposal
and then that was not selected.

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.990
And then, we needed
-- it became clear

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:07.030
that a sample return mission
requires more resources

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.120
than was allowable in
the discovery program.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.820
So, we went to the
new frontiers program

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.720
which is a larger cost
gap -- PL admission.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.020
Wrote another proposal.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.890
Made it to Phase A which is --

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:20.520
this is Volume two of
the phase A proposal.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.810
All 90 copies required
by the review team.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:24.110
It's since gone digital but --

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.410
[ Laughter ]

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.720
Way back in 2009, it was
paper -- if you can imagine.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:34.100
Site visits; selections;
lots and lots of meetings.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.650
And then, we actually
[inaudible] implementation.

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:41.670
And so, the ATLO which
is the Assembly, test,

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:46.180
and launch operations --
started March 23, 2015.

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.420
This is the spacecraft being
put into a thermovac chamber.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.850
That is a chamber to simulate
the vacuum and coldness and heat

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:59.600
of space to make sure
that the systems function.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:03.330
More reviews, and then last
week, the spacecraft was shipped

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.500 position:56%
to Kennedy Space Center and unloaded

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:11.030
and is undergoing its final testing
now until it's ready to launch.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.180
And Atlas V 411.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:17.040
And that's code for 3-meter
fairing, one solid rocket motor,

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.280 position:56%
and one single engine centaur stage.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:26.480
The window opens at 7:05 p.m.
eastern time, September 8, 2016.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.900
Come if you can.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.640
And because it's hurricane season,
we have a 35-day launch window

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.840
so that if something bad
happens, we have lots of time

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.140
to regroup and try again.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:47.800
So, after launch, we depart
the Earth and then have --

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:51.190
Earth gravity assist one year
later to change inclination.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.130 position:56%
Get them on the same plane as Bennu.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:58.380
And then, we approach the asteroid
initially as a point source

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:03.410
and then it becomes more and
more an actual geologic object.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.130
We enter an orbit which
is a semi-stable orbit.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:11.990
I guess in this case, Bennu is so
small that the pull of gravity is

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:16.920
about equal to the pressure of the
sun so you have to balance and,

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:22.090 position:56%
basically, surf in the gravity field
and the solar field between the two

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.550
which is why that it's very
important that our center of mass

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:27.970
and our center of area be
coaligned in the spacecraft.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.970
Once we have understood the --

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.040
Let's try that again.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.420
The asteroid better,
we'll be on detail survey

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.350
to understand our favorite
sampling sites.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:46.070
Down select to one sampling site.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:49.680
Do a rehearsal to make sure
that we can do every single step

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.930
of the operation of sampling.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.210
Because getting close to an
asteroid is a little bit scary.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.790
You're only going to want to
do it once -- the sampling.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:59.910
So, that means we have lots
of margin for rehearsing it --

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.660
that it's matching the
orbits, matching the heights.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.960
Getting very, very close.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.470
Everything but sampling
until we're ready to sample.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.970
And then something happens where --

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.630
Because it's orbiting the sun,
the asteroid gets very close to --

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.390
well, closer to the sun than we
would like and so there's a risk

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.510
of the sample will get
hot after we collect it.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.790
We collect it in the
sampling system,

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:32.580
and then it's sitting outside in
the spacecraft on the sampling arm

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:34.850
for up to a month because
as I mentioned,

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:37.570
the stowing operation is
a once-and-done operation.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.990
We want to make sure
that we do it right.

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:41.590
That means that it's
sitting out in sunlight

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:43.530
and that could get it too hot.

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:48.130
So, we have this period here after
the lying in the sand - LITS --

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.240
[ Laughter ]

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.890
Where we will stand down and
wait until it's cool enough

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:56.920
to actually perform the sampling.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.030
If everything goes perfectly,
we can sample earlier.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:03.620
But, there are things called
safe modes that spacecraft go

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:08.560 position:56%
through where if you have, like, a
computer glitch, the spacecraft goes

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.250
to safe mode and resets itself.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.030
And this happens all the time.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:15.430
On average, about twice
a year or so.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:19.290
Let's say, if the spacecraft
is orbing Mars, that happens.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:22.210
And then, fine, you're
still orbiting Mars.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.900
But we're near an object
that has almost no gravity.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:30.010
And so, when we hit safe mode, our
instructions are drive to the sun.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.730
Just burn away.

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.460
So. that means that you're now --

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.790
you've gone from over
here to over here.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.090
We have to approach
the asteroid again

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.630
and understand what's happening.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:44.410
And so, that takes extra time
and so we've allocated lots

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:47.040
of extra time margin to
be able to reset ourselves

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.330
and get the engineering team --
the navigation team to understand

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:54.440
where the spacecraft is relative
to the asteroid and become same.

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.730
And then it will approach again.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.140 position:56%
So, this could take as much as month

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.280
after a safe mode,
unlike a couple of days.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.170
And so, we have all
that margin built in.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:07.510
And then -- let's see
if we can get this to --

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:12.040
[ Music ]

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.340
&gt;&gt; The milky way.

did our Sun, the Earth,

and the planets come to be?

In recent decades, our understanding

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.250
of the solar system's
evolution has greatly improved,

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:38.040
but deep questions remain.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.280
To answer those questions,
astronomers are preparing

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.040
to visit someplace very small.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.340
Asteroid Bennu.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:51.960
A lump of rock and organic
material, the early building blocks

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:57.120
of the solar system,
of Earth, of us.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.860
Bennu is a time capsule, and
its journey takes us way,

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.890
way back...four and
a half billion years.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.490
The raw ingredients of
Bennu, and our solar system,

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.040
originated in a stellar nursery:

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.400
a vast cloud of hydrogen,
helium, and dust.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.150
Our own Sun doesn't yet exist.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:25.360
Nearby are hot stars like this
one, quickly burning up its fuel...

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:30.740
and destroying itself in a colossal
explosion called a supernova.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:40.390
The explosion destabilizes our
cloud, causing it to collapse.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:45.940
In the geologic blink of an eye,
a hundred thousand years, gravity,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:49.270
and angular momentum flatten
the cloud into a swirling disc.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:56.630 position:56%
In the center, where molecules crash
together tightest, a proto-star revs

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:00.890
up to incredible pressures
and temperatures.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:05.520
Deep within the disc, clumps of
dust not much larger than a grain

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:07.410

heated into droplets

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:11.830

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.550
The source of this
heat remains a mystery.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:20.050
Chondrules are destined to
become the building blocks

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.170
of the solar system.

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:27.520
Coaxed by gravity and
turbulence, the chondrules clump.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.220
They grow into the first asteroids,
into mountains, into planets.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:38.240
The asteroids are rubble piles of
rock, metal, ice, and organics.

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.650
This large asteroid is
the parent body of Bennu,

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:48.020

size we can only guess.

is far from finished.

near its outer edge,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.330
It's really -- gravitational pull
of Jupiter is the main source.

00:41:21.330 --> 00:41:24.840
A good question is why are
there any planets at all?

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.380
Why isn't it just gas and dust?

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:33.320
Gravitationally, they tend to
accrete and in the asteroid belt,

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.210
there's enough gravitational
disruption

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:38.010
from Jupiter -- as I understand.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.720

But it's too unstable there
for a planet to actually form.

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.780

of the asteroid is dusty and would
respond to the capture mechanism

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.630
&gt;&gt; Jason Dworkin: All
right, so how do we know

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.800
that the asteroid has
regolith on it?

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.970
We have thermal inertia
measurements taken from --

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.170
From the -- primarily, the
Spitzer Space telescope,

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.860
as well as some other telescopes,

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:26.150
that give us a thermal
inertia of the asteroid.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:30.550
Thermal inertia is how long it
takes for a solid to cool off

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:33.140
when it gets out of the sunlight.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:38.270
And so, compare the thermal
inertia of beach sand versus rocks.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:45.430
And beach sand cools off faster
because it's finer grain.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.850
And so, you can use that
to tell the grain size.

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:51.350
Average grain size is about two
centimeters which is perfect

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.910
for fitting inside of
our sampling system.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.400
And there's bound to be dust.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.920
That's also why we have contact
pads on the sampling system so that

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:04.170
if the worst happens and
we don't get rocks inside,

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:30.000
And we actually have conversa-,
it will be a very interesting day

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.280
when we choose the sampling site.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.650 position:56%
Let us imagine that you have the
surface of Bennu when it's all black

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:39.100
and there's one white rock.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.430
Do you want to sample the one
white rock because it's weird

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:45.230
or the black part because
it's normal?

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:47.390
Again, that will be an
interesting conversation

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:53.490
and that's a PI led mission and
so there's a council that reports

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:56.920
to the PI, who makes the
decision, who then gets concurrence

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.330
from the Associate
Administrator of NASA.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:04.590
And so, there's a bureaucracy to
make sure that we make a decision

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:07.280
that is equally unpleasant to all.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.540
[ Laughter ]

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.490
Yes. In the back.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:12.820
&gt;&gt; How do you match the surface?

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:16.480
I assume that you're going
to have to be stationary

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.450
over whatever the surface is
that you're going to sample.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.530
How do you match its orbit?

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:26.080
I assume you know which
way the spin is, et cetera?

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.440
&gt;&gt; Jason Dworkin: The
orbital parameters

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.190
of Bennu was a 4.2-hour day.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.490
It's retrograde orbit.

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:33.880
We know that already.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.460
When the spacecraft gets close,

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:40.160
we'll be able to match it
very precisely because it is

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.790
such a small object, it's really,
more like a docking maneuver

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.590
than it is an orbiting maneuver.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.510
And so, we can use all of
the tiny little thrusters all

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.120
over the spacecraft to
help us orient ourselves

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:57.120
to match the orbital rotation
when we go into our rehearsals --

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.970
to make sure that we
can do that properly.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:03.230
And then, actually match the
orientation on the surface.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:08.930
We'll be generating four maps
to help us choose our sample.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.800
The first map is the safety map.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.410
Make sure we have a
site that is actually --

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.770
will not endanger the spacecraft.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:19.070
The second map is the
sampleability map to make sure

00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:23.730
that we have sample
sizes at that location

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.680
which can fit in our
sampling system.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.680
Measuring again the thermal
inertia and taking images.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.150
After that, we have the
deliverability map to make sure

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:36.520
that the navigators can
get us to that spot.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:40.660
Like it's not, say in the North
Pole, where the rotation is

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:45.090
such that you actually have to
spin the space craft too fast.

00:45:45.090 --> 00:45:46.430
And then, after that
is the science map

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:48.420
that gives us the most
exciting science.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.010
The black rock versus the
white rock for example.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:55.980 position:56%
And so, the addition of these four
maps will help us decide the safest,

00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:01.810
most sampleable, most deliverable,
most exciting site we can get.

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:03.110
Yes, sir.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:08.340
&gt;&gt; How do you discriminate between
material that has accumulated

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:12.060
on to this object over times
[inaudible] and you're passing

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.360
through the different
medium as opposed

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:19.050
to what real content
of the rock represents?

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.860 position:56%
Is there a way of finding that or --

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:23.680
&gt;&gt; Jason Dworkin: So, the
question is how do we differentiate

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.330
between original Bennu material

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:30.720
and material accreted
from other objects?

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.360
That will be looking
at the minerology.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.250
Looking at the detailed
elemental abundancies and I stop

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:42.200
at distributions of the
sample when we get back.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.480
They're both very interesting
stories.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:50.350
So, for example, the Almahata Sitta
meteorite that landed, or well,

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:52.760
crashed into Sudan
in -- what was it?

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.630
2010 or so.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:47:01.660
No. 2008. 2008 -- TC3
was the asteroid

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:04.830
and was the only time an
asteroid was observed in space

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:06.420
and [inaudible] characterized.

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:09.460
And then hit the Earth
and it was collected.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:11.950
So, it's both an asteroid
and a meteorite.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:15.300
Almahata Sitta, 2008, TC3.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.090
Anyway, that turns out to be
a [inaudible] of a whole bunch

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.790
of different kinds of
meteorites thrown together

00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:23.520
in a really weird way.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:27.080
And what exciting science that
will be if that's what Bennu is.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:30.950
But just as with Almahata Sitta,
we'll be able to determine

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:32.670
that by looking at the rocks.

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:33.970
Yes, sir?

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.940
&gt;&gt; If you were to hit the jackpot,
get everything you want to know

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.800
out of this, what would that be?

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.590
&gt;&gt; Jason Dworkin: So, what is the
ultimate success for this mission?

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.510
Well, nothing less than
original life, of course.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.370
[ Laughter ]

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:57.400
It's to either prove or disprove
theories on solar system formation,

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:04.530
on are there [inaudible]
that led to the timing

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.940
of the proto-solar nebula.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.930
What organic compounds are present?

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:15.950
Are there excess of
left-handed amino acids?

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:21.470 position:56%
Something that I specialize in that
led to, perhaps, the origin of life.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:27.050
Are there -- are those amino
acids a biological type

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:30.580
but not contamination?

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:36.650
Are these -- the sugar
contents -- nucleus basis.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:42.700
There's a wealth of chemistry that
we cannot yet answer from rocks

00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.070
on the ground because
of contamination

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:47.940
that this will help us understand.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:57.140
[Inaudible comment]

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.450
&gt;&gt; Jason Dworkin: So, this is
comparing OSIRIS-REx to ARM,

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:02.240
the Asteroid Redirect Mission.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:09.770
OSIRIS-REx is a PI led mission
that was -- getting there.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:20.750
That was selected on the
New Frontiers line in 2009.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:22.650
It is a science driven mission

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:25.790
to return a sample for
purpose of science.

00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:32.040
ARM is very much like
Gemini, it's a way to rehearse

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.540
and practice having
astronauts operate in space.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:41.490
ARM is an engineering
exercise directed by the agency

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:48.160
to understand how to
work on objects in space

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.130
to help up get closer to Mars.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.220
That is not science drive,
that's technology driven.

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:55.970
If there is a science pay
off, then that's great.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.540
But science is not the
driver of that mission.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.320
In the case of OSIRIS-REx,
science is the driver.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:05.390
And there might be some technology
pay offs in how to interact

00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:08.740
with small bodies, but
the purpose is science.

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.820
So, they have entirely
different purposes.

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.230
They're also at pretty different
stages in their life cycle.

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:17.970
The OSIRIS-REx is built and about
to launch, ARM is still a concept.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.350
Anyone else?

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:26.080
Yes, sir.

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:30.780
&gt;&gt; If asteroid are formed from
the same material as [inaudible],

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:33.510
why would we have different --

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:41.400
[Inaudible comment]

00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.260
&gt;&gt; Jason Dworkin: So, it's -- if
the Earth and the asteroids came

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.700
from the same source, why
are they different now?

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.070
Well, for one thing,
the Earth melted.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:57.030
And partly because of this gigantic
-- I can't get back to it --

00:50:57.030 --> 00:51:05.280 position:56%
this gigantic impact that formed the
moon, that totally melted the earth.

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.290
After that, life will find a way.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:10.820
Life is pervasive.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:16.250
It has totally dominated
the chemistry of the earth.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:21.580
Geologic processing like subduction
has also dominated the crust

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.880
of the earth.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.750
And so, between geology and life,

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.730
the earth is a highly-evolved
object.

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:30.810
There's not much left
of it that's primordial.

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.530
And these asteroids
have never melted.

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.120
And they've never seen life.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.720
And they've never seen liquid water
-- at least not that we know of.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.790
And they've certainly
never seen subduction.

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:46.780
And so, they contain
the untarnished history

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.980
of the early solar
system unlike the Earth

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:53.990
which has been totally rearranged.

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:59.350
And just has Mars has been
rearranged by its geologic history.

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:02.770
And Venus has been rearranged
by its geologic history.

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:05.370
Anyone else?

00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:06.790
[Inaudible comment]

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.090
Pardon?

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:14.950
Oh, Bennu is an Egyptian bird god.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:20.760
And so, OSIRIS-REx is the
acronym for the mission.

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.510
Egypt is kind of cool
and that's why we went

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:26.340
with the Egyptology reference.

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:30.890
And that was initially for
the early OSIRIS concepts

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.220
which were not funded.

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:35.920
OSIRIS-REx was the
big grander version.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.290
Started as a joke.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:39.050
The OSIRIS king.

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:42.510
And I guess that's
post-[inaudible] but whatever.

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:45.470
[ Laughter ]

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:47.630
And so, the joke stuck and we came

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:50.380
up with a backronym for
what REx stands for.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:52.030
Regolith explorer.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:58.750
And so, we had a contest to rename
101955 1999 RQ36 something a little

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:00.310
bit more palatable.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:04.290
And a young man in North
Carolina came up with the name

00:53:04.290 --> 00:53:08.860
and he's been given a ticket
to the launch to see it.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.840 position:56%
And so, he thought that the image
of the spacecraft reminded him a bit

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:19.530
of a bird which also led to a
parody song, Bennu and the Rex.

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:21.510
Which I will not sing here.

00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:24.290
[ Laughter ]

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:26.090
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:53:26.090 --> 00:53:29.890
[ Applause ]

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:33.540
