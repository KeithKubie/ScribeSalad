The final attachment style is secure attachment, and about 65% of babies have a

00:00:04.222 --> 00:00:09.255
secure attachment. Babies with secure attachments cry and become really

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:13.791
distressed when the caregiver leaves. But when the caregiver returns, the baby

00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:18.580
offers warm hugs, and the baby will settle down fairly quickly. Attachment is a

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.930
great example of how nature and nurture both influence our development. We are

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.130
born with a temperament which can influence how we attach to our caregivers,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.380
but we also have to consider nurture or the experience our caregivers provide

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.829
us. This can also affect our attachment to them.
