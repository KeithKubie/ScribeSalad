time that satellite transmitters have
been placed on freshwater crocodiles I

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420
put these transmitters on the Crocs and
 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.310
put these transmitters on the Crocs and
satellite means that they send a signal

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
satellite means that they send a signal
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.170
satellite means that they send a signal
to a satellite and then send it to my

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180
to a satellite and then send it to my
 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.300

computer so I know where they're at

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310

every second of every day it's
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.259
every second of every day it's
fascinating to see their movement

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
fascinating to see their movement
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.830
fascinating to see their movement
patterns and we catch some monster Crocs

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
patterns and we catch some monster Crocs
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.579
patterns and we catch some monster Crocs
it's uh it's a good film
