00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.220
Hi I'm Kagure Kabue I'm from Kenya originally

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.390
but I live in San Francisco now. I have

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.590
darkly pigmented skin and I lived in an area

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.140
that had a high prevalence for sickle cell anemia.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.930
First of all Kenya is in East Africa and

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.020
it's right under the horn of Africa. So under

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.810
Somalia and above Tanzania. And we have the Indian

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.670
Ocean to our east. So, if you're closer to

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.110
the coast it's much hotter. It's just hot at the coast, especially in January.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.640
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.760
&gt;&gt; and we're right on the equator. The country is actually almost split

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.060
in half by the line, equator line and if you live up in the

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.800
highlands, like I do, which is on the slopes of Mount Kenya, the temperature

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.690
doesn't vary much, so it will only be a few degrees celsius different

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.930
from morning to evening.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.453
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:56.140
&gt;&gt; And so you can wear a sweater or not, if you want, or not.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.071
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:57.071 --> 00:00:59.020
&gt;&gt; And it's, it's beautiful. You should check

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.588
out the Kenyan government website for more information.

00:01:02.588 --> 00:01:02.998
[LAUGH]

00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:04.330
Lots of Lions and.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.440
&gt;&gt; People in different continents on the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.090
globe have different color skin, and that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.140
is caused by the different amounts of

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.800
melanin that they have deposited by melanocytes

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.180
into the, the skin itself. so give us some, some idea, you

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.060
know in Kenya, are most people, do they have dark skin? Do they have light skin?

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.580
&gt;&gt; I would say most people have dark skin.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.650
because I guess its, is it a sliding

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.130
scale? What's, what's dark skin and what's not

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.640
dark skin? For most people would probably be

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.250
on the end where your skin is considered dark.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.900
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.910
&gt;&gt; I had, the advantage or disadvantage of going

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.000
to a s-, an international school when I was

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.350
younger. And so, there were a lot of Europeans,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.040
or people who were both European and African descent.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.480
And so I don't know when I first

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.820
realized the difference. I don't remember, except maybe

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.169
when I came here and the absolute opposite

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.800
was happening where I was suddenly the minority whereas

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.210
where I grew up people with lighter skin

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.630
pigmentation were the minority. And so, I don't

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.150
know, I think that was my first time

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.230
to actually realize, is when I moved here in

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.430
2008 that oh my goodness, this plane is full of people who do not look like me.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.460
&gt;&gt; Skin color is such an easy trait for people to latch on to. You

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.610
know, they associate lots of other things with

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.294
it. historically, I think this has always been

00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:40.960
true. Do you think that in general

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.070
and you can speak from your perspective growing

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.920
up in Kenya. Or even from your experience

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.040
in San Francisco. Do you think you know,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.040
your generation or the current generation's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.510
perspective on skin color is different from

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.340
past generations in a, in a, in a better or a worse way?

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.910
&gt;&gt; I think it's, I think it's better, but

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.990
it's also very complicated because there's that sort of

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.400
love hate relationship that comes with a country or

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.240
a people who've been enslaved or colonized. Where you end

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.450
up either identifying because you identify, you connect those two traits,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.010
you connect the wealth and the success to the skin pigmentation.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.480
And so I hope to think that in a reverse situation,

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.020
where skin pigmentation someone with darker

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.565
skin pigmentation had colonized a country

00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:32.120
[LAUGH]

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.658
that was full of Like, an African person like

00:03:34.658 --> 00:03:37.630
Chaka Zulu went to I don't know, Britain or something,

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.250
and colonize them, that the opposite would happen and

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.562
everybody would be outside trying to tan. And I know,

00:03:42.562 --> 00:03:43.210
[LAUGH]

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.350
I don't know if that would happen. But you

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.990
know I'd like to think that that's how this

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.340
is broken down. It's not because one is better

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.840
or worse than the other. It's just historically there has

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.970
been a correlation or a connection between these two.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.850
And so people have tend to identify one with success

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.540
and one with failure. It just so happens that

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.530
that's how it went down at this period in history.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.270
&gt;&gt; I really like that thought experiment.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.810
That's a really good thought experiment to do.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.130
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.690
&gt;&gt; Do you think of skin color, skin pigmentation,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.240
as a positive or a negative trait in any way?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:22.680
&gt;&gt; I think skin color can have positives. I

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.080
don't think of it is negative or positive specifically.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.170
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.030
&gt;&gt; But I do know that, when I go out

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.650
in the sun. I have the advantage of not burning. Or,

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.680
I know that I'm less likely to get

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.390
skin cancer than someone with lighter skin pigmentation.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.590
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.040
&gt;&gt; But on the other side, I do know that. It, you

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.100
do need the sun in order for your body to produce vitamin D.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.668
&gt;&gt; mm.

00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:53.320
&gt;&gt; And in that case, if you have a higher, skin you be, have darker

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.530
skin pigmentation then, your less, you're more

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.950
likely to not have the ability to produce

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.660
enough Vitamin D.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.250
&gt;&gt; Right, exactly. And I know that there's some people

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.750
who actually have to take Vitamin D supplements, or they

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.140
actually have to be told to go out into the

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.980
sun more to get enough sunlight, so that they can make

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.990
enough Vitamin D. A lot of people think differently about

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.090
skin color. Some people, it's a big deal other people

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.980
it's not a big deal. If you could give advice,

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.270
or just say anything speaking to that idea and people about

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.750
whether or not skin color is a big deal or

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.210
not. what would you say, or what advice would you give?

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:35.390
&gt;&gt; I think the advice I'd give is that it shouldn't

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.730
matter. It would be naive of me to say that you should ignore it because

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:45.060
others are not ignoring it. And so you should be aware of how

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.470
others will treat you. But all in all it doesn't, it shouldn't change who,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.880
it doesn't change who you are on the

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.330
inside. It's a genetic trait that simply dictates

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.650
what the color of your skin and so,

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.330
after that It may have its biological advantages or

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.410
disadvantages. But in the end, it doesn't, it

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.550
doesn't, your skin color is not your ethnicity. It

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.380
doesn't your race. Race is a social construct.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.670
And so, it doesn't change who you are on

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:20.180
the inside. It really shouldn't matter. And it would be great to say that

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.700
it doesn't matter but to some it does. My advice would be to be who you are.
