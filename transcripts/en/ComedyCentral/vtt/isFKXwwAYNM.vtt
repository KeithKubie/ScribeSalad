She was like, what, all y'all
three of y'all want something?

Dad was like, "No,
this is my son."

And I was like, "Oh, shit, how
fucked up do I look...

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.687
Where she think I'm one of
these dudes?"

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.389
That's when I was over it.

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:31.857
I'm like, "Man, I need to get
out of here."

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.893
And I looked, and there was
a back door open,

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:36.896
and it had a basketball
right outside.

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:39.265
And in the projects, they had
a basketball court.

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:40.733
So that was my excuse.

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:41.734
It's like the universe was
telling me,

00:06:41.767 --> 00:06:43.636
"Get the fuck outta here."

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.038
So I was like, "Hey, Dad, I'm
gonna go play basketball."

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.607
He was like, "Hey, why don't
you go play basketball,"

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.444
like it was his idea,
like he thought of it.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:53.412
So I grabbed the ball,
and I go outside,

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:55.080
and it was scary as shit,

00:06:55.113 --> 00:06:57.750
because I had to cross the
threshold into the projects.

00:06:57.783 --> 00:06:59.418
And if you don't live in the
projects,

00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.822
you don't got no business
in the goddamn projects.

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:05.090
And the only people I knew that
lived in the projects,

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:06.425
one of 'em died.

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:08.727
So who the fuck I'ma yell for?

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.796
So I tried to be tough,
walking in the projects

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:13.265
to go shoot basketball,
but guess what.

00:07:13.298 --> 00:07:16.302
I can't play
goddamn basketball.

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:18.604
I sucked at basketball!

00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:22.107
Got cut from everything
I tried out for.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.510
And people looking at me like,
"Who the fuck this nigga?"

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:26.111
That's what they do
when you walk in any hood

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:28.280
and they don't know you.
Like, "Who the fuck

00:07:28.313 --> 00:07:31.984
is this motherfucker with
these little ass shorts on?"

00:07:33.685 --> 00:07:35.788
I shoot a ball,
air ball, miss.

00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:38.157
I just watch
the ball just miss,

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.496
and I'm like, "Oh, shit, I'm
about to get my ass whupped."

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.965
I'm out there trying to shoot.
I'm nervous.

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:48.133
Any time somebody make a move,
I'm doing this.

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:50.836
All the sudden, my dad come
outside, "Hey, hey,

00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:52.838
"what's up, man?
Oh, you playing basketball.

00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:55.441
Let me see that ball."
Pang!

00:07:55.474 --> 00:07:57.843
He missed.

00:07:57.876 --> 00:08:00.212
But he didn't give a fuck
about playing basketball.

00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:02.681
He just turned to me and
I saw the look in his eyes

00:08:02.714 --> 00:08:04.817
and it was intense.
It was intense.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.720
I ain't even recognize him.
He was like, "Hey, man.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.723
You got that $20 I gave you?"

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.658
And I was like, "Shit."

00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:15.361
Yeah, I got it, but that shit
was deep.

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:17.396
I'm not used to having $30.

00:08:17.429 --> 00:08:20.699
I'm giving this dude 75%
of my money.

00:08:20.732 --> 00:08:23.035
I don't even know if it's 75%,

00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:25.237
'cause I ain't never had 30
goddamn dollars before

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.072
to even do the math!

00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:29.475
And I reached in; now that shit
was so folded so tight,

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.477
like, them last two pieces
of toilet paper.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.846
You know how you fold
that shit?

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:36.215
It was deep.
Like, I had to unfold it

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:37.683
to see what it is.

00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:39.018
I was like, "Yeah, here it is
right here."

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.252
And he was like,
"All right, I'll be back."

00:08:40.285 --> 00:08:42.988
And he just, like...

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:45.491
Just danced his ass away.
You know what I mean?

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:47.493
And I'm feeling bad now,

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:50.896
'cause I'm like,
"Man, I missed dinner."

00:08:50.929 --> 00:08:52.531
I was like, "All right,
we still go to the movies."

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:54.033
You know what I mean?

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:55.834
Still, I'm out there bricking
the ball, boom.

00:08:55.867 --> 00:08:58.070
People going around, I'm
talking to 'em a little bit,

00:08:58.103 --> 00:08:59.538
nervous as fuck.

00:08:59.571 --> 00:09:01.907
My dad come back
ten minutes later.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.345
"Hey, man, you got
that other ten?"

00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:10.549
I was like, "No.

00:09:10.582 --> 00:09:11.717
No, I must've dropped
that shit."

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.887
You know what I mean?
[laughs]

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.389
He's like, "All right,
all right.

00:09:17.422 --> 00:09:18.624
I'll be back.
You good? You good?"

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:20.459
And then he left, right?

00:09:20.492 --> 00:09:23.696
He left, and I was like, "Man,"
it started to hit me,

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:27.566
like, "Man, I think my dad
on drugs.

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:30.736
Man, if he was on drugs,
that would be fucked up."

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:32.371
Like, I'm about to miss
a movie now.

00:09:32.404 --> 00:09:35.574
I done drove an hour.

00:09:35.607 --> 00:09:38.210
Damn, I ain't going to get to
see "Addams Family Values."

00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:39.278
You know what I mean?

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.250
I shoot a shot, just as I miss,
just as I air-ball it,

00:09:45.283 --> 00:09:47.486
you see the ball--

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:52.725
and I see the blue Cougar
just drive off.

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:55.594
And I'm like, "Oh, fuck.

00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:59.465
"This nigga just left me in
the projects.

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:01.934
By myself."

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:04.436
And the loneliness and
the abandonment that came

00:10:04.469 --> 00:10:06.605
over me during that time,

00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:07.773
Fucked me up.

00:10:07.806 --> 00:10:09.775
Like, I'll never forget it.

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:12.411
Life-changing, because that was
a moment for me

00:10:12.444 --> 00:10:15.114
where someone was like,
"You gotta do something

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:16.181
with your life."

00:10:16.214 --> 00:10:19.485
You got to check the fuck
outta here.

00:10:19.518 --> 00:10:22.287
Whoever is responsible for you
is gone.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.622
It's up to you now.

00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:26.592
You got to do what the fuck you
gotta do

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:30.129
to get out this situation.

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.297
And...

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.632
I ain't have no self-esteem

00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:37.803
because he just took it
to the pawn shop.

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:40.873
Cut to four year later,

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:44.810
partial basketball scholarship

00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:48.347
and I'm selling crack cocaine.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.215
Like, 18 years old.

00:10:50.248 --> 00:10:53.652
And I ain't the best coke
dealer, you know what I mean?

00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:55.821
'Cause the person--my OG
keep calling,

00:10:55.854 --> 00:10:58.524
sending me on weird-ass jobs.

00:10:58.557 --> 00:11:00.959
Get a phone call, like,
"Hey, man,

00:11:00.992 --> 00:11:03.495
"this chick want some rocks,
but she ain't got no money,

00:11:03.528 --> 00:11:06.231
"so I want you take her and let
her suck your dick.

00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:08.667
Want you to give her
two rocks."

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.839
I was like, "All right,
I'll do that shit."

00:11:13.872 --> 00:11:16.508
Fuck these junkies.

00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:18.811
But it was all out of anger,
because my dad was a junkie.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:20.512
You know what I mean?

00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:24.650
So I ain't give a fuck about
no other junkies out there.

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:28.387
So I'm getting my dick sucked

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.825
in a Honda Accord

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:35.527
behind a grocery store.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.529
And it's weird.

00:11:37.562 --> 00:11:41.366
It's weird.
It's a weird moment.

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:45.537
How the fuck did I get here?

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.607
And it was even more weird
for her.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.209
You know what I mean?
She looked up,

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:54.113
she was like, "Sorry if I ain't
doing a good job."

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:00.719
"I don't even really suck dick.
I'm a lesbian."

00:12:00.752 --> 00:12:04.423
I was like, "Oh, shit.

00:12:04.456 --> 00:12:06.258
Crack is addictive."

00:12:10.428 --> 00:12:13.198
Crack is addictive.

00:12:13.231 --> 00:12:15.367
I thought it was on the person
that smoked the crack.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.437
No, this shits gets a hold on
you.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:22.307
That's a powerful ass drug.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:27.279
And I can't come.

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:30.249
That's a tough situation.

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:31.784
But I'ma tell you why,

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:34.086
'cause when I looked up,
it's a park right there.

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:35.721
And at that park,
in that basketball court,

00:12:35.754 --> 00:12:40.058
is a father and son
playing basketball.

00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:43.428
And I'm getting
my dick sucked

00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:46.799
in this Honda Accord,
trying not to cry...

00:12:50.001 --> 00:12:54.106
A father and son playing
goddamn basketball!

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:57.176
That could have been my life.

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:59.311
And I can't even look up or
down,

00:12:59.344 --> 00:13:01.580
so I'm just looking out the
window, trying to find

00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:05.151
some inspiration
so I can finish.

00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:16.628
And seeing that father and son
play ball,

00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:21.466
I've recognized something
that no matter how much money

00:13:21.499 --> 00:13:26.205
I made selling crack
or how successful I got,

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:32.978
I never could buy the thing
that I wanted,

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:38.050
which was the bond of
a father and son, together.

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:42.387
And that was one of
the last moments,

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:45.057
you know what I mean,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.761
that I decided to sell crack.

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:53.766
I came though.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.437
