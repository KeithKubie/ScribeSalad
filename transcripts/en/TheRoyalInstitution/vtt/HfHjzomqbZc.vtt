00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.984
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.190
Now this is called mass.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.790
But I'm not taking confession.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.730
Well, if you really
insist, maybe later on,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.160
we can do something along
those lines over a pint of beer

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.050
in the pub afterwards.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.120
I know it doesn't
always seem like it.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.050
But trust me.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.730
An author really
does need a reason

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.830
to sit down and write a book.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.120
So my reason for wanting to
write this particular book was

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.540
to try to convey something,
some sense of what has been

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.240
an understanding in
contemporary physics

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.670
for already quite
a number of years,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.910
but which I felt
actually wasn't really

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.870
that wonderfully well understood
or commonly understood.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.790
And that is the way
that modern physics

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.420
conceives the nature of
matter and, in particular,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.540
the property of mass.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.910
So what I want to try
and do is to give you

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.010
a sense of the journey that
I went on myself researching

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.880
and then writing this book to
give you some sense perhaps

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.310
also of the sense
of astonishment

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.090
or wonder at where
contemporary science feels

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.390
that we've landed up.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.970
And I'm going to begin by
setting myself a hopefully not

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.930
too difficult mission.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.850
So this is my mission, Jim,
should I choose to accept it.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.640
Here's a cube of ice.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.890
And I'm going to ask
myself two really,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.110
hopefully, quite simple
questions about this stuff.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.000
I want to know
what is it made of,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.920
and I want to try to
answer the question

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.165
where would I look
to find its mass.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.950
So we know ice.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.270
Don't we?

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.950
It's what you put in
your gin and tonic

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.190
or, increasingly, the
cosmopolitans among you,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.060
in your glass of Sauvignon
blanc, as the Italians do.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.760
We know it's made of water.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.100
And we're going to start the
story with the ancient Greeks

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.770
because much of our common
understanding of the nature

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.360
of material substance
actually comes

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.300
from a handful of Greek
philosophers dating back

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.890
about 450 years before year
0, before the Common Era--

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.310
names like Leucippus,
if he really existed,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.590
Democritus, then later, 100
years later or so, Epicurus.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.630
And much of Epicurus'
work was actually

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.150
translated into a grand poem by
the Roman poet and philosopher,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.090
Lucretius.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.970
And a great place to start
because Epicurus once

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.420
said nothing comes into being
out of what is non-existent.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.800
That's philosophers for you.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.100
I can guarantee you the
cryptic crossword puzzles

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.570
were ace in ancient Greek times.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.390
We're talking, of course, about
the famous Greek elements--

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.650
earth, air, fire, and water.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.386
That's good because we
know ice is made of water.

00:03:21.386 --> 00:03:23.510
And we're interested in
exploring a little bit more

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.950
about what ice-- what
that water is made of.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.940
And we get the sense
that nothing comes out

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.640
of stuff that doesn't exist.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.730
A great star of what
Epicurus is really saying

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.670
is it's a common observation
that nothing magically appears

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.020
out of nothing.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.880
Stuff just doesn't appear.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.180
And there's a corollary to that.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.940
If it's a common experience that
stuff doesn't magically appear,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.810
it is also a common experience
that stuff doesn't magically

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.290
disappear.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.600
Push that to its
logical conclusion,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.130
and you end up in
a situation where

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.510
you have to accept that
nature resolves everything

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.180
into its constituent atoms.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.450
And nothing, no substance
can be resolved completely

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.160
into nothing.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.630
It's a simple
logical consequence.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.760
If nothing can
come from nothing,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.850
and nothing can be
resolved into nothing, then

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.590
by definition, when
I have something,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.020
it must resolve into some
indestructible indivisible bits

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.270
of stuff, what the
Greeks called atoms.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.830
Even better, we know that
the ancient Greeks speculated

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:43.020
that if you accept that
substance, like water,

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.500
consists of atoms, then
by definition atoms

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.300
must be moving in
something, which

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.920
the Greeks called the void.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.370
Empty space is how
we think of it today.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.150
And there had to be a
reason for that motion.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.950
And so the Greeks had
no real difficulty

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.455
in ascribing properties
to these atoms.

00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:06.080
As you can see from
the little diagram,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.180
they gave them different shapes.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.820
Some were spiky with hooks
that would cling to each other,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.760
giving them certain
characteristic properties

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.260
that we can actually see
manifested in our experience

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.900
of different substances.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.760
But if they were
perpetually in motion,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.860
then the argument went they must
have something called weight.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.910
They fall through the void
much like heavy rain drops will

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.560
fall from the heavens on an
otherwise warm June, Sunday

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.990
afternoon.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.060
OK, even further,
seawater, being fluid,

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.410
OK, must consist of round atoms.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.590
So here we're getting
quite a few answers

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.840
to our opening questions.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.800
What is it made of?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.080
Well, ice is made of water.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.170
Water is made of hard,
round atoms that are

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.530
indestructible and indivisible.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.840
And those atoms
in their turn must

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.370
have the property of weight.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.280
OK, good start.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.390
Everyone happy?

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.140
Everyone happy?

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.100
Yes.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.020
Good.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.527
All right, then we have
to wait quite a long time.

00:06:21.527 --> 00:06:23.610
I don't want to give you
the impression that there

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.960
was nothing going on in
the 1,300 or 1,400 years

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.870
between the ancient Greek
philosophers and the times,

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.960
perhaps a little bit
before Isaac Newton,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.060
the times of Galileo,
Bacon, Robert Boyle,

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.370
and others contemporary
with Newton.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.850
But I just thought I'd pull
this quote from an online

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.170
encyclopaedia of philosophy
called the Stanford Online

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.300
Encyclopaedia of Philosophy.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.080
And this, when I read it,
really struck a chord.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.310
Here is a recipe for producing
mediaeval philosophy, the stuff

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.690
that was going on in the
1,300 years between the Greeks

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.370
and Newton.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.880
"Combine classical pagan
philosophy, mainly Greek,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.580
but also in its
Roman versions, with

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.920
the new Christian religion.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.830
Season with a variety of
flavouring from the Jewish

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.650
and Islamic
intellectual heritages.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.680
Stir, and simmer for 1,300
years or more until done."

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.010
So there was a lot going on, but
most of the intellectuals, most

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:35.130
of the minds of
thinkers in this period

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.400
were devoted to
trying to reconcile

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.370
the pagan philosophical
texts of the Greeks

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.740
with the demands
effectively of the Catholic

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.850
Church and other orthodoxies.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.750
And eventually, things
started to free up.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.730
The first universities,
of course,

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.740
were created out of monasteries
to all intents and purposes.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.080
So that kind of sense
of monastic scholarship

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.930
translated itself into
academic scholarship.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.330
And it slowly, over a
long period of time,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.870
began possible to
start speculating along

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.716
lines that were not
any longer theological.

00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:16.590
You could start to
speculate about the nature

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.840
of the natural world
that didn't necessarily

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.790
have always to reference
back to some kind

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:23.100
of religious orthodoxy.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.750
So to be fair though,
Newton, we tend

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:29.880
to regard Newton
as one of the first

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.190
among a generation
of scientists.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.740
But in truth, Newton was
a mechanical philosopher.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.000
His famous book,
published in 1687,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.270
it's English title is the
Mathematical Principles

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.430
of Natural Philosophy.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.680
So these folks
understood that they

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.931
were doing natural philosophy,
but of a particular mechanical

00:08:49.931 --> 00:08:50.430
kind.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.162
It was the mechanical
investigation of nature.

00:08:54.162 --> 00:08:55.620
Newton, of course,
had a lot to say

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.810
about things like
motion and gravitation,

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.370
which we'll talk about
in a little while.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.450
But these philosophers, these
mechanical philosophers,

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:09.850
also held an understanding
that substance was ultimately

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:14.650
composed of
indivisible, hard atoms.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.630
But their concept
of mechanical atoms

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.030
was not really that
much more sophisticated

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.920
than the conceptions
that the ancient Greeks

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.580
had put forward hundreds or
thousands of years before.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:28.600
All right, Newton,
though, went further.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.460
Newton speculated
that not only were

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.290
these little hard billiard
balls of substance moving

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.140
in the void, they
might also actually

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.049
have forces acting between them.

00:09:41.049 --> 00:09:43.090
That was something the
Greeks never latched onto.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.310
As far as they were
concerned, all of the motion

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.765
was due to the
weight of the atoms.

00:09:47.765 --> 00:09:50.140
The idea that there might
exist different kinds of forces

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.600
between atoms was new,
but very speculative.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.790
Newton had no
experimental grounds

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.700
for making that
kind of statement.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.460
The other thing that we
would look to Newton for

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.640
is really a good
understanding of things

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.810
that are manifest in our
visual world of experience

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:12.130
to do with the motion of
objects, things with mass,

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.060
things with acceleration,
as a result of the acting

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.820
of a force of some kind.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.990
And so here, at least if we
can't get further insight

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.790
into the nature of
atoms themselves,

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.200
we can at least
get some insights

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.880
into the nature of
this thing that we're

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.060
calling mass or weight,
which I'm not differentiating

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.600
between in this talk.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.130
And indeed, there
is a definition

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.944
of mass in Newton's
Mathematical Principles

00:10:39.944 --> 00:10:40.860
of Natural Philosophy.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.540
And it reads
something like this.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:49.930
"The quantity of matter or
mass is a measure of the same,

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:54.040
arising from its
density and bulk,"

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.200
which we can interpret
as volume, "conjointly."

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.710
Do you see anything
wrong with that?

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.650
It was Ernst Mach, coming a
couple of hundred years later,

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:10.830
who actually pointed out,
"The formulation of Newton

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.420
is unfortunate.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:15.810
As we can only define density
as the mass of a unit of volume,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.812
the circle is manifest."

00:11:16.812 --> 00:11:18.270
And that, by the
way, in the corner

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.570
there is a vicious circle.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.430
So Newton, who we would expect
to be the champion of clarity,

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.170
his second law of
motion is force

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.480
equals mass times acceleration.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.620
These are concepts
that are embedded deep

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.870
in our common
understanding of what's

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.080
known now as classical physics.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.860
And I would say
that's a physics that

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.610
is just consistent with
our everyday observations.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.200
Watch a game of tennis.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.470
Watch Andy Murray lose in the
semifinal of the French Open

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:54.370
to Stan Wawrinka, and you
get a sense for the way

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.460
that the motion of the tennis
ball is affected by a force.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.460
Watch a game of
snooker on the TV.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:05.480
Get in your car and accelerate
at high speed along the M4,

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.180
well, until you get to the
first set of traffic cones.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.610
And you get a sense for what
Newton's classical physics is

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:15.550
trying to tell you.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.440
But start to pick
at it, and you'll

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.610
find that some of the
fundamental concepts that we

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.580
are so very familiar
with start to unravel

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.700
a little bit because,
in truth, something

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.350
as important and
fundamental as mass

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.730
was never really defined
properly in the first place.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.340
Mach had a go at defining
mass, but only relative

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.470
to other masses.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.030
There was no real
attempt to come up

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:45.500
with a firm understanding,
a derivation almost,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.177
as to what mass is.

00:12:48.177 --> 00:12:49.760
All right, so we've
got some problems.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.843
We're not any further along
with our understanding

00:12:51.843 --> 00:12:53.350
of the nature of atoms.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.330
And we've got this
bit of a wobble

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.610
when it comes to
understanding what mass is.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.944
But let's keep going.

00:12:59.944 --> 00:13:02.110
Those two questions where
I started at the beginning

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.960
seem so fairly straightforward.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.710
We should surely be
able to get some light

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.260
at the end of the tunnel if we
keep our heads down and keep

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.260
going.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.720
OK, move on.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.620
Well, when you don't get
clarity from the physicist,

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.920
you can always rely on chemists.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.060
And some 100 years after
Newton, again, John Dalton

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.110
wasn't the only one here.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.580
I'm picking out and singling
out these heroes just

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.340
really to encapsulate
what was essentially

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.670
a movement, the responsibility
of many individuals involved

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.370
in its development.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.860
But John Dalton
famously said that he'd

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.670
come to some enlightened
understanding of the nature

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.150
of chemical
substances by looking

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.880
at their weights, an
understanding, in fact,

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.300
that he could understand
chemical substances in terms

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:58.710
of the nature of the
atoms that they contained.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.310
So this is the beginnings of
a burgeoning understanding

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.800
of chemistry and, in
fact, if I'm honest,

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.990
really the foundations,
along with the development

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.746
of the science of
thermodynamics,

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:09.620
the development of the
beginnings, the seeds,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.328
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.190
Dalton was pretty
curmudgeonly when

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.560
it came to an understanding
of the composition of water.

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.230
As far as he was concerned,
it was one atom from hydrogen

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:28.480
and one atom of oxygen.
Antoine Lavoisier wasn't sure.

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.810
But Antoine Lavoisier didn't
survive the French Revolution.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:35.020
I'm afraid he was
guillotined for his efforts,

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.520
not for his
scientific efforts, I

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:40.020
have to say, but for his
efforts as a tax collector.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.880
And it took a little while
after some confusion.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.700
Maybe the clarifying voice
was an Italian chemist

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.450
called Stanislao Cannizzaro
who in this quote

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.330
makes it quite clear what he
thinks the nature of chemical

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.150
substance is all about.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.760
"The different quantities of
the same element contained

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.250
in different molecules
are all whole multiples,"

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.590
and that was the singular
thing that the chemists were

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:08.170
observing, "all whole
multiples of one and the same,

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.230
which, always being
entire, has the right

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:12.310
to be called an atom."

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.950
I love that quote.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.020
And of course, coming
out of the work that

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.590
was being done on understanding
the nature of the relationships

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:24.070
between the constituents,
the atomic constituents,

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.340
of different
molecular substances,

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.970
we came to the
firm understanding

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:31.870
that water is a molecule of H2O.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:37.580
OK, I won't tell you the
amount of confusion created

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.650
around even that simple
understanding because,

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:42.080
of course, if you take
hydrogen as a gas,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.630
your instinct is to think
that it's a monatomic gas.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.980
It's one atom of hydrogen.

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.000
If you take oxygen as a
gas, your initial instinct

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.200
is to think of oxygen
as a monatomic gas, O.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.990
But when H and O were
combined to produce water,

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.360
things didn't work out.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.700
And it was only the realisation
that hydrogen is actually

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.410
a molecular gas.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:05.920
It's H2.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.910
And oxygen is a
molecular gas, O2.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.460
Combine those, and you
can then begin to work out

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.110
how water can be H2O.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.100
All right, so we've
come quite some way.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:22.550
I actually think we're
up for a mission update.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.730
OK, so we started
off this evening

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:29.950
with two very simple questions
around this cube of ice.

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:32.740
And as a result of endeavours
beginning with the ancient

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:37.630
Greeks 2,500 years ago,
we've understood that ice,

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:42.190
being water, is made of
round atoms with weight.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.110
We've got a lot more
sophisticated thanks

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.780
to the efforts of the
mechanical philosophers

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.050
in the 17th and 18th
centuries and in the chemists

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:52.520
in the 18th and 19th centuries.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.000
And we now understand
that we can

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.520
drill into ice as a substance.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.740
And what we'll find is a
lattice of molecules of H2O.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.520
Here the red ball
represents an atom

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.579
of oxygen. And the two little
white balls represent atoms

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:10.670
of hydrogen. So ice is a regular
lattice of water molecules,

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.480
which we write as H2O.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.569
Where would we then
look to find its mass?

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.270
Well, we can find its
mass or its weight--

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:23.530
I'm not differentiating-- in the
mass or weight of it's hydrogen

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.270
and oxygen atoms.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.550
But we have to remember
the caveat, whatever

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:32.310
that is, because we haven't got
a good definition of mass yet.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.980
OK, everybody happy?

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.790
We all knew this.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.950
Right?

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:38.450
I'm sorry.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:42.009
I feel I might have wasted 20
minutes of your lives going

00:17:42.009 --> 00:17:43.300
through stuff you already know.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.466
But I think it's important
you understand the nature

00:17:45.466 --> 00:17:47.470
of the journey that we're on.

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:49.520
OK, so that's good.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.085
Let's move forward
a little further.

00:17:51.085 --> 00:17:52.930
Ah now, see.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.940
Pesky physicists are
now back in the picture.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.850
You can't trust them.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:01.120
Just at the time at the
beginning of the 20th century

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.430
when we were starting
to get hold of evidence

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.890
that atoms really existed--

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.920
they weren't just figments
of a fertile imagination--

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.410
just at the time when
we were getting evidence

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:14.560
that atoms really
existed, physicists

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.550
were working out how
to split them apart.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.930
I don't know, honestly,
not to be trusted.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.820
And again, this is a model
that should be very familiar,

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.370
the kind of planetary
model of the atom.

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.260
Rutherford famously
did some experiments

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.070
bombarding thin gold foil
with something called

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.930
alpha particles, effectively
the nuclei of helium atoms,

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.070
and was astonished.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:43.030
Expecting that this is like
shooting 15-inch shells

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.610
at a piece of tissue
paper, how astonishing

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.200
was it then to find some
shells bouncing back at him?

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.470
And what that meant,
simply, was that all

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:59.230
of the mass of a
gold atom or any atom

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:02.200
is actually concentrated,
firmly concentrated,

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.090
in a small central nucleus.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.690
And in fact, we now
understand that oxygen atoms

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:13.850
consist of nuclei surrounded
by orbiting electrons.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:20.920
And those nuclei contain a total
of 16 particles, eight protons,

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:27.160
positively charged,
eight neutrons, neutral.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.430
Hydrogen is the periodic
table's lightest element.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:35.580
It consists of just a single
proton in its nucleus.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.640
Oh, fantastic, so time for
another mission update.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.660
OK, so we've gone a bit further.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.010
OK, the physicists have meddled,
but we've gone a bit further.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.940
We now understand that, in
fact, our molecule of water

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:54.790
can be imagined as hard central
nuclei, oxygen, two hydrogen

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.050
atoms, in a structure
around which

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.610
are wrapped orbiting electrons.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.600
And it's the nature of the way
that the electrons wrap around

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.130
these three atoms that create
the molecular properties

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.110
of something like water.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:12.670
Fantastic, the
even better news is

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:19.315
99% of the mass of an atom is
to be found in its nucleus.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.390
We still don't
know what mass is.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.300
But we know where
to look for it.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.415
That's good news.

00:20:28.415 --> 00:20:31.460
OK, we can worry about
what it is later.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.220
OK, so our attention
now turns to the nature

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.530
of the protons and neutrons in
the nuclei of atoms themselves.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.770
That's where we look to find.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:41.690
We now know what
water consists of.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.430
We know its atomic structure.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.317
We know its nuclear structure.

00:20:45.317 --> 00:20:47.900
We're going an awful long way
to answering the first question.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.816
What is water made of?

00:20:48.816 --> 00:20:50.510
What is the ice cube made of?

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.460
And we think, at
least, we're getting

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.900
some clarity in
where we think we

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:57.320
need to look to find its mass.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.096
OK, keep going.

00:21:00.096 --> 00:21:07.590
Ah, now I can't tell you
what kind of mess this makes.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.010
Again, just when you thought
things were starting to become

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:22.530
clear, we hit this period of
scientific endeavour where we

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:27.540
get nothing other than
madness and confusion.

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:37.410
So we can credit Prince
Louis, 5th duc de Broglie,

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.160
with the insight that the
discovery made by Einstein

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.370
in 1905-- what did
Einstein discover in 1905?

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.790
He discovered that light waves
can be particles, what we now

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:48.565
know as photons.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.380
Louis de Broglie
speculated that,

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.690
as a result of some
further observations

00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:00.850
in experimental science over
the subsequent nearly 20 years,

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.010
then maybe it's
also a possibility

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:07.500
that electrons can be waves.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.450
Now we'd always
cherish the notion,

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.880
right from the beginnings
of the speculations

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.450
of the ancient Greeks, that we
would be able to take material

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.310
substance, accept
that, ultimately, we

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:25.300
must hit a final kind
of indivisible stuff out

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.000
of which everything is made.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.650
And now we've got
this French prince

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:34.780
telling us, well,
actually, you know,

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.140
what you thought were little,
hard billiard balls of material

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.270
substance that happened
to be negatively charged

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:44.230
electrons can also be waves.

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.590
Why is that a problem?

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.580
Well, let's have a quick look.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.330
I just want to spend
a few minutes talking

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.640
about what I call the essential
mystery of quantum mechanics.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.738
There's a famous experiment.

00:22:55.738 --> 00:22:57.830
It may already be
familiar to you.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.960
It's called the
two-slit experiment.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:06.070
And it's easy to understand what
we see in the context of a wave

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:07.960
theory of light.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.790
We take a light source.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:13.900
We take two narrow
slits or holes.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.450
And we shine the
light through these.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.800
Now there's only one caveat.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.960
The distance, the
spacing, between the slits

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.820
has to be of a
certain magnitude.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.290
And the slits
themselves have to be

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:25.655
of the order of the
wavelength of light.

00:23:25.655 --> 00:23:27.280
And the chances are
you're going to see

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.620
what you need to see
only if that light itself

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.219
is monochromatic.

00:23:31.219 --> 00:23:33.010
In other words, it has
a single wavelength.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:37.240
It's not contaminated
with different colours.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.570
Do that, and what you see
projected on a far screen

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.450
is what's known as the
two-slit interference pattern.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:45.160
It's very easy to understand.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.160
As the light waves
squeeze through the slits,

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.090
they diffract.

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.290
They spread out beyond.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.570
And in the space beyond where
a wave crest runs into a wave

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.400
crest coming from
the other slit,

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.980
you get what's known as
constructive interference.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.730
The waves add up to
give a stronger wave.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:07.000
Where a trough meets a trough,
you get a deeper trough--

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.620
constructive interference.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.770
But where a wave crest
meets a wave trough,

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.900
you get a cancellation--

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.080
destructive interference.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:17.950
And the result is a
pattern of alternating

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.330
light and dark fringes.

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:24.870
These were first discovered by
Thomas Young in about 1804--

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:26.940
easy to understand with
a wave theory of light.

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:33.720
But de Broglie is now telling
us electrons can be waves.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.680
So how about if we do that
experiment with electrons?

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.420
And how about we
do that experiment

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.670
in such an arrangement
so that only one

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.780
electron goes through
these two slits at a time?

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.070
Think about that for a second.

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.805
An electron is an
indivisible bit

00:24:53.805 --> 00:24:55.180
of-- it's a
fundamental particle,

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.560
an elementary particle.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.210
It has a negative
electrical charge,

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:02.170
but it also has a
mass, whatever that is.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:04.000
We'd anticipate that
the electrons surely

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.464
must go through one or
other of these two slits.

00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:08.380
And the one thing that
you don't expect to get

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.296
is an interference pattern
coming out of that.

00:25:10.296 --> 00:25:11.740
How can it possibly?

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.670
But de Broglie was saying
electrons can also be waves.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.570
And a wave passes through
both slits simultaneously

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.520
to interfere on the far side.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.530
So let's do the experiment.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.470
Here's what we see when
a few electrons have

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.940
passed through these two slits.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.590
This is fine.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.080
What we see is,
for each electron,

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.600
we see a definitive spot.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.090
It says an electron
hit here, struck here,

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.750
and that seems entirely
consistent with the idea

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.600
that a single electron
maintains its integrity,

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.250
goes through one
or the other slits

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.940
to be detected on the
screen on the far side.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:53.520
Then let's slit in a few
more electrons and a few more

00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.320
electrons and a few more.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.360
Now, although the resolution
is a little bit fuzzy--

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.380
this is not HDMI quality--

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.500
we get the sense that even
though these electrons are

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.120
passing through
this apparatus one

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.030
at that time, what we're seeing
is an interference pattern

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.840
of light and dark fringes.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.090
What I love about
this experiment is,

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:25.600
if indeed the electron is
passing through both slits

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:32.060
simultaneously as a wave,
what happens to its mass

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:32.960
while it does that?

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.900
Now I don't know
how many of you are

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.080
familiar with the
work of Tom Stoppard.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.200
He wrote a play called Hapgood.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.900
It was put on stage in, I
think, the late 1980s, 1988

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.520
or thereabouts.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.380
He had a character, Kerner.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:54.310
It was a play about a double
agent in MI6, I think.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.280
But the double
agent was a metaphor

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.090
for wave-particle duality.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:00.805
Stoppard is a clever guy.

00:27:00.805 --> 00:27:03.900
And Kerner said, "Every
time we don't look,

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.910
we get wave pattern."

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.166
Because, of course,
faced with that kind

00:27:08.166 --> 00:27:09.540
of puzzling
experiment, you might

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.490
be tempted to say, OK,
well, I'm bloody well

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.060
going to trace the path of an
electron through this thing.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.720
I'll show you.

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.270
But the minute you do
that, every time we

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.190
look to see how we
get the wave pattern,

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.910
we get the particle pattern.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.220
The act of observing
determines the reality.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.720
And that's the
essential mystery.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.682
OK, Einstein and Bohr
had a famous debate.

00:27:33.682 --> 00:27:35.140
The problem with
this kind of thing

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.080
is that, when we see a
single spot on the screen,

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.610
there's a phrase.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.100
It says that if the electron
is described as a wave,

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.210
it's kind of distributed.

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:45.790
It could be anywhere
across that screen.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.470
It ends up being
in only one place.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:52.610
It's detected there, but that
place cannot be predicted.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:54.410
It's left to chance it seems.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.160
That's the nature of
quantum probability.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.410
And Einstein didn't like that.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.890
He said God does not play dice.

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.690
Bohr, on the other
side of course,

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.120
answered it is not
for us to tell God

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.530
how he should around the world.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.030
All right, so this is the
mystery of quantum mechanics.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.240
We were doing so well.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.920
We'd started with
our cube of ice.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.140
We got molecules of water
in a regular lattice.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.180
We found the mass of
molecules of water

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:26.430
in the protons and
neutrons in it's nuclei.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.940
And now we run into
this sea of confusion

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.770
called quantum mechanics.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.070
I'm going to press
on because, OK,

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.510
the thing about
quantum mechanics

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:39.310
is that it works really well.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:43.050
It is by far and away one of the
best theories of physics that

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:45.510
have ever been designed,
even though it's bizarre

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.790
and nobody understands it.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.710
You think I'm joking.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:50.210
I'm not.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:56.100
There's an extension
of quantum mechanics,

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.800
perhaps less familiar
than some of these things,

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.879
called quantum field theory.

00:29:00.879 --> 00:29:03.420
And one of the first successful
developments of quantum field

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.320
theory was this guy here, the
charismatic American physicist,

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.639
Richard Feynman.

00:29:08.639 --> 00:29:09.930
But there were others involved.

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.630
Julian Schwinger,
Shin'ichiro Tomonaga,

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:15.591
and an English physicist called
Freeman Dyson were responsible

00:29:15.591 --> 00:29:16.590
for putting it together.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.512
It's called quantum
electrodynamics.

00:29:19.512 --> 00:29:20.970
And the subtlety
and sophistication

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.800
of quantum electrodynamics
is a thing to behold.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.880
I think Feynman once said that
the predictions, the things you

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.830
can calculate with
quantum electrodynamics,

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.760
is like knowing the distance
from San Francisco to New York

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.290
to within the width
of a human hair.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:38.460
It is so precise
that you can't but

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.540
accept that this version of
quantum field theory is--

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.236
it's got some
essential truth in it,

00:29:45.236 --> 00:29:47.110
despite the fact that
we don't understand it.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.460
And that was fine.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.040
QED worked really well.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.900
But then when
physicists' theories

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.130
started to assemble about 20
years after this-- something

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:01.500
called the Second
World War intervened.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.650
20 years afterwards,
when theorists

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:06.930
started to try to
create a quantum field

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:12.120
theory to describe protons
and neutrons, they hit a snag.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.440
In the meantime, quantum
waves, by the way,

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.360
so we've not lost the idea of
wave-particle duality in this.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.110
We still have to deal
with this confusion.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.540
It's just that those
wave ideas have

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.490
been translated into a field.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.490
as still an extended,
distributed structure.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.830
We've still got the problem
of the collapse of the wave

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:29.610
function.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.850
We still understand that
an electron field somehow

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:36.030
interacts with the screen and
ends up producing a single dot

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:40.170
over here in a way that
cannot be predicted.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:41.580
There was a problem.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.190
And that is that early
quantum field theories,

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.410
they dealt with only
massless particles.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:51.320
Now the photon is a good
example of a massless particle.

00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.610
And so having got the clarity--

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:57.870
even though I use clarity
probably in inverted commas--

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.480
having got the clarity of
quantum mechanics and quantum

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.267
field theory, we're
now at a situation

00:31:03.267 --> 00:31:05.100
where things have gone
horribly wrong again.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.140
And we've lost sight of mass.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.930
We cannot get to the mass
of protons or neutrons,

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.800
even though we know that
these things do have a mass.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.530
So what do we do?

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.420
Well, actually, the
first thing to do

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.878
is to actually understand what
a massless particle actually

00:31:17.878 --> 00:31:19.804
looks like.

00:31:19.804 --> 00:31:21.220
And for that, I'm
afraid I'm going

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.310
to have to ask you to indulge
me a little bit of Einstein's

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.810
special theory of relativity.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.240
I promise it won't
hurt too much.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.220
So here's a particle,
very simply conceived.

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:34.720
It's a billiard ball type thing.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:35.560
It has a diameter.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.750
I've called it d0.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.760
You with me?

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.770
OK, I'm going to push
that particle to travel.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.470
It's travelling
with a velocity, v.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:49.550
And I'm going to push that
particle so that it moves

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:53.140
at ever-increasing speeds
up to the speed of light,

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.190
which is given the
special symbol, c.

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:59.250
All right, now to understand
what goes on, I need

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:03.660
to recognise one of the effects
of Einstein's special theory

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:08.910
of relativity is that distances
contract, and time dilates.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.000
Don't ask me to go
into that right now.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.980
But anyone who wants to buy
a beer afterwards for me,

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:17.470
I will happily regale them with
the reason why that happens.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.640
So what we do is we
push our particle.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:26.740
Let's push it to something
like 87% of the speed of light.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.050
This factor here, given
the Greek symbol gamma,

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.969
is called the Lorentz factor.

00:32:32.969 --> 00:32:34.760
You don't have to worry
where it comes from

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.870
or what it represents.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.990
You just need to know that it
started off with a value of 1.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.374
And now it has a value of 2.

00:32:41.374 --> 00:32:43.540
And what it means, according
to that little equation

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.220
up there it means
that the diameter

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:49.430
of this particle in
the direction of travel

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:54.400
has compressed to half
its original diameter.

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.540
That's special theory
of relativity for you.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:00.741
Push it a little bit further,
now 98% of the speed of light--

00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:02.490
by the way, we're
getting now to the kinds

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:06.870
of speeds at which protons are
hurled around the Large Hadron

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.190
Collider at CERN.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:12.120
They get up to about 99%
of the speed of light.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.390
We see now that this
Lorentz factor, gamma, is

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:18.330
moved to a value of about five.

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.230
That means the diameter
of this particular

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:23.490
is a fifth of its original
diameter in the direction

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.230
in which it's moving.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.640
I think you can
figure out what's

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.230
going to happen if
we push this all

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.700
the way to the speed of light.

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:36.710
We're going to end up with the
thing going off the top there.

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.920
And we end up with,
effectively, a dimensionless,

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.790
a two-dimensional particle,
if that makes sense.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.600
Now in truth, we
can't accelerate.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:48.970
We can't move particles with
mass at the speed of light.

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:53.034
Only massless particles
can travel at this speed.

00:33:53.034 --> 00:33:53.950
It's a characteristic.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:56.440
And by the way, massless
particles only ever

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.960
travel at the speed of light.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:03.550
OK, so what that means is a
massless particle travelling

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.260
at the speed of light is
flat or two-dimensional.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.310
It's kind of lost
the third dimension.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.725
It cannot possibly exist
in a third dimension.

00:34:13.725 --> 00:34:15.100
And in fact, for
those of you who

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.020
know about light
polarisation, you'll

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.880
know that light
actually has only two

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.460
states of polarisation, which
we can think of, perhaps,

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.530
as vertical and horizontal.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:27.020
There's no light polarisation
in this direction.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:30.790
If this is like travelling
towards you here, it's either--

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:35.170
I always say horizontal when
I do that and then vertical.

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.500
Vertical or horizontal,
there's no polarisation

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.750
in this direction for
the very simple reason

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.449
is that it has no third
dimension to travel in

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.179
or to be polarised in.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:50.199
OK, so that's a
bit of a problem.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.350
So in effect, to
fix this problem

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.739
in quantum field theory in
the early 1950s, what you need

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.300
is a trick.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.660
We need massless
particles going in.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.450
We need something
magical to happen.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:07.860
And we need to get particles
with mass coming out.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.000
You know what this is?

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.310
It's called the Higgs field.

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.320
And the fundamental
particle of the Higgs field

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.080
is this thing called
the Higgs boson.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:23.610
Now here's a dirty little secret
about theoretical physics.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.350
If you're a
theoretical physicist,

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:27.240
sitting down, pondering
great thoughts

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.280
about the nature of
material substance

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:36.270
and elementary
particles, your mission

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:39.480
is to get the maths
to work out correctly.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.520
That's your first priority--

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.320
get the maths to
work in a way that's

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.528
consistent with theoretical
structures that have gone

00:35:45.528 --> 00:35:48.810
before and, hopefully, in
such a way that might give you

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.774
some insights as to
an experimental test

00:35:50.774 --> 00:35:52.440
you can do or give
you something to look

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.690
for in a laboratory like CERN.

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:00.130
But these theorists are
not overly concerned

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:02.970
as to what it means.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.110
And it's then left--

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.640
when these things do turn out
to have a bit of life to them,

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.470
it means that we're
left scrambling

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:14.191
to try to understand
what on earth this means.

00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:15.690
As far as they're
concerned, they've

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:17.670
got a mathematical trick.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.800
They invoke something
called a Higgs field,

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.816
and, suddenly, mass is
switched on as a result.

00:36:22.816 --> 00:36:23.940
What is supposed to happen?

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.830
Well, believe it
or not, politicians

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.680
get puzzled by this too.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.680
And if you can cast your
mind back, those of you

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:34.620
are old enough, to another
conservative government that

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.540
actually in the end
became a minority

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:41.880
conservative government under
John Major in the 1980s,

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:43.500
John Major had a
science minister

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:46.510
called William Waldegrave.

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.540
And William Waldegrave
was facing a challenge

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.650
of understanding as to whether
it was worthwhile for the UK

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.820
to continue funding the
European Centre for Nuclear

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.620
Research, CERN.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:01.270
I think we spent in those
days about 50 million pounds

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:03.350
on CERN.

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:04.850
And, of course,
the message he was

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:06.558
getting from high-energy
physicists-- oh,

00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:08.290
but we need to find
the Higgs boson.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:11.660
And William Waldegrave says tell
me what the hell this is then

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:15.430
on one sheet of A4 paper.

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.920
And I will give the best entry
a bottle of vintage champagne

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.290
as a reward.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:22.290
And he got many entries.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.110
And in fact, he got
many good entries.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.640
But perhaps the
best one actually

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:28.340
comes from a guy called
Professor David Miller, close

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:32.510
by here at University College
London, who said, well,

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.910
maybe think of it like this.

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:37.070
Imagine a singularly
important personality

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:39.280
in Conservative Party politics.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.720
Thatcher had gone, but
let me tell you now

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:44.490
she was still a force
to be reckoned with.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.870
And imagine that we have a room
here full of Conservative Party

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:48.560
workers.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.730
This is the Higgs field.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:57.630
Now Thatcher, being
two-dimensional and massless,

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.960
comes into this
room of Higgs field.

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.582
And immediately,
the field starts

00:38:02.582 --> 00:38:04.290
to cluster around her
because we all want

00:38:04.290 --> 00:38:06.690
to hear what she has to say.

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.560
We're waiting for her to
pronounce on, you know,

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:11.370
the big political
decisions of the day.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.410
And as a consequence
of this grouping

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.910
or this clustering of the field
around a massless particle,

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.290
its motion is impeded.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.830
It can't get through the room
in quite the speed of light that

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:24.150
it was travelling before.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:28.480
And as a consequence,
it has acquired mass.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.410
Now it's an imperfect analogy.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:34.515
But William Waldegrave
kind of liked it.

00:38:34.515 --> 00:38:38.670
Well, OK, so that's how
the Higgs field gives

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:39.870
elementary particles mass.

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:42.100
What about the
Higgs boson itself?

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:47.250
Well, the Higgs boson is
like a softly spoken rumour.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:50.670
Of course, this is clearly
something that's contentious.

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.900
We don't want everyone
to be hearing this.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.020
So as the rumour
goes around the room,

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.800
the party workers cluster
to hear what it says.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:03.000
And that motion, that
clustering of the field itself,

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.570
is the Higgs boson, all
absolutely clear now.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:12.950
Good, all right, so
actually, you know the story.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.690
There was a search
for the Higgs boson.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:18.140
It was discovered
or found in 2012.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:23.360
I, rather incredibly, had a book
about this discovery in stores

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.540
only six weeks after the
discovery was announced.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:27.350
I had an agreement
with my publisher.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:34.660
I will write a book that is 95%
finished, which you then print,

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.600
and then we wait.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.240
And I actually listened to
the live webcast from CERN

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.960
on the morning of
the 4th of July, 2012

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.180
and finished the chapter.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:48.030
And the book was then, as I say,
in the store six weeks later.

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.030
I thought it was quite good.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:56.000
But so finding the Higgs boson
completes the standard model.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.400
Now this is, effectively, the
particle physicist's equivalent

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.840
of the chemist's periodic table.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.450
These are the ingredients
that we need, finally,

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.980
to get to our current
contemporary understanding

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.910
of the nature of matter.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.160
We don't need all this though.

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.180
That's the good news.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.240
We can shrink this down
to just a few bits.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:20.910
What we need is two things
called up and down quarks.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:25.020
These combine in
triplets, in threes,

00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.560
to form protons and neutrons.

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:31.040
So protons and neutrons
are not in themselves

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:34.380
elementary particles any longer.

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.380
We need these things
called gluons.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:37.940
These gluons literally glue.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.580
Physicists have limited
creativity, really,

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.042
at the end of the day.

00:40:42.042 --> 00:40:43.500
When they come up
with these names,

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.170
they are normally
pretty obvious what

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.294
they're kind of getting at.

00:40:46.294 --> 00:40:48.350
So gluons glue the
quarks together

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:52.440
inside protons and neutrons.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:54.014
We need electrons, obviously.

00:40:54.014 --> 00:40:55.430
Electrons are still
the thing that

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:58.070
accounts for most chemistry
and most molecular biology

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.700
at the end of the day.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:04.340
So we need them, and
they form patterns

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:08.180
around the outside
of the atomic nuclei.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:11.120
The force that holds the
electrons and the nuclei

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.460
together is the
electromagnetic force.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:15.350
And that is a force
that's carried

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:19.354
by photons, familiar
particles of light.

00:41:19.354 --> 00:41:21.270
We also need this thing
called the Higgs boson

00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:23.394
because the Higgs boson
is about the Higgs field.

00:41:23.394 --> 00:41:24.810
And the Higgs field
Higgs field is

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:27.030
necessary in the standard
model of particle physics

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.280
to give particles mass.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:37.160
Right, mission
update, are we ready?

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:42.110
So we learned that a
cube of ice consists

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.810
of a lattice of
water molecules, H2O.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.940
We learned that
an oxygen atom has

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.390
a central nucleus with eight
protons, eight neutrons.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.990
Hydrogen atoms have a central
nucleus each of one proton.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:56.990
We drilled into
the proton itself.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.777
[ALARM]

00:42:06.262 --> 00:42:08.258
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:09.755 --> 00:42:13.050
I'm glad you didn't all run
screaming from the room.

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:17.160
Now we have a real problem
because you kind of would

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.560
expect that, if we can trace the
mass of a substance like a cube

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:27.270
of ice to its molecules, to its
atoms, to its atomic nuclei,

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:29.490
to its protons and
neutrons, and we

00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:32.310
learn that protons and neutrons
are themselves composed

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:34.760
of quarks, you might expect--

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.740
now, OK, those quark masses
are coming from interactions

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.640
with the Higgs field.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.500
But let's not get
too detained by that.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.030
They have a mass.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.580
We know what that is.

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:50.010
But when we do the sums, we
find that a mass of a proton--

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.030
only 1% of the
mass of a proton is

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.360
accounted for by adding up the
masses of its two up quarks

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.860
and one down quark.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.300
Something seems to have
gone horribly wrong.

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.820
Fortunately, there was
this guy called Einstein.

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.190
And he wrote a paper in 1905.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.050
And what's Einstein's
most famous equation?

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:10.830
E equals mc squared.

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:12.080
Everybody knows that equation.

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.574
Right?

00:43:14.574 --> 00:43:16.240
Maybe you'd be a
little bit disappointed

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:21.000
to learn that in
his singular paper

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.490
in 1905 about this aspect
of special relativity

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:30.020
that equation doesn't
appear at all.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:34.800
What Einstein discovered, his
big insight, is actually not E

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.660
equals mc squared.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.650
It's this-- m equals
E over c squared.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:45.270
Mass is the measure of the
energy content of a body.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:49.720
Now I've got to tell you--

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.540
I mean who remembers The
Quatermass Experiment on BBC

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.010
television all those years ago?

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:58.260
I see a smile in the audience,
yes, a kindred spirit.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:04.860
Who remembers video footage
of atomic explosions

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.460
in the 1960s, 1970s,
frighten you to death,

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.550
as these bombs got ever bigger?

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:13.950
You take the fission
of a uranium nucleus,

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:19.050
uranium-235 nucleus, and a
fifth of the mass of one proton

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:23.100
is converted into the energy
of an atomic explosion.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.350
You kind of have that almost
cultural understanding

00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:32.250
that E equals mc
squared represents

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.080
the vast reservoir
of energy that

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.730
is somehow locked up in mass.

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:38.820
And when you convert
mass into energy,

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.540
as was done towards the end
of The Quatermass Experiment,

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.140
you get this enormous release.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.440
But that wasn't
Einstein's insight,

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.540
despite the fact that E
equals mc squared became

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:56.610
the most well-known equation in
the whole history of physics.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.110
So here's what's
really going on.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:02.180
It's mass, Jim, but
not as we know it.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.210
The mass, about 1% of
the mass of a proton,

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.930
let's say, comes from
interactions between otherwise

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:15.280
massless quarks and the Higgs
field, which is all around us,

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.870
by the way.

00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:19.570
If it didn't exist, if it were
somehow magically switched off,

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:21.640
we'd all explode.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.550
Well, not in an
spectacular explosion,

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:28.730
but all our particles
would become massless

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:32.650
because there'd be no
mechanism to give them mass.

00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:35.866
So you hope that Higgs
field stays switched on.

00:45:35.866 --> 00:45:37.990
OK, so it comes from the
energy of these particles'

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.790
interactions in the Higgs field.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:40.660
But it's only 1%
of the total sum.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:41.800
Where's the rest of it?

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:43.420
The bulk of the
proton mass comes

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.840
from the energy
of the gluons that

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.120
are dancing back and
forth between the quarks,

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.680
holding them together.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.990
The gluons are
massless particles,

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:57.110
but they possess very,
very, very high energy.

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.110
And once they're all
locked up in the confines

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.690
of a proton or a
neutron, that energy

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:04.565
translates into what we
understand and perceive

00:46:04.565 --> 00:46:05.065
as mass.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.600
Frank Wilczek-- who is one of
the architects of the standard

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.270
model, worked on something
called quantum chromodynamics,

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:16.030
which is a theory that
describes quarks and gluons--

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:17.030
put it this way.

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:19.630
"If the body is a human body,
whose mass overwhelming it

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:22.090
arises from the protons
and neutrons it contains,

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:23.740
the answer is no
clear and decisive.

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:27.070
The mass of that body,
with 95% accuracy,

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:29.434
is its energy content."

00:46:29.434 --> 00:46:30.850
I would quite like
to do something

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:35.100
about the energy content of
a certain part of my body.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.600
But so far, I haven't come up
with a diet that will actually

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:43.090
disconnect the Higgs field
just in this specific region.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:43.780
But who knows?

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.720
I'm hopeful.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.940
And what this is, it's
mass without mass.

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:51.580
In scrambling to try and
find a way to articulate

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.200
this in the book, I said look.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.210
Mass is not a property.

00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:56.980
Ever since the
ancient Greeks, we've

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:02.310
always understood that atoms
would have weight, weight

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:06.000
or mass being an intrinsic
or primary property

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.760
of these indivisible,
indestructible bits

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.250
of substance.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:14.790
But now we learn that mass
is actually not a property.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:17.940
It's not something
that matter has.

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:21.040
It is rather a behaviour.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.790
It's something that
quantum fields do.

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:31.200
Now this isn't the end.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.970
The standard model
of particle physics

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:36.192
has lots of explanatory holes.

00:47:36.192 --> 00:47:37.650
The one thing that
it doesn't do is

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:41.344
it doesn't explain,
for example, gravity.

00:47:41.344 --> 00:47:43.260
And at the moment, there's
a lot of endeavour.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.634
There's a lot of work going
on, both in the string theory

00:47:45.634 --> 00:47:48.030
community and in another
area called loop quantum

00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:51.270
gravity, to try to devise a
quantum theory of gravity.

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:53.730
There may yet be more to learn.

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.700
However, I'm pretty confident
that our understanding

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:01.140
of matter and the nature of
mass is not going to change

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:03.400
as a result of these endeavours.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:04.890
So get used to it.

00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:07.530
When you climb on the
scales in the morning,

00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:10.740
you're weighing
the energy content

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.770
of the gluons locked
up inside the protons

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:15.430
and neutrons of your body.

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.430
I don't know whether that
will make a difference

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:18.900
to what the scales will say.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:22.881
But sometimes, a bit of
enlightenment is a good thing.

00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:23.880
Now I want to thank you.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.005
I've gone on a little bit
longer than I'd intended.

00:48:26.005 --> 00:48:27.470
I want to thank Carlo Rovelli.

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.090
He's an Italian theorist
who very kindly agreed

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:32.120
to read the manuscript
over my shoulder

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.960
and make sure I didn't
commit any howlers.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.340
Latha, Jenny, Phil,
who's in the audience,

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:39.990
are folks at Oxford
University Press

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:42.900
who helped turn my
ramblings into a, hopefully,

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.080
readable book.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.080
My mother, well, we should
all thank our mother.

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.570
Right?

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:51.570
But my mother, who's 80 this
year, I've got to tell you.

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:54.300
She has an endless curiosity.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.010
In her 70s, she
decided that she would

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.260
study for a degree in history
at University of Warwick, which

00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.160
she did part time.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.750
Bless her.

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:03.930
And she agreed to
read the manuscript,

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:06.780
coming back saying,
Jim, why do you have

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.480
to use all these big words.

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.580
Can't you make it just
a little bit simpler,

00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:14.040
which I did try to do.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.690
Martin Davis who
introduced me, thank

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:18.750
you very much for asking me
to come along this evening,

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.607
and of course you for
being so very patient.

00:49:21.607 --> 00:49:22.440
Thank you very much.

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:24.890
