00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.290
A new study finds that if you’re already
intelligent - then taking so-called “smart

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.450
drugs”Modafini could actually make you stupider!

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:15.580
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and with the
school year coming to a close soon, there

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.591
will inevitably be some students who turn
to so-called “smart drugs” to help them

00:00:20.591 --> 00:00:22.000
power through exams.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.040
It’s claimed that one in five students have
taken the smart drug “l” for just that

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.040
reason.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.270
But what if we told you, it could actually
be impairing your performance?

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.230
Well according to a new study, published in
PLOS One, people who are otherwise healthy

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.640
who take the drug Modafinil, could actually
be experiencing the opposite effect of what’s

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.640
intended.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.030
Researchers from the University of Nottingham
recruited 64 participants, in which half of

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.400
them took the drug Modafinil, and the other
half took a placebo.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.440
All of them were given a Hayling Sentence
Completion Test, which is a neuropsychological

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.470
exam that tests your critical thinking response
times.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.010
Unsurprisingly, the participants who took
Modafinil exhibited slower response times,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.630
than people who took the placebo.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.659
And I say “unsurprisingly,” because some
people claim that Modafinil is a “smart

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.750
drug” in part because it slows your reaction
time.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.159
The idea is that that delayed response actually
improves cognitive performance by making you

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.539
less impulsive.

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.399
But the researchers found, that’s not really
true.

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.139
When a task required instant reactions, the
drug just delayed people’s responses - with

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:27.060
no clear evidence of any improvement to cognitive
performance.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.420
Interestingly, previous studies from this
same research group, also found that Modafinil

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.490
impairs creativity and inhibits people from
thinking outside the box - but only for people

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.299
who are creative to begin with.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.719
That same study also found that people who
describe themselves as not particularly creative

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.729
- actually experienced enhanced creativity
while taking the drug.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.889
The author of the study, Ahmed Mohamed, says
this is a widely known effect of “smart

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:53.499
drugs” - or psychostimulants.

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.659
They enhance cognition in people who actually
need it, but for healthy people who already

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.630
operate at optimum levels, they have the opposite
effect - they actually stifle it.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.979
And once you’re at that level, it’s very
difficult for any drug to bring you higher

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:07.139
than where you’re already at.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:08.619
What do you guys think about this?
