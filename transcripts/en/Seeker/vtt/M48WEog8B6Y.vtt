00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.760
What if I told you that one of the cutest
darn animals on the face of the planet was

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.720
a nocturnal and venomous bad ass?

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.720
Behold!

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.270
The fearsome slow loris!

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.880
Awwwwww...

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.220
Hello adorable primates, it’s Natalia but
you can call me Dolores the Slow Loris!

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.140
We all love adorable animal videos!

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.269
And there is one video in particular that’s
won the hearts of millions.

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.119
It features Sonya, a pet slow loris, arms
raised, being tickled by her owner.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.250
Many remark, “man, I want a pet slow loris!”

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.960
And that’s the problem.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.730
First of all, a loris with its arms raised
is actually distressed.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.649
And while the video may seem harmless, it
has also been devastating to the conservation

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.449
of this critically endangered species.

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:49.070
Yes, one of multiple slow loris species, the
Javan slow loris, is on the IUCN top 25 most

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.760
endangered primate species list.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.770
In fact, up to 80% of slow lorises die before
they even reach the market to be sold, so

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.050
slow lorises should never- I repeat- never
be kept as pets.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.539
Ok, I’m going to climb down from my soap
box.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.000
(Natalia hops onto a shorter apple box)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.320
Now that we got that out of the way, let’s
talk about the myriad of ways the slow loris

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.120
is one badass animal.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.130
Oh and loris literally translates to “clown”
in Dutch, so slow lorises?

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.010
Slow clowns!

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.720
But what exactly IS a slow loris?

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.840
Let’s break down some primate taxonomy,
shall we?!

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.840
OK.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.350
Slow lorises are primates that live throughout
South and Southeast Asia.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.220
But they are neither a monkey nor ape, instead
they fall into the category of strepsirrhine.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.750
Y’see, all primates are in the order Primata,
and there are two suborders, haplorhini and

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.750
strepsirrhini.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.240
Monkeys and apes, including humans, are haplorhines
and lemurs, galagos, and lorises are strepsirhines.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.840
Strepsirrhines differ from monkeys and apes
in a bunch of ways and are considered to be

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.000
more ‘primitive’ than their haplorhine
cousins.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.530
Sorry, slow loris!

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.600
Strepsirhines have a wet tip of their nose,
called a rhinarium, kinda like your dog or

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.600
cat.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.140
This is because they rely on their sense of
smell more than their monkey and ape kin.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.500
Some strepsirrhines also have a “toilet
claw” or “grooming claw” to comb their

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.140
dense fur- they’re like the metrosexuals
of the primate world.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.180
The eyes of strepsirrhines also possess what’s
called a tapetum lucidum, a thin reflective

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.510
membrane that amplifies light and helps them
see at night.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.629
It’s this same membrane that allows other
mammals to see well at night, like cats, dogs,

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.830
or Bigfoot- just kidding.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.750
Or am I?

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.400
This comes in handy since many of these strepsirrhines
are nocturnal, including the slow loris.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.310
The tapetum lucidum gives them “eye shine”.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.379
Y’know that creepy eye glare that cats get
at night that makes them resemble soulless

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.340
demons in fur coats.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.590
Their nocturnal nature also explains why these
animals have huge peepers, which let in more

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.590
light.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.340
They’ve been called “little firefaces”
because the shape and the coloration of their

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.629
eyes look like little twin flames.

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.370
Slow lorises are arboreal, meaning they live
in trees.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.499
They spend a majority of their lives moving,
you guessed it, slowly and snakelike through

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:57.650
the forest canopy searching for their favorite
foods- tree sap, insects, flower nectar, and

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.650
fruit!

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.760
The reason they appear to move ‘snakelike’
is they actually have extra vertebrae compared

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.930
to other primates.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.879
And they have the one of the longest tongues
of primates which allows them to enjoy their

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.849
favorite foods, like flower nectar!

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.780
But here’s the weirdest thing about slow
lorises: they’re the ONLY venomous primate

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.780
in the world!

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.909
Well, except for me before I have coffee in
the morning.

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:18.730
Rar.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.870
Unlike me though, the slow loris has a gland
in the inside of it’s elbow called the brachial

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.870
gland.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.409
This secretes a pungent fluid that it rubs
on branches to communicate with other slow

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.409
lorises.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.550
The fluid also happens to be poisonous and
includes an allergen that is similar to the

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.049
Fel d 1, the allergen in cat saliva.

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.540
So it’s even more dangerous if you’re
allergic to cats.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.889
And since the slow lorises lick their brachial
gland throughout the day, if they were to

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:43.680
bite you with their extremely sharp teeth,
you would most likely go into anaphylactic

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.680
shock.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.269
In fact, one of the cruelest parts of the
slow loris pet trade, is that their teeth

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.489
are cut down to render them harmless.

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.010
This is a painful process and once done, they
are unable to defend themselves if they are

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.639
ever released into the wild.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.069
So, slow lorises are pretty badass, but they’re
also on the brink of extinction because of

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.709
hunting and the pet trade.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.560
Moral of this story: they may be ridiculously
cute, but should NEVER be kept as pets.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.930
It’s cruel for them and potentially dangerous
to you!

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.280
The slow loris may be nocturnal but humans,
not so much.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.200
