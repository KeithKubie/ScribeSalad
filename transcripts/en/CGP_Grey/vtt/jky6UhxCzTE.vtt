Hello YouTube subscribers

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.280
Right now, our relationship is a bit, complicated.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.090
While it feels like just the two of us, me
making videos for you, there's really three

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.090
of us.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.460
And for you to be able to watch one of my
videos, three things need to happen:

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.460
1.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.460
I make the video.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.550
2.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.089
I have to put it somewhere.

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.990
That's YouTube for a variety of reasons.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.990
3.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.029
You need to be told that the video is up.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.279
The internet is a big place and it's easy
to miss stuff.

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.679
This last part is, presumably, why you're
a subscriber and why, hopefully, you're seeing

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:29.679
this video.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.260
But I hear from a lot of people that the message
about a new video being up doesn't always

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.260
get though.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.650
Now I don't want to point any fingers or anything,
*but that's totally on YouTube*.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.690
For whatever reason, they've had a bit of
a history when it comes to *not* always sending

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.620
notifications to subscribers.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.800
Like my last video which went up in the middle
of some huge technical problem with subscriber

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800
feeds.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.060
This kind of thing has been going on for years.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.890
Also, YouTube has been going the FaceBook
path of deciding for you what you want to

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.059
watch, instead of just showing you the stuff
you subbed to.

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.119
So they might just ignore what you've subscribed
to for their own business reasons which turns

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.600
the subscriber button into more of a suggestion
from you rather than a request.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.119
And, because I don't have a way to talk to
you directly, YouTube can, at any time, for

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.999
any reason, basically just shut down a channel.

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.999
Just done.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.350
That's a lot of power that I hope they'd never
lean on in a negotiations with creators.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.350
But anyway:

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.289
I've been thinking about this a lot and I've
figured out a crazy technological solution

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.429
to all of the above: it's called email.

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.450
Yeah, seriously.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.969
I know email feels like barely post-industrial
technology at this stage, but I've been testing

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.069
it out with several tens of thousands of people
and it's working great.

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.229
If you want to always see the things I've
made, click this button, enter your address,

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.850
and I can just tell you when I've made things.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.850
It's amazing.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.780
And we don't have to rely on YouTube to pass
notes for us.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.069
It makes our relationship direct and clear.

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:57.499
And I've spent a lot of time figuring out
how to make it work best for you.

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:05.670
Click here to try it out.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.670
...

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.670
Still here huh.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.200
Not sure quite why...

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.620
Guess I should say something...

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.370
Well, I've been thinking about the relationship
between creators and audiences for a while

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.370
now.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.440
I've written about it here, and spoken with
Brady, my podcast co-host about it here and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.440
here.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.459
If you're interested, you can click and check
those things out as well.

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.959
Still watching, huh?

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.470
Well this is getting weird, so I'm going to
just end the video now.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.520
Bye...

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.569
Seriously.
