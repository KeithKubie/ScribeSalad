JENNA TAYLOR: Hello.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.180
Welcome, everyone, to
the teaching kitchen

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.050
at KitchenSync.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.170
My name is Jenna Taylor.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm a food services manager
here in Mountain View,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.140
and I want to thank you all
for joining us here today.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.620
This teaching
kitchen is special.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.720
It was the first of
its kind at Google.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.550
Since it opened, we've built
another one in Pittsburgh.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.720
We're planning for Seattle,
Kirkland, New York, hopefully

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.570
others.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.510
The food program at Google
invests in these spaces

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.060
because food literacy
and engagement are really

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.900
at the heart of our mission,
which is ultimately to enable

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.790
Googlers to be at their best.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.030
So yes, we provide
you with great food,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.870
but it's also important
to us that we empower you

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.140
with the knowledge and
skills necessary to make

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.640
delicious, nutritious food at
home and in your communities,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.840
because really we believe
that cooking together

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.870
builds community.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.820
It enables collaboration,
and it gives you another way

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.940
to be creative and innovative.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.930
The bonus is spaces
like this also

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.080
give us a place
to welcome experts

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080
from the culinary industry.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.910
So today we are very privileged
to have Zagat Guest Chef Scott

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.370
Daigre with us.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.752
Join me in welcoming
him, please.

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:15.710
SCOTT DAIGRE:Thank you.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.210
Thank you.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.560
JENNA TAYLOR: Scott has a
very diverse background.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.060
He's a landscape
designer, a farmer,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.220
an avid gardener
He's a chef, and now

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.610
author of "Tomatomania!"
which I'm sure you're all

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.530
as excited as I am about.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.740
He started out, really,
with the seedling sale,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.440
wildly popular in
southern California.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.300
Same name, still run that today.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.460
Only now, he's further
sharing his passion

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.790
by coming out with the
book, "Tomatomania!"

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.250
It's really supposed to be a fun
and beautiful guide to growing,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.540
preparing, cooking
tomatoes, all things

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.876
summertime and
deliciousness, so I can't

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:56.000
wait to hear more about it.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.958
SCOTT DAIGRE:Thank you.

00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:57.660
Thank you.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.000
Thanks again, everybody.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.730
Yeah, I loved-- there's nothing
better than being in a room

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.780
with a bunch of tomato
maniacs, you know?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.660
What can I tell you?

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.870
And it was nice to meet so
many of you out this morning,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.036
out in the-- the Growglers
out there in the gardens.

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:14.562
It's an amazing thing to be able
to grow, to eat what you grow,

00:02:14.562 --> 00:02:16.770
and then get inspired by
eating and grow more things,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.730
and you know, there you are.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.380
We did this.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.850
We did this book to
inspire with easy things.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.780
This is not a super
complicated situation.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.610
It really isn't.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.151
It's an easy thing
that hopefully you

00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:31.460
can take cues from your garden.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.370
You'll see we have a few riffs,
a few variations on what we're

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.020
going do.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.790
And the recipe that
we're looking at today

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.870
is called New
Tomatoes Rockefeller.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.080
I grew up in Louisiana, so
the first dish I ever remember

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.280
was oysters Rockefeller from
Antoine's in New Orleans.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.410
Have you ever been?

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.910
Go.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.930
Put it on your lists right now.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.100
Enter it in your phones.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.930
That was a very
key thing for me.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.195
It was something I remember
from being this big,

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:56.820
and when we put these
together, I said,

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.910
geez, I really like that,
and it's my first memory.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.201
What could we do with tomatoes?

00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:02.070
So Jenn Garbee, my
co-author, and I,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.910
put together a new
tomatoes Rockefeller,

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.680
and that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.170
So I look forward
to showing you this.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.336
We'll go through some steps.

00:03:08.336 --> 00:03:10.750
Thanks ahead of time to the
wonderful staff and chefs

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.380
here who have taken good care
of me and made this easy to do.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.000
And we'll give you the--
we'll give you the go around.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.700
You know what it all
begins with, obviously.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.700
Tomatoes, OK?

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.660
No two ways about that.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.618
It begins with tomatoes,
but the thing about it

00:03:24.618 --> 00:03:27.410
is, you know, as you
well know, probably, you

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.290
can get lots of different
kinds of tomatoes

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.790
that you might grown
in your garden,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.770
or find it anywhere with the
nursery if you're growing it,

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.790
the grocery store, if
you're buying them.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.530
So it depends.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.870
The beginnings of this recipe
start with what tomatoes

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.840
we're going to use.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.640
If you're using a big
fat tomato like this,

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.870
we're putting these in the oven.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.328
And we're basically going to
roast them like a roasted bell

00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:50.440
pepper, so if you've got a big,
soft, flat heirloom like this,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.954
it's not going to
hold up so well.

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:53.370
You have to be
careful about that,

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.830
especially if it's overripe.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.650
Overripe ones are just
going to be really flat when

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.733
you get them out of the
oven, because they're just

00:03:58.733 --> 00:03:59.790
going to sink away.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.700
And conversely, if
you buy something

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.030
at the store-- you're familiar
with this, that number,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.820
aren't you?

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.930
You're familiar with that guy,
the round, kind of pellet size

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.360
hard thing that we find in
the stores most of the year,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.427
unfortunately, and don't
grow in our own gardens,

00:04:12.427 --> 00:04:13.760
but this is quite useful for us.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.420
And we're going to do
a combination today,

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.044
because it works for
us in the kitchen,

00:04:17.044 --> 00:04:18.832
and we'll talk
about that as we go.

00:04:18.832 --> 00:04:20.290
The first thing
that you want to do

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.290
is you want to create the
boat that you're going

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.074
to put this whole item in.

00:04:24.074 --> 00:04:26.490
Again, it could be a large
boat, it could be a small boat.

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.823
You could even do these with
cherries if you got really,

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:31.390
really, really, really
careful, but the first thing

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.600
that I've done here
with these is obviously

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.910
I'm going to scoop them out.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.400
And what I get
when I find this--

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.010
the book tells you to scoop
these out and use the innards.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.840
When you use this from
the grocery store,

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.350
and you get this
really hard core,

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.740
it's really not very good
for you, or good to you,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.160
and it's really
hard to work with.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.430
So I'm going to totally cheat
today, because, again, I

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.430
want to use something
that I bought at the store

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.520
for its firmness.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.290
And I want to use some beautiful
heirloom tomatoes over here

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.100
for the actual-- for the
actual stuffing that we're

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.100
going to eat, or most of
the stuffing that we're

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.780
going to eat.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.920
When you scrape out a
tomato, you obviously

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.650
are going to take
out all the seeds,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.690
and you're going to take out as
much of the juice as you can.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.196
You want to set these face down.

00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:12.570
You can set them
anywhere, right?

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.940
Set them face down and let
them drain just a little bit,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.430
so you get some of that
moisture out there.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.090
And what you'll also have to
choose as you go through this

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.840
is where you cut this tomato,
where you cut it in half.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.280
You can make them super flat
and small, so little, bitty

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.460
appetizer, you know,
like a smaller appetizer

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.410
kind of a thing.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.416
Or just a little bitty taste,
or if you get these big ones,

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:33.790
you just take off
that top level.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.540
And you've got quite
a hefty monster there

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.400
that you can fill with
all this good stuff

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.090
that we're going to add.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.210
So again, you continue to do
as many as you want there.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.870
The recipe that we're working
with in this book makes

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.350
8 to 10 servings,
which would be 8

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.010
to 10 finished halves, or
2/3, or whatever it is you

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.566
want to do.

00:05:51.566 --> 00:05:53.440
After you drain those--
and I don't have time

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.110
to fully drain
them today-- we've

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.900
got the oven set at 400 degrees.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.240
That's where you start.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.420
Good, round number.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.170
And I'm going to put these in
there for six to eight minutes.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.259
Don't let me forget, OK?

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:06.550
Because that would be terrible.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.591
But anyway, you're going
to put them in the oven,

00:06:08.591 --> 00:06:11.650
and you're just going to let
those heat up just a little bit

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.630
and soften while we move
on to the next part of what

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.740
we're doing.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.840
The dressing.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.660
It begins here.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.040
Do you know what fennel is?

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.030
Do you know fennel is?

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.224
Beautiful, frothy kind of a
plant, good bug attractant,

00:06:26.224 --> 00:06:27.890
really good for you
gardeners out there,

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.770
if you want to get a
good, healthy garden.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.010
We're going to start with
a teaspoon of fennel seed.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.042
This is whole fennel
seed, all right?

00:06:34.042 --> 00:06:36.250
And if you don't-- if you've
ever worked with-- well,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.940
it's just like-- getting
ground fennel in a canister

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.964
or in a little glass bottle,
it's kind of like grabbing--

00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:47.380
to me anyway-- grabbing the
tomato from the grocery store,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.790
rather than out
of your backyard.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.540
If you get a whole
fennel seed, you

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.530
had the advantage of
being able to crush it

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.210
and getting all those really
wonderful flavors immediately

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.970
escaping from the seed.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.270
So you have an opportunity
to do a little more with it.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.399
This is a hot-- they tell
me this thing is hot.

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.190
I don't really believe
that because there's

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.980
no fire involved, but they
tell me it's very hot.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.980
So we're moving on that.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.330
Now, I don't know
if you can smell it,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.454
but I can already smell it.

00:07:12.454 --> 00:07:14.750
And all we're doing is we're
going to shake this around

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.330
for a minute or two, and we're
going to toast these slightly.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.955
And what you're doing
is you're coaxing

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:20.650
a little flavor out of there.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.060
And then what we're-- can
you see that smoke coming out

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.680
of there?

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.305
Can you see it?

00:07:23.305 --> 00:07:24.100
Watch it closely.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.750
Watch closely.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.000
I'm about to do a magic trick.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.540
There it goes, and you
can see it start to toast.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.190
And you really are just going
to do this for a couple minutes

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.060
at the most.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.080
They won't change color.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.580
They might darken just a little
bit, but what you are doing,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.650
you're just creating something
kind of cool and different.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.233
For those of you who
don't cook a lot,

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:42.470
this is kind of an easy
way to get a big wow,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.830
and fennel, this
taste of fennel,

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.340
it's going to be very
pervasive in the dressing.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.270
And it's what you want.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.851
What we used here
was about a teaspoon.

00:07:51.851 --> 00:07:53.350
If you're not a
fennel lover and you

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.150
want a little bit
of this taste, only

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.940
use half of that, because it
is a very pervasive, pervasive

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.560
taste.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.580
All right, it's smoking.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.450
These have darkened
a bit, and I'm

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.010
going to set those
out there to cool.

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.261
And we're going to move
on to to the rest of this.

00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:07.260
How am I doing on those?

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.780
OK, two minutes in
on the tomatoes.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.330
We're good to go, so
they're in the oven there.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.360
They're just fine.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.577
All right, we've got
our toasted fennel.

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.160
The next thing that I would do
normally-- and thank you, chef,

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.701
for taking good care
of me-- would be

00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:20.630
to toast a little bit of bread.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.717
Now, just like everything
else, the fresh tomato

00:08:23.717 --> 00:08:25.300
and everything else,
good, fresh bread

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.160
is always going to get
you the best results.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.109
So find some great, fresh bread.

00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:32.650
If you don't have
that, day old bread

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.140
works as well, because
it's getting a little hard

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.919
and getting a little stiff,
and that's just fine.

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:39.330
You can use whatever you've got.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.740
Slice it up, tiny, tiny pieces.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.980
That's easier to work with.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.000
Again, you're not working with
a football or a basketball here.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.570
You're working
with a very-- oops.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.360
You're working with a very
small little container.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.090
Make them small.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.100
This makes it more
variable or versatile

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.679
when you get back into the dish.

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:58.220
So all you need to do-- this is
what the chefs did here-- was

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.220
cube the bread, put
it on a flat tray,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.420
pop it into the oven
for just five minutes,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.032
and it firms up a
little bit more.

00:09:04.032 --> 00:09:04.990
And you're ready to go.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.490
You don't want it
to be really hard.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.080
It's going to get covered with
sauce, with dressing-- sorry,

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.120
and you want it to get a
little-- you want it to soak up

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.160
a little bit of that,
so you don't want

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.600
it to be too terribly hard.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.520
So that would've been step two.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.520
Step three, moving
on to the dressing.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.847
do you guys know what this is?

00:09:22.847 --> 00:09:23.680
I love these things.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.680
When you can pull these
out, this is really fun.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.180
Kitchen fun at its best, right?

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.650
A mortar and pestle
is a really cool tool.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.820
If you're lazy like
me, sometimes you'll

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.550
just get a fork,
and you know, make

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.050
the best of it, but
with this thing,

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.540
especially with these
cumin seeds-- oh, sorry,

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.790
the fennel seeds-- and what
you want to get out of it,

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.959
you want to use the
time-tested-- you

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:44.000
getting that there, Mike?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.320
You want to use this
time-tested technique.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.250
You want to smash it.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.300
I don't know if
you can smell that.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.550
Oh, my goodness, the smell
that comes out of there

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.410
when you-- maybe it'll
drift over to you.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.780
But what you want to
do is you're basically

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.807
going to make dust.

00:09:56.807 --> 00:09:59.140
You're making fennel dust
here, and that's what we want.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:01.000
We want it to be really fine.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.600
You don't need it to be--
you don't want any graininess

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.946
in there at all, OK?

00:10:06.946 --> 00:10:08.570
And what you're going
to essentially do

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.490
to start this dressing
is you want a paste.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.990
You want to make a
paste, and that's

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.406
what we're going to do with
the rest of these ingredients.

00:10:14.406 --> 00:10:17.160
A clove of garlic, and
this one you can mash.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.570
And since we're using
the mortar and pestle,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.050
I don't even have to dice that.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.710
I mean, I can, but what
you-- but you can really

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:25.900
use this sort of
like a caveman tool.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.650
So it's kind of-- it's
not very new tech at all,

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.680
but it sure works to
get things ground up,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:35.480
and that's a terrific way
to get this all finished.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.250
All right, so I've
got garlic in there.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.027
I've got my seed, and the
next thing is green onion.

00:10:40.027 --> 00:10:42.110
And we took a medium bunch
of green onions, right?

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:46.730
Chopped them up really fine
into the mix, same thing.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.672
And all this is just going
to-- get back in there.

00:10:49.672 --> 00:10:51.630
It's going to mush
together, mush all together.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.880
There's no fancy
way to say that.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.736
It's going to mush.

00:10:54.736 --> 00:10:55.985
Let me see what this is doing.

00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:57.270
Oops, wrong oven.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.841
All right, we're getting there.

00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:01.590
Again, if you're using
a big, soft tomato,

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.350
you got to check that more
often, because of course it's

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.155
going to sink even-- it's
going to cook very, very fast.

00:11:07.155 --> 00:11:09.280
So can you see that on the
monitor that's up there?

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.070
I don't know how close
you can see that.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.350
It's not even really
attractive at this point.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.220
But it does smell really
good, and that's what we want.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.420
So again, it's the green
onion, it's the garlic,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.200
and it's the fennel seed.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.950
And you do that as
much as you need to do.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.280
Now, every once in a while
in this mortar and pestle,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.800
especially some of
these have little pits,

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.960
like these sort of rough ones.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.890
Gather that up every
once in a while

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.290
and start over and see if
you can't get it all messed,

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:35.790
you know?

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.570
Get it all back into the mix.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.520
Now, that's not
much of a dressing,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.330
but we're going to add the good
stuff now to make it just so.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:46.430
And I'd better pull
those babies out,

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.820
just so they don't go too far.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.320
JENNA TAYLOR: Scott,
for those of us

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.700
who might not have a
caveman tool like this one,

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.900
is this something you could
do in a food processor?

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.120
A little--

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.940
SCOTT DAIGRE: You can, but then
you've got so much to clean.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.880
What are you going to
do that for, you know?

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.500
JENNA TAYLOR: All those
parts and pieces to clean?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.690
SCOTT DAIGRE: Yeah,
that's the thing.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.734
Food processors, they
scare me, you know?

00:12:02.734 --> 00:12:03.050
This is so easy.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.420
Look at that.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.920
JENNA TAYLOR: But if you want
to go a little more high tech.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.990
SCOTT DAIGRE:Yes,
you could definitely,

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.850
but if you're going to do that--

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.170
JENNA TAYLOR: Fear
not, Googlers.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.700
SCOTT DAIGRE: --if you're going
to do it, up your ingredients.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.990
Like, up your
amounts just a little

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.630
bit because you'll lose it.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:10.930
JENNA TAYLOR: To
really get traction?

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:11.980
SCOTT DAIGRE:Yeah,
you'll lose it.

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.660
Exactly.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.285
You'll double it or
something, and then

00:12:14.285 --> 00:12:16.244
split it before you
put it into the recipe.

00:12:16.244 --> 00:12:17.410
And of course, this is easy.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.980
If you're making this dressing,
it's kind of wonderful.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.842
So I generally make
a lot of it, and then

00:12:21.842 --> 00:12:23.800
use only what you need
for this particular one,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.841
and save it for the rest
of the whatever, a week,

00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:27.190
as long as whatever you got.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:28.600
And I think it'll be great.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.594
See how these have
lightened just a little bit?

00:12:30.594 --> 00:12:31.760
You can see what's happened.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.843
They're warm to the touch.

00:12:32.843 --> 00:12:34.500
In fact, they're pretty soft.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.265
And that's exactly
what you want.

00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:37.140
They can cool or not.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.110
It doesn't matter when
you do this next step.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.400
It's going to be just fine.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.690
So to this beautiful
mixture that I've now

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.236
put in the-- see how much you
lose on those blades of that

00:12:46.236 --> 00:12:46.820
processsor?

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:47.510
See that?

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.580
You lose so much.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.767
This is so much easier,
but anyway, we're

00:12:50.767 --> 00:12:52.100
going to get the liquid portion.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.709
Olive oil, obviously part of
every good salad dressing,

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:56.000
so the olive oil goes in there.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.750
We've used about 3/4 of
a-- or 2 tablespoons,

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.570
excuse me, and Worcestershire
sauce, Worcestershire sauce,

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:02.070
right?

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.590
Right, chef?

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.880
Easy for you to say.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.670
Just a tablespoon in there.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.400
That's going to give us--
that makes our dressing.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.590
Obviously this is what's
going to make it liquidy

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.460
enough to put into our salad.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:20.890
Now it's still pretty pasty,
and that's what you want.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.920
This is the point at which--
and here you go, how could that

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.030
possibly be enough, right?

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.460
Because it looks
pretty small in there.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:27.120
That's OK.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.994
Don't worry about it.

00:13:27.994 --> 00:13:30.810
Just stick to those ingredients,
or to whatever ratio you've

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.870
developed, and
you'll be just fine.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.010
So yeah, it's even
less attractive now,

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.140
but it's going ot taste
really, really good.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.410
So it's all in there,
and we're ready to go.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.840
And now, we get ready
to ready our arugula.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.630
We've used arugula in
the base of this salad.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.540
This is approximately
4 cups, and all

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.910
I'm going to do
to this puppy dog

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.985
is just lightly-- let me
use a little bit more.

00:13:59.985 --> 00:14:01.940
All I'm going to
do here is lightly,

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.515
lightly chop, because again,
we're going into a small space,

00:14:04.515 --> 00:14:06.973
and some of these arugula can
be as wide as that tomato is,

00:14:06.973 --> 00:14:09.677
you know, wide, or more,
so all you're going to do

00:14:09.677 --> 00:14:11.510
is you're going to chop
it just a bit, rough

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.130
chop so that it will
go, it'll fit better

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.350
into that whole situation.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:19.270
All right?

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:22.181
Now, got spinach in the garden?

00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:22.680
Use spinach.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.260
It works wonderfully in this.

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:25.380
Got a favorite kale?

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:26.610
You could even do that.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.947
So again, you know, rules
are rules, but they're also--

00:14:28.947 --> 00:14:30.530
they're pretty much
made to be broken.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.071
So if you've got
it, use it, and this

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:33.810
is a recipe that can
be really, really

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.760
versatile for other
things in your garden.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.670
All right, light chop,
we're good to go,

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.850
and we're going to put
the arugula right there

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.789
into a beautiful bowl.

00:14:46.789 --> 00:14:48.705
Now, we're going to go
backwards a little bit,

00:14:48.705 --> 00:14:52.940
and we're going to
grab the bread, right?

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.010
The cubes that we got?

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.634
I'm going to put in
about half of this.

00:14:55.634 --> 00:15:00.080
Some people don't like bread
in their salads at all.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.150
Some people love it.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.424
Make it work for you.

00:15:02.424 --> 00:15:03.340
Croutons are croutons.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.150
I like them, so we can
put a lot in there.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.237
I'm going to add a
little bit of pepper,

00:15:09.237 --> 00:15:11.070
and I'm going to add a
little touch of salt.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.528
And I'm actually going to put
a little salt in the dressing

00:15:13.528 --> 00:15:16.710
too, since I want that to
be sharp enough, right?

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.396
And then the last, we
had two more ingredients

00:15:19.396 --> 00:15:20.020
to put in here.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.900
The last is-- this is
a crumbly goat cheese.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.780
Works perfectly.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.880
Feta works as well.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.000
We've used that before.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.080
The other day I
made this for family

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:33.590
with a great Humboldt, a
great cowgirl creamy Humboldt,

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.181
and it was amazing.

00:15:35.181 --> 00:15:36.430
Just be sure to chop it small.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.388
You don't want a big old
hunk of cheese sitting

00:15:38.388 --> 00:15:39.937
in the middle of this tomato.

00:15:39.937 --> 00:15:42.270
So as long as you chop it
small, it's going to be great.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.170
And it's going to mix
in really, really well.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.128
So a little bit of-- just
a little bit of this.

00:15:46.128 --> 00:15:49.460
We're going to add this on
top as well after this all

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.170
gets done.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.430
Now the part where I
cheated, when I emptied out

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.230
the tomatoes-- again,
if you buy a store

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.670
bought tomato, that's
got so much core.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.830
It's a commercial variety.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.510
They're fine.

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.030
They're just a little
different than what

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.140
you're going to
grow in your garden,

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.556
but there's not
much there to use,

00:16:04.556 --> 00:16:06.740
and I want to put
tomatoes into the mix.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.102
So what I did was we
chopped up an heirloom,

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:12.060
so we took that beautiful--
this is an heirloom

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.540
called Gold Medal.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.670
There's so many beautiful
heirloom varieties,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.980
and I mean come on, that's
kind of amazing, right?

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.720
So to get the most
out of this thing,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.720
why would I want an
industrial strength tomato

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.780
with not much taste, when I
got this going on in the spring

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.754
or in the late spring
and in the summer?

00:16:26.754 --> 00:16:28.170
So I'm going to
take this, and I'm

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.430
going to use about a handful.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.012
How's that for being exact?

00:16:32.012 --> 00:16:33.470
And if it's me,
I'm using more just

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.705
because I want-- just
I want more of that,

00:16:35.705 --> 00:16:36.580
and this is the base.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.500
This is a beautiful
base of what's going on,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.030
so you're going to put this in
here, and mix it up slightly,

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.110
and make a complete mess.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.600
And this is where your
salad dressing comes in.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.830
So claim all of
that off the sides

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:56.250
of the mortar and the pestle,
and mix that puppy dog in there

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:56.890
just so.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:00.120
And like I said, you make this
little mound of paste in there,

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.120
and it sure doesn't look
like a lot of dressing,

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.470
but it goes a long way.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.589
So I tend to like a lot
of dressing on salads.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:07.986
Again, your call.

00:17:07.986 --> 00:17:08.819
You can do whatever.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.380
You just want it glossy.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.280
You just want it glossy,
and this is so easy.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.359
You can do it with your fingers.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:14.520
You can make it, you know.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.520
Have fun in the kitchen.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.346
Play, get messy, and this
is the base of the salad.

00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:20.970
Now it's really great
in these tomatoes

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.094
when it's cooked because
the arugula will cook down

00:17:23.094 --> 00:17:24.750
a little bit, and it'll soften.

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.880
And that's what we want.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.970
That's what we want
to have happen.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.120
Dynamite salad.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.580
Forgetting everything else, this
is a really dynamite little mix

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.570
for anything.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.700
A little side, a little
anywhere you want to do that.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.450
So can you see how
that's just glistening?

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.800
It's just barely there.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.550
So it's not really wet,
and we're ready to go.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:52.050
And this is where we go back
to our initial cut tomato.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.330
Very simple.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.560
Guess what happens next?

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.270
You take all that
beautiful mixture,

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.554
you stuff it in
there, all right?

00:18:01.554 --> 00:18:03.470
Some will come out more
beautiful than others,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.454
and that's all right.

00:18:05.454 --> 00:18:07.370
And in the end, you guys,
what we'll generally

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.570
do when you plate
this or whatever,

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.730
you can put it in-- what's
really a really cool way

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.870
to do this is in a
mound of brown rice,

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.540
or like some wild
rice, or something.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.400
We just put it in there
and set these puppies up so

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.204
that they don't fall over.

00:18:20.204 --> 00:18:22.620
If you're using some varieties,
you can use some varieties

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.237
and even cut them
on end, so that you

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:26.195
have a flatter profile.

00:18:26.195 --> 00:18:27.520
Where'd that other one go?

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.502
And you're good to go.

00:18:29.502 --> 00:18:30.460
So this is going to go.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:36.060
Again, if I was being a
little bit more spare here,

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:40.220
we could get these through
probably six to eight tomatoes.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:45.690
So that's your pre-done
tomato, and you

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.792
can-- sometimes we'll add
a little bit more goat

00:18:47.792 --> 00:18:48.750
cheese on the top here.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:50.958
I'm going to wait till the
end to do that today, just

00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:53.010
so it doesn't totally
melt all over everything.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.410
And it'll look a little
puffy and fun and all of that

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:58.270
up on top of everything.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.020
Turn the oven down
to about 350, so you

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.490
don't scorch these, which
isn't that much difference,

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.290
but it does make a
difference in the end.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.570
And you only want these
in for just a few minutes.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.064
If you put them in when
the tomatoes are warm,

00:19:10.064 --> 00:19:11.730
you can really do
just a couple minutes,

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.729
and you're pretty good.

00:19:12.729 --> 00:19:13.770
You want to keep a watch.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.561
You want to keep an
eye on it and make sure

00:19:15.561 --> 00:19:18.590
that the arugula should
be all wet, right?

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.284
It should be all-- sort of
have the olive oil all over it.

00:19:21.284 --> 00:19:22.700
It shouldn't be
scorching, but you

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.533
don't want it to look
like yesterday's news.

00:19:24.533 --> 00:19:27.130
So you want it
softening just a bit,

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.737
and then you're then you're
kind of raring to go.

00:19:29.737 --> 00:19:30.570
You're raring to go.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.569
While that's in there,
anybody got any questions

00:19:32.569 --> 00:19:34.642
about tomatoes in
general, growing them?

00:19:34.642 --> 00:19:35.850
Who's got them in the garden?

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.280
I know a lot of you do.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.380
I know a lot of you do.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.300
What are you thinking?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.342
What can I help you with?

00:19:41.342 --> 00:19:42.925
You guys, at this
point in the season,

00:19:42.925 --> 00:19:45.150
you know, we're at midpoint
in the tomato season now.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.400
There's lots of things, funny
looking things on leaves

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.645
and, you know, all over
the place that, you know,

00:19:49.645 --> 00:19:50.270
that are there.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.890
Do you have a curly top
question over there?

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:52.070
JENNA TAYLOR: So what's the
well, what's the question?

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.903
AUDIENCE: How long--

00:19:54.567 --> 00:19:56.900
SCOTT DAIGRE: How long will
tomatoes last in the garden?

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.900
What a great, great question.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.150
Thank you, Eva.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.260
Tomatoes last in
the garden as long

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.006
as you plan for them to last.

00:20:04.006 --> 00:20:05.130
And that's the bottom line.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.010
There's a strategy involved
with growing tomatoes.

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.120
Did you ever develop one of
those when you-- come on.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.411
You guys know about strategies.

00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:11.720
You know about this.

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.850
Well, there's a strategy
in the tomato garden too.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:16.760
If you want a long season,
you start right at the cusp,

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.340
right at the beginning of the
first available time, right?

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.860
When the temps, when the
nighttime temp-- and this is

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.850
a foul one, because our
nighttime temperatures,

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.240
above 55 degrees is
what we should be doing,

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.430
but that never really happens
until way late in the season.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.040
But when your
daytime temperatures

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.780
are remarkable enough, high
enough so that it makes sense,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.210
for most of you guys,
that would be when, Eva?

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:43.690
You probably plant the-- early
April, early to mid April?

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.670
Well, if you're me in
southern California,

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.857
we can be in March
1, and it really

00:20:47.857 --> 00:20:48.940
depends on where you live.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.430
So you pay attention to that.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.130
Plant at the cusp of the season.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.422
Then wait two
weeks, plant again,

00:20:54.422 --> 00:20:56.130
so don't plant all
your tomatoes at once.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:56.850
Plant three.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.040
Leave a little space.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.840
Plant three two weeks later.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.640
Plant three three weeks later,
and plant one another couple

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.511
of month-- a month after that.

00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:07.010
That way you've got a staggered
situation that will help you

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.676
because you don't
have all your tomatoes

00:21:08.676 --> 00:21:09.970
come in at once, right?

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.080
That's a good thing, but
those later tomatoes,

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.350
because they generally will
start to grow and flower

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.770
in the highest
heat of the season,

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.144
probably won't
produce much then.

00:21:17.144 --> 00:21:19.570
They'll relax, but
they'll be really strong.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.300
As the other ones
are doing this,

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.110
they'll be really strong
as fall temps are cooling

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.568
and they'll come back up and
shoot flower and fruit for you

00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:27.120
again.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.494
So that's a really
good question.

00:21:28.494 --> 00:21:30.280
It's all about what
the gardener decides.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.405
You can decide to have a
really quick short season,

00:21:32.405 --> 00:21:35.200
or you can have-- decide to have
a really great, long season,

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.842
and all your neighbors
will be jealous.

00:21:36.842 --> 00:21:39.050
Why would one tomato get
something that the other one

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:40.660
doesn't?

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.560
Well, why is one of
us cold right now

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.940
and the other one's really warm?

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.740
I mean, that's kind
of what it gets to.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.090
You look down a row of tomatoes.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.760
In our test fields, Tomatomania!

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.450
test fields are full of
things that we can't really

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.210
figure out, because you
got a row of 25 tomatoes,

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:55.390
and two are doing fine.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.650
The next two are doing OK.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.700
The next one died.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.170
Then that's how it happens.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.420
It's kind of an amazing thing.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.370
I was telling this story today.

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.185
That's one thing that sort
of awful pesticides fixed,

00:22:05.185 --> 00:22:05.685
you know?

00:22:05.685 --> 00:22:08.150
You killed everything, and
so everything does well.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.920
Well, we don't love
that so much anymore,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.550
and it is what happens.

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.910
Even the same varieties.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.274
We test grow the same
varieties down a row.

00:22:15.274 --> 00:22:16.690
You see the same
things happening.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:17.499
JENNA TAYLOR: Like
natural selection

00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:18.210
in the tomato community?

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.500
SCOTT DAIGRE: Kind of that, and
we were talking this morning.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.840
Where did the seed come from?

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:23.370
How is it planted?

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.700
What's going on in that
soil versus that soil,

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.670
we never know.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.290
Back to these real
quickly, guys.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.710
That is a finished product.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.340
Now, you see how
light that tomato is?

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.860
That's also-- how kind
of orangey it got?

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.910
That's also a product of
what kind of a tomato it is.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.030
That actually got scorched
a little bit much.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.290
I was chatting too much.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.980
But look, this is
a beautiful thing

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:48.540
that you can use for,
again, just a little side,

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.190
a little appetizer,
or a big appetizer,

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:51.810
if you chose a big-- you know?

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.580
If you choose this.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.960
Imagine that version.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.812
That version of that
would be pretty great.

00:22:57.812 --> 00:22:59.270
And in this one,
you could actually

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.190
scoop it out and use
the inside because it's

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.300
so delicious and nice
and soft, because it's

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.440
a big, beautiful heirloom.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.315
And this is probably
one of the Pink Germans.

00:23:06.315 --> 00:23:07.050
I'm not sure.

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.975
This one wasn't labeled,
but probably one of the Pink

00:23:09.975 --> 00:23:10.850
German, German Queen.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.210
There's a host of
beautiful German heirlooms

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.840
and from all over, or
heirlooms from all over Europe,

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.640
that kind of run
in this category.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:21.550
And they're stupendous
and tasty and amazing.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.710
Yes?

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.170
Heirlooms came into vogue
in the last 10 years.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.870
What's so funny is
that my Tomatomania!

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.500
team and I sat down in
2001, after 10 years

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.410
of doing this event, and
we said, is heirloom over?

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.160
You know, are
heirlooms just done?

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.140
And I guess we didn't have to
worry about that, because it's

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.160
only gotten bigger.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.070
Do you know the difference
between heirlooms and hybrids?

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.550
It's all about the seed.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:43.550
It's all about the seed.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.130
An heirloom is true from seed.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.640
If I grow this and it's a
German Queen, an heirloom,

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.590
if I grow it this year,
and I save seed correctly,

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.900
and I keep that seed
healthy and dry,

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.770
I can grow-- I can plant
it out next season.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.880
I get the same tomato.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.400
That's not true of your
hybrids that we have today.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.919
For no other reason than
the seed is not stable.

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:05.460
A hybrid, like a
Sungold, the world's

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.080
most famous and favorite
tomato, little orange cherry,

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.960
which you've all had.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.580
Beautiful, but if
you save that seed,

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.729
you've got a 33% shot of
getting Sungold next year,

00:24:14.729 --> 00:24:17.020
which for some people isn't
bad, but hey, why don't you

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:17.870
buy the real seed?

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.610
And then it's
planned obsolescence,

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:20.670
is what a hybrid is.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.230
That's what it is, and
that's the only difference.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.430
You could stabilize that seed
over seven to nine generations,

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.190
and then you effectively
have an heirloom,

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.830
because it will
be true from seed.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.850
That's the difference, and
heirlooms tell us a story.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.270
We love them because they're
big and beautiful and not

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.350
so perfect, like a
lot of us, right?

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.500
And they do.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.000
They have a lot of lore and a
little bit more story to them,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:44.760
and we like that.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.970
That's not to say that
hybrids aren't, you know?

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.110
We love our hybrids.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.770
Hybrids are made to be strong,
productive, disease resistant,

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:51.340
you know?

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.210
Find something wrong
in that category.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.370
There isn't anything.

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.490
They're terrific, so we
like to embrace all that,

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.532
and especially if
you're a new gardener.

00:24:59.532 --> 00:25:02.500
If you're a new
gardener, grow hybrids.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.330
Become successful.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.955
That's really what we want at my
event more than anything else.

00:25:05.955 --> 00:25:07.320
We want you to be successful.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.403
So just start with hybrids
and learn how to do it.

00:25:09.403 --> 00:25:12.280
Get it right, and then try the
crazy ones, just, you know--

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.800
and if you have a crazy big
yard, try as much you want.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.300
That's good.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:15.800
Yes?

00:25:19.032 --> 00:25:20.740
JENNA TAYLOR: How do
you propagate those?

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:21.230
SCOTT DAIGRE:How
do you propagate?

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.604
You can do it--
you can obviously

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.870
propagate tomatoes seed to seed,
if you're propagating this way,

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.910
but you can use-- you can cut
and root a stem of a tomato

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.040
very easily.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.820
The stems are hairy, and all
of those hairs turn into roots

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:34.990
very, very quickly.

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:36.540
So if you'll take
a seven to eight--

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.266
you can even let one
of the little side

00:25:39.266 --> 00:25:41.890
branches grow that grows in the
middle of the leaf and the stem

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:42.590
right there.

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:44.580
Wait till it gets
7, 8 inches long.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.530
Put it in a glass of water
for four or five days, a week,

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:48.440
whatever.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.630
Pop it out into the garden.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.660
Cover it for a while and
keep it a little moist.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.230
It'll look like-- it'll bitch
and moan and be all, you know,

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:58.520
look bad for a while, and it's
going to come back just fine

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.446
and be great.

00:25:59.446 --> 00:26:01.070
So they're tough,
and that's actually--

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.980
talk about a long season.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.512
You find a favorite tomato,
take cuttings of that plant

00:26:05.512 --> 00:26:07.720
and put it in your garden
down underneath the mother.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.303
You'll have it as
long as you have it,

00:26:09.303 --> 00:26:11.740
as long as the weather allows,
and that's a beautiful way

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.410
to lengthen your season and
be a real gardener too, right?

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.880
Because that's a real
gardener thing there.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:19.030
All right, anybody else?

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.740
You mean if you're
cooking with it?

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:21.240
Oh, gosh.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.500
Well, you can totally use it.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.000
Look, you can use
it in this recipe.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.290
I'm just being funny, because
I used these today because I

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.581
like the way they keep their
shape, and they're firmer.

00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:29.949
You can totally do it with this.

00:26:29.949 --> 00:26:31.490
You could absolutely
do it with that.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:33.957
You just have to be careful
not to-- it's a little funny.

00:26:33.957 --> 00:26:35.540
You're going to get
into those loaves,

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.710
and it's kind of harder
to clean out, number one.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.360
And you just have to leave
a little bit more skin,

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.070
a little bit more
width on the outside,

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.130
and you'll do just fine.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:44.963
But you do have to watch
it, because they're

00:26:44.963 --> 00:26:46.090
softer from the get go.

00:26:46.090 --> 00:26:48.070
And they'll shrink and just
kind of fall apart on you.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.040
So that's the only
thing, because I

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.456
want you to use
every piece of it,

00:26:50.456 --> 00:26:53.102
but I didn't mean to-- you know,
I just wanted to caution you,

00:26:53.102 --> 00:26:55.060
and I-- again, I think
those look kind of cool.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.560
Given their little red, nice,
little round little boats,

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.529
but you can always
do it with this.

00:26:59.529 --> 00:27:00.820
You can always do it with that.

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:02.520
Other questions, yes?

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:03.440
Oh, green tomatoes.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.689
How do you use green tomatoes?

00:27:04.689 --> 00:27:06.180
They're great in a salsa.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.970
They're really, really
good in a salsa.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.450
Or a salsa-- you know, we've
done all sorts of things

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:15.140
with that, mixed with tomatillos
and doing a whole green theme.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.840
I've heard of people making
green tomato ketchup.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.860
Right?

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.082
Cook it down, soften it up.

00:27:20.082 --> 00:27:21.790
It doesn't taste like
red tomato ketchup,

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.420
I'll tell you that much.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.160
But it's interesting,
and it's different.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.032
And so I think the salsas are
probably your best way to go.

00:27:29.032 --> 00:27:30.490
They're much like
this, only green.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.070
I mean the store bought
varieties, right?

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.319
So you have to probably cook
them a little bit longer,

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:35.420
all of that, but they're--

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.140
AUDIENCE: Would they
taste good like this?

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.520
SCOTT DAIGRE:I don't
know that they would.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.520
I mean frankly, it's going to
be a little bit, a vessel that's

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.570
unfinished.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.874
So it might, you know--
it's going to have a taste.

00:27:43.874 --> 00:27:45.540
Just overdo these
elements a little bit.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.140
A little bit more salt,
a little bit more pepper.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.106
A little bit more zing.

00:27:48.106 --> 00:27:49.480
You can-- you'll
be fine with it.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.140
Yeah, I think it would be great.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.300
Is it OK to put cooked
spinach and tomatoes together?

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.350
I do it all the time.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.460
I'm still standing here.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.960
No, I think it's fine, and
again, you're not cooking.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.550
You're really
warming here, right?

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.080
All you're doing
is kind of having

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.940
it sink down into that
boat a little bit,

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.300
and so that you get
this finished product.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.716
That's really what you're doing.

00:28:09.716 --> 00:28:11.590
And I didn't put goat
cheese on top of there.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:12.410
Doggone.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:14.220
I was going to do that
while it was warm,

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.845
so that's the finishing
touch on these.

00:28:15.845 --> 00:28:16.987
I totally forgot that.

00:28:16.987 --> 00:28:19.320
And there you are, but I think
you'll be fine with that.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.622
And like kale, you know,
kale's a little tougher.

00:28:21.622 --> 00:28:23.580
You might have to cook
that little longer, warm

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:25.710
it a little longer,
and you'll be fine.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:27.640
OK, anybody else?

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.470
Other questions?

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:29.310
Yes, sir?

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.300
How do you eat
tomatoes in winter?

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.170
You don't, you know?

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.490
I think with lots of
seasoning, lots of seasoning,

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.070
or you know, put
them in the freezer.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.900
Hey, hello.

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.820
JENNA TAYLOR: Or can?

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:39.860
SCOTT DAIGRE:Do
you have tomatoes?

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.190
Tomatoes?

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.690
Huh?

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:42.020
JENNA TAYLOR: Or can them?

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:42.410
SCOTT DAIGRE: Can them.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:43.760
You can totally can them.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.820
You can freeze a
tomato just like that.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.890
Open your freezer, or
open your freezer door.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.100
Put it in, and put it
in one of those bins,

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.450
and close the freezer door.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:54.570
Done, and I'm serious.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.740
As you thaw this baby,
the skin sorta fall off.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.240
Boom.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.780
That's one icky job done, right?

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.030
You don't have to blanch and
do all that mess anymore.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:05.384
Seriously, stack them in
one corner of your freezer,

00:29:05.384 --> 00:29:07.050
and they're ready for
you when you want.

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.674
Now, you can't make
a salad out of that

00:29:08.674 --> 00:29:10.080
when you thaw it out, right?

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.049
But you can make a
really nice sauce.

00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:13.340
It locks in the flavors, right?

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:15.730
And it works exceedingly well.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.400
And I don't know if you've
ever heard of tomato water.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.900
Tomato water for cocktails.

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.340
Tomato water for some recipes.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.830
It's basically the clear
liquid that-- the gel and some

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.996
of the liquid that's inside
of there that drains out

00:29:25.996 --> 00:29:27.120
if we were to cut it.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.710
If you use tomato water, and
you have a frozen tomato,

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:32.130
it's the most glorious thing.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:35.690
You pop that in a bowl
or something frozen,

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.560
and you make a few
slits around the bottom.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.830
The tomato melts, and you get
this beautiful, clear, perfect

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:43.270
unsullied tomato
water that's killer.

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.150
So if you use that,
that's a great way

00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:47.300
to use a frozen tomato.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.099
But yeah, seriously, just throw
it in the freezer, you're done,

00:29:51.099 --> 00:29:52.640
and you will have
it all season long.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.880
Just not that great when
you're going to go sort of bite

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.410
into and enjoy the way we
do in the summer, right?

00:29:58.410 --> 00:29:59.920
Yes.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.890
Remove the seeds when
you're cooking a tomato?

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.056
Some people have some people
have trouble with that,

00:30:04.056 --> 00:30:05.660
with seeds in their diet, right?

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.810
Because of gastro issues.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.000
So you can.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.770
I don't.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.270
I never received-- I never
remove the seeds in anything.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.340
I really don't, and
frankly, I like the skins.

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.601
There's a lot of nutrition
right under the skin.

00:30:17.601 --> 00:30:19.350
So when you remove the
skin of the tomato,

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.980
you're kind of removing a good
bit of the-- a good bit of what

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.870
you really want in there anyway.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.290
So I think it's a really-- you
know, I'll puree something.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.880
If the skins bother me,
I'll just puree it all,

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.747
and that way you get
all that good stuff.

00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:32.830
And I hope you enjoy that.

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:37.440
And so I think it's good there.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.310
I don't bother,
but some people do.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:41.820
Some people, you know, people
who know a lot more than me

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.240
about taste say
that the seed, that

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.380
umame that we get in
a tomato is critical.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.677
It's critical to eat the
seed and to get that whole,

00:30:50.677 --> 00:30:53.290
you know, the whole
realm of flavor.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.130
So there you go.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.338
Yeah, I don't leave them out.

00:30:55.338 --> 00:30:57.000
It's mostly because
I'm kind of lazy,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.570
and I don't want to do that all.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.911
But when I get umame on the
top of it, I'm pretty good.

00:31:01.911 --> 00:31:02.410
All right?

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:02.951
Anybody else?

00:31:02.951 --> 00:31:03.620
Other questions?

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:03.930
Yes?

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:04.533
AUDIENCE: With the
seeds, how do you

00:31:04.533 --> 00:31:06.650
harvest it for the next season?

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.530
SCOTT DAIGRE: How do you
harden for next season?

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:11.190
How do you save a seed?

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:12.510
Pretty simple stuff.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:14.420
You take a tomato.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.720
And you do this, right?

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.170
And you get some seeds,
or you get seeds and pulp

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.320
in a small, clear
cup or bowl, right?

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.960
And you get about
half an inch and you

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.850
let that sit outside
for three days.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.270
And it begins to ferment.

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.520
You want to ferment the seed,
because the fermentation

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.960
process causes all that
gel, which is an inhibitor,

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.230
to go away.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.610
So now the seed is bare.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.850
After three or four days,
it's sitting in that gook

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:41.920
for three or four days.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.770
You put it under the
faucet and run it around.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.700
The good seed will
sink to the bottom,

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.420
and the bad seed floats.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.310
Pour that off with the
pulp, and keep doing

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.370
that until you have only seed.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:55.720
Pour it off, dry it out, put
it in an envelope, or some kind

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.930
of a canister with a Kleenex
or some sort of a desiccant

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:01.564
that will take up any excess
moisture, or extra moisture,

00:32:01.564 --> 00:32:02.730
and you're off to the races.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.070
Store it in a cool place.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.947
You can have them
for 10, 15 years.

00:32:05.947 --> 00:32:07.530
They could be viable
for 10, 15 years.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:08.680
Eva?

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.030
Where else should you
find heirloom seeds?

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:14.242
Well, you could Google
it, probably, you know?

00:32:14.242 --> 00:32:16.200
I think you could find--
if you find heirlooms,

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.250
you could find heirloom
seeds everywhere, but yeah.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.240
Thanks to Google, we
can find heirloom seeds

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.395
all over the place, from
the tiniest of suppliers,

00:32:23.395 --> 00:32:25.395
who are doing two varieties
that they're really,

00:32:25.395 --> 00:32:29.310
you know, enamored of,
to Tomato Fest that's

00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.710
out of Monterey, Carmel, right?

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.500
And they have 600 varieties.

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:35.870
600 varieties of seeds.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.640
Lots of information for
you, lots of good things

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.850
that you can learn,
so all over the place.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.620
Tomato Fest, Seed
Savers, there's

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.890
a slew of wonderful people
who are working hard

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.950
to keep all these great
heirlooms alive, right?

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.810
And to keep them
in the marketplace

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:51.280
and keep them viable, and
we're thankful for that.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.920
So yes, plenty of places to
get good seed, all right?

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.670
Plant food or
fertilizer for tomatoes.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:58.314
Mix it up.

00:32:58.314 --> 00:32:59.980
Use a good soil
amendment so that you're

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.331
feeding with the medium
you plant in, right?

00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:03.080
Use a compost tea.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.536
Use a granular that's balanced.

00:33:05.536 --> 00:33:06.410
You want it balanced.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:08.201
You want the numbers
on that fertilizer bag

00:33:08.201 --> 00:33:10.312
to be more similar than
they are disparate, right?

00:33:10.312 --> 00:33:11.020
And change it up.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.061
Do something different so
that you're giving them

00:33:13.061 --> 00:33:15.377
a wide spectrum of
things, or if you have to,

00:33:15.377 --> 00:33:17.460
just use that one balanced
product that somebody's

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.720
already mixed for you.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.810
So it matters not.

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:20.590
It matters not.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:22.770
The key thing about
fertilizer is to use it.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.320
It doesn't matter
what kind it is.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.278
A lot of us buy fertilizer
and put in the shed,

00:33:26.278 --> 00:33:28.030
and there it stays
all season long.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:29.620
And that's the end
of that, right?

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.230
Why didn't my tomatoes work?

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:32.504
Buy it and use it.

00:33:32.504 --> 00:33:33.920
That's how it
works, and you guys,

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.080
if you've never
done foliar feeding,

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.270
foliar feeding is a terrific
way to feed tomatoes.

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.240
It basically is any
solution, whether it's fish

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.840
emulsion-- it's all
nitrogen, so careful-- fish

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.495
emulsion, compost
tea, any of that,

00:33:44.495 --> 00:33:46.900
that you can actually
spray on the leaves

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.200
as well as put in,
soak the roots with,

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.770
and it takes it up both ways.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:54.060
And the tomato is hugely
efficient at using

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.800
fertilizer that's been
put on the leaves, OK?

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.920
JENNA TAYLOR: The Topsy
Turvy hanging upside down

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.030
tomato plants?

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:00.300
SCOTT DAIGRE: Oh,
the Topsy Turvy?

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.290
Ooh, the Topsy Turvy.

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:02.290
Do you know this one?

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.379
The little tiny--
here's my problem.

00:34:04.379 --> 00:34:06.170
The little tiny container
that you're going

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:08.000
to grow a tomato in, right?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.949
I get 50% of people
saying thumbs up,

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:12.764
and 50% of people
saying thumbs down.

00:34:12.764 --> 00:34:14.639
If you're a really good
gardener, and very on

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:16.870
top of it, and you have a
sprinkler system that you

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:18.304
could drip it on, yeah.

00:34:18.304 --> 00:34:19.679
They could be
successful, and you

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.762
don't put them in all day
sun, for goodness sakes,

00:34:21.762 --> 00:34:23.150
because it's a tiny container.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.380
It can work.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:26.889
Choose the right tomato
and be on top of it.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:28.086
You'll be just fine.

00:34:28.086 --> 00:34:28.960
Thank you, everybody.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.210
I hope you enjoyed that.

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.179
It's been such a
blast being here,

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.194
and being on-- seeing a little
bit of what-- where you live,

00:34:35.194 --> 00:34:36.610
and that's, that's
really awesome.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.060
Keep up the good work in
the garden, and you know,

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.334
keep-- but I feel like I
should say thank you for the,

00:34:41.334 --> 00:34:43.250
you know-- being at the
center of the universe

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:44.625
is kind of cool,
and I like that.

00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:45.889
So it's been a pleasure.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:47.909
JENNA TAYLOR: And thank
you for joining us.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:48.380
SCOTT DAIGRE: It's
been a pleasure.

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:49.242
Thank you, Jenna.

00:34:49.242 --> 00:34:49.950
Thanks everybody.

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:53.300
