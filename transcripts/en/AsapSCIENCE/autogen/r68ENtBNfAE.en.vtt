00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.700
 If you are thinking about having children these days or becoming future parents, 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.280
 Many know that fertility decreases with age. 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.640
 So, when should you have children? 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.220
 Is there anything you can do to overcome your biological clock? 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.840
 The menstrual period usually begins in women at the age of 12 or 13 years 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.460
 But most ovaries do not begin to release eggs until several years of this age. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.060
 In fact, women's fertility is only peak when they reach the beginning or mid-twenties. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.820
 Unlike males, they produce sperm continuously 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.720
 Women have a limited number of eggs, but do not worry. 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.560
 Once you reach puberty, you have about 30,000 eggs 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.820
 Much more than the 300 to 400 eggs that are released during a lifetime, 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.440
 However, widespread statistics show that after one-year gestation attempts, 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.580
 A 30-year-old woman has a 25% 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.940
 The rate of failure increases to 44% for a 35-year-old woman, 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.500
 And up to 66% for a 40-year-old woman. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.740
 But most of these data were published in an academic journal published in 2004, concerned with birth records in France 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.820
 Between 1670 and 1830 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.780
 We can say that there have been many changes in the lives and health of women 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.660
 Since the era of electricity, antibiotics and reliable food. 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.440
 It is not related to the number of times sex is practiced and the fact that it gradually decreases with age 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.160
 Recent studies offer a more optimistic look 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.360
 For the percentage of women who are unable to conceive during a year of unsecured intimate relationships 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.660
 By 13% to 14% for women between the twenty-seventh and thirty-fourth 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.760
 And 18% of women between 35 and 39 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.780
 The study continues to show fertility decline 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.380
 But it offers better opportunities than old research has suggested 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.740
 Another study showed that women between 38 and 39 years old 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.200
 Who had previously been pregnant 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.740
 They have an 80% chance of being naturally pregnant within six months 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.100
 This indicates another error in studies 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.120
 Almost half of the pregnancies in America are unintentional 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.220
 This means that most fertile women become inadvertently pregnant 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.740
 While those who deliberately attempt to have children for the first time after the age of 30 are less fertile regardless of age 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.860
 This reinforces the vital role of aging 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.660
 However, older eggs may not be fertilized normally 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.860
 Which increases the proportion of chromosomal changes with age 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.220
 Women at the age of 30 receive 1/800 for a child with Down syndrome 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:14.420
 But the probability increases by the age of forty to reach 1/100 but it remains a chance of 1% 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.120
 But what about men? Many think that man's fertility is limitless thanks to famous examples such as Charlie Chaplin 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.980
 Who gave birth until his 70s 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.980
 While males continue to produce sperm. 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.680
 The greater the cell division, the greater the probability of mutations 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.560
 When the male reaches the age of 50, the sperm cells have undergone 800 cycles of division and multiplication 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.500
 As a result, adult parents are increasingly at risk for children 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.160
 Schizophrenia in personality, autism, cancer, type of dwarfism and fibromyalgia 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.340
 And even skull and facial abnormalities, even among younger parents in the Western world 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.840
 Sperm counts have decreased by 50% in the past 40 years 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.900
 The implications and importance of this have not yet been determined 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.720
 Yet there is still much to learn about raising children rather than living 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.640
 Statistical points indicate that young parents have more energy 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.520
 But older parents have physical maturity and stability 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.580
 Of course high income does not mean good parents 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.780
 But studies have shown that high family income means a high SAT rate 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.480
 Not to mention that in middle and low income countries 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.320
 The chance of death among girls between the ages of 15 and 19 during childbirth is 28% higher for women aged 20 and 24 years 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.000
 Studies have also been found in some sub-Saharan African countries 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.160
 That 25% of girls and adolescents are absent from school because of unintended pregnancy 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.980
 Preserving the eggs of younger women with physical refrigeration is common 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.980
 But it is not guaranteed with age 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.840
 Still affects the success rates of pregnancy and researchers believe that the cooling process reduces the efficiency of oocytes 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.000
 Moreover, this is not an option for most women because the cost of cooling alone is estimated at $ 10,000 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.760
 And a laboratory inoculation cycle, which could cost up to $ 12,000 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.200
 in general . Yes, having children becomes more difficult as men and women grow older 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.520
 But he did not reach the stage of concern imagined by the media 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.720
 Fertility is a variable thing that depends on genes and lifestyles 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.560
 The best time to have children is a very personal decision 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.160
 As in the lack of desire to have children 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.460
 Special thanks to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for their support of this episode 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.820
 Although the world is on a huge road of progress 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.480
 It is important to remember that progress is not inevitable 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:27.400
 This is why the Gates Foundation has created a "Goal Report" that will help raise awareness, sense responsibility and work hard for a better future 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.020
 Did you know that the number of mothers who died during childbirth has halved in the last generation? 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.000
 The Gates Foundation wants to ensure a healthy and continuous life and promote health for people of all ages 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.180
