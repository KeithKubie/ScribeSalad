00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:01.172
- [Voiceover] What I hope to do

00:00:01.197 --> 00:00:03.018
in this video is get
a little more practice

00:00:03.018 --> 00:00:07.430
and intuition when we're
multiplying multi-digit numbers.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.334
So let's say that we wanted to calculate

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:14.117
what 7,000 times six is.

00:00:14.117 --> 00:00:16.008
7,000 times six.

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:18.713
Now, for some of you, it
might just jump out at you.

00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:21.198
That, hey look, if I
have seven of anything,

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:23.068
and here I have seven thousands,

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:25.249
and I multiply that by
six, I'm now going to have

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.069
seven times six of that
thing, or 42 of that thing,

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.087
and in this case we have 42 thousands.

00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:34.073
So you might just be able
to cut to the chase and say,

00:00:34.073 --> 00:00:37.288
hey look, six times seven thousands

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:41.190
is going to be 42 thousands.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.150
And that's great if you can
just cut to the chase like that,

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.473
and another way to think
about it is like, look,

00:00:45.473 --> 00:00:47.529
six times seven is 42, and then

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:49.292
since we're talking about thousands,

00:00:49.292 --> 00:00:50.174
we're not just talking about seven,

00:00:50.174 --> 00:00:51.207
we're talking about seven thousands.

00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:53.169
I have three zeros here,
so I'm going to have

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:56.491
42 thousands, three zeros there.

00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:58.290
But I want to make sure
that we really understand

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.706
what is going on here.

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:01.226
This will also help us with a little bit

00:01:01.226 --> 00:01:03.789
of practice of our
multiplication properties.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:07.612
So 7,000 is the same thing
as 1,000 times seven,

00:01:07.612 --> 00:01:08.936
or seven times 1,000.

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:10.328
It's seven thousands.

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:13.067
Or you could view it as a
thousand sevens, either way.

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:18.067
So this is the same thing as
1,000 times seven times six.

00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:23.145
And so you could view it as, you could do

00:01:23.145 --> 00:01:26.163
1,000 times seven first,
which would be 7,000,

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:27.603
and then times six.

00:01:27.603 --> 00:01:30.552
Or you could do the seven times six first,

00:01:30.552 --> 00:01:31.852
and this is, this right over here

00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:34.010
is the associative
property of multiplication.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.402
It sounds very fancy,
but it just says that,

00:01:36.402 --> 00:01:38.387
hey look, we can multiply
the seven times six first,

00:01:38.387 --> 00:01:40.662
before we multiply by the thousand.

00:01:40.662 --> 00:01:45.358
So we could rewrite this as 1,000 times,

00:01:46.712 --> 00:01:48.493
and if we're going to do
the seven times six first

00:01:48.493 --> 00:01:50.028
we can put the parentheses around that,

00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:52.889
times seven,

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.924
times six.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:59.232
Seven times six.

00:01:59.257 --> 00:02:02.105
Notice, it's 1,000 times seven times six.

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:05.181
I could do 1,000 times
seven first to get 7,000,

00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:08.931
or I could do the seven
times six first to get,

00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:10.440
and you know where there is going,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.507
so if you multiply the
seven times six first,

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:15.466
you're going to get 42,

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:18.079
and you're gong to have 1,000 times 42.

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.203
1,000 times 42.

00:02:20.203 --> 00:02:22.165
So you can view this as a thousand 42's

00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:23.883
or maybe a little bit more intuitively

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:26.100
you could view this as 42 thousands.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.100
So, once again, we get to 42,000.

00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:34.668
And so the whole reason, some of y'all

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:36.061
might have just been able
to do this immediately

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:37.107
in your head and that's all good,

00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:40.020
but it's good to understand
what's actually going on here.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.843
And the reason why I also
broke it up that way,

00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:44.002
this way, is that the
exercises on Kahn Adacemy

00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:46.464
make you do this to make sure that you

00:02:46.464 --> 00:02:49.482
really are understanding how
to break up these numbers

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:53.940
and how you could re-associate
when you multiply.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.298
Let's do another one.

00:02:55.298 --> 00:02:57.101
Let's say that we wanted to figure out,

00:02:57.126 --> 00:02:59.581
let's say that we wanted to figure out,

00:02:59.581 --> 00:03:01.938
let me give ourselves some space,

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:03.286
let's say that we wanted to figure out

00:03:03.286 --> 00:03:05.209
what 56

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.416
times eight is.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.881
And there is a bunch of different
ways that you could do it.

00:03:13.881 --> 00:03:16.436
You could say that, look, 56, this is

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:20.676
the same thing as 50, five tens,

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:25.394
that's 50 plus six ones,

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:30.230
so 50 plus six, and all
of that times eight.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.735
And then you could distribute the eight

00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:37.601
and you could say, look, this
is going to be 50 times eight,

00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:42.118
So it's going to be 50 times eight,

00:03:42.118 --> 00:03:44.637
plus six times eight.

00:03:44.637 --> 00:03:49.372
Plus six times eight.

00:03:49.803 --> 00:03:51.497
And 50 times eight?

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:55.213
Well, five times eight
is 40, but we're not

00:03:55.213 --> 00:03:57.895
just saying five, we're saying five tens,

00:03:57.895 --> 00:04:01.516
so five tens times eight
is going to be 40 tens,

00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:03.919
or it's going to be 400.

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.297
Another way to think about
it, five times eight is 40,

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:08.436
but we're not talking about five,

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:09.875
we're talking about five tens, so it's

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:11.721
going to be 40 tens.

00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:14.333
So 50 times eight is 400, and then

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:19.151
six times eight is, of
course, equal to 48.

00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:24.151
So this is going to be equal to 448.

00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:28.973
This is actually how I
do things in my head.

00:04:28.973 --> 00:04:30.227
When I do it in my head I obviously am not

00:04:30.227 --> 00:04:31.830
writing things down like this but I think,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.753
okay, 56 times eight,
I could break that up

00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:39.513
into 50 and six, and eight
times 50, well that's 400,

00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:41.290
or 40 tens you could say.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.355
Eight times five tens is
going to be 40 tens, or 400.

00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:46.478
And then eight times
six is going to be 48,

00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:48.730
so it's going to be 400 plus 48.

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.892
Once you get some practice you're going

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:52.156
to be able to do things
like this in your head.

00:04:52.156 --> 00:04:55.035
And if it helps, we
can also visualize this

00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:57.669
looking at an area of a rectangle.

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.549
So imagine this rectangle right over here,

00:05:00.549 --> 00:05:05.215
and let's say that this dimension

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.978
right over here is eight,
it is eight units tall.

00:05:08.978 --> 00:05:10.184
So that's the eight.

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:15.184
And this entire dimension,
this entire length here is 56.

00:05:16.453 --> 00:05:19.588
So the area of this rectangle
is going to be 56 times eight,

00:05:19.588 --> 00:05:21.515
which is what we set to figure out,

00:05:21.515 --> 00:05:22.931
and to do that, well we could break it up

00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:26.217
into 50 and six, so this first section

00:05:26.217 --> 00:05:30.512
right over here, this has length,

00:05:30.512 --> 00:05:32.984
we could say this has length 50,

00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:36.166
that has length 50, and
then this second section,

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:38.175
this has length six.

00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:39.034
This has length six.

00:05:39.034 --> 00:05:40.252
And the reason why we broke it up this way

00:05:40.252 --> 00:05:42.226
is cause we can, maybe in our heads,

00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:43.433
or without too much work, figure out

00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:44.849
what eight times 50 is and then

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.056
separately figure out
what eight times six is.

00:05:47.056 --> 00:05:48.751
So separately figure out the areas

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.724
of these two pieces of the big rectangle

00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:52.453
and then add them together.

00:05:52.453 --> 00:05:55.344
So what's eight times five tens?

00:05:55.344 --> 00:05:58.804
Well it's going to be 40 tens, or 400.

00:05:58.804 --> 00:06:01.068
This is going to be 400 square units,

00:06:01.068 --> 00:06:03.911
is going to be the area
of this yellow part.

00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:05.688
And then what's eight times six?

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:08.903
Well we know that's going
to be 48 square units.

00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:10.668
So the entire rectangle is going to be

00:06:10.668 --> 00:06:13.072
the eight times the 50,
or the 50 times the eight,

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:15.649
the 400, this area, the yellow area,

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:18.424
plus the magenta area, plus
the eight times the six,

00:06:18.424 --> 00:06:21.732
the 48, which is 448.

00:06:21.732 --> 00:06:25.668
448 is going to be the
area of the whole thing.

00:06:25.668 --> 00:06:28.380
Eight times 56.
