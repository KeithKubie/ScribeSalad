00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.300
Sampling can be a lot cheaper and faster than trying to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.380
sequence a whole genome and compare it to something else. But,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.240
still, random sampling can have it's own disadvantages. For example, let's

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.840
try a random sample from a random page of my genome

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.820
book, where we just take one letter from the random page.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.240
We can turn the page and take another letter, and then

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.010
turn the page and take another letter. And keep doing this

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.530
over and over and over again. But what if we do

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.120
this for lots of people, and find that most

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.290
of the regions we sampled show no difference at all?

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.280
We could have compared genomes from all over the

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.900
planet, and not seen a single difference, because all human

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.230
genomes are already over 99% identical. So the key

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.530
is to sample in regions where we know there's going to

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.112
be some variability. And of course this is when our

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:51.480
single-nucleotide variants or SNVs are really going to come in handy.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.590
Personal genetic companies like 23 and me don't just randomly

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.400
sample the genome. They're actually going to take a million individual letters

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.250
of the genome, SNVs to be precise. Regions where they know

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.640
even comparing closely related individuals,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.410
they'll expect to see some differences.
