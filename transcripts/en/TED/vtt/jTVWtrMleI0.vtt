00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:15.543
Pat Mitchell: I know you don't like
that "legend" business.

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:17.182
Marian Wright Edelman: I don't.

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:18.357
(Laughter)

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:19.728
PM: Why not, Marian?

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.586
Because you are somewhat of a legend.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.223
You've been doing this for a long time,

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:27.064
and you're still there
as founder and president.

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:32.077
MWE: Well, because my daddy raised us
and my mother raised us to serve,

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.477
and we are servant-leaders.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:39.152
And it is not about
external things or labels,

00:00:39.176 --> 00:00:41.564
and I feel like the luckiest
person in the world

00:00:41.588 --> 00:00:45.774
having been born at the intersection
of great needs and great injustices

00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:47.819
and great opportunities to change them.

00:00:47.843 --> 00:00:50.368
So I just feel very grateful

00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:52.463
that I could serve and make a difference.

00:00:52.487 --> 00:00:54.440
PM: What a beautiful way of saying it.

00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:57.717
(Applause)

00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.872
You grew up in the American South,

00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:02.805
and like all children,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.272
a lot of who you became
was molded by your parents.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.290
Tell me: What did they teach you
about movement-building?

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:14.642
MWE: I had extraordinary parents.
I was so lucky.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.118
My mother was the best
organizer I ever knew.

00:01:17.142 --> 00:01:21.013
And she always insisted,
even back then, on having her own dime.

00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:24.885
She started her dairy
so that she could have her penny,

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.397
and that sense of independence
has certainly been passed on to me.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.807
My daddy was a minister,
and they were real partners.

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:35.108
And my oldest sibling is a sister,

00:01:35.132 --> 00:01:38.530
I'm the youngest,
and there are three boys in between.

00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:41.015
But I always knew I was
as smart as my brothers.

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.404
I always was a tomboy.

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:47.271
I always had the same
high aspirations that they had.

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:50.112
But most importantly,
we were terribly blessed,

00:01:50.136 --> 00:01:51.602
even though we were growing up

00:01:51.626 --> 00:01:55.040
in a very segregated
small town in South Carolina --

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:59.017
we knew it was wrong.

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:02.143
I always knew, from the time
I was four years old,

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:05.754
that I wasn't going to accept
being put into slots.

00:02:05.778 --> 00:02:10.341
But Daddy and Mama always
had the sense that it was not us,

00:02:10.365 --> 00:02:11.616
it was the outside world,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.007
but you have the capacity
to grow up to change it,

00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:15.902
and I began to do that very early on.

00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:18.467
But most importantly,
they were the best role models,

00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:20.998
because they said: if you see a need,

00:02:21.022 --> 00:02:22.871
don't ask why somebody doesn't do it.

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:24.269
See what you can do.

00:02:24.293 --> 00:02:26.732
There was no home for the aged
in our hometown.

00:02:26.756 --> 00:02:31.047
And Reverend Reddick, who had what we know
now, 50 years later, as Alzheimer's,

00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:32.783
and he began to wander the streets.

00:02:32.807 --> 00:02:35.919
And so Daddy and Mama figured out
he needed a place to go,

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:37.564
so we started a home for the aged.

00:02:37.588 --> 00:02:39.927
Children had to cook and clean and serve.

00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.713
We didn't like it at the time,

00:02:41.737 --> 00:02:44.595
but that's how we learned
that it was our obligation

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:47.967
to take care of those
who couldn't take care of themselves.

00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:52.038
I had 12 foster sisters and brothers.

00:02:52.062 --> 00:02:56.269
My mother took them in after we left home,
and she took them in before we left home.

00:02:56.293 --> 00:03:00.380
And again, whenever you see a need,
you try to fulfill it.

00:03:00.404 --> 00:03:04.190
God runs, Daddy used to say,
a full employment economy.

00:03:04.214 --> 00:03:05.215
(Laughter)

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.992
And so if you just follow the need,

00:03:07.016 --> 00:03:11.124
you will never lack for something to do
or a real purpose in life.

00:03:11.148 --> 00:03:14.461
And every issue that the Children's
Defense Fund works on today

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:18.775
comes out of my childhood
in a very personal way.

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.128
Little Johnny Harrington,
who lived three doors down from me,

00:03:22.152 --> 00:03:24.820
stepped on a nail;
he lived with his grandmother,

00:03:24.844 --> 00:03:28.346
got tetanus, went to the hospital,
no tetanus shots, he died.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.435
He was 11 years old.

00:03:30.758 --> 00:03:31.973
I remember that.

00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:34.370
An accident in front of our highway,

00:03:34.394 --> 00:03:37.372
turns out to have been
two white truck drivers

00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:40.569
and a migrant family
that happened to be black.

00:03:40.593 --> 00:03:42.230
We all ran out to help.

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:45.579
It was in the front of a church,
and the ambulance came,

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:48.915
saw that the white
truck drivers were not injured,

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.622
saw the black migrant workers were,

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:53.713
turned around and left them.

00:03:53.737 --> 00:03:55.216
I never forgot that.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.449
And immunizations
was one of the first things

00:03:57.473 --> 00:03:59.560
I worked on at the Children's Defense Fund

00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:04.071
to make sure that every child gets
immunized against preventable diseases.

00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:05.246
Unequal schools ...

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.174
(Applause)

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:10.349
Separate and unequal,

00:04:10.373 --> 00:04:12.156
hand-me-downs from the white schools.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.029
But we always had books in our house.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.338
Daddy was a great reader.

00:04:15.362 --> 00:04:17.542
He used to make me
read every night with him.

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:19.356
I'd have to sit for 15 or 20 minutes.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.254
One day I put a "True Confessions"
inside a "Life Magazine"

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:24.937
and he asked me to read it out loud.

00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:26.988
I never read a "True Confessions" again.

00:04:27.012 --> 00:04:28.246
(Laughter)

00:04:28.595 --> 00:04:30.008
But they were great readers.

00:04:30.032 --> 00:04:32.714
We always had books
before we had a second pair of shoes,

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:34.167
and that was very important.

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:37.020
And although we had hand-me-down
books for the black schools

00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:38.461
and hand-me-down everythings,

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.207
it was a great need.

00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:43.628
He made it clear that reading
was the window to the outside world,

00:04:43.652 --> 00:04:48.331
and so that was a great gift from them.

00:04:49.358 --> 00:04:55.429
But the reinforced lesson was that God
runs a full employment economy,

00:04:55.453 --> 00:04:57.389
and that if you just follow the need,

00:04:57.413 --> 00:05:00.135
you will never lack for a purpose in life,

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:01.911
and that has been so for me.

00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:04.175
We had a very segregated small town.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.636
I was a rebel from the time
I was four or five.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.097
I went out to a department store

00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:11.276
and there was "white"
and "black" water signs,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.223
but I didn't know that
and didn't pay much attention to that,

00:05:14.247 --> 00:05:16.522
and I was with one
of my Sunday school teachers.

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:18.470
I drank out of the wrong water fountain,

00:05:18.494 --> 00:05:21.318
and she jerked me away,
and I didn't know what had happened,

00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:24.082
and then she explained to me
about black and white water.

00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:25.813
I didn't know that, and after that,

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:28.551
I went home, took my little
wounded psyche to my parents,

00:05:28.575 --> 00:05:31.749
and told them what had happened,
and said, "What's wrong with me?"

00:05:31.773 --> 00:05:33.989
And they said,
"It wasn't much wrong with you.

00:05:34.013 --> 00:05:35.683
It's what's wrong with the system."

00:05:35.703 --> 00:05:38.191
And I used to go then secretly
and switch water signs

00:05:38.205 --> 00:05:39.284
everywhere I went.

00:05:39.308 --> 00:05:40.309
(Laughter)

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:41.733
And it felt so good.

00:05:41.757 --> 00:05:44.289
(Applause)

00:05:44.313 --> 00:05:50.487
PM: There is no question
that this legend is a bit of a rebel,

00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:52.479
and has been for a long time.

00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:56.623
So you started your work as an attorney
and with the Civil Rights Movement,

00:05:56.647 --> 00:06:00.624
and you worked with Dr. King
on the original Poor People's Campaign.

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:04.265
And then you made
this decision, 45 years ago,

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.321
to set up a national advocacy
campaign for children.

00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:13.084
Why did you choose that
particular service, to children?

00:06:13.108 --> 00:06:17.112
MWE: Well, because so many of the things
that I saw in Mississippi

00:06:17.136 --> 00:06:19.767
and across the South

00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:21.012
had to do with children.

00:06:21.036 --> 00:06:23.661
I saw children with bloated
bellies in this country

00:06:23.685 --> 00:06:25.143
who were close to starvation,

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:26.720
who were hungry,

00:06:26.744 --> 00:06:29.386
who were without clothes,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.814
and nobody wanted to believe

00:06:30.838 --> 00:06:33.228
that there were children
who were starving,

00:06:33.252 --> 00:06:35.521
and that's a slow process.

00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:37.289
And nobody wanted to listen.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.670
Every congressman
that would come to Mississippi,

00:06:39.694 --> 00:06:43.076
I'd say, "Go see," and most of them
didn't want to do anything about it.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.575
But I saw grinding poverty.

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:47.830
The state of Mississippi wanted,
during voter registration efforts --

00:06:47.854 --> 00:06:51.624
and with outside white kids coming in
to help black citizens register to vote --

00:06:51.648 --> 00:06:55.601
they wanted everybody to leave the state,
so they were trying to starve them out.

00:06:55.625 --> 00:06:57.721
And they switched
from free food commodities

00:06:57.745 --> 00:06:59.704
to food stamps that cost two dollars.

00:06:59.728 --> 00:07:02.633
People had no income, and nobody
in America wanted to believe

00:07:02.657 --> 00:07:05.402
that there was anybody
in America without any income.

00:07:05.426 --> 00:07:07.719
Well, I knew hundreds of them,
thousands of them.

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:09.994
And malnutrition
was becoming a big problem.

00:07:10.018 --> 00:07:13.345
And so one of these days
came Dr. King down

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:16.876
on a number of things we were fighting
to get the Head Start program --

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.074
which the state
of Mississippi turned down --

00:07:19.098 --> 00:07:20.447
refinanced.

00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:22.535
And he went into a center

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:25.591
that the poor community
was running without any help,

00:07:25.615 --> 00:07:29.409
and he saw a teacher carve up an apple
for eight or 10 children,

00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:31.957
and he had to run out,
because he was in tears.

00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:33.187
He couldn't believe it.

00:07:33.211 --> 00:07:36.979
But only when Robert Kennedy
decided he would come --

00:07:37.003 --> 00:07:39.402
I had gone to testify
about the Head Start program,

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:40.932
because they were attacking.

00:07:40.956 --> 00:07:42.964
And I asked, please,
come and see yourself,

00:07:42.988 --> 00:07:44.288
and when you come and see,

00:07:44.312 --> 00:07:46.776
see hungry people
and see starving children.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.706
And they came, and he brought the press,

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.777
and that began to get the movement going.

00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:54.080
But they wanted to push
all the poor people to go north

00:07:54.104 --> 00:07:56.697
and to get away from being voters.

00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:58.055
And I'm proud of Mike Espy.

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:00.890
Even though he lost last night,
he'll win one of these days.

00:08:00.914 --> 00:08:04.212
(Applause)

00:08:04.236 --> 00:08:08.553
But you wouldn't have seen
such grinding poverty,

00:08:08.577 --> 00:08:12.228
and the outside white kids
who'd come in to help register voters

00:08:12.252 --> 00:08:16.208
in the 1964 Summer Project
where we lost those three young men.

00:08:16.232 --> 00:08:20.242
But once they left, the press left,

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:21.917
and there was just massive need,

00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:24.171
and people were trying
to push the poor out.

00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:26.678
And so, you know, Head Start came,

00:08:26.702 --> 00:08:29.869
and we applied for it,
because the state turned it down.

00:08:29.893 --> 00:08:33.413
And that's true of a lot of states
that don't take Medicaid these days.

00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:36.057
And we ran the largest
Head Start program in the nation,

00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:37.437
and it changed their lives.

00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:40.588
They had books that had children
who looked like them in it,

00:08:40.612 --> 00:08:42.518
and we were attacked all over the place.

00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:43.722
But the bottom line

00:08:43.746 --> 00:08:46.993
was that Mississippi
gave birth to the Children's Defense Fund

00:08:47.017 --> 00:08:48.460
in many ways,

00:08:48.484 --> 00:08:52.239
and it also occurred to me that children

00:08:52.263 --> 00:08:54.377
and preventive investment,

00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:56.554
and avoiding costly care

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:59.075
and failure and neglect,

00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:02.059
was a more strategic way to proceed.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:04.208
And so the Children's Defense Fund

00:09:04.232 --> 00:09:07.540
was born out of
the Poor People's Campaign.

00:09:07.564 --> 00:09:09.890
But it was pretty clear
that whatever you called

00:09:09.914 --> 00:09:11.780
black independent or brown independent

00:09:11.804 --> 00:09:13.833
was going to have
a shrinking constituency.

00:09:13.857 --> 00:09:18.188
And who can be mad at a two-month-old baby
or at a two-year-old toddler?

00:09:18.212 --> 00:09:19.911
A lot of people can be.

00:09:19.935 --> 00:09:22.745
They don't want to feed them,
neither, from what we've seen.

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:24.690
But it was the right judgment to make.

00:09:24.714 --> 00:09:26.539
And so out of the privilege of serving

00:09:26.563 --> 00:09:29.865
as the Poor People's Campaign
coordinator for policy

00:09:29.889 --> 00:09:31.890
for two years, and there were two of them,

00:09:31.914 --> 00:09:33.201
and it was not a failure,

00:09:33.225 --> 00:09:36.319
because the seeds of change get planted

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:39.410
and have to have people
who are scut workers and follow up.

00:09:39.434 --> 00:09:43.160
And I'm a good scut worker
and a persistent person.

00:09:43.184 --> 00:09:44.491
And you know, as a result,

00:09:44.515 --> 00:09:47.112
I would say that all those people
on food stamps today

00:09:47.136 --> 00:09:50.193
ought to thank those poor people
in the mud in Resurrection City.

00:09:50.217 --> 00:09:54.127
But it takes a lot of follow-up,
detailed work -- and never going away.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.858
PM: And you've been doing it for 45 years,

00:09:56.882 --> 00:10:00.380
and you've seen some amazing outcomes.

00:10:00.404 --> 00:10:04.293
What are you proudest of
out of the Children's Defense Fund?

00:10:05.976 --> 00:10:09.888
MWE: Well, I think the children now
have sort of become a mainstream issue.

00:10:09.912 --> 00:10:14.118
We have got lots of new laws.

00:10:14.592 --> 00:10:17.375
Millions of children are getting food.

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:19.744
Millions of children
are getting a head start.

00:10:19.768 --> 00:10:22.260
Millions of children
are getting Head Start

00:10:22.284 --> 00:10:24.348
and have gotten a head start,

00:10:24.372 --> 00:10:28.026
and the Child Health
Insurance Program, CHIP,

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.292
Medicaid expansions for children.

00:10:30.316 --> 00:10:33.442
We've been trying to reform
the child welfare system for decades.

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:36.055
We finally got a big
breakthrough this year,

00:10:36.079 --> 00:10:39.413
and it says, be ready with the proposals
when somebody's ready to move,

00:10:39.437 --> 00:10:43.148
and sometimes it takes five years,
10 years, 20 years, but you're there.

00:10:43.172 --> 00:10:46.823
I've been trying to keep children
out of foster care and out of institutions

00:10:46.847 --> 00:10:49.228
and with their families,
with preventive services.

00:10:49.252 --> 00:10:50.403
That got passed.

00:10:50.427 --> 00:10:52.799
But there are millions
of children who have hope,

00:10:52.823 --> 00:10:54.533
who have access to early childhood.

00:10:54.557 --> 00:10:55.919
Now, we are not finished,

00:10:55.943 --> 00:10:57.943
and we are not going to ever feel finished

00:10:57.967 --> 00:11:01.886
until we end child poverty
in the richest nation on earth.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.129
It's just ridiculous
that we have to be demanding that.

00:11:05.153 --> 00:11:09.994
(Applause)

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:14.672
PM: And there are so many of the problems
in spite of the successes,

00:11:14.696 --> 00:11:18.271
and thank you for going through
some of them, Marian --

00:11:18.295 --> 00:11:19.879
the Freedom Schools,

00:11:19.903 --> 00:11:22.078
the generations of children now

00:11:22.102 --> 00:11:25.803
who have gone through
Children's Defense Fund programs.

00:11:25.827 --> 00:11:27.573
But when you look around the world,

00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:31.722
in this country, the United States,
and in other countries,

00:11:31.746 --> 00:11:33.502
there are still so many problems.

00:11:33.526 --> 00:11:35.795
What worries you the most?

00:11:37.031 --> 00:11:41.149
MWE: What worries me is how irresponsible
we adults in power have been

00:11:41.173 --> 00:11:44.487
in passing on a healthier earth.

00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:47.892
And it worries me when I read
the "Bulletin of Atomic Scientists"

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:51.347
and see now that we are
two minutes from midnight,

00:11:51.371 --> 00:11:52.599
and that's gotten closer.

00:11:52.623 --> 00:11:55.496
We have put our future

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.409
and our children's future
and safety at risk

00:11:59.433 --> 00:12:03.053
in a world that is still
too much governed by violence.

00:12:03.077 --> 00:12:04.649
We must end that.

00:12:04.673 --> 00:12:09.500
We must stop investing in war and start
investing in the young and in peace,

00:12:09.524 --> 00:12:11.943
and we are really so far away
from doing that.

00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:13.039
(Applause)

00:12:13.063 --> 00:12:17.396
And I don't want my grandchildren

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.637
to have to fight
these battles all over again,

00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:21.222
and so I get more radical.

00:12:21.246 --> 00:12:23.828
The older I get, the more radical I get,

00:12:23.852 --> 00:12:27.045
because there are just some things
that we as adults have to do

00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:28.335
for the next generations.

00:12:28.359 --> 00:12:30.445
And I looked at
the sacrifices of Mrs. Hamer

00:12:30.469 --> 00:12:32.384
and all those people in Mississippi

00:12:32.408 --> 00:12:35.143
who risked their lives
to give us a better life.

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:37.319
But the United States
has got to come to grips

00:12:37.343 --> 00:12:39.987
with its failure to invest
in its children,

00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:43.224
and it's the Achilles' heel
of this nation.

00:12:43.248 --> 00:12:46.249
How can you be one of the biggest
economies in the world

00:12:46.273 --> 00:12:51.001
and you let 13.2 million children
go live in poverty,

00:12:51.025 --> 00:12:53.279
and you let children go homeless

00:12:53.303 --> 00:12:55.050
when you've got the means to do it?

00:12:55.074 --> 00:12:58.532
We've got to rethink
who we are as a people,

00:12:58.556 --> 00:12:59.975
be an example for the world.

00:12:59.999 --> 00:13:01.419
There should be no poverty.

00:13:01.443 --> 00:13:04.512
In fact, we want to say we're going
to end poverty in the world.

00:13:04.536 --> 00:13:05.687
Just start at home.

00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:07.264
And we've made real progress,

00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:09.336
but it's such hard work,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.326
and it's going to be our Achilles' heel.

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.256
We should stop giving more tax cuts,

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.687
sorry folks, to billionaires
rather than to babies

00:13:16.711 --> 00:13:18.035
and their health care.

00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:20.233
We should get our priorities straight.

00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:21.258
(Applause)

00:13:21.282 --> 00:13:24.011
That's not right,
and it's not cost-effective.

00:13:24.035 --> 00:13:28.067
And the key to this country is going
to be an educated child population,

00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:29.758
and yet we've got so many children

00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:32.126
who cannot read or write
at the most basic levels.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.090
We're investing in the wrong things,

00:13:34.114 --> 00:13:37.470
and I wouldn't be upset
about anybody having one billion,

00:13:37.494 --> 00:13:38.645
10 billion [US dollars],

00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:40.906
if there were no hungry children,

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.958
if there were no homeless children,

00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:45.241
if there were no uneducated children.

00:13:45.265 --> 00:13:47.639
And so it's really about
what does it mean to live

00:13:47.663 --> 00:13:49.964
and lead this life.

00:13:49.988 --> 00:13:51.425
Why were we put on this earth?

00:13:51.449 --> 00:13:54.329
We were put on this earth
to make things better

00:13:54.353 --> 00:13:55.568
for the next generations.

00:13:55.592 --> 00:13:58.047
And here we're worrying
about climate change

00:13:58.071 --> 00:13:59.577
and global warming.

00:13:59.601 --> 00:14:02.517
And we're looking at, again,
I constantly cite --

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:05.466
I look at that "Bulletin
of Atomic Scientists" every year.

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.543
And it says now:
"Two minutes to midnight."

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:09.141
Are we out of our minds, adults,

00:14:09.165 --> 00:14:13.217
about passing on a better a world
to our children?

00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:16.337
That's what our purpose is,
to leave a better world for everybody,

00:14:16.361 --> 00:14:19.414
and the concept of enough for everybody.

00:14:19.438 --> 00:14:21.699
There should be
no hungry children in this world

00:14:21.723 --> 00:14:23.359
with the rich wealth that we have.

00:14:23.383 --> 00:14:25.641
And so I can't think of a bigger cause,

00:14:25.665 --> 00:14:28.776
and I think that I'm driven by my faith.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.824
And it's been a privilege to serve,

00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:33.831
but I always had the best
role models in the world.

00:14:33.855 --> 00:14:37.510
Daddy always said God
runs a full employment economy,

00:14:37.534 --> 00:14:39.887
and that if you just follow the need,

00:14:39.911 --> 00:14:41.817
you'll never lack for a purpose in life.

00:14:41.841 --> 00:14:45.152
And I watched the partnership --
because my mother was a true partner.

00:14:45.176 --> 00:14:48.134
I always knew I was
as smart as my brothers, at least.

00:14:48.158 --> 00:14:52.802
And we always knew that we were not
just to be about ourselves,

00:14:52.826 --> 00:14:54.769
but that we were here to serve.

00:14:54.793 --> 00:14:58.206
PM: Well, Marian, I want to say,
on behalf of all the world's children,

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.501
thank you for your passion,

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.596
your purpose and your advocacy.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.269
(Applause)
