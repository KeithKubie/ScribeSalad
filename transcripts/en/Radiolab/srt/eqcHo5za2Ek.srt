1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,620
Alright. Hey guys, sorry. Hey, we're
here now. Hey, Peter. Simon, Simon,

2
00:00:05,621 --> 00:00:07,480
how are you man? I'm doing
well. And Yourself? Good.

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,650
Okay. Uh, who's who? Um, Peter is
a DJ. Peter Rosenberg from hot 97.

4
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:14,060
Simon Adler is the journalist.

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,480
Our Pal Andrew Moran from the New Yorker
is also in the room and Robert and

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,260
ironman.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,980
Good. Well, uh, we have all gathered
here today to talk about, uh,

8
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,780
the wonderful world of
professional wrestling,

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,043
my favorite world.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,970
So yes,

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,970
we're going to talk about professional
wrestling for the first half of the show.

12
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:36,340
And we realize there's probably a lot
of you out there listening right now who

13
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:36,870
are like,

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,150
seriously guys, there are people
like, oh wait, you're 35 years old.

15
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,020
Do you love wrestling? It's, you know,

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,360
I get this a lot if I'm tweeting about
it a lot, I get tweets that go, you know,

17
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,400
it's fake, right? It's like,

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,070
we'll do I write you that when you
tweet about your favorite movie,

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,550
it's entertainment. The awesome
thing about wrestling is,

20
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,480
is that there are these random
things that are a little bit real.

21
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:00,220
And sometimes those moments
of realness can just be like

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,500
Paul [inaudible].

23
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,780
They can change everything.

24
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,683
Oh,

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,800
now if you're like me and
you grew up in the 80s, a,

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,350
you might remember wrestling is like, you
know how Kogan versus Andre the giant,

27
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:17,270
these epic matchups,

28
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,010
they were kind of great but also sort
of ridiculous and cartoonish. Well,

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,670
according to Peter Rosenberg,

30
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,320
there was a moment where wrestling started
to sort of tinker with reality and a

31
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:31,850
much more nuanced and a
fascinating way. In fact,

32
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:35,330
you could argue that pro wrestling
became a reinstate the creation of the

33
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:38,510
Baroque movement of the 16th century.
But the postmodern twist you get,

34
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,860
I know people who would.

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,280
Okay, you're going to meet him. I'm Chad.
I'm Robert. This is Radiolab. And uh,

36
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:48,580
according to Peter, this whole
thing's where we're going to start.

37
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:53,020
This whole thing goes back to this
moment called the Montreal screw job.

38
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,650
The Montreux screw job was above anything
else that had ever happened or that

39
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,770
will ever probably ever happen
again because it was odor,

40
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:03,310
reality transpiring right
there in the ring. I mean,

41
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:06,940
it was when real life
just came and tore a hole

42
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,483
in the fiction.

43
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,750
That guy you just heard
is David Shoemaker.

44
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,900
I write about professional wrestling for
Grantland and the guy you're about to

45
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:22,950
hear is journalists, Simon Adler. He
will take the story from here. Okay,

46
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,900
so the moment in question really
centers around this one guy named Brett

47
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,060
[inaudible] red. They hit man heart.

48
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,410
Brett Hart is seen by many to be the
greatest entering performer of all time.

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,820
He was one of the good guys.

50
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,000
That's the room, the

51
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,960
[inaudible] business.

52
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,870
They call him a baby face. Is
that what you call the good guys?

53
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,700
The good guy in wrestling.
He's a baby face.

54
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,830
He was my favorite wrestler as a kid.
I didn't understand why at the time,

55
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,040
but now I do. It's because he did so

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,690
well and in that era, the mid to late
eighties when I fell in love with him.

57
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,650
So many guys were just big and
hawking and a little bit clumsy.

58
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,010
But Brett did the kind of work that
you could show to someone who's,

59
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,600
who's never watched wrestling.

60
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,830
I think they could see the art in it
and I think they could see how it's,

61
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,000
it's like ballet or a million other arts

62
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,570
forms. What he means.

63
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,660
And you can kind of see this when you
watch old Brett Hart matches on youtube.

64
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,470
He's a gliding through the air, bouncing
off the mat, off the ropes here,

65
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,880
tell stories brilliantly within
the way he, uh, executes a map.

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,340
The wrestling is scripted, but there's
a lot of improv going on there.

67
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,270
The set beads,

68
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:50,010
he knew how to take those moments
and in that Improv make you think,

69
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,310
oh shoot, he's about to lose. And then

70
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,260
[inaudible]

71
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,180
he was a natural born wrestler,

72
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,990
you know, his father was a, was a
legendary wrestler, his brother,

73
00:04:03,991 --> 00:04:08,180
Owen legendary wrestler.
He comes from, um,

74
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,230
this Canadian wrestling royalty

75
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,560
kid. Growing up, I had the
ability to watch the, uh,

76
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,390
or had the fortune of watch these varied
wrestling styles and techniques and

77
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,020
stuff.

78
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,960
That's Brett Hart in an
interview in 2000 on fresh air.

79
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,080
And he says that some of his earliest
memories as a kid were these massive dudes

80
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:32,800
showing up to his house and hanging
out in his basement with his dad.

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,410
You know, even then my dad
was, you know, I'll say 60,

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,180
who's teaching them how to be wrestlers,

83
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,290
pull on these old wooly tights. And
then he would wrestle with these guys.

84
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,410
And he would literally,
um, put them in wrestling,

85
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:47,580
holds these submission wrestling
holds, which is his obsession. And uh,

86
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,870
he would torture these big huge football
players for hours and they would scream

87
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,570
literally these high pitched
screams. It was terrifying.

88
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,820
I'd be upstairs in the room
above it and as I got older,

89
00:04:57,821 --> 00:05:01,450
I would go down and actually venture
into the room and sit on the bench and

90
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,380
watch. And uh,

91
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,910
he would sometimes these wrestlers would
run out when my dad finally let them

92
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,280
go. They'd actually run
out, tear out of the,

93
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,960
out the doorway and out the outside,
sometimes in the snow and run out the,

94
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,890
in their bare feet. And you,
and even seeing them again,

95
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,010
I mean there's a legendary, so many
legendary stories about the Hart family,

96
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:21,270
but you, you know, my
favorite among many is, uh,

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,110
the bear that lived in their backyard
during the summers because at the time,

98
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,550
wrestling a bear was a thing that would
actually happen from time to time. No,

99
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:35,530
really. And, uh, Brett tells a
story in his, his book, um, about,

100
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:39,130
you know, just sitting there and
letting the bear lick his toes. I mean,

101
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:43,540
like this is, this is a life that they,
that he lived and he was, he was so in,

102
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,800
it was so ingrained in him.

103
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,240
Um,

104
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,200
so in the early eighties,
Brett was working for his
dad's company up in Canada.

105
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,860
And while that's going on in Canada,
there's this guy, Vince McMahon,

106
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,060
back in the u s who is building kind
this wrestling empire. It basically,

107
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:03,050
he's buying up all of these small
promoters from across the country and

108
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:07,510
eventually goes up into Canada and
buys out breads, dad's company.

109
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,780
I bought it in 1984. They paid him a
certain amount of money to stop running.

110
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,470
Like, just to kind of go out of
business. And then they took on, uh,

111
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,960
some of his better wrestlers at the time,

112
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,020
which was myself and I had
a couple of brother-in-laws.

113
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,000
And shortly thereafter,

114
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,123
Jared,

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,790
the WWF comes under fire,

116
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,790
how Kogan and other world wrestling
federation stars have taken the offensive

117
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,500
against accusation that many have
been steroid abuser, like man

118
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,830
red to widespread steroid abused in
the world wrestling federation. So

119
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,710
there's this big steroid crisis.

120
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,740
Vince has to deal with all of this
litigation and he kind of needs to rebrand

121
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,310
his organization. He needs a new good
guy, a new champion, a new baby face.

122
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,950
And he looks to Brett for that

123
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,140
for a couple of reasons.
According to David Shoemaker.

124
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,970
One is that he's a traditionalist, sort
of a throwback to an earlier time too.

125
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,660
He's not that big. So when you see
him, you don't think steroids guys,

126
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,810
definitely, yeah. Roid rage. And
so he saw all that in Brett Hart.

127
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,620
So during the 90s, Vince
makes Brett a really big star.

128
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,443
Hey Scott,

129
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,540
face of the company, I mean he was
on the Simpsons. He was a really,

130
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:24,650
really big star. You know,

131
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:27,290
there are people who criticize Brett
for saying he wasn't that fun or he took

132
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,200
himself too seriously, but
he was a serious worker.

133
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,810
He took wrestling very
seriously for myself,

134
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:37,190
really fighting hard to actually
survive and come out of it.

135
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,200
Actually to come out of the
wrestling profession someday as a,

136
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,540
as a success rather than
a wrestling tragedy,

137
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,300
which is what so many of them turn out.

138
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:54,870
Okay. So fast forward to
1995, 1996 at the time,

139
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,880
a major rivalry was starting between the
WWF that is Vince McMahon's company and

140
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:03,870
the WCW, um, which was
ted Turner's company,

141
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,910
Ted Turner and Gillian Air.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,480
And one of his big tactics is I'm
just going to start buying all of the

143
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:12,870
wrestlers from the WWF, from
Vince McMahon's organization.

144
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:16,140
So he's offering them more money.
He's offering them longer contracts,

145
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:19,860
and he was just like flooding it with
money to steal all the stars from WWF.

146
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,110
And then in late 1996, Brett got an offer.

147
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,780
Turner really went in for the
kill from WCW. That was huge.

148
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,470
Two point $8 million.

149
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,340
I mean you have to show us the
common sense, you know, first of all,

150
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:34,240
you've got to do what's right
for your family, but I mean,

151
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,190
how much money do you need?

152
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:39,960
Sometimes I find myself torn between
trying to do the right thing for my family

153
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,030
and at the same time show my loyalties.

154
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,880
That's a clip of Brett talking in a
documentary that was being filmed at the

155
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:48,310
time called wrestling with
shadows, which is fantastic.

156
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,690
The filmmaker Paul Jay was nice enough
to let us play some clips. In any case,

157
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,100
Brett gets this offer and he's
got kind of terrible decision

158
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,950
to make because Vince
gave him a lot. You know,

159
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:03,951
he really gave him his life and initially
Brett decides there's no way I'm going

160
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:04,771
to leave. You know?

161
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:09,240
I think my relationship was with Vince
McMahon was always sort of like a father

162
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,550
and I sort of saw myself. If I left,

163
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,310
it would have been a little
bit like leaving my dad,

164
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,170
especially when the shifts are down.

165
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,070
He really did see Vince
as a father figure.

166
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,750
So Brett goes to Vince and
basically says, convince me to stay.

167
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,830
They went back and forth.

168
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,410
There was conversation about
him signing a longterm deal,

169
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:31,910
a 20 year deal with WWF. Not for as
much money, but for guaranteed security.

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,540
Vince said, I can't
afford to pay you that.

171
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,633
Just talk to Vince

172
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,560
in the documentary. Brett and his wife,
they're sitting at a kitchen table.

173
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,420
Let me see. He goes, nobody wants bread.

174
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,010
Heart more than Minspeck, man,

175
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,060
you can't afford to compete with Turner.

176
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,940
He was Turner's hell bent on
trying to put him out of business.

177
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,310
I got to think about everything.
I got to think about everything.

178
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,350
Just see what makes sense.
Call Eric, maybe. How

179
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,870
can we cut this off now
for a little while? Okay.

180
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Ultimately it became clear that Brett
would have to go take the money.

181
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,690
I can't help but feel really
heartbroken and disappointed that um,

182
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,690
that I left this company.

183
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,343
Yeah.

184
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,970
So this really gets to the heart of it.
Once Brett decides he's going to leave,

185
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,580
they have to figure out how, how
are they going to make his exit?

186
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,690
This is really the pivotal
question behind all of this.

187
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,810
Yeah. You know that it's a
very, very delicate situation.

188
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,970
That's Vince. So,

189
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:54,660
and this was sort of his problem to solve
because he worked for Vince McMahon,

190
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,750
you know, you could say I was his right
hand man because I was writing the show.

191
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,840
He was part of the team that scripted,
who would win, who would lose,

192
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:02,340
how it would happen, you know? I mean,

193
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:06,600
I was literally putting this show on
paper, you know, once a week. Wait,

194
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:09,900
why is this a hard question? I mean,
can he just pick up and leave? Well,

195
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,380
because he's the champion. He
has the belt, the physical belt,

196
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,110
the giant golden like belt buckle thing,

197
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,410
and that belt is the symbol of
the company and everybody in it,

198
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,540
everybody working behind the scenes,

199
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:24,090
everybody who was trying
to support their family,

200
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,330
that belt was a
representation of all that.

201
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:31,440
That the worst thing that could happen
is your champion walking away with the

202
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,970
belt, drilling up to the new company,

203
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,370
holding up the championship
from the old company

204
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,720
where they could just
defile it if they wanted to.

205
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:42,130
That was not an option for Vince
McMahon. This isn't a perfect comparison,

206
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:46,840
but the closest thing I've come up to
in my mind is it would be like Lebron

207
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,840
James quitting his contract with Nike
and then showing up in an Adidas and

208
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:58,000
taking a piss into a pair of
Nike's. So you know Vince,

209
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,850
at the end of the day, he just
had to get that belt off of bread.

210
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,860
So their initial thought, their first
plan was probably the simplest option.

211
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,750
There was a match coming up, this big
event of pay per view event in Montreal.

212
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,470
Brett being the champion of the company,

213
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,770
he should just lose to the number two
guy in the company, Shawn Michaels.

214
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:20,080
Vince loved Sean. I mean really
thought Sean was a mega star,

215
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:22,700
which was right about clearly
Sean was next in line.

216
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,870
So they pitched this idea to Brett
and Brett was like, I can't do that.

217
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,980
For one he thinks Shawn's an idiot.

218
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,190
It's got this premadonna personality.

219
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,370
I mean he thinks he's better than everyone
else and is something very arrogant

220
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,770
and I'm noxious about him
because he was, he was a showman.

221
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,890
He would hump the ring just like
do ridiculous things. And like

222
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,130
Brett. Shaun was the triumph
of style over substance. Also,

223
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,220
you're asking Brett to wrap up his career
in the WWE with a loss in Montreal in

224
00:12:53,251 --> 00:12:55,350
Canada where he is a national hero.

225
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,410
I described the events. I just
assume blow my brains out.

226
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,940
It would be the same once you're asking
me to do from a character standpoint,

227
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:05,160
that's what I would be doing.
Breadth to hit hitman hardwood.

228
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,273
Blow his brains out.

229
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,850
Yeah.

230
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,200
Oh, the whole thing's been hard. Yeah.

231
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,253
Okay.

232
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,563
Day of the match.

233
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,140
Still nothing has been decided as
to how the match is going to end.

234
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,620
Brett is backstage and eventually he
goes to Vince to have a conversation.

235
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:28,940
Right.

236
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,380
I gotta just talk the documentary crews
filming all of this and at this point

237
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:36,920
Vince says, no, I don't want any
cameras in here. Get those out of here.

238
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,720
And so Brett actually ends up wearing a
wire to document the conversation that's

239
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:42,560
about to happen.

240
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,230
I never ever wanted to leave here
with any kind of bad feeling,

241
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,540
but this week has been a bad week for
me. I feel kind of betrayed a little bit.

242
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,950
Well, I go to a little bit and again,
all we're talking about really is Turner,

243
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,590
Gosh, what's coming between
you and me and that's all.

244
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,130
I can't tell you how appreciative I will
always be for everything you've done.

245
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,690
I didn't want to leave with any problems.

246
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,080
I actually didn't want to leave it all
and then it's the point where there was

247
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:06,570
no other choice but to go the way
this whole thing has been depicted.

248
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,110
It's really hard for me as a hero
here to come up short this weekend.

249
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,500
What would you want to do
today then? I'm open to new.

250
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,170
I think what I'd like to
do is get through today.

251
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,390
I think tomorrow is you
just go in and do my,

252
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,580
so Brett suggest that this
ends in a disqualification.

253
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,650
Usually what that means is something
called a Shmata Moz or whatever you want.

254
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:28,020
Typically in a Schmaltz,

255
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,980
the ring is just flooded with a bunch of
wrestlers and chaos into is the referee

256
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:36,160
usually is thrown out of the ring
and it ends in some sort of draw.

257
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,290
Bret would then appear on Monday night
raw the next day and turn over the belt.

258
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,360
That is what he planned on doing too.

259
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:46,000
That way he could turn over
the belt but not lose. Exactly.

260
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,850
And eventually Vince says, okay, fine.

261
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,030
Nah, I ain't got, I'm opening to, like I

262
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,130
said before on the term wind up

263
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,970
and now Milton Bradley,

264
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,950
they're like chronic karate
fighters by 1997 survivors. Sherry.

265
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,210
Okay, here we go. So
survivor's series, 1997

266
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:12,663
[inaudible]

267
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,210
oh, the drama.

268
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,470
So around 9:20 PM 20,000
people in the stands,

269
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,340
countless television screens across
the country. Shawn Michaels comes

270
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,700
and he,

271
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,410
he comes out singing his own
theme themes. I think I'm cute.

272
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,360
I know I'm sexy. It's singing karaoke
style. It's prerecorded of him singing.

273
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,110
That's an approach. Yeah, he's
got his hair in a ponytail.

274
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,050
He's wearing his trademark
black spandex pants,

275
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,640
but hearts all over them like he is the
manifestation of everything that Brett

276
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:50,474
despises.

277
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,320
And then outcomes. Bret
Harte waving a Canadian flag

278
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,150
20

279
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,690
and he walks into the ring to gets
in, takes off the championship belt,

280
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:07,020
hands it to the ref and before
the match even officially begin.

281
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,613
Okay.

282
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,140
Shawn flies at Brett and
just starts [inaudible].

283
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,833
Yep.

284
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,700
Sean and Brett. They're
going at each other

285
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,100
with assertive

286
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,400
like real ferocity pretty
quick. They're outside the ring.

287
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,110
Right.

288
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,650
Kicks up. Shawn chucks him over the
security railing into the crowd.

289
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:38,903
It didn't, no.

290
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,870
Then there's this moment where Brett
picks Sean up so that Sean's legs are

291
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,530
straight up in the air and then

292
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,090
right. Just slams him on his back

293
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,343
in all of this.

294
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,600
Yeah. Everything I know about it
is like they're following the,

295
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,820
the narrative arc, but
like they know, okay,

296
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:06,430
we're going to fight her out outside
the ring for a while and, and then x, y,

297
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,420
z will happen and so eventually

298
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,700
Brett throws Shawn back
into the room and then

299
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,030
you get to a point in the match,

300
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,990
which feels very early in the match
where Brett climbs onto the turnbuckle,

301
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:23,260
which is the corner post of the
room. He gets up on top of that,

302
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,980
catapults himself off the turnbuckle
through the air towards Sean.

303
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,040
Mike, Super dramatic. He's kind of
floating in the air there for a moment

304
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,940
and then in front of a hip man.

305
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,280
What Sean does right before bread
is about to come and hit him,

306
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:46,210
he pulls the referee in
between Brett and Sean,

307
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,980
a human shield of sorts. Brett
hits the referee, the referee

308
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,560
hit Sean and all three men are lying

309
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,360
on the map. Is that a disqualification?

310
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,910
It might be if they could get on
Paula, oh, here we are. Right?

311
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:05,300
This could, this can
be the moment, but no,

312
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,780
before the referee can
get up. Sean gets up,

313
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,860
walks over to Brett and then Shawn
Puts Brett in the sharp shooter,

314
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,610
which is Brett's signature finishing move.

315
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,200
Basically Sean pretzels up bread's legs
and sits up and within seconds the bell

316
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:31,154
rings,

317
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,460
Sean Slides out of the rain, grabs the
belt, runs to the back, takes off things,

318
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:43,090
work a certain way in wrestling matches,
right? Like no one gets the first pin,

319
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,630
the second match starts and no one puts
someone in submission hold and they

320
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:47,530
instantly submit,

321
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,560
especially not bred heart and ages did
not appear like the time the match was

322
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,230
supposed to end. The
crowd is kind of shocked.

323
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,650
It's strangely quiet

324
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,200
and there's this one moment where the
camera zooms in on Brett's face while he's

325
00:19:03,301 --> 00:19:04,080
lying,

326
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,080
chest down on the mat looking up
and there is just this bizarre,

327
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,520
amazing look on his face.

328
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,300
Confusion is an emotion that almost
never exists in pro wrestling.

329
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:16,760
Yeah,

330
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,850
there's the cartoon confusion of like
everything's crazy and your arms are going

331
00:19:19,851 --> 00:19:22,070
like wild. Your eyeballs
pop out of your head,

332
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,300
but real confusion is one of the
most compelling emotions of all.

333
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,680
That's what you see on his
face in its most pure form.

334
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:33,790
[inaudible]

335
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,050
genuine confusion.

336
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:39,550
[inaudible]

337
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,660
and then anger. Brett gets
up, puts his arms on the rope,

338
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:44,620
looks down

339
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,280
seasoned and sick man and
spits right in Vince's face.

340
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,170
He then proceeds

341
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,720
to get out of the ring and basically
destroyed everything in sight.

342
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,630
He goes over to the announcer's
table, starts ripping it apart,

343
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,070
he destroys the monitors, throws
the headphones out into the crowd.

344
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,390
He goes pretty nuts

345
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,590
and in maybe the moment that truly
made you go, what is happening?

346
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,330
Brett gets back into the ring.

347
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,360
He takes his hand in the air and draws
with his finger in the air as big as he

348
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:17,324
can.

349
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,330
W C W which is where he was going to be
leaving to go work w c w and keeps doing

350
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:31,670
that walking across the range
of signaling w c w to the crowd.

351
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:34,760
[inaudible]

352
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,290
after the match, Brett heads back into
the locker room looking for Vince.

353
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,770
It is good. It

354
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,000
tells the cameras to shut off

355
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,900
and then to make a long story short,

356
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,630
he clocks Vince in the
face, knocks him out.

357
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,190
Now the WWF has a real
problem on their hands.

358
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,310
Vince has a black guy and the fourth wall
has just been torn down and they need

359
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:07,940
to figure out how or if they're
going to build it back up. And um,

360
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,870
the next day, this again was the
head writer at the time, Vince Russo,

361
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,150
we had a television taping
right after the, you know, you,

362
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:18,740
you have roar on Monday, you know,
you, you do your paper view on Sunday,

363
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:22,910
you have roar on Monday. So
they all huddled in a room
to discuss their options.

364
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,830
And Vince says that everybody in that
room dif first knee jerk reaction is,

365
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:30,620
well, we're going to sweep this under
the rug and not even talk about it.

366
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:31,091
I mean that,

367
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:34,970
that was almost just assumed because
you have to understand there's this old

368
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,253
principle in wrestling called [inaudible]

369
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,750
Kayfabe. And basically what this is,

370
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:43,550
is this law of the wrestling God passed
down since time eternal that says,

371
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:46,580
you don't talk about
the fact that it's fake.

372
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,940
Everyone knows that it's
scripted and that it's fake.

373
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,090
But you damn well better
not mention that ever. Why?

374
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,220
Because everybody has a better time
when everyone is under the spell. Of it.

375
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,650
Uh, and I was like, wait a minute,

376
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,840
Vince is walking around with a black eye.

377
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,980
The boys has a black guy and one of
the boys punched them in the face.

378
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,000
Russo is saying, I understand
Kayfabe but we have to address this.

379
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:18,500
We can't not acknowledge this and
that doesn't have to be a problem.

380
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,370
That can be an opportunity for us.
I mean it like, I hate to say this,

381
00:22:22,371 --> 00:22:25,100
but like it doesn't get
any better than this.

382
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:28,070
Rousseau says this
discussion got very heated.

383
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,160
It was passion filled and in the end
nobody really knew what Vince McMahon was

384
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:34,634
going to do.

385
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:39,940
Why the time red hearts step center
stays for his match up with Shawn and

386
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:43,720
eventually Vince McMahon decides
I'm going to break with Kayfabe.

387
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,410
Now keep in mind he's always been
the owner of the organization,

388
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:52,240
but very few people actually knew that
too. Most fans of professional wrestling,

389
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,840
he was just an announcer that
night on his own TV show.

390
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:59,350
He comes out not as Vince
McMahon, the ringside announcer,

391
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:02,620
but as Vince McMahon,
the owner of the company.

392
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,520
Yeah, right in the chase seven
days ago. With the survivor series,

393
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,420
did you or did you not screw Brett Hart?

394
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,420
Some would say I screwed Bret Harte.

395
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,750
Bret Hart would definitely
tell you I screwed them.

396
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,150
I'll look at it from a
different standpoint.

397
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,050
I look at it from the standpoint of
the referee did not screw Brett Hart.

398
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,180
Sean Michael Certainly
did not screw Brett Hart,

399
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,100
nor that Vince McMahon screw
bad heart. I truly believe that

400
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,790
Brad Hart Screwed Bret Hart and you can
look in the mirror and know that I'm

401
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,880
sure in some parts of the country right
now there's a collective groan that you

402
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,980
orchestrated in the situation
and the fact that uh,

403
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,690
there are people are not going to
understand what you mean by Brett heart

404
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:50,690
screwed Bret Hart. So
what do you mean by that?

405
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,730
There's a time honored tradition in
the wrestling business when someone is

406
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:56,623
leaving,

407
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:02,230
they show the right amount of respect
to the WWF superstars in this case who

408
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:07,871
helped make you that superstar you show
the proper respect to the organization

409
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,140
that helped you become who you are today.

410
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,530
It's a time honored tradition and Brett
Hart didn't want to honor that tradition

411
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,250
and the less that was
Brett's decision, Brett,

412
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,783
rude breath.

413
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,510
And everything changed from that point on.

414
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,110
And according to Peter,

415
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,890
after the Montreal screw
job and after this speech,

416
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,840
the writers of the WWF started blurring
the lines on a different level.

417
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,040
Vince McMahon, the chairman of
the WWE, ladies and gentlemen,

418
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,253
he became

419
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,080
Mr [inaudible],

420
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,930
Mr McMann, the character, the
number one villain in the company.

421
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,370
Yeah,

422
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,310
there were no more ridiculous,
you know, stupid, unbelievable,

423
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,730
childish, ignorant,
immature, Terrick, dors.

424
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:11,090
Every character we had was basically
an extension of themselves.

425
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:12,763
So,

426
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,810
you know, stone cold,

427
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:20,760
Steve Austin was Steve
Austin 1000 times magnified.

428
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,050
Okay?

429
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,610
The Rock was rocky.

430
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:28,240
My via 100 times magnified.

431
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,710
And as a result,

432
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,830
that was the beginning of the biggest
boom in the history of the wrestling

433
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:36,340
business

434
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,690
as far as business goes. This was
huge for the WWF and Vince McMahon.

435
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,310
They came roaring back in the ratings war.

436
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,960
They destroyed Ted Turner
in the WCW. They won.

437
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:50,650
And if you ask Vince
Russo, why this approach,

438
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:55,400
this new aesthetic was so
successful, he said simply the truth.

439
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,230
That was great TV, plain and simple.
The fans just want something true.

440
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:05,090
Just tell the fans what happened.
But Peter says two things.

441
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:08,540
One, it's way more complicated than
that. It's not just about the truth.

442
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,220
You still have these writers who are
scripting the show and wrestlers who are

443
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:17,780
getting that script and following it
so it's not like it's now a true world.

444
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,050
I think it's something more like there
are these tiny injections of truth into

445
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:26,480
this world in really unexpected moments.

446
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,580
What that does is it puts everyone on
high alert all the time for those moments

447
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,450
and when everyone is on high alert
for those moments all the time,

448
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,940
every moment has the potential to be true,

449
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,210
has the potential to have a little
bit of that injection into it.

450
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,100
And when you are watching
for those injections,

451
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,410
it completely changes how you
are engaging with the art form,

452
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,250
with the entertainment. And that
creates an entirely new type of fan,

453
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,930
what they call a smart fan,

454
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,520
a smart Marcus smart as they're known
people who will love the wrestling

455
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:03,360
business but really love the behind the
scenes of the business. No. What now?

456
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,010
What was the smart mark? Smart Mark.
Here's where you can get a little lingo.

457
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:12,000
Crazy. [inaudible] the lingo part of
wrestling is a huge, huge part of it.

458
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,721
And uh,

459
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:17,721
mark is someone who doesn't know that
wrestling is fake or using another piece

460
00:27:19,021 --> 00:27:23,850
of jargon here that it is a work. Yes.
A work is anything that's not real.

461
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,150
Okay. As opposed to a shoot,
which is something that's real,

462
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,440
like the Montreal screw job.
Yes. Our shoots by definition,

463
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:35,280
something that's not supposed
to happen in the ring.

464
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,290
A shoot should never happen. But yeah.
Then there's something called, of course,

465
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,220
a work shoot

466
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,443
[inaudible]

467
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,380
and that's something that
does happen. What does that,

468
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:52,240
where you script it to seem like it's
totally unscripted and it may even be real

469
00:27:52,241 --> 00:27:54,250
life that they're injecting
into it, but it was planned,

470
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,620
was still all discussed that
this is what would happen.

471
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:01,740
And so watching wrestling becomes this
game of hunting for the truth according

472
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:06,460
to David Shoemaker and not just
any truth, but the authentic truth,

473
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,310
the true truths, the truth, truth.
Even if you know that it's fake,

474
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,790
there's some point where the guys are
really going at it in the ring that you're

475
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,580
just like, wow, maybe it's
real. Just that right there.

476
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,580
And that's what makes
wrestling so powerful.

477
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:23,260
It's the never ending search for
the reality, uh, within the unreal.

478
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,650
The fact that we get so blend
these things together. I mean,

479
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:32,140
another example that's just fantastic
is, um, in the early two thousands,

480
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,430
there was edge,

481
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:38,490
Matt hardy and a girl named Lita Lita
and Matt Hardy were legitimately in love

482
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,480
dating for years. Edge and Matt
Hardy were legitimately best friends

483
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,370
and then you

484
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:52,810
make your life miserable edge ended up
with Lita took his best friend's girl.

485
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,430
You bet your life miserable too. Something
that unfortunately happens in life.

486
00:28:57,431 --> 00:29:00,250
Sometimes guy kills

487
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,630
and it was turned into a storyline.

488
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,160
Man had fought over women
since the beginning of time
and we got to see an epic

489
00:29:09,161 --> 00:29:10,390
battle over one right now.

490
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,730
I find it incredible that you
could go out into the room

491
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,560
and pretend to beat the
hell out of someone.

492
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:22,350
You want to beat the hell out.

493
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,550
[inaudible] to know that
you have to go out there,

494
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,910
work really hard against someone you
legitimately hate and also absolutely have

495
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:34,670
to protect. How can we not find
that? Fascinating. That's awesome.

496
00:29:34,671 --> 00:29:38,510
That's incredible. It's like watching
Fleetwood Mac go on tour. Exactly.

497
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,010
That's what I was going to say next.

498
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,450
That's Andrew Moranz the way from the
New Yorker and play all their songs cause

499
00:29:43,451 --> 00:29:46,510
all their songs. They all
had these love quadrangles.

500
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,210
They all were married and left
each other and wrote songs about,

501
00:29:49,211 --> 00:29:52,450
I'm so pissed off at you because you
left me for the guy who's standing right

502
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:52,810
there.

503
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,840
And then they'd go out on tour and Lindsey
Buckingham is standing right next to

504
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,110
CV annex playing the song that
he wrote about you betrayed me.

505
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:03,370
I hate you so much. It's crazy. It right
after night. Super Fascinating. Yeah.

506
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,400
I just think there's a part of the human
brain that wants to be confused between

507
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:12,820
those boundaries that wants to be
slipping in between. What's real,

508
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:14,470
what's fake to feel that confusion.

509
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,400
I feel like that's why Jimmy Fallon was
so successful on Saturday night live,

510
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,830
not because he was the
greatest sketch comedian,

511
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:22,970
but because he broke a lot and you,

512
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,840
you can't do that in wrestling
because those moments are the best.

513
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,760
You have to save them.
You have to save them.

514
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:31,480
And when people acknowledge a moment
and you can tell they look around at the

515
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,430
crowd and they're
acknowledging like this is,

516
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,990
or someone says one line that everyone
kind of knows. It's like, Whoa,

517
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,040
that's kind of real. Those moments are
special and you, you have to save them.

518
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,540
Hold on one sec guys. Sorry. Hey,
what's up? He's on the way. All right.

519
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,930
I'm I'll, I'll be leaving shortly.
Peace. Sorry guys. I'll show way it's,

520
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,120
come on guys. One real quick
question. What have you, of course,

521
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,720
what happened to Peter, Brent,
Brent Hart after this? It's a,

522
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:58,750
did he go off to WCW and
have a big career? Well,

523
00:30:58,751 --> 00:31:02,230
that's Sorta the interesting thing
is that after the Montreal screw job,

524
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,370
a few weeks later,

525
00:31:03,371 --> 00:31:08,371
Brett showed up on WCW television and
it never really worked out for Brett.

526
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,600
In 1999,

527
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,890
just two years into his contract
with WCW during a match,

528
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:19,220
he got kicked in the head and
suffered a severe concussion

529
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,580
and it, it, it was the
beginning of the end

530
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,973
that same year.

531
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,810
Well, Ladies and gentlemen, uh,
something has gone terribly wrong.

532
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,890
Brett's brother Owen Hartman who
was wrestling for the WWF, um,

533
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,060
during one of his entrances to the match.

534
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,260
He was entering from the ceiling and
something with the stunt went terribly

535
00:31:40,261 --> 00:31:45,261
wrong and he fell 50
feet into the ring and,

536
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,630
and he died. Anyway,

537
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,750
this is not a part of the
show. This is real life.

538
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:52,870
Oh one mark is being
attended to right now by,

539
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,360
oh, I went through right
away. I said I could never,

540
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,980
I don't think I can ever go back.

541
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,060
Brett Hart spoke with Terry Gross
about a year after this incident.

542
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:06,090
You think of all these sort of contrived
storylines that they have in wrestling,

543
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,090
you know, this guy's going to come in and
he's going to do that. And he's gonna,

544
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,710
he's gonna say this about you.

545
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,170
Are they gonna I just thought I heard
anything that you could possibly imagine

546
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:17,300
is so pathetically meaningless when you
relate to the, the real life horror.

547
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,810
What happened with my brother, he would

548
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,940
retire shortly after saying that.

549
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,523
[inaudible] [inaudible]

550
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,263
[inaudible] [inaudible]

551
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,913
[inaudible]

552
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:10,380
[inaudible]

553
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:14,880
so thank you to um, to Simon. Uh, what
did we decide his wrestling name was?

554
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,780
Simon Simon, the growling
gruyere. Adler. Adler.

555
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,090
Cause he's from Wisconsin. So you have
to be like a fierce cheese cheese.

556
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,261
And thank you.

557
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:29,100
Also a very special thanks to fresh
air for letting US air their Brett Hart

for allowing us to play some clips from

559
