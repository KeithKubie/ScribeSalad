00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.060
I try to practice what I preach in my class,
or practice what I teach in my class, which

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.970
is that learning happens not from me telling
things to students, but from them experiencing

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.970
things.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.400
And I want them to be able to enable that
with their own students, and I'm trying to

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.410
do that in my own class with my students.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.860
So, on the first day of class, I might give
a lecture for 20 minutes about what the class

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.300
is about, and that's pretty much it for lecturing
for me for the rest of the semester.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.510
So, we do a lot of stuff that's discussion-based
and activity-based.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.470
I do try to have, I don't think constructivism-From
my perspective, I'm not a radical constructivist

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.730
who says, "Everything needs to be learned
by the students on their own."

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.010
But it's a matter of having, figuring out
what those experiences are, how to design

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.510
them, and then how to engage in conversation
and reflection based on those experiences

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.180
to have students learn about what it means
to teach and what it means to learn.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.829
So it's about constructing those right situations
that I think hopefully foster learning, and

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.610
we do change that year after year after we
realize, "Well, this didn't work so well this

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.610
year.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.610
Maybe we'll change it for next year.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.640
Maybe we'll get rid of this and replace it
with something else."

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.380
And then it's a matter of figuring out, for
any particular group of students, where I

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.729
interject myself into the conversation--where
I have to sort of ask a critical question,

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.729
or where I have to offer an opinion, or where
I kind of just let the conversation go where

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.399
it may.

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:27.149
"Some people really like to talk, and some
people really don't like to talk.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.729
So sometimes I just let that naturally evolve,
and try to be able to gauge whether there's

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.770
some people who are not talking who would
like to be talking, or who could benefit from

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.770
talking.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.149
One of the reasons why we sort of rotate the
responsibilities is that it makes sure that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.060
at least at some point for each activity you're
up at the front of the room.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.830
You're in charge of a Current Events.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.450
You're in charge of a Chapter Reading.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.100
You're in charge of teaching a lesson.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.119
So there are a lot of opportunities where
you're required to sort of be engaged at the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.800
front of the room, or centrally in the room,
even if you're not at the front.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.720
And I think that that tries to break down
some of the barriers in terms of why some

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.000
people don't participate in the class, why
they sit in the back and are quiet.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.590
Once they sort of have that opportunity to
come to the front, some of those barriers

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.620
are broken down and they're more willing to
participate.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.150
I don't typically cold-call on people, but
we do break up into groups, so sometimes when

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.879
students are reluctant to talk in a group
of 25, they're much more willing when everybody

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.090
in the group needs to talk with each other.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.909
The Modes of Teaching activity allows us to
do student teaching but in a way that gets

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.970
everybody engaged and thinking about this.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.319
And I think one of the things that students
come into the class thinking is that, "Well,

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.489
the most efficient way to teach is to get
up at the front of the room and talk to people.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.129
And I'll tell them that, and I can cover so
much in an hour.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.829
It's really great."

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.510
And then it's a matter of having them think
about, well, what are the benefits of using

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.510
other activities?

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.150
What are the benefits of having people do
things hands-on?

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.549
What are the benefits of using other media
and hands-on activities that you might do

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.379
with even a small group of students at the
front of the room?

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:00.739
And how those fit together.

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.950
It's not to say that one of them is better
than the other, but it's to think about, what

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.799
are the ways they fit together, and what are
the ways they engage you in different ways?

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.959
So, it gets people thinking about, what are
the merits of these different things?

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.349
And then also, how do they fit together in
ways that may not be obvious?

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.739
Because it's... sometimes people think about
the lecture as the thing that should go first:

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.459
"I should tell them the stuff, and then they
should rehearse it in a lab or an activity."

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.150
And the way we mix it up, sometimes that comes
first.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.450
Sometimes the lecture comes first, and sometimes
the activity or lab comes first.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.010
And it's about understanding, "Wow, that really...
diving right into it really gave me some context

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.010
for this.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.599
And then when I went to the lecture the next
class period, it actually made a lot more

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.760
sense because I had already done this activity
where the... that lecture was put into some

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.410
sort of context."
