00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:35.999
.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.999
Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.999
It’s a pleasure and an honor

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.999
to welcome President Dilma Rousseff

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.999
who is visiting us for the
first time at Princeton.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.999
It isn’t any secret that
the events in Brazil

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.999
since last year make this
visit especially significant.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.999
With the necessary brevity, but searching
for a bit of intellectual honesty

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.999
I must say that... I don’t
have my star today...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.999
but I must say that I have great sympathy

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.193
for the original proposal that
brought the Worker’s Party

00:01:18.218 --> 00:01:20.999
(PT) to power at the beginning
of the last decade,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.099
in a political and economic
process that ended in 2016,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.599
in a decisive moment... and still
indefinite... of Brazilian politics,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.999
with the impeachment of
President Dilma Rousseff.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.999
It isn’t my intention, at
this time and in this space

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.999
to defend or critique the
diverse political actors who,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.999
since at least what we call the “jornadas
de 2013” (2013 Protests) in Brazil,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.999
have been confronting a complex
social legacy of the previous decade,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.999
when the Brazilian economy
grew exponentially,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.999
when we saw a still-unrecognized
income distribution in the country,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.999
while, nonetheless, some of its structural
problems were never completely resolved,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.399
like corruption, which is
today the star of the media,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.999
and especially elementary public education.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.999
In one form or another,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.999
the expansion of the internal market and Brazil’s
new place on the international stage seemed,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.999
to many of us Brazilians,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.999
a natural legacy of the Constitution
proclaimed in 1988,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.999
following the most recent
Brazilian dictatorship.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.999
In short, the rights of a society

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.999
that was rehearsing its first steps
toward a return to democracy,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
are today what we find threatened.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.459
The parliamentary coup
d’etat which brought the

00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:52.923
impeachment of President
Dilma Rousseff last year

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.999
symbolized the closing of a
cycle in Brazilian history,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.999
or perhaps the opening of another cycle,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.999
in which the judicialization and the spectacularization
(or the mediatization) of Brazilian politics

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.999
create an environment of
instability and uncertainty

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
in relation to the future
of democracy in Brazil.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.999
The worst part of this spectacularization

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.999
is probably the lack of dialogue and
the irreversible polarization of positions.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.999
As if there were only two sides,
two enemy tribes.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.999
To make things worse, the
presumed corruptors...

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.999
Those that are in prison... are those
that have the most visibility.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.999
A strange situation:

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.999
the crooks say what they wish,
and society listens to them,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.999
without the justice system even having
determined the guilt of those who were accused.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.999
The presence of President
Dilma Rousseff today in Princeton

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.999
is an effort to give voice to someone who
had her political trajectory interrupted,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.999
which is certainly not
a novelty in her life,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.999
since she, herself,
alongside other leftist militants,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.999
was imprisoned during
the military dictatorship

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.500
and lived, last year, a process of
impeachment that made many of us think

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.700
in the distance there can be
between legality and legitimacy.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.999
I’d like to thank the colleagues and staff

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.999
of the Spanish and Portuguese Department,
Program in Latin American Studies,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.999
and the Princeton Institute for
International and Regional Studies,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.999
who made this event possible,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.999
which is being recorded and simulcast

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.999
in other auditoriums on
campus, and also online.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.999
I’d especially like to thank Damaris Zayas,
Rachel Golden, and Justin Kazlauskas for the help

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.999
and my colleagues Gabriela Nouzeilles
and Mark Beissinger.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.999
Also thanks to Diogo Santanna,
who served as intermediary for everything,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.999
and my dear colleague and friend at Brown,
James Green.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.999
Last but not least, thanks to the team
of President Dilma Rousseff

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.999
It is a great pleasure to invite her
to the stage and, once again,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
to give her our most sincere and effusive
welcome to our home.

00:05:12.124 --> 00:05:38.124
[Applause]

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.999
I wanted to start wishing a good afternoon
to everyone present here,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.999
giving thanks for your presence.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.999
To acknowledge Professor Pedro Meira Monteiro,
Director of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese;

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:11.500
to acknowledge Professor Gabriela Nouzeilles,
from the Program in Latin American Studies;

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:21.999
to acknowledge the Director of the Princeton Institute
for International and Regional Studies, Mark Beissinger;

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:30.000
to acknowledge all of you who made it possible to
be here, to give thanks to all of you present.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.999
During my life, I have
lived two coups d’etat,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
One military coup and
one parliamentary coup.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.999
A military coup has certain characteristics

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.999
which are basically the
suspension of all rights,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.999
the right to organize, of expression, the
right to mobilize, and freedom of the press,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.999
but above all, the right to dissent.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.999
When you dissent in a military coup,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
you’re imprisoned, tortured,
isolated, exiled, and killed.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.700
A parliamentary coup is
different because...

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.999
we have to study and understand it...

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.999
because it’s a post-Cold War coup,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.999
a coup that has a characteristic:

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.999
it doesn’t eliminate certain
democratic rights for all people;

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.999
it eliminates rights for some people.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.999
Many have identified the
existence of parliamentary coups,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.999
principally in Latin America,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.999
because in recent years, we can identify
at least three coups d’etat:

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.999
one in Honduras, one in Paraguay,
with President Lugo,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.999
and one in Brazil: the impeachment
that took me from power.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.999
These coups are becoming a new way

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that popular governments are being
destroyed in Brazil and Latin America.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.999
This is a process for which we have
to understand its raison d’etre,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.999
because understanding and comprehending
is the essential preliminary way

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to be able to change a situation.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.999
That’s why I begin telling you
that the parliamentary coup

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.999
by virtue of an impeachment
without the crime of responsibility,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000
was motivated by a few reasons.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.999
I’ll start with a symbolic reason:

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.999
the use of a strong misogyny

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.999
that characterizes a certain typification
and certain instruments

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000
which are going to be used against me
throughout the process.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.999
I always say

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
that what is done with words
is very important.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.999
Because what is done with words burdens,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.999
in a democratic society,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.999
part of political and ideological struggle

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.999
and a vision of the world
and a vision of society

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.999
of questions of gender... really,
of all sorts of questions.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.999
In my case, a dichotomy was visible.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.999
I was seen as a “hard woman.”

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.999
Women are “hard.” Men are “strong.”

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.999
Women are “susceptible
to emotional crises.”

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.999
Men, no. Men are “sensible.”

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.999
Women are “obsessive-compulsive”
about their work.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.999
Men are “efficient and determined” workers.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.999
This comes out at times,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.999
sometimes even in coarse language.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.999
This happened throughout the coup,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.999
functioning as its underlying discourse.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.999
It is interesting to note, however,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.999
that for being the first female president,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.999
I was a woman surrounded by kind men.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.999
My male administrative aides, who worked
alongside my female administrative aides

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.999
were people who maintained
a non-misogynistic standard.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.999
They maintained a standard of cooperation,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.999
and it is important to note...

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.999
Because this makes it clear that Brasil
isn’t just misogyny and gender hatred.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.999
This is an underlying reason,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.999
almost a syntax,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.999
but it isn’t the principal
reason of the coup.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.999
There’s a reason that
also has a characteristic

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.999
which mobilizes the
parliamentary part of the coup,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.999
and it’s expressed in the
recording that they made

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.999
of the talk between a senator
in favor of the coup, Romero Jucá,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.999
and a senator what was in the process
of being accused, named Sérgio Machado.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.999
In this conversation,
Senator Jucá tells Senator Machado:

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:50.999
“It’s necessary to remove the President because
she’s not going to control Operation Car Wash,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.999
she doesn’t want to impede it, so we need to
remove her from power to “stop the bleeding.”

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.999
The word “bleeding” is literal,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.999
“remove me from power” is also literal,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.999
and “impede the
investigations” is explicit.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.999
There was, without any
doubt, this intention,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.999
primarily between those who
politically articulated the coup.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.999
It is also clear that this
is an underlying reason.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.999
Not that it isn’t important...

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.999
What I am saying is that, along with other
factors, this creates the reasons for the coup.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.999
But they don’t entirely explain it.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.999
It was necessary for larger interests to
come together in sectors favoring the coup,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.999
of political parties that
made the coup possible.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.999
Which sectors are these?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.999
I would say that in part, it’s the media, which
in Brasil is controlled by four or five families.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.999
And in part, it’s the market.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.999
This conjunction media-market
has an interest.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.999
What is the interest?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.999
To frame Brazil from an economic,
political, and social point of view...

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.999
But above all, economic and social...

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.999
And I also believe

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.999
that there was a strong interest
in framing external Brazilian politics.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.999
The political segment in favor
of the coup, as I said,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.999
was made up in a significant part,
by the PMDB and the PSDB,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.999
federal deputies and senators.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.999
So this group got together
to frame Brazil in what?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.999
To frame Brazil in a neoliberal project

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.999
that we had interrupted, which had
been around since (President) Collor,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.999
passing through Fernando Henrique Cardoso,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.999
and had been suspended:

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.999
suspended when President Luiz Inácio
Lula da Silva was elected in 2003.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.999
At that time, we discontinued
a process of accelerated privatization

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.999
which had occurred, for example, in
Argentina... and will continue to occur.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.999
Argentina is losing its
instruments of finance politics.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.999
Argentina emerges from the crisis, following
the failure of the government of Menem

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.999
with the integral loss of the
instruments of the Argentine State.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.999
We maintained three large banks:

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.999
one bank, which is the only bank that gives
long-term loans, which is the BNDES,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
one comercial bank on the
model of the large private banks,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.999
and one finance bank,
which is the Caixa Econômica Federal,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.999
in addition to maintaining
Petrobras and Eletrobras.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.999
But above all, the capacity
to articulate social policies in Brasil.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.999
To develop social policies.
And this we did.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.999
These policies are characterized
by introducing the poor in the budget.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.999
For carrying out a project
of social inclusion,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.999
the expansion of our internal market...

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.999
A country with 200 million inhabitants has
great wealth in its internal market.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.999
And at the same time, guarantee for
the first time in recent years

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.999
that there be a politics of social inclusion,
income distribution, and reduction of inequality.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.999
And this wasn’t only the transference
of wealth via the Bolsa Família,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.999
that we have, and which
is very important. Why?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.999
Fourteen million families...
It oscillates entre 13.9 and 14 million...

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.999
It is important to say
that these 14 million families

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.999
can be multiplied by four, on average,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.999
which makes 56 million people. It isn’t
trivial to make this type of policy.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.999
And it’s important to say that
people don’t live from the Bolsa Família,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.999
which is something reported by the media.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.999
People work. It’s just that
what they make isn’t sufficient.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.999
So the Bolsa Família completes the gap.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.999
And this is the fundamental
idea of the Bolsa Família,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.999
which has requirements,
such as, for example,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.999
Families have to enroll their children
in school... 85% is the minimum diligence

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.999
that a family has to take care of its children
in order to maintain the Bolsa Família.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.999
It has to get vaccinations
...three required systematic vaccines...

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.999
And, when a woman is pregnant,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.999
she has to carry out
three mandatory pre-natal exams.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.999
This way, we reduced death by diarrhea,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.999
we reduced infant mortality.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.999
But above all, we brought Brazil out of the UN
Hunger Map in 2014... between 2013 and 2014.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.999
And we overcame extreme poverty in 2014,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:59.999
when we exceeded the limit,
which we considered,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.999
which was $1.50 per day,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.999
so that no Brazilian was below this.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.999
It’s something important.
But it wasn’t just this that we did.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.999
No process of income distribution
exists without access to public services

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.999
and without increased
opportunities for people

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.999
in terms of their own education
and ability to find better work.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.999
We are talking about assuring certain access to
differentiated productive activities. Through what?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Through professional education.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.999
It was a program we called Pronatec,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.999
The National Program of Technical
Education and Employment.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.999
We constructed this program, in
partnership with other industrial services,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.999
services of industrial
education, the SENAI,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.999
which is a service that trains
industry workers...

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.999
By the way, Preident Lula became a metal worker 
because he had been trained at SENAI.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.999
So we formed this partnership with the SENAI,
with the National Service of Agriculture,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.999
with the National Transportation Service,

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.999
and with our Federal Institutes of
Technological Instruction,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.999
and we formed this partnership.
We trained 20 million people.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.999
Becuase in Brazil it's important to say:

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.999
We broke with the previos project which
enacted social policy through pilot programs.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.999
But enacting social policy through pilot programs,
in a country with 200 million inhabitants,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.000
100 million of whom are poor,
means not doing anything.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.999
So, when we see the curve of
income distribution in Brazil,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.999
of income distribution and of inclusion,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.999
you’ll see that the periods of pilot
programs are periods of stagnation,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.999
there’s no effect on poverty.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.999
We have to make policies in Brazil
for millions of people.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.999
So there’s no policy.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.999
And this is something very important,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.999
which is that people
changed their perspective.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.999
We have to remember that Brazil was the
last country to abolish slavery.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.999
I always say this because
it’s important for understanding Brazil.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.999
We have a problem with social inclusion
and we have a problem with privilege.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.999
There are segments of society
that think that it’s their privilege,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.999
for example, to enjoy the airports,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.999
without being disrupted by
domestic workers and doormen,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.999
or other professional categories that before didn’t
travel in plane and started to travel in plane.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.999
But that’s just a detail.
The fact is, we did this.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
The coup, for me, was a planned process.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:28.999
Planned also because we were
going against the grain:

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.999
when inequality was increasing
in the rest of the world,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.999
in Brazil it was decreasing.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.999
All you have to do is
look at the Gini index.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.999
However, we didn't manage to take
all the necessary steps.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.999
so that along with income distribution,
we could change wealth distribution.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.999
We partially achieved
more equal distribution of wealth,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.999
because we created programs that guaranteed
access to housing for the poorest population.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.999
In truth, I think that the
biggest factor of the coup

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.999
is that it was inimaginable for the poor
to form part of the budget.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.999
We had done something... and I don’t
consider it an absurd alteration,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.999
a radical alteration in the system...

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:33.999
But it was an expressive step, because for the first
time there was really income distribution in Brazil,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.999
for the first time, there were social
policies, any government policy had a focus:

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.999
“We have to overcome poverty,
we have to overcome supreme poverty,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.999
We have to guarantee access
to quality public services.”

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.999
This is so important.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.999
I’m going to say this because I met
a student of Cuban origin here.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.999
Because I want to speak about
“Mais Médicos” (More Doctors),

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.999
and I’m grateful to the Cuban doctors, and to the Cuban
government for having sent to Brazil 11,000 doctors.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.999
Brazil was a country that had 1.8 doctors
for every 1,000 inhabitants,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.999
below the standards set by
the World Health Organization.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.999
From there, we tried to grow and we created
many problems with the medical segments

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.999
because of the problem of privilege.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.999
And we brought to Brazil 18,260 doctors,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:44.999
which made it possible to
attend 63 million Brazilians.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.999
Where? Not over there in the Amazon...

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.999
There too... but also in the periphery of
the largest city in Brazil, São Paulo,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.999
in the periphery of the largest Brazilian cities, the
capitals, cities larger than 100,000 inhabitants.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.999
Using what? The same database that was
used in the process for the Bolsa Família

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.999
served also to cross medical assistance
with the database registrar.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.999
You can observe that we
distributed privileging

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.999
where the population had the greatest need because
they have the greatest socio-economic fragility.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.999
Now... all that couldn’t be this way.
It had to end.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.999
So what happens? The
economic crisis begins.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.999
Nobody can do anything... we succeeded for six years
at preventing the crisis from arriving to us.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.999
One thing is governing
at the rise of a cycle.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.999
Another thing is governing
when the crisis begins,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
because the crisis stirs up
something they call distributive conflict.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.999
You’ll remember that in Brazil,
on the eve of impeachment,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.999
it was substantiated by the yellow duck,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.999
there on the Avenida
Paulista, a six-meter duck,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.999
that was an undue copy of a Dutch duck,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:26.999
that they placed on the Avenida Paulista,
the financial center of São Paulo,

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.999
saying “I don’t want to pay the duck.” That is,
“pay the duck,” in a distributive conflict,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.999
is to pay the necessary part of the crisis,
which is an increase in taxes.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.999
There is no way to just cut costs,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.999
Europe is proving this, ad nauseam. Why?

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.999
Because what happens
with austerity policies?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:01.999
You cut, cut, cut spending, you depress
the economy instead of restarting it.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.999
In Brazil, we needed to adapt. In crisis,
you always need to readjust spending.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.999
How, then, to increase taxes at the same time,
which in Brazil is a completely regressive system?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.999
Because it’s a difficult thing
to pass tax reform in Congress.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.999
We tried three times, and then we started
sending isolated adjustments.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.999
And the last one we sent was the CPMF,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.999
which is a tax of 0.38% on
financial transactions,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:42.999
which caused horror for the elite, because it
would make clear where tax fraude was happening.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.999
That’s why the CPMF was
battled and transformed

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.999
into one of the greatest threats to
civilization committed by my government.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.999
The threat was precisely realizing that
we had already charged a greater CPMF.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.999
It was realizing that (and we had 
already changed the CPMF before) 

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.999
the internal revenue service, from 
taxing all financial transactions,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.999
knows who’s paying what for whom.
So it was a very complex process.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.999
I want to say that the media played an
important role in distorting the facts.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.999
The media said Brazil was broken:

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.999
“This government needs to leave
because it left Brazil broken.”

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.999
Now, this government that
“left Brazil broken”

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.999
was the government that
prevented Brazil from defaulting

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.999
with the International Monetary Fund (FMI),

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.999
which permitted that in 2002,
when we arrived to the government,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.999
the FMI dictated Brazil’s
macro-economic policy.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
We payed off the Fund around 2006,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.999
I believe that it was at
the beginning of 2006.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.999
Why? Because the government before Lula

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.999
had only $14 billion in reserves

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.999
and owed $16 billion to international
creditors, if I’m not mistaken.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.999
Anyway, we payed off the Fund.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.999
But in the period of 2003
until the day I left the government,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.999
we accumulated $380 billion in reserves.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.999
No country is “broken” if
it pays its creditors.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.999
We didn’t simply pay our creditors, we had
enough money to honor our commitments.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:55.999
“The government is broken”...a government
isn’t broken if it honors its debt,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.999
if it has the capacity to go into debt
and to charge taxes.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.999
So the government broke the country?
The government didn’t break the country.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.999
The government faced an economic crisis

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:15.999
that became the basis for a political
crisis. That is what happened.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.999
The government faced an economic crisis
and suffered a political crisis.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.999
Why? Because we had a program.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.999
We won four elections with that program.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.999
In this past election, it became clear,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.999
because they believed until the last minute
that they were going to win,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.999
but in the past election it became clear
that they hadn’t won the elections.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.999
So what’s the situation?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:52.999
Four consecutive times they had
lost the opportunity to adopt the program

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.999
that they considered best for Brazil,
which is a neoliberal conservative program

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.999
which believes that we spend
too much on the poor.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.999
So much so that they called... until the moment they
realized the population didn’t share their view...

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.999
They called the Bolsa Família the “Bolsa
Esmola” (the Charity Scholarship),

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:22.999
until the moment they realized that they had created an
enormous campaign against the arrival of the doctors,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.999
until they realized that the doctors
had the support of the population,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.999
90% of the population supports
the presence of the doctors

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.999
and even says that they are very important because
“they take care of us, they check in, they do exams,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.999
and they have a closer relationship.”

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.999
And this is really good because it
changes the standard of service.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.999
Besides, they praise the doctors a lot.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.999
I also want to record here
that they say Brazilian nurses

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.999
have great professionalism and a great capacity for
service, but going back to what I was saying...

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.999
So, if Brazil wasn’t broken,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.999
if it wasn’t the government, if it wasn’t the
policies of the government, what was it?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.999
“We’re against the policies of the government,
we can’t wait until the election.”

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.999
So they created they conditions and
the environment for impeachment.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.999
How do you create the
environment for impeachment?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:37.999
It’s interesting to signal what
an author named Naomi Klein says.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.999
She says the following, citing Friedman,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.999
and citing Friedman’s
evaluation of two circumstances:

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:54.999
One, the government of Pinochet (in Chile) and
two, the Falklands crisis for Margret Thatcher.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.999
She basically says the following:

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:11.999
It is very important when you’re in a moment of crisis,
because in crisis... I’m going to quote literally:

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.999
“Only a crisis... actual or perceived...
Produces real change.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.999
When that crisis occurs, the actions that are
taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.999
That, I believe, is our basic function:

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.999
to develop alternatives
to existing policies,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.999
to keep them alive and available

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:46.999
until the politically impossible
becomes the politically inevitable.”

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.999
The politically imposible was,
through the electoral process

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.999
to pass through the neoliberal reforms
that are now being imposed.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.999
They would never be approved.
They were never approved,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.999
they were not even mentioned.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.999
This is the politically impossible.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.999
The politically inevitable is when a political crisis
on top of an economic crisis, creates impeachment.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.999
This is the trajectory and the prescription
of the coup in Brazil.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.999
It was about framing Brazil in
neoliberalism, and they did it.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
So I tell you here, concluding.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:52.999
This process is a process that is contradictory
today with the interests of the population.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.999
Why? After the impeachment,
they tried to limit the debt ceiling

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.999
which ends up freezing for 20 years
spending on education and health.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:13.999
In real terms, the rest of the
spending a primary budget exemptions

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.999
could even have nominal reduction.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.999
They propose a welfare reform,
which is the reform of a model

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.999
in which if you complete the
requirements for integral retirement,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.999
if you retire, you have
to start working at age nine.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.999
Why? It’s 65 years plus
49 years of service.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.999
49 years of service in a labor market with unemployment
and informality, you have seven more years, on average.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.999
Add 49 and 7, it makes 56, subtract
from 65, you get nine years old.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.999
It’s not evil, it’s changing the model.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.999
It’s getting rid of public welfare,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.999
creating the conditions
to privatize welfare.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.999
But in the interim, it destroys retirement
for women, rural workers, men, the poor,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.999
it gets ride of assistance
for the poor and disabled.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.999
It creates job insecurity
with the law they call outsourcing,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.999
it increases deregulation of the job market,
creating job insecurity and diminishing salaries

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.999
now through a project that
wants to do away with

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.999
the Consolidation of Labor Laws (CLT),
of workers’ protections.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.999
Anyway, it opens up land to foreigners, opens
the skies to aviation without a counterbalance

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.999
it’s selling parts of the pre-salt layer
at rather questionable prices...

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.999
and all of this is happening.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.999
What’s the contradiction? The more they do
this to serve the media and the market,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:02.999
the more the population reacts against
them, and there they have a conflict.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.999
There’s an election in 2018.
The conflict is the following:

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.999
If it serves the market, the congresspeople
who aren’t suicidal

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.999
(they might be something else,
but they aren’t suicidal)

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.999
they won’t vote in such unpopular measures.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.999
If they don’t vote, they won’t deliver
service to the market.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:33.999
If they vote... the congresspeople
who aren’t suicidal...

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.999
There’s no proof of the
measures they need to deliver.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.999
That’s the dilemma.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.999
Besides that, even though they had promised that they would
freeze the investigations so they wouldn’t reach them

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.999
they reached them.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.999
So, the situation in Brazil
today only has one solution.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:04.999
That old story that it’s possible to talk,
to have dialogue, is a fairy tale.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.999
No one can think that in a country 
with the complexity of Brazil,

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.999
everybody is going to sit down and talk.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.999
Where do we talk in a democracy?
In the election we talk.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.999
So, the only way to get out of this crisis
in which we find ourselves is the election.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.999
Be that when it is, it’s a
scheduled meeting in a democracy.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.999
If it isn’t before, we know that
there’s a date scheduled: October of 2018.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.999
And October of 2018 in
Brazil already began.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.999
Why? Because the national
campaign mobilizes all interests.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.999
It’s like this here too. Presidential
regimes have this characteristic.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:03.999
I believe that the only way out for Brazil is democracy,
more democracy, and greater extension of freedoms.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.999
And remembering always that we have
only transformed a country successfully

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.499
when we’ve had democracy.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:12.999
They’ve been the richest periods.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Thank you very much.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Thank you very much.
Everyone can hear, right?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.999
We’re going to move to the questions.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.999
We have approximately 20-25 minutes.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.999
Believe me that it’s not an easy task
to cut off the President...

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.999
but I think this way,
we’ll have a little time.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.999
The organization we had discussed

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.999
is that we are going to
collect a few questions

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.999
so there’s more time for the
voice to be with you all.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.999
I’m going to use my prerogative as moderator
to ask the first question very quickly,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.999
which is, simply: Mrs. President,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.999
for us to get beyond the idea
of the inevitability of the coup,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.999
how can we think about
and understand retrospectively

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:14.999
the 2013 protests in Brazil?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.999
There are microphones in the audience.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.999
Who would like to ask one
or two more questions?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
We have several candidates.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Let me take notes.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.999
Hi Mrs. President. I’d like to
thank you for your presence here.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.999
My name is Rafael. I’m a student here
in the Woodrow Wilson School

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.999
and I worked in management for Minister Miriam
Belchior and Ministrer José Eduardo Cardozo.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.999
I was hoping you could comment on the electoral success of
certain politicians who call themselves “non-politicians” or

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.999
“professional administers” and what this
means for Brazilian democracy.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.999
The other thing we’ve seen this week

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:19.999
is the disclosure of a list of almost 100 names of
politicians and governors, current ministers, senators,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:30.999
who are being prosecuted in the federal Supreme Court for
accusations that vary from fraud to money laundering.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.999
I was hoping you could comment on
the necessary political reforms

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.999
to help recover the credibility
of Brazilian politicians.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
One more?

00:42:42.001 --> 00:42:45.999
Good afternoon. My name is Vinícius.
I’m a doctoral student here in Physics.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.999
Thank you very much for visiting us.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.999
My question is related to something you
mentioned during your talk about the BNDES

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.999
and about the central role that 
developmentalism had in your government

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.999
and in the construction of
infrastructure in Brazil.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:12.999
Some people criticize the fact that Brazil 
took external loans at 14% and then BNDES,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.999
to stimulate the economy, would
give cheap loans at 3%,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.999
and that this would have created
a large financial imbalance.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.999
So I wanted to know your opinion
with respect to this,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000
about the role of the State as
a driver of development.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Should we start with these?
We’ll go fast.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
We’re going to wait for the answers
before another round of questions.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.999
2013. There are many explanations.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.999
It’s something that
always raises questions.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.999
But I have one of the reasons.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.999
I think that it’s much easier to distribute
income than to guarantee access to services.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:19.999
You distribute income, in ten years
you change the pattern significantly...

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.999
It isn’t easy

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.999
to create a new technology for this.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.999
We used the state bank "Caixa" to be able to distribute 
cards, therefore getting rid of clientelism,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:40.999
preventing a direct relationship between any person
and the citizen who received the Bolsa Família.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.999
But it’s difficult to access,
to change the quality of services.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.999
To change all of the social
infrastructure of a country.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.999
To guarantee medical posts near people.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000
You all need to see that one of the strong
motivations for mobilization in 2013 was health.

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.000
One of them was health.

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:10.000
That’s why we created Mais Médicos
and we brought doctors from abroad.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.999
But the situation is difficult. Why?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.999
Because let’s be clear about something:

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.999
The end of extreme poverty is
only the beginning, as we’d say.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.999
The end of extreme poverty
doesn’t resolve anything.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.999
On the contrary, from there,
people have other interests,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:38.999
they have other claims, they have other
desires, other demands, other anxieties.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.999
Here’s something I think had a part in 2013

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.999
and which is due to this yearning for more.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.999
And I also believe that there’s
something interesting about Brazil.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.999
There’s an institute called “Data Popular”

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:11.999
that ran an investigation about what
you attribute a change in your life to.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.999
In the first place, God.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.999
In the second place, the person, him
or herself... which is very good.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.999
In the third place, the person’s family.
In the fourth place, a few friends,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.999
and in the last place, the government.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:36.999
I’m saying this because it isn’t only my
information, it didn't happened only in Brazil.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:46.999
I had a conversation recently with
ex-President Cristina Kirchner

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.999
and she tells that me in Argentina
the pattern of response is very similar.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.999
What does this mean?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.999
It means that governments
can’t stop doing things,

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.999
explaining why they are
doing certain things.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.999
Principally because when they’re large-scale
policies, it isn’t clear what is being done.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.999
So there was dissatisfaction
toward access to services. Very strong.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.999
I also think that at that time,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.999
there was a theory that it was
legitimate democratic expression.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.999
That’s how we confronted it at the time.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:34.999
We treated it as something necessary,
something correct.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:42.999
I don’t think 2013 had anything
to do with 2016 and 2015.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.999
Why? Because in 2013, Brazil was growing.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.999
The interest rate had reached 2.5%.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.999
The unemployment rate was falling.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.999
So immediate economic reasons,
there weren’t any.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.999
But I think there was
social dissatisfaction

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:10.999
caused by improvements in quality of life
and greater necessity for change.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.999
That’s why I think that
2013 has a component

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.999
that is a positive component,
not a negative component.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:27.999
I believe that the resurgence of the idea of
"the worse the better" doesn’t come in a vacuum.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.999
It’s not a flash in a blue sky.
It’s human-powered.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.999
And here I move to the second (question).

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.999
They choose a president of the Chamber,

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.999
a president of the Chamber who changes...
And I’ll move also to the other question...

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.999
Who changes the democratic
center of Brazil.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.999
You have a democratic center that emerges
from the Constitution of 1988

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.999
of which Dr. Ulysses Guimarães, aka "Democratic
Elections Doctor," holds its maximum expression.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.999
So you have a pattern with Brazil’s
center being progressive.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.999
And besides being progressive, it participated
in one form or another in all governments.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.999
All the presidential
coalitions of the moment.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.999
Beginning at a certain moment,
there’s a rupture in this center.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.999
Its hegemony shifts to a
position on the extreme right,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.999
ultraconservative from
the point of view of civilization,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.999
and representative of the “Bancada da
Bala,” of the “Boi” (the “BBB Bench”).

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.999
It’s BBB, right? Bullet,
bullock, and bible.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.999
Those three.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.999
And there are gender politics
that are very bad.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:46.999
Homophobic politics,
besides being ultra ultra conservative

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.999
and neoliberal.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.999
This political hegemonization
invalidated my government,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.999
four months after being elected.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.999
March. I was elected in November. In March, they
already brought to the table the idea of impeachment.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.999
From there, politics in terms of
worse and better is visible.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.999
The enterprise called it
the “Pauta-Bomba” (Bombs Away!).

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.999
It was the agenda that
increased spending instead of reducing.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.999
So I don’t think it had
anything to do with 2013

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.999
but I think that ascending
technocratic politics

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.999
have plagued Brazil since the dictatorship.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.999
This politics they call technocratic,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.999
something above good and evil, and that
we have to elect technocratic leaders,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.999
Comes from the dictatorship.
The dictatorship created this,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.999
in that old discussion that a student
was for studying, a teacher for teaching

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.999
a worker for working, and politics
was carried out by a military government.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:00.999
So this process by a technocratic
government, apolitical and not ideological,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.999
that is the vision. And I think
this is very serious.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.999
Because I think that anyone who defends
one of these positions isn’t democratic.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.999
Democracy is born for politics.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.999
You can’t separate one from the other. Why?

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.999
Because without a political vision
in the sense of defending interests,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.999
not my individual interests, but
the collective interests of a society,

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.999
you don’t have a democratic process.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.999
There’s no given form by the economy

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.999
nor by any economic, sociological,
or political theory

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.999
that guarantees the correct
management of men and women.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.999
There is only one way:

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.999
politics, conscience,
opposition, and participation.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.999
So, technocracy is a very
questionable form of domination

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.999
that I think emerges today
from the following contradiction:

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.999
neoliberalism, increasing inequality,

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.999
and increasing restrictions.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:24.999
It’s a form of corroding democracy.
One of the variables is technocracy.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:31.999
To say that it’s possible
to look in the manual,

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.999
and get rid of participation of the 
people with their votes, or to take

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:44.999
care of the public sphere technocratically, 
is impossible to carry out democratically.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.999
In any dictatorship, this is a no-brainer.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.999
The list... So what happens?

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.999
The list isn’t of 81 people.
The list is of 300 people.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.999
They’re being sent to investigation.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.999
They’re not being prosecuted.
What’s the problem?

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.999
Many problems come out of this.
I’m not going to tell here.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.999
I really should, so I’m going to.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.999
You know why I should tell? Because it shows
a certain pattern for you to understand.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.999
During one year, two
people from my campaign,

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:38.999
one was the treasurer, and another was
the person who became my chief of staff,

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:49.999
were accused of having gone to the CEO
of a company called Andrade Gutierrez,

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.999
the CEO was named Otávio Azevedo. I’m saying
the names because they’re public record.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.999
He said that these members of my campaign,

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.999
had gone there and threatened:

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.999
“If you don’t contribute to the campaign,
you won't get any contracts.”

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.999
No position in the government.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.999
This is how it was taken.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.999
So the judge... a little more
than a year went by...

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:28.999
And the judge calls this man
to testify, and asks,

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.999
and the defense attorney also asks,

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.999
“When was this?” He says the date.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.999
“And how was it done?”
With a nominal cheque.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.999
“What day was it?” He gives the date.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.999
If I’m not mistaken,
it was a 10th or a 14th.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.999
The people from the campaign go
check the records,

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.999
because it was an official action.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.999
Bribe and blackmail,
that was the only charge.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.999
So they go there and
discover the following:

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.999
There was, in fact, a donation and
there was, in fact, a nominal cheque.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.999
For whom was the donation?

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.999
It was for the PMDB.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.999
Why did he think it was for the PT?

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Because the in the court classification, the last number 
of the process was 13 [number of the Workers' Party, PT].

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.333
Wait, be calm. You
think it stopped there?

00:55:28.358 --> 00:55:30.999
If it were only that, we
would have been condemned.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:36.999
So he looks for the nominal cheque...
And this is all online.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:43.999
It was published in all the newspapers,
by Jânio de Freitas, nonetheless.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.999
So they look at the nominal cheque.
To whom is it made out?

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.999
Michel Temer.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.999
So then we told the judge:
“Cancel the accusation,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.999
"call out the person who had pressed 
charges, this is perjury.”

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.999
So the judge calls the person 
who had pressed charges

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.499
and asks him:

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:14.999
“Here is the evidence,
do you have anything to say?”

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.999
And he says, “Oops, I was mistaken.”

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.999
The defense says, "How is it possible
that you made a mistake,

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.999
"if you said for a year that this was corruption?"

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.999
"You said it was. Now it isn’t corruption anymore?
We would like to know if it was corruption."

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:36.999
He hadn’t just been mistaken,
but this wasn’t corruption.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:44.999
It hadn’t happened. No one went and
looked for him in his office.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.999
And this is what I’m saying:

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.999
A lot of things are pushed through quickly.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.999
When you treat some people, it’s
according to certain criteria

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.999
and when you treat others,
it’s different criteria.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:05.999
I think it’s very strange that
during those two and a half years

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.999
The accused have only been from the PT.
Only.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.999
Now it’s imposible for everyone else
not to be investigated too.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.999
I want to tell you all,

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.999
I want to say this because it’s 
been broadcast to Brazil as well,

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.999
that with me, they use a trick
which is the following:

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.999
“She knew.” And then you ask,
“But did you tell her this?”

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.999
“No I didn’t, but she should have known.”

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.999
“But how should she have known?”

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.999
And here it’s the judge asking:
“How should she have known? Why?”

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.999
Because of the size of my enterprise.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.999
So they accuse me. They can’t accuse
me of having given money.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.999
They can’t accuse me of having
a Swiss bank account

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.999
of money in any other fiscal paradise.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.999
They can’t accuse me of having accepted

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.999
ANY illegal action.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.999
Now, accusations of the sort,
“She should have known”

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.999
I’ve had since the day of my election.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.999
On the day of my election, the cover
of the magazine Veja read:

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.999
“She knew everything.”

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.999
It didn’t specify what was this
“everything” nor what I “knew.”

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.999
The advantage now is that
this is going to be opened up.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.999
And just like we discovered the
nominal cheque and the account,

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.999
we’ll discover what type of story this is.
So I think I've finished...

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.999
Ah, and Vinícius and infrastructure.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.999
Vinícius, terrible news: they’re
destroying the BNDES.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:58.999
The BNDES is being destroyed.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.999
First they went and took
$100 billion from the BNDES.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.999
Why? How does the BNDES work?

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.999
Part of the BNDES obtains resources;

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.999
it has shares, it
participates in companies.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.999
All this creates cash flow.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.999
Another part is that the union government

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.999
increases its participation.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.999
It increases the quantity of resources

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:41.999
that it sends to the BNDES
to be able to make loans.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.999
It was always like this
and always worked like this.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.999
One of the things that allowed us to have

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.999
fairly high economic growth in this period

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.999
wasn’t for us, it was from
financing activities.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.999
From small activities
to more sophisticated ones.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.999
And this was done with the BNDES.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.999
I think the BNDES is a
fundamental instrument of development.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.999
For you to have an idea, the resources of the BNDES
were of the size of the resources of the World Bank.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.999
The BNDES isn’t a little bank. Many times bigger
than the Inter-American Development Bank.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.999
In terms of resources, very
close to the World Bank.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.999
In this period, the
government didn’t take loans,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.999
not from the BID, nor from the World Bank.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.999
We left the BID and the World Bank

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.999
for states and regional
governments, if necessary.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.999
Starting in 2007-2008, we never took
any more resources because we had them.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.999
Brazil is a rich country.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.999
Believe me that what they’re
doing is the following:

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.999
they are constructing a new brutal recession
because they believed in their own story.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.999
First, they believed that the economic crisis
was due to the PT being in the government

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.999
and not because there was a huge drop
in the price of commodities.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.999
You had the United States leaving the TPP, provoking
a generalized crisis in emerging countries.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.999
In Brazil, we were still feeling the
effects of the recession in China.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.999
China is an important economy
for emerging countries.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.999
And Brazil went through its
biggest hydrological crisis...

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.999
We’re still at the end of it...
In the past 80 years.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.999
We had drought for a long time
where had never been drought,

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.999
which was in São Paulo, in the
southeast of the country.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.999
And this provoked an extreme
situation of inflation,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.999
because we had to drop the
price of thermal energy.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.999
We use more water. You don’t pay for water.
When you use thermal energy,

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.999
you pay for fuel, and fuel is expensive.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.999
This had repercussions in
prices and in inflation.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.999
And finally, what I think
is most significant

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.999
is that they underestimated the
political crisis they created,

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.999
which is very serious.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.999
Mrs. President, we are unfortunately out
of time, as we are aware.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.999
But I’d like to ask just one last question
to be able to close,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.999
and the question is very simple,
and from the bottom of my heart.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.999
Thinking about Brazil, and the future,

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.999
and not thinking only about 2018,

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.999
although we’re all tempted to think 
about a big change in 2018,

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.999
how to be optimistic today
and recover utopia?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.999
I don’t think 2018 will bring a big change.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.999
I think 2018 is something else.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.999
Brazil has a tradition of
making transitions on top.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.999
I’ll give the the last one,
but we could cite several.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.999
In the last one, despite the movement 
in support of free elections after the dictatorship,

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.999
when there would be a democratic transition, 
a renegotiation was made.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.999
And I’m not saying here that
it should have been different.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.999
I think we cannot do that with history.
It was like that.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.999
It was like that. What did they do?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.999
They negotiated torture. The torturers
were going to get amnesty.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.999
There were many arguments that if you didn’t
do this, a transition wouldn’t be possible.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.999
Nobody will ever know.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.999
The fact is that we’re different
from Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay,

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.999
which didn’t give amnesty to torturers
and prosecuted them.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.999
The consequence of this
is that it’s possible

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.999
for a person to go inside Parliament to
defend the military dictatorship and torture

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.999
in a vote for impeachment.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.999
And others invade the parliament and
defend the return of a military dictatorship.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.999
This would be unthinkable in Chile,
Uruguay, and Argentina.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.999
Anyway, I don’t think it’s possible today
to make a transition on top.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.999
A transition on top is a
transition of the elite.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.999
I think that always in a transition,

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.999
there has to be a base in which all the people

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.999
and leaders participate.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.999
I understand that.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.999
I just think that at this time,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.999
there has to be a democratic process
as the basis of any transition.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.999
Any negotiation, any dialogue,
if you want to use the word.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.999
Any dialogue.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.999
There will never be dialogue,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.999
because it isn’t possible to have dialogue,

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.999
without a democratic process.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.999
I don't think it's a return to power,
or to remain there.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.999
I just believe the following:

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.999
Without a democratic process
with participation by the population...

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.999
And win whoever wins,
the result must be respected.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.999
This is the only possible way
to have a transition.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.999
The democratic process for me is much more,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.999
the detonator of a process that will
allow Brazil to retake a path.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.999
If it’s going to be 2018?
It’s the deadline.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.999
I don’t know when it’s going to occur,

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.999
it will depend on the country’s situation.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.999
But I think that there’s
a date scheduled in 2018.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.999
And from this effect, alongside the process,
comes another thing: political reform.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.999
Because a country with 25
parties is ungovernable.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.999
It’s not that people aren’t virtuous.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.999
They might even not be very virtuous.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.999
But the electoral system,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.999
the political system,

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:03.999
triggers non-virtue.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.999
Why? Because 25 parties
can’t have a program.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.999
I’m sorry, but there are not
25 programs for Brazil.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.999
And it’s not 25, it will
be 30 very soon.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.999
Why? Because they got rid
of the electoral threshold,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.999
so two democratic clauses,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.999
which are free access to communication
media during the electoral period,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.999
which gets rid of the media filter,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.999
and the public party fund
that gives support,

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.999
those two are obviously used
for the expansion of parties.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.999
If the party is free, and I’m
going to have access to the party fund,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.999
and I can negotiate time on TV,
I can aim at what I want for the party.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.999
Since I am never going to be in power

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.999
because I’m from a tiny party,

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.999
what do I do?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.999
I negotiate positions, I negotiate amendments,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.999
I negotiate advantages.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.999
So it has to do with the process
of ungovernability in Brazil.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.999
This is where (and I don’t know how you 
translate physiology in the United States)

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.999
Or patronage.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.999
Do you know how to translate it?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I think it already entered into
the vocabulary, didn’t it?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.999
Yes. This is a process
that the system fosters.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.999
So two things have to occur.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.999
The democratic process, you never know...

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.999
you never know what comes
out of the judge’s head.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.999
It used to be said that you never know 
what comes from a judge's head...but you know. 

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.999
From a woman’s womb, you also know.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.999
But the electoral process you 
never know what will come.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.999
You can’t know. It’s impossible.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.999
And also, at this stage, to say that 
democracy is a threat...

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.999
I already mentioned this story I'd heard in the past.
Democracy is not a threat!

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.999
At this moment, democracy is
the only way to structure a process

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.999
that didn’t work out, which is the
impeachment process,

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.999
the coup, and the
consequences of the coup.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.999
The absolute paralysis today of Brazil
facing everything that is happening.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.999
They’re not giving anything, they’re not
even delivering anything to the market.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.999
We’re in a rather difficult situation.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.999
So I say for you here:

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.999
I believe that in the democratic process

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.999
there’s no shame in losing the election.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.999
There’s no shame in the election
for whoever wins and whoever loses.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.999
What’s wrong is losing the election

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.999
and wanting to win by other means.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.999
That’s what’s wrong.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.999
So for me, the democratic
process is eminently...

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.999
Now, they can’t create a coup

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.999
in a democratic process. 

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.999
The democratic process's aim is 
for us to find ourselves.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.999
Because nobody can start saying
after an election,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.999
“But I don’t want that president,
I want the other one”

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.999
Because if not, you shake things up
and then there’s a coup.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.999
So on top of this, on top of
the democratic process

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.999
you make a pact.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.999
Because I don’t think,
and you’ll excuse me...

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.999
I already told this story yesterday,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.999
I always remember a cartoon I read
of Asterix and Obelix.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.999
There’s the centurion mounted on the horse,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.999
pensive and reflective,
and he says the following:

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.999
“I think these Welsh are really strange.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.999
“We invade their country,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.999
“We destroy their towns

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.999
“We kill them, we rape their women,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.999
“And when we want dialogue,
they don’t want to talk.”

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.999
I’m so sorry, but in order to
have dialogue today in Brazil,

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.999
you have to have popular participation.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.999
There is no dialogue on top possible.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:24.999
There’s an agreement. What is it?
The agreement is the following:

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.999
We are going to have direct elections.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.999
We are going to make political reform.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.999
I think this agreement
is absolutely necessary.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.999
Now, dialogue is dialogue.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
First and foremost, you have to have
a basis of democracy.
