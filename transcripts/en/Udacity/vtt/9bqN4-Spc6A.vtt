Here's our last absolute value equation. This one looks crazy. We have the

00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:08.633
absolute value of 2x plus 1 is equal to the absolute value of 3x minus 5. We

00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:13.154
have the symbol on both sides of the equation. Alright, let's take a step back

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:17.597
and think about what this really means. We know x is some number, so if I plug

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.739
in a number here, I'll get another number. The same is true on this side. So

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.762
these numbers could be positive or they could be negative. So if the number's

00:00:25.774 --> 00:00:29.810
positive and this number's positive, is this statement true? Or if there is a

00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:33.662
negative sign in front of the number, is this statement true? Check all the

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:37.710
statements that you believe are correct. That is the left side is equal to the

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:38.273
right side.
