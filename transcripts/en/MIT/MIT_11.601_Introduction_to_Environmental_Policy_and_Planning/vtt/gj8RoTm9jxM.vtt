00:00:11.155 --> 00:00:11.882
You're on.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:15.560
ELIZABETH COOPER: OK,
good morning and welcome.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.000
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me to serve

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.300
on this advisory group to
develop a regional water

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.331
strategy for our
metropolitan area.

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:25.580
I've called this meeting to
give you my advice for how

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.470
to proceed in this process.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.720
During this meeting, I will
first clarify our goals

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.930
in this process.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.279
Then I did devise some
challenges that I see

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:34.820
and what we stand
to lose if we don't

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.659
conduct this process wisely.

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.450
Next, I'll give my
thoughts on the strategy

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.970
to follow to make a sound
and politically viable

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:41.900
regional plan.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.330
And I'll talk about what I
think success in this process

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.830
would look like for you to keep
in mind prospectively as you

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.410
carry out the planning process.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350
So our goal is to
develop a strategy

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.240
for administering
water that balances,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.310
and to whatever extent
possible, actually

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.470
meets the needs of the
diverse stakeholders

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.080
from the industrial,
residential, agricultural, and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.499
conservation sectors, as well
as our partners in government.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.540
I also believe that a
second, but still important

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.940
goal is to get through
this process in a way

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.150
that this diverse
group of stakeholders

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.662
feels good about the causes
they took part in, has learned

00:01:12.662 --> 00:01:14.120
from it, and thus
is encouraged too

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.786
and has a skill set
to collaborate again

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:17.241
in the future.

00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:18.740
As you know, we
face some challenges

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.119
to developing this plan.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.160
With current distribution
and used water supplies

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.743
are tight and are
insufficient to meet

00:01:23.743 --> 00:01:26.660
the needs of development that we
hope will return to our region

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.970
with economic rebound.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.251
If we don't develop a
strategy to as far as possible

00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:33.500
meet the needs of all the
stakeholder groups involved,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.600
we will see rising
conflict that could really

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.460
strain the relationships
in this community

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.590
and ultimately tear it apart.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.050
I'm also concerned that if we
don't act wisely and proceed

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.970
in a way that everyone
is on board with,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.180
our process could be
undermined by parties

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.930
who feel disenfranchised
or who don't want

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.950
to collaborate on a solution.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.730
So how do we navigate this
delicate task with our eyes

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.064
open to arrive at
a sound solution?

00:01:56.064 --> 00:01:57.980
I'm very confident in
your abilities and those

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.410
of the experts that you talk
to make sound difference

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.390
about a plan to share
and distribute the water,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.270
but I don't want to just rely on
expertise to engineer the best

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.010
solution to this problem.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.650
I want a plan that is developed
to be the result of an informed

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.510
consensus that has the
backing of everybody

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.220
needed to implement it.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.220
Political viability is
one key factor we need,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.600
and an expert solution won't
necessarily get us there.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.030
You have been
selected to be part

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.030
of this advisory group
because of your expertise

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.330
and credibility to
deal with this policy

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.680
and decision-making effort.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.967
You have the authority to
convene a credible process.

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:32.300
However, I think we will end
up with a stronger and more

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.790
politically viable
solution if we directly

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.290
involve stakeholders
who we see as

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.106
likely to be in conflict over
the decision-making effort.

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:40.980
I suggest you bring in
a professional neutral

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.190
facilitator who can aid
in involving stakeholders

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.974
in the proposal
generating process

00:02:44.974 --> 00:02:46.640
and who could help
solidify participants

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.770
confidence and the
neutrality of the process

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.620
since disagreements are likely
to be politically charged.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.610
Here's how I
suggest you proceed.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.550
Hire an experienced
neutral as I said.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.320
Begin by conducting
situation assessment.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.450
This means meeting with
representatives of each

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.596
of the stakeholder groups.

00:03:01.596 --> 00:03:02.970
I previously
mentioned and anyone

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.040
else who thinks they should
be included in the process

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.456
and discuss with them what
their needs are for water, what

00:03:07.456 --> 00:03:09.420
their interests are,
and how they'd like

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.995
to see a regional plan develop.

00:03:11.995 --> 00:03:13.620
After you've conducted
that assessment,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.140
distill down the
results of your research

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.990
and communicate to the public
the parameters of the problem

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.281
and what are some of the
preliminary avenues that could

00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:24.080
be pursued to reach a plan.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.770
Ask stakeholders groups
to select representatives

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.420
to participate in a formal
consensus building process.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.430
Conduct joint fact
finding about uses of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.550
and needs for water in the
region and help participants

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.627
explore strategies that
conceptualize water

00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:39.960
as a flexible resource where
it can meet multiple groups

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.392
needs simultaneously.

00:03:42.392 --> 00:03:44.100
Here you can bring in
your own expertise.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.260
And by all means,
we want everyone

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.840
to agree together on
the facts that we're

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.140
going to use to make the
recommendations together.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.450
Invent options based on the
results of the information

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.950
gathering.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.582
Help participants
in the process.

00:03:56.582 --> 00:03:59.040
Find ways to add value to the
resources you're dealing with

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.260
and invent mutually
acceptable solutions.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.140
If necessary, bring other issues
besides water to the table.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.110
These groups
intersect and overlap

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.634
in a number of areas that
affect our planning strategy.

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:10.800
And it might be that if we
add in other ingredients,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.466
we're able to package
solutions that are

00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:15.170
more acceptable to everyone.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.512
Excuse me.

00:04:17.512 --> 00:04:19.470
Help representatives
caucus the various options

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.380
with their constituencies
and clarify their interests

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.870
and needs and help them package
options together in a way

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.060
that everyone can agree to
and have them all endorse

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.970
an agreement for a strategy.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.090
And then they will turn that
recommendation over to you

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.290
to formalize and then that's
what we would implement.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.130
After we engage in this
process, how will we

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.034
know that we've succeeded?

00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:42.700
All groups can sign
on to the agreement,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.220
and all agree that it is a
better arrangement than having

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.234
no agreement at all.

00:04:46.234 --> 00:04:47.650
And participating
groups will have

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.350
learned about each other's
needs and each other in a way

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.500
that they can see that
coming to consensus

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.582
is not necessarily
a zero-sum game.

00:04:56.582 --> 00:04:58.540
I think that this is the
best strategy not only

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.998
because collaboration improves
the quality of the decision,

00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:03.650
but it also makes it
more implementable.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.010
It should help neutralize
the process politically

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.780
if it has extremely
widespread support.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.760
Both the media and
the state government,

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.070
who have been less than
favorable about developing

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.790
a regional water plan would
have a hard time criticizing it

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.825
if everyone really backs it up.

00:05:17.825 --> 00:05:19.450
This has been a brief
overview, and I'm

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.400
happy to address questions
and discuss in more detail.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.000
Thank you.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.150
LAWRENCE SUSSKIND: Thank you.
