Oh

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:04.840
 
 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.420
 
well the first the first observation was

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.430
well the first the first observation was
 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.629
well the first the first observation was
that there was a very strong correlation

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:12.639
that there was a very strong correlation
 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.589
that there was a very strong correlation
between the extent to which the genome

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599
between the extent to which the genome
 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.980
between the extent to which the genome
in a cancer cell has changed and the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990
in a cancer cell has changed and the
 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.130
in a cancer cell has changed and the
lethality of the cancer so that if one's

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140
lethality of the cancer so that if one's
 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.599
lethality of the cancer so that if one's
looking at a cancer and there are lots

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609
looking at a cancer and there are lots
 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.000
looking at a cancer and there are lots
of changes in the genome that patient is

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010
of changes in the genome that patient is
 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.189
of changes in the genome that patient is
less likely to survive than a patient

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199
less likely to survive than a patient
 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.700
less likely to survive than a patient
whose genome has just begun to evolve

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710
whose genome has just begun to evolve
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.350
whose genome has just begun to evolve
that was the first major uh observation

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360
that was the first major uh observation
 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.560
that was the first major uh observation
there are a lot of particular details

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570
there are a lot of particular details
 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.110
there are a lot of particular details
that emerged from those studies that is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120
that emerged from those studies that is
 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.229
that emerged from those studies that is
we found the locations of jeans they're

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239
we found the locations of jeans they're
 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.330
we found the locations of jeans they're
called oncogenes and tumor suppressor

alter the capacity of the cancer cell to
 

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:12.059
alter the capacity of the cancer cell to
grow divided or spread in the individual

so this has been an engine also for the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750
so this has been an engine also for the
 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.969
so this has been an engine also for the
discovery of new cancer genes we weren't

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979
discovery of new cancer genes we weren't
 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.550
discovery of new cancer genes we weren't
the first ones to do this people have

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560
the first ones to do this people have
 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.460
the first ones to do this people have
been using these techniques for a while

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470
been using these techniques for a while
 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.400

drugs that are given to a patient are
 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:33.600
drugs that are given to a patient are
determined by whether that patient has a

particular gene amplification in their

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259
particular gene amplification in their
 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.880
particular gene amplification in their
cancer the most well-known example of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890
cancer the most well-known example of
 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.669
cancer the most well-known example of
that is patients with amplifications of

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679
that is patients with amplifications of
 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.580
that is patients with amplifications of
the her2 gene will likely respond to

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590
the her2 gene will likely respond to
 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.620
the her2 gene will likely respond to
Herceptin so our view has been that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630
Herceptin so our view has been that
 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.999
Herceptin so our view has been that
specific amplifications will correlate

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009
specific amplifications will correlate
 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.880
specific amplifications will correlate
with drug sensitivity we're in the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890
with drug sensitivity we're in the
 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.910
with drug sensitivity we're in the
middle of exploring that and we've also

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920
middle of exploring that and we've also
 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.609
middle of exploring that and we've also
begun to look at single cells within

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619
begun to look at single cells within
 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.469
begun to look at single cells within
cancer so we can now actually look at

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479
cancer so we can now actually look at
 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.029
cancer so we can now actually look at
the genome of an individual cell within

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039
the genome of an individual cell within
 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.279
the genome of an individual cell within
the cancer and that's giving us a much

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289
the cancer and that's giving us a much
 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.259
the cancer and that's giving us a much
more detailed picture of how the cancer

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269
more detailed picture of how the cancer
 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.360
more detailed picture of how the cancer
has evolved so we think we'll be able to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370
has evolved so we think we'll be able to
 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.770
has evolved so we think we'll be able to
identify for example the earliest cells

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
identify for example the earliest cells
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.900
identify for example the earliest cells
the earliest mutations in a cancer

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
the earliest mutations in a cancer
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.870
the earliest mutations in a cancer
that'll tell us how the cancer began to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880
that'll tell us how the cancer began to
 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.510
that'll tell us how the cancer began to
grow in the first place it'll also tell

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520
grow in the first place it'll also tell
 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.400
grow in the first place it'll also tell
us what you might call sort of the

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
us what you might call sort of the
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.199
us what you might call sort of the
tribal or population structure of the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209
tribal or population structure of the
 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.390
tribal or population structure of the
cancer and that tells us about how the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400
cancer and that tells us about how the
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.540
cancer and that tells us about how the
cancer is how the individual cancer

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550
cancer is how the individual cancer
 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.630
cancer is how the individual cancer
cells are interacting with each other

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640
cells are interacting with each other
 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.490
cells are interacting with each other
interacting with a host and migrating

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500
interacting with a host and migrating
 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.750
interacting with a host and migrating
throughout the cancer and possibly

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760
throughout the cancer and possibly
 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.820
throughout the cancer and possibly
migrating throughout the patient so that

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
migrating throughout the patient so that
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.020
migrating throughout the patient so that
we think that by looking at the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
we think that by looking at the
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.850
we think that by looking at the
individual cells of a cancer we'll be

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860
individual cells of a cancer we'll be
 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.220
individual cells of a cancer we'll be
able to improve clinical staging and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
able to improve clinical staging and
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.590
able to improve clinical staging and
drug treatment enormously but this is a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600
drug treatment enormously but this is a
 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.040
drug treatment enormously but this is a
long-term project this will take us five

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050
long-term project this will take us five
 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.860
long-term project this will take us five
years ten years

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.360
 
alright well I can give you two ways

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370
alright well I can give you two ways
 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.369
alright well I can give you two ways
there many ways that this research could

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379
there many ways that this research could
 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.350
there many ways that this research could
impact the clinic i can give you two

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
impact the clinic i can give you two
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.509
impact the clinic i can give you two
very concrete examples if a new drug is

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519
very concrete examples if a new drug is
 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.199
very concrete examples if a new drug is
being tested in a population with a

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209
being tested in a population with a
 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.570
being tested in a population with a
particular type of cancer one might look

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580
particular type of cancer one might look
 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.370
particular type of cancer one might look
for correlations between response to the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380
for correlations between response to the
 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.509
for correlations between response to the
drug and the genome profile that could

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519
drug and the genome profile that could
 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.690
drug and the genome profile that could
tell you which which patients are likely

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700
tell you which which patients are likely
 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.370
tell you which which patients are likely
to respond to a drug so that patients

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
to respond to a drug so that patients
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.839
to respond to a drug so that patients
don't have to take a drug that's not

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849
don't have to take a drug that's not
 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.460
don't have to take a drug that's not
going to benefit them and don't have to

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470
going to benefit them and don't have to
 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.530
going to benefit them and don't have to
suffer the side effects of a drug that's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540
suffer the side effects of a drug that's
 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.680
suffer the side effects of a drug that's
not going to benefit them and that will

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690
not going to benefit them and that will
 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.660
not going to benefit them and that will
ultimately lead to the design of better

ultimately lead to the design of better
 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.569
ultimately lead to the design of better
drugs a second way in this next way is

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500
you know it's not not not quite science

fiction but we're looking a little bit
 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.780
fiction but we're looking a little bit
into the future when we can examine the

into the future when we can examine the
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.270
into the future when we can examine the
genome of individual cells and can do

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280
genome of individual cells and can do
 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.630
genome of individual cells and can do
that cheaply we can develop tests early

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640
that cheaply we can develop tests early

detection tests or cancer that are based
 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.220
detection tests or cancer that are based
on blood so it's now being appreciated

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230
on blood so it's now being appreciated
 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.569
on blood so it's now being appreciated
widely that even cancers that perhaps

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579
widely that even cancers that perhaps
 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.059
widely that even cancers that perhaps
have not yet metastasize release their

have not yet metastasize release their
 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.150
have not yet metastasize release their
cells into the bloodstream and do so in

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160
cells into the bloodstream and do so in
 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.949
cells into the bloodstream and do so in
fairly large numbers so that you can

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959
fairly large numbers so that you can
 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.690
fairly large numbers so that you can
collect cells from the blood

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700
collect cells from the blood
 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.449
collect cells from the blood
unidentified them as a kind of cell that

unidentified them as a kind of cell that
 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.420
unidentified them as a kind of cell that
shouldn't be in the blood but people

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430
shouldn't be in the blood but people
 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.620
shouldn't be in the blood but people
haven't yet been able to look at the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630
haven't yet been able to look at the
 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.460
haven't yet been able to look at the
genomes of these individual cells so

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470
genomes of these individual cells so
 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.779
genomes of these individual cells so
some of the methodology that we're

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789
some of the methodology that we're
 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.210
some of the methodology that we're
developing will enable us to do that so

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220
developing will enable us to do that so
 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.640
developing will enable us to do that so
you can imagine that at some time in the

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650
you can imagine that at some time in the
 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.930
you can imagine that at some time in the
future you can draw blood in the

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940
future you can draw blood in the
 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.760
future you can draw blood in the
doctor's office and just like the

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770
doctor's office and just like the
 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.860
doctor's office and just like the
doctors now do what's called a blood

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870
doctors now do what's called a blood
 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.990
doctors now do what's called a blood
count to determine how many white blood

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000
count to determine how many white blood
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.820
count to determine how many white blood
cells you have whether it's likely that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830
cells you have whether it's likely that
 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.180
cells you have whether it's likely that
you've got a fever they'll be able to be

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190
you've got a fever they'll be able to be
 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.100
you've got a fever they'll be able to be
able to sort out from the blood the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110
able to sort out from the blood the
 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.690
able to sort out from the blood the
small proportion of cells that might be

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700
small proportion of cells that might be
 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.070
small proportion of cells that might be
being spun off by a cancer somewhere

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080
being spun off by a cancer somewhere
 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.750
being spun off by a cancer somewhere
undetected in the body and by looking at

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760
undetected in the body and by looking at
 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.300
undetected in the body and by looking at
the genome of those cells and possibly

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310
the genome of those cells and possibly
 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.190
the genome of those cells and possibly
by also looking at the RNA that those

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200
by also looking at the RNA that those
 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.110
by also looking at the RNA that those
cells are making I'll be able to say

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120
cells are making I'll be able to say
 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.930
cells are making I'll be able to say
this person has a malignant bone cancer

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940
this person has a malignant bone cancer
 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.440
this person has a malignant bone cancer
and then then you can look for that so

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450
and then then you can look for that so
 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.810
and then then you can look for that so
this technology ultimately can lead to

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820
this technology ultimately can lead to
 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.659
this technology ultimately can lead to
early detection for
