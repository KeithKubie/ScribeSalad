00:00:32.222 --> 00:00:33.700
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.190
Our lecture today concerns
mathematical induction, which,

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.490
roughly speaking, is a technique
that one uses to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.520
prove something when one already
has a pretty good

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.460
suspicion as to what the
right answer is.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.710
Now, rather than to philosophize
about this too

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.800
long, let's tear right into a
problem and see, in action,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.700
just what the concept means.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.800
Recall that, in an earlier
lecture, we have proven that

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.460
the limit of a sum is equal
to the sum of the limits

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.800
provided, of course, that
there are only two

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.600
terms in the sum.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.470
That is, if we have two
functions, 'f 1' and 'f 2',

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.180
the limit of 'f1 of x' plus 'f2
of x' as 'x' approaches

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.940
'a' is the limit of 'f1 of x' as
'x' approaches 'a' plus the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.710
limit of 'f2 of x' as
'x' approaches 'a'.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.650
The question, now, is how
about the limit of 'x'

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.870
approaches 'a' of 'f1
of x', plus 'f2 of

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.410
x', plus 'f3 of x'?

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.060
Now, to tackle a problem like
this, we do what is so often

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.010
done in any mathematical
logical procedure.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.960
We try to reduce an unfamiliar
problem to a familiar problem

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.800
which has already been solved.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.220
Let's see what I mean by that.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.780
If this had been only two
terms in here that we're

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.180
adding, we would have known how
to handle this problem.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.720
So what we observe is that since
the sum of two functions

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.750
is, again, a function, we can
assume that our expression is

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.530
written this way.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.710
Now, you see, we've reduced our
problem to the sum of two

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.240
functions, namely, 'f1 of x'
plus 'f2 of x' being one of

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.520
our functions, 'f3 of x' being
another of our functions.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.860
We know, now, what?

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.350
That the limit of a sum is
the sum of the limits.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.760
If we have two functions,
you see this is, what?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:30.100
The limit 'f1 of x' plus 'f2 of
x', you see, plus the limit

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.750
as 'x' approaches
'a', 'f3 of x'.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.290
But now, look what's in this
expression over here.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.160
This is now, what?

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.650
The limit of the sum
of two functions.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.070
And, you see, we know that the
limit of a sum is the sum of

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.520
the limits is true if we have
only two functions, so, from

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.840
here, we get to here.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.170
And, from here, we
can say, what?

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.310
This is the limit 'x' approaches
'a', 'f1 of x',

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:02.740
plus the limit as 'x' approaches
'a', 'f2 of x',

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.940
plus the limit as 'x' approaches
'a', 'f3 of x'.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.970
In other words, what we have
shown is that the limit of a

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.160
sum equals the sum of the limits
is true not just the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.290
sum of two functions, but for
the sum of 3 as well.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.100
And, more importantly, the truth
for 3 hinged directly on

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.410
the truth for 2.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.290
In other words, it wasn't just
that we proved that the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.430
formula was true for the sum of
three functions, we proved

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.060
it on the assumption that it was
already true for the sum

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.080
of two functions.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.840
And, by the way, notice how we
may now begin to suspect that

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.610
this idea generalizes.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.640
For example, let's take
a look over here.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.530
Suppose I now said how
about the limit as

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.980
'x' approaches 'a'?

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.340
And we'll now take the sum of
four functions: 'f1 of x',

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.391
plus 'f2 of x', plus 'f3
of x', plus 'f4 of x'.

00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:01.670
See, what about something
like that?

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.730
And, again, we argue the same
way as we did before.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.400
We say, you know, if
we had only had two

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.530
functions in here--

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.960
and this gives us the
hint to do this--

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.860
see, we do know that the limit
of the sum is the sum of the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.110
limits if we have only
two functions.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.570
You see, now, I could
write this as, what?

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.860
It's the limit of the first one,
as 'x' approaches 'a',

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.540
but what is the first one?

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.060
The first one is the function
'f1 of x', plus 'f2 of x',

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.010
plus 'f3 of x', plus the
limit of the second.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.730
The second now you see, is
'f sub four of x' as 'x'

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.590
approaches 'a'.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.330
Now, you see our previous
case told us, what?

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.890
That the limit of a sum is equal
to the sum of the limits

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.210
if you have the sum of
three functions.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.250
That's exactly what we have over
here, and now you see we

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.130
can say, what?

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.020
Ah, this is the limit of the
first as 'x' approaches 'a',

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.170
plus the limit of the second
as 'x' approaches 'a', plus

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:14.300
the limit of the third as 'x'
approaches 'a', plus the limit

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.230
the fourth as 'x'
approaches 'a'.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.520
In other words, what
have we done now?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.980
We've shown that knowing that
the limit of a sum is the sum

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.260
of the limits was true for a
sum of two functions and of

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.300
three functions.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.700
We've shown, inescapably, that
the same result holds for the

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.710
sum of four functions.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.870
Let's take a little breather
here and make a few asides.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.840
I think, sometimes, when one
starts to work too much with

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.340
mathematical symbolism, we lose
track of the fact that

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.640
things are not quite as
difficult as they might

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.340
otherwise have seemed.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.150
You see, for one thing, my claim
is that we have already

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.900
tackled this problem as recently
as first grade

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.160
arithmetic.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.860
Namely, we learned, what?

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.890
We learned tables.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.280
Remember the addition tables?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.510
You learned how to
add two numbers.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.670
All of a sudden somebody
says what is the sum of

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.810
1, 2, 3, and 4?

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.610
What is this number?

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.780
And what we said was, look
at, we'll just add

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.240
these two at a time.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.950
1 plus 2 is a number,
which is 3.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.240
3 plus 3 is a number,
namely 6.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.330
And 6 plus 4 is a number: 10.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.860
In other words, we essentially
did, what?

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.160
We added the first
to the second.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.860
Then we added the sum of the
first two to the third, the

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.320
sum of the first three to
the fourth, and that

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.290
was how we did this.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.320
Of course, what we assumed in
doing this was that the sum of

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.375
two numbers was, again,
a number.

00:06:45.375 --> 00:06:47.470
Up above, we assumed
that the sum of two

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.040
functions was a function.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.280
And this is not quite as trivial
as it might otherwise

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.060
have seemed.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.170
Namely, look at, if you add two
odd numbers, do you get

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.570
like things when you combine
like things?

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.860
The sum of two odd numbers
is always even.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.940
You see, you can't say let's
replace the sum of two odd

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.550
numbers by another odd number.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.080
You can say it, but
it would be wrong.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.830
On the other hand,
another example.

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.910
How about subtraction?

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.360
That's a nice operation.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.760
If you subtract a positive
number from a positive number,

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.910
are you guaranteed that the
result will be positive?

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:25.640
Well, for example, what
about 3 less 5?

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.800
The answer would
be negative 2.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.770
Positive minus positive can very
well be negative, so we

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.040
must be sure, what?

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.160
That, when we combine like
objects, we get like objects.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.770
And another thing that we
assumed was that our answer

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.450
did not depend upon
voice inflection.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.600
Now, what does that mean?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.650
Let me show you something
over here.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:49.340
Look at the expression 12
divided by 6 divided by 2.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:55.910
If you read this as if it said
12 divided by 6 divided by 2,

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.250
the answer is 1.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:04.010
On the other hand, if you read
the same thing as if it said

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:09.380
12 divided by 6 divided by
2, the answer is, what?

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.760
12 divided by 3, which is 4.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.680
In other words, division depends
on voice inflection,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.580
whereas, addition doesn't.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.730
And I simply point out these
asides to show you that, as we

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.770
go through advanced mathematical
analysis, we are

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.500
always making use of the same
assumptions that we were

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.539
making when we dealt with
more simple things.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.000
And I think this is the
healthiest way of seeing how

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.070
our subject develops.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.130
We will leap from things that
we already know into

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.970
generalizations that are
less familiar to us.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.220
At any rate, let's now return
to our main theme of

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.750
mathematical induction
and try to summarize

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.420
what's happened so far.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.740
We are working with a certain
conjecture, let's call it.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.910
The conjecture is that the limit
of the sum is the sum of

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.660
the limits.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.590
We know that the conjecture
was true for two terms.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.870
We proved that, once it was
true for two terms, it was

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.220
true for three terms.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.540
We then prove that, if it was
true for three terms, it was

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.120
true for four terms.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.090
And now, if we have any
imagination at all, we might

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.590
become suspicious and say, you
know, I think, if it's true,

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:20.340
in general, for 'n' terms,
it's going to be

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.810
true for 'n + 1' terms.

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.660
And that brings us to our next
stage in our mathematical

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.130
induction, namely, suppose the
limit of the sum is equal to

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.770
the sum of the limits in the
case that there are 'n' terms

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.000
in our sum.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.690
What can we conclude about the
limit of a sum in the case of

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.380
'n + 1' terms?

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.040
And, without going through the
proof here, we'll do these

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.990
things in our supplementary
notes in our learning

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.270
exercises, but, here, I just
want to focus our attention on

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.630
what the main theme is.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:56.770
What we say is, since we can
add without worrying about

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.060
voice inflection, why don't we
throw in a pair of braces

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.230
here, thus reducing our problem
to the limit of a sum

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.390
when we're adding but
two functions,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.990
use the theorem there.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.990
And, now, given the limit of the
sum of 'n' functions, we

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:15.810
know that that's the
limit of a sum.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:20.330
And now, it appears that the
truth for 'n' is going to

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.490
imply the truth for 'n + 1'.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.320
Now, of course, there may be
other problems that work

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.270
structurally this way other than
the limit of a sum equals

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.340
the sum of the limits.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.670
So let's generalize
that result.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.100
And the generalization
is what is known as

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.610
mathematical induction.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.900
What mathematical induction says
is this, let's suppose we

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.120
have a conjecture.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.420
Now, how we get the conjecture
is something we'll talk about

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.040
in a while, but let's suppose
we have the conjecture.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.670
Well, to try to show that the
conjecture is true all the

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.170
time, we had better be sure it's
true at least sometimes.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.450
So we say, OK, let's show that
the conjecture is true

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.130
for 'n' equals 1.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.530
That's just a simple
verification.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.120
We show that it's true
for 'n' equals 1.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:09.630
Then we say OK, next, prove that
the truth for 'n' equals

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.950
'k' implies the truth for
'n' equals 'k + 1'.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.720
In other words, we're not saying
that it's true for 'k',

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.650
all we're saying is that, if
it's true for 'k', if it's

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.690
true for 'k', the truth for
'n' equals 'k' implies the

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.720
truth for 'n' equals 'k + 1'.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.650
Then, if that's true, our
conjecture is true for all

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.490
whole numbers.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.990
Why is that?

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.300
Well, let's take a look,
informally, here.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:40.720
Let's suppose that both of these
conditions are obeyed.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.780
We know the conjecture is
true when 'n' equals 1.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.560
Now, take 'k' to be 1.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.510
Since it's true for 1, this part
tells us it's going to be

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.940
true for one more than
1, which is 2.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.120
Now that the conjecture is true
for 2, this says, what?

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.170
It's going to be true for 3.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.460
And knowing that it's true
for 3, this will say

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.820
it's true for 4.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.690
And now I'll loosely use the
word et cetera, and come back

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.260
and reinforce that
as we go along.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.370
I think now, perhaps, the best
thing to do is to look at a

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.520
second example.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.910
You see, what we did first of
all was we used an example to

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.170
lead in to what the definition
would be.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.720
Now that we have the definition,
let's proceed

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.450
directly to use it.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.460
Let me give you a conjecture.

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.530
The conjecture which I have in
mind is that the sum of the

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:31.770
first n positive numbers--

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.120
and this is an interesting
formula--

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.650
it's the last number multiplied
by one more than

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.860
the last number divided by 2.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.220
Well, let's just see if that's
true at all for a while.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:50.400
Look at, if 'n' is 1, the
left-hand side here is 1.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.300
And 1 times 2 divided
by 2 is also 1.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.400
If 'n' is 2, the sum
of the first two

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.310
numbers here is, what?

00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:59.940
One plus 2 is three.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.710
On the other hand, 2 times
3 divided by 2 is also 3.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.470
So, at least, our conjecture is
true for 'n' equals 1 and

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.640
'n' equals 2.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.040
What does mathematical
induction say?

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.890
Let's take a look again, now.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.050
You see, we showed that the
conjecture was true

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.180
for 'n' equals 1.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.730
And, for good measure, we also
showed that it was true for

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.710
'n' equals 2.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.940
So, we can check this off.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.010
We've done that.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.010
Now, what do we do?

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.670
We assume the conjecture is
true for 'n' equals 'k'.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.920
That means, what?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.670
Well, just replace 'n' by 'k'.

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:40.700
We're assuming that
this is true.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.750
From the truth of this,
what must we do next?

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.710
Well, what we must do next is
investigate what happens if

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.030
you add, what?

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.660
Not 'k' numbers, but 'k + 1'.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.960
So, in other words, what happens
when you replace 'n'

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.470
by 'k + 1'?

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.120
Now, watch how we do this.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.070
The same thing that we did in
theory before, we say, look

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.620
at, we already know how
to handle this amount.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.742
We're told that that's going to
be ''k' times 'k + 1' over

00:14:07.742 --> 00:14:12.200
2', so let's rewrite
this in this way.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.200
Now, we can replace the
bracketed expression by ''k'

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.620
times 'k + 1' over 2'.

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.490
We add on, of course, 'k + 1'
because that's the last term

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.880
that's over here.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:29.050
Now, we factor out 'k + 1'
from this factor here.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.950
That leaves us with, what?

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:34.720
'k/2 + 1'.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.330
And this, in turn, says, what?

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:43.560
That the sum of the first 'k +
1' numbers is ''k + 1' times

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.810
'k + 2' over 2'.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.350
And notice that that's exactly
what the conjecture should say

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.790
when 'n' equals 'k +
1', namely, what?

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.230
The sum of the first 'n'
numbers, no matter how many

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.260
you have, is, what?

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.390
The last number times one
more than the last

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.480
number divided by 2.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.350
The sum of the first 'k
+ 1' numbers is, what?

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:12.110
It's 'k + 1', the last one,
times 'k + 2', which is one

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:15.240
more than the last one,
divided by 2.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.940
And now, what we've done is we
have verified the second part

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:23.520
of our mathematical induction
setup, namely, if we go back

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.490
to our basic definition over
here, we have to show, what?

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:30.170
Prove that the truth for 'n'
equals 'k' implies the truth

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.670
for 'n' equals 'k + 1', which
is exactly what we did.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.890
And, while you're thinking about
that, let's take a break

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:41.170
for a few more asides which, I
think, may cement down this

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:43.480
idea a little bit
more strongly.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.430
I mentioned before that
induction is something that

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.230
one uses when one already has
a suspicion as to what the

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:51.540
right answer is.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.090
I don't know how this grabs
you, buy my own particular

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.050
feeling is that you do not look
at the sum of the first

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:01.250
'n' numbers and say aha, it's
the last one times one more

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:03.800
than the last one
divided by 2.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.050
You see, that's the nice thing
about textbook problems.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.270
When they give you a problem
on induction and they say

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.060
prove this conjecture, notice
that they've already given you

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.920
a tremendous hint, namely,
they've told you what the

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.670
conjecture is.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.330
You see, in the textbook of real
life, one usually has to

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.350
find out what the conjecture
is for oneself.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.150
In fact, in the form of a rather
interesting aside,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.050
there is a very interesting
mathematical anecdote

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.460
connected with this particular
problem.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.370
It's an anecdote attributed to
the mathematician, Gauss, who,

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.460
when he was a young chap, was a

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:39.290
discipline problem in school.

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:45.870
And the story is that his
teacher, as a punishment,

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.610
asked him to add the
first 100 numbers.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.140
And Gauss wrote down the answer
very, very rapidly.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.040
And what he did was, he didn't
add these all up.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.070
What he observed was, what?

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.010
The first one plus the last
one added up to 101.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:02.110
The second plus the next
to the last added

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.970
up to 101, you see?

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.790
And each pair going in this
way added up to 101.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.430
And how many pairs were
there, all together?

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.400
Well, there were 100 numbers,
so there were 50 pairs.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.970
In other words, there
were, what?

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:21.560
100 divided by 2 pairs, each
pair adding up to 101.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.660
And now, notice the recipe: 100,
namely the last number,

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:30.540
times one more than the last
number, 101, divided by 2.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:36.600
By the way, in the exercises
on this assignment we have

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:40.010
another problem, and that is,
if you think this one was

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.370
already cumbersome, try guessing
what the recipe for

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:47.000
this one is: what is the sum
of the first n squares?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.740
In other words, not 1, plus 2,
plus 3, et cetera, but 1

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.710
squared, plus 2 squared, plus
3 squared, et cetera.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:58.280
I give you the answer, but try
to think for a while as to how

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.920
likely it is that you would have
conjectured this in the

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.950
first place.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.700
It turns out to be ''n'
times 'n + 1' times

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.760
'2 n + 1' over 6'.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.560
You see, the reason I bring this
out is that I call this a

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.090
contrived example.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.170
It is not the case where the
mathematician would most

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.320
likely have invented
mathematical induction.

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.440
The case where he would have
invented mathematical

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.450
induction is the case that we
did earlier, for example,

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.780
where we talk about the
limit of a sum being

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:27.510
the sum of the limits.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.690
You can actually see what's
happening, how the truth that

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.630
'k' implies the truth
for 'k + 1'.

00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.340
And by the way, let me make
one more aside here that I

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.950
forgot to mention earlier.

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.150
In our definition of
mathematical induction, we

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.090
said show the conjecture is
true for 'n' equals 1.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.270
This was quite hypocritical
because the very first example

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.160
that I picked didn't even
start until 'n' was 2.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.790
We talked about the limit of
a sum being the sum of the

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.250
limits, and the smallest
sum we talked about was

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.150
the sum of two terms.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.630
The point that I wanted to
mention is, for example,

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.230
suppose that the first number
you can prove the conjecture

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.820
for is, for example,
'n' equals 7.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.010
I don't know why I picked 7.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.720
I had to pick something.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.180
Let's just call it
'n' equals 7.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.640
Suppose I can also show that, if
the conjecture is true for

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.200
'k', it's true for 'k + 1'.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.060
Then, you see, what I can
conclude is I can conclude

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.390
that it's true for 'n' greater
than or equal to 7.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:26.440
Namely, if it's true for 7, this
says it will be true for

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.310
one more than 7, which is 8.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:31.070
If it's true for 8, this says
it will be true for 9.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.860
If it's true for 9, this
says it will be

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.730
true for 10, et cetera.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.270
And we go on this way.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.250
Now, again, this may be a very
naive way of looking at it,

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.630
but I always look at
mathematical induction as a

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.640
bunch of toy soldiers stacked
up in a line in such a way

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.910
that, if any one of the toy
soldiers falls down, he knocks

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.340
down the one that's immediately
behind him, OK?

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.250
You see what I'm driving
at here?

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.120
If the first falls-- and, by
the way, that's a big if--

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.130
if the first falls, he knocks
down the second.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.270
The second falling knocks
down the third.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.430
The third falling knocks
down the fourth.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:09.720
The fourth falling down knocks
down the fifth, et cetera.

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.920
Notice that, if the first
one doesn't fall,

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.920
none of them fall.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.350
Or, for that matter, going back
to my previous analogy,

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.590
if the seventh one is the first
one that falls, all the

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.330
ones behind him fall down.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.560
Now, be very careful.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.470
Mathematical induction doesn't
say the first 50 fall down, or

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.230
the first 100 fall down,
it says they all

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:31.490
have to fall down.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:35.120
For example, here's a case where
several fall down, but,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.303
all of a sudden, one isn't
knocked down by the one in

00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:38.890
front of him.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:41.220
In other words, what
mathematical induction really

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:46.460
involves is the idea not just
that something is true, but

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.100
that it's true because the
previous one was true.

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:54.570
You see, for example, is it
possible that all of the

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:58.700
soldiers fall down even though
the one in front didn't knock

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.040
the other guy down?

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.510
I mean, it's possible all of
these go down, but for

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.600
different reasons.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.180
Mathematical induction says
much more than that.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.910
Mathematical induction says
yes, they all go down, but

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.980
each goes down because
of the one before.

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:16.410
And, by the way, one
more little aside.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.690
Notice that, in our analog,
we assumed that

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.930
there was a next one.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.970
You say, well, what do
you mean you assume

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:23.900
there was a next one?

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.820
Obviously, there has
to be a next one.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.610
But, the concept of next depends
on whole numbers.

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:33.510
For example, when you
deal with fractions,

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.840
there is no next one.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.260
Let me show you what
I mean by that.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:38.190
Let's talk about the real
numbers in general.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:39.480
On the number line, here's 0.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.750
What is the first fraction,
the first real number?

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.680
I don't care what you call it.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.190
What is the first number which
is greater than 0?

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.950
What is the first number which
is greater than 0?

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.680
And the answer is, there
is none because

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.540
whichever one you pick--

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.060
call it 'r'.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.130
Let 'r' stand for the first
number which you think is

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.430
bigger than 0, OK?

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.855
How about 'r/2'?

00:22:04.855 --> 00:22:10.340
'r/2' is still bigger than 0,
but 'r/2' is less than 'r'.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.340
In other words, given any number
you pick that's bigger

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.110
than 0, you can fit
in another one.

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.550
So, there is no number which
is immediately next to 0.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.540
In other words, as a caution,
notice that mathematical

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.410
induction is used when
we're dealing with a

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.440
whole number of objects.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.280
Now, let's emphasize some of
these little asides from a

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.060
more specific point of view.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.150
Let me, first of all, give you
an example in which something

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.370
is true for a whole bunch of
numbers, but, all of a sudden,

00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.100
isn't true in general.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.470
Now, how anybody ever stumbled
across the example I'm going

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.670
to give you next, I have no
idea, but I find it's a very

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.380
interesting concept.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.340
Let's look at this.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.120
Let's write down the following
function: 'p' of 'n', where

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.180
'n' is any positive whole
number, will be defined to be

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.530
'n' squared, minus
'n', plus 41.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:10.610
For example, 'p' of 1 will be
1 squared, minus 1, plus 41,

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.510
which happens to be 41.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:15.950
41 happens to be a prime number:
a number which has no

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.780
factors other than
itself and 1.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.540
Let's try 2 in here.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:26.570
2 squared, minus 2, plus 41,
is 43: also a prime number.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.130
Let's try 3 in here.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:34.570
3 squared is 9, minus 3
is 6, plus 41 is 47:

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.290
also a prime number.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:40.290
The amazing thing is that, as
you go all the way through to

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:44.110
40, you get nothing
but prime numbers.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.530
And you say, ah, it's right
so far, it must be

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:48.790
right all the time.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:50.290
And this is wishful thinking.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:53.150
This is like the man who wants
to count the deck of cards to

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.890
see if the cards are all there,
and he says one, two,

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.090
three, four, five.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.620
Well, so far, so good.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.450
They must all be here.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.430
It's like falling off the Empire
State building, and

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.900
halfway down, somebody says,
"How you doing?" You say, "So

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.490
far, so good." No, we're in a
little bit of trouble here

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.510
because, as soon as we pick
'n' to be 41, watch what

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:12.520
happens here.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:18.890
This becomes 41 squared,
minus 41, plus 41.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.750
And this is 41 squared, which,
obviously, is not a prime.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:25.000
It's 41 times 41.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.700
And here is an interesting
example where a certain

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.750
formula generates nothing but
primes for the first 40

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.190
integers, but fails on
the 41st integer.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.020
Why did this happen?

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:41.080
Because, evidently, the fact
that this was a prime in no

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.600
way depended structurally
on the fact that

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.930
this one was a prime.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.990
There is our mathematical
induction again, that not only

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.730
must the conjecture be true, but
it must follow inescapably

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.510
from the case before.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.010
If you'd like a more
fascinating, realistic

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.000
example, it's something that
we call the unique

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.890
factorization theorem of
elementary number theory.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:08.470
This says that every positive
whole number greater than one

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:12.480
can be factored uniquely into a
product of primes, unique up

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.640
to the order in which
you write them.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.260
For example, 2 is already
a prime, it's 2.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.600
3 is already a prime: 3.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.810
4 can be factored
as 2 times 2.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.900
5 can be factored as--

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.220
well, it's already
a prime, it's 5.

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.780
6 can be written as, what?

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.440
2 times 3.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.300
7 can be written,
of course, as 7.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.670
It's already a prime.

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:37.740
8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.090
9 is 3 times 3.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.860
10 is 2 times 5, and 11
is already a prime.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.280
Well, this doesn't
prove anything.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.820
I'm just trying to demonstrate
what the theorem says.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.460
The interesting thing is do you

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:53.510
notice how 'n + 1' factors--

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.470
I don't know what phrase to use
here, but let's call it

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.860
considerably different
than 'n'.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.060
In other words, look at what
happened to 10 when I

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.190
added 1 onto it.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.170
It factored into 2 times 5.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.710
I add 1 onto it, and, all of
a sudden, the factorization

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.420
properties change.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.870
Let me give you an example.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.770
Look at 59.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:16.240
59 happens to be a prime.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.390
Look at 61.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.140
61 also happens to be a prime.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:24.350
By the way, for those of you are
number theory buffs, these

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.410
are called twin primes.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:29.770
Consecutive odd numbers, which
are both prime, are called

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.580
twin primes.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.670
By the way, 2 is the only even
prime, of course, because, if

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.550
a number is greater than
2, and it's even, it's

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.540
divisible by 2.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.525
So, 2 is the only even prime.

00:26:41.525 --> 00:26:42.850
Twin primes are, what?

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.520
Consecutive odd numbers both
of which are primes.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:49.230
So, 59 and 61 are a pair
of twin primes.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:52.620
One might intuitively suspect,
therefore, that the number

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:56.070
between them must be sort
of a prime too, or

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.200
whatever that means.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.830
Obviously, it can't be a prime
because in between them comes

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.600
60, which is, in particular,
an even number.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.200
But look at all the nice
factors that sixty has.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.050
60 is, what?

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:11.070
It's one more than 59, one less
than 61, but look at how

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.320
different it factors.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.990
In fact, a pseudo induction-type
thing is look

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:25.150
at the factors of 60:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:25.600
We say, what?

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.700
7, experimental error?

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.120
No, no.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.850
But, this is not induction,
by the way.

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:35.730
The fact that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 6 are all factors of 60

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.420
does not mean that 7 is going
to be a factor of 60.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.370
We do not say just because it
works so far, it's going to

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.230
keep working.

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.290
And I'm not going to belabor
this point anymore.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.610
Suffice it to say that look at
how differently 60 factors

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.230
compare to the number the came
just before it and the number

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.660
that came just after it.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.610
In other words, assuming that
the unique factorization

00:27:55.610 --> 00:28:00.350
theorem is true, the truth for
'n + 1', somehow or other, has

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:02.900
nothing to do with the
truth for 'n'.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.760
And you see this is, again,
another weakness of, what's

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.180
called, induction.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.650
Well, so, that's a weakness
of induction.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.710
The point that I'm making is why
shouldn't induction have

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:14.770
some weaknesses?

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.900
After all, if it could solve
every problem, what we would

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.040
do is have a calculus book that
was three pages long.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.280
It would be called,
The Principle of

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.840
Mathematical Induction.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.740
When we solved that problem by
induction, everything else

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.940
would be done.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.450
No, there are problems
that do not lend

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.820
themselves to induction.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.130
In summary, induction is a
particularly effective

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:39.090
technique which one uses to
prove that something is true

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:43.870
for all whole numbers provided
that one has a suspicion that

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.600
this thing is true in
the first place.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.990
And secondly that, even if the
suspicion is true, the truth

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:52.890
for the 'n' plus first case
follows inescapably from the

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.350
truth for the n-th case.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.940
At any rate, this completes
our lecture for today.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:02.965
And, until next time,
good bye.
