five cards
it all works nice and fine for face to

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230
it all works nice and fine for face to
 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.870
it all works nice and fine for face to
face like we are now how do we do this

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880
face like we are now how do we do this
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.400
face like we are now how do we do this
over the mail you know if I'm going to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
over the mail you know if I'm going to
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.779
over the mail you know if I'm going to
put them in envelopes and mail them to

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789
put them in envelopes and mail them to
 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.330
put them in envelopes and mail them to
you know obviously I might just peek

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
you know obviously I might just peek
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.710
you know obviously I might just peek
I might just switch the hands here

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
I might just switch the hands here
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.000
I might just switch the hands here
because you've got ace high and I've got

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
because you've got ace high and I've got
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.009
because you've got ace high and I've got
a king high and you know we'll do it

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
a king high and you know we'll do it
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.580
a king high and you know we'll do it
this way I might I might want to put

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
this way I might I might want to put
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.070
this way I might I might want to put
cards in envelopes and ship them around

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
cards in envelopes and ship them around
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.959
cards in envelopes and ship them around
and have a fair deal and that's a model

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969
and have a fair deal and that's a model
 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.100
and have a fair deal and that's a model
for what we can do over the Internet

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110
for what we can do over the Internet
 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.270
for what we can do over the Internet
then after we see what happens with

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
then after we see what happens with
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.040
then after we see what happens with
postal mail we can try to see can we do

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050
postal mail we can try to see can we do
 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.010
postal mail we can try to see can we do
the same thing over the internet yeah

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
the same thing over the internet yeah
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720
the same thing over the internet yeah
how are we gonna do this so somehow you

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
how are we gonna do this so somehow you
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.840
how are we gonna do this so somehow you
need to choose five cards I need to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850
need to choose five cards I need to
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090
need to choose five cards I need to
choose five cards your five cards have

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
choose five cards your five cards have
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.190
choose five cards your five cards have
to be different than my five cards you

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
to be different than my five cards you
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410
to be different than my five cards you
should know what my five cards are I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
should know what my five cards are I
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.330
should know what my five cards are I
shouldn't know what your five cards are

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
shouldn't know what your five cards are
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.069
shouldn't know what your five cards are
so we're going to add at least a little

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079
so we're going to add at least a little
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959
so we're going to add at least a little
bit of pseudo cryptography here that is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
bit of pseudo cryptography here that is
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.610
bit of pseudo cryptography here that is
locks we're gonna mail you all the cards

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
locks we're gonna mail you all the cards
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110
locks we're gonna mail you all the cards
so I'm gonna take each card and put it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
so I'm gonna take each card and put it
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.400
so I'm gonna take each card and put it
in an envelope but you're not going to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
in an envelope but you're not going to
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.540
in an envelope but you're not going to
be able to see them because I'm going to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550
be able to see them because I'm going to
 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.600
be able to see them because I'm going to
put a lock on each one so that you can

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
put a lock on each one so that you can
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.310
put a lock on each one so that you can
receive these envelopes in some random

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
receive these envelopes in some random
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.870
receive these envelopes in some random
order the way the post office delivers

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
order the way the post office delivers
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.340
order the way the post office delivers
them now you get an envelope that looks

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
them now you get an envelope that looks
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.600
them now you get an envelope that looks
like this with your name on it of course

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
like this with your name on it of course
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.280
like this with your name on it of course
it's got a card in it you can't see what

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
it's got a card in it you can't see what
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.080
it's got a card in it you can't see what
the card is and we'll do that 52 times

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
the card is and we'll do that 52 times
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.969
the card is and we'll do that 52 times
so I'll put a card there's the five of

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
so I'll put a card there's the five of
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679
so I'll put a card there's the five of
clubs put that in an envelope

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
clubs put that in an envelope
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.200
clubs put that in an envelope
lock it up zero okay locked up I'll keep

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
lock it up zero okay locked up I'll keep
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.060
lock it up zero okay locked up I'll keep
the key and there's your second card

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
the key and there's your second card
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.560
the key and there's your second card
I've got the key to all of them so we're

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
I've got the key to all of them so we're
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.240
I've got the key to all of them so we're
gonna have 52 of these in random order

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
gonna have 52 of these in random order
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.340
gonna have 52 of these in random order
you have no idea what card is in which

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
you have no idea what card is in which
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.319
you have no idea what card is in which
envelope and they're all shuffled by

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
envelope and they're all shuffled by
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.609
envelope and they're all shuffled by
this whole process of getting them to

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
this whole process of getting them to
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.120
this whole process of getting them to
you in locked

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130
you in locked
 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.310
you in locked
envelopes like this and so you've got 52

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320
envelopes like this and so you've got 52
 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.100
envelopes like this and so you've got 52
envelopes or boxes each with one card in

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
envelopes or boxes each with one card in
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.300
envelopes or boxes each with one card in
it they're all shuffled you don't know

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
it they're all shuffled you don't know
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550
it they're all shuffled you don't know
the order and you're not gonna open them

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
the order and you're not gonna open them
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.780
the order and you're not gonna open them
you can't open them actually because you

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
you can't open them actually because you
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580
you can't open them actually because you
don't have the key to these locks so the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
don't have the key to these locks so the
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.719
don't have the key to these locks so the
next thing we're going to do is you're

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
next thing we're going to do is you're
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.910
next thing we're going to do is you're
going to ship them all back to me with

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
going to ship them all back to me with
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.370
going to ship them all back to me with
an additional lock on each one so you're

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
an additional lock on each one so you're
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.899
an additional lock on each one so you're
gonna put a lock on the other corner of

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909
gonna put a lock on the other corner of
 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580
gonna put a lock on the other corner of
the envelopes here and then they'll be

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
the envelopes here and then they'll be
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.170
the envelopes here and then they'll be
double locked and I'll get all the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
double locked and I'll get all the
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.850
double locked and I'll get all the
envelopes back in random order

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
envelopes back in random order
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.920
envelopes back in random order
each doubly locked so let's do that yeah

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930
each doubly locked so let's do that yeah
 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.209
each doubly locked so let's do that yeah
these locks are just like the original

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
these locks are just like the original
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.590
these locks are just like the original
ones except that you have the key and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
ones except that you have the key and
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.959
ones except that you have the key and
instead of me having the key so you've

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969
instead of me having the key so you've
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.459
instead of me having the key so you've
got the key now you can unlock all these

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
got the key now you can unlock all these
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.990
got the key now you can unlock all these
second locks and we've got them here

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
second locks and we've got them here
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.219
second locks and we've got them here
these are different colors so we know

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
these are different colors so we know
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.080
these are different colors so we know
these are Brady locks as opposed to Ron

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
these are Brady locks as opposed to Ron
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.809
these are Brady locks as opposed to Ron
locks you putting black

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819
locks you putting black
 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.690
locks you putting black
on the envelopes should be clear these

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700
on the envelopes should be clear these
 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.069
on the envelopes should be clear these
are your hands not my hands doing the

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079
are your hands not my hands doing the
 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.349
are your hands not my hands doing the
work here on my knees I'm on these in

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359
work here on my knees I'm on these in
 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:20.800
work here on my knees I'm on these in
mind

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810
mind
 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.990
mind
I like these problems these are good so

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000
I like these problems these are good so
 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.220
I like these problems these are good so
at this stage were at a very interesting

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230
at this stage were at a very interesting
 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.199
at this stage were at a very interesting
situation we've got all the envelopes

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209
situation we've got all the envelopes
 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.910
situation we've got all the envelopes
sent to you with a lock on them in this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920
sent to you with a lock on them in this
 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.500
sent to you with a lock on them in this
case the silver locks that I know how to

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510
case the silver locks that I know how to
 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.539
case the silver locks that I know how to
unlock and now you've taken the envelope

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549
unlock and now you've taken the envelope
 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.190
unlock and now you've taken the envelope
shuffled them up and put your own locks

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200
shuffled them up and put your own locks
 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.809
shuffled them up and put your own locks
on each one one black lock per envelope

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819
on each one one black lock per envelope
 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.699
on each one one black lock per envelope
as you see here and you have the keys

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709
as you see here and you have the keys
 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.830
as you see here and you have the keys
for the black locks I have the keys for

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840
for the black locks I have the keys for
 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.300
for the black locks I have the keys for
the silver locks and all of these get

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310
the silver locks and all of these get
 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.949
the silver locks and all of these get
mailed back to me it's on random order

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959
mailed back to me it's on random order
 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.959

they're locked with locks that I can

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840
they're locked with locks that I can
 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.020
they're locked with locks that I can
open let's see what I got and then we'll

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030
open let's see what I got and then we'll
 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.590
open let's see what I got and then we'll
see who won the last card I've opened up

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600
see who won the last card I've opened up
 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.370
see who won the last card I've opened up
all five envelopes and I got a hand

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380
all five envelopes and I got a hand
 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.100
all five envelopes and I got a hand
almost a flush even but I got ace king

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110
almost a flush even but I got ace king
 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.409
almost a flush even but I got ace king
and you've got Queen Jack ten nine oh if

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419
and you've got Queen Jack ten nine oh if
 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.520
and you've got Queen Jack ten nine oh if
you had an eight you would add a street

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530
you had an eight you would add a street
 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.970
you had an eight you would add a street
yeah yeah what we achieved was playing

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980
yeah yeah what we achieved was playing
 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.580
yeah yeah what we achieved was playing
poker over the mail we dealt the cards

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590
poker over the mail we dealt the cards
 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.230
poker over the mail we dealt the cards
out in a way that you never saw of what

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240
out in a way that you never saw of what
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.879
out in a way that you never saw of what
cards I had I never saw what cards you

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889
cards I had I never saw what cards you
 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.710
cards I had I never saw what cards you
had until we finally opened them up but

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720
had until we finally opened them up but
 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.030
had until we finally opened them up but
individually then we can disclose them

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040
individually then we can disclose them
 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.230
individually then we can disclose them
or maybe people have a round of betting

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240
or maybe people have a round of betting
 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.820
or maybe people have a round of betting
first and you can see that yeah I've won

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830
first and you can see that yeah I've won
 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.770
first and you can see that yeah I've won
and it was a fair game right even though

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780
and it was a fair game right even though
 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.629
and it was a fair game right even though
we played it over the mail and you think

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639
we played it over the mail and you think
 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.070
we played it over the mail and you think
it might be impossible to play poker

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080
it might be impossible to play poker
 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.659
it might be impossible to play poker
over the mail how do you deal the cards

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669
over the mail how do you deal the cards
 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.010
over the mail how do you deal the cards
in fact you can deal the cards as long

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020
in fact you can deal the cards as long
 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.750
in fact you can deal the cards as long
as you have locks that only I can open

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760
as you have locks that only I can open
 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.490
as you have locks that only I can open
and locks that only you can open this is

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500
and locks that only you can open this is
 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.500
and locks that only you can open this is
an interesting example of what we might

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510
an interesting example of what we might
 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.360
an interesting example of what we might
call a cryptographic protocol we want to

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370
call a cryptographic protocol we want to
 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.620
call a cryptographic protocol we want to
do something over the internet it's got

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630
do something over the internet it's got
 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.760
do something over the internet it's got
certain properties you want to achieve

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770
certain properties you want to achieve
 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.620
certain properties you want to achieve
and I think if poker game is is

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630
and I think if poker game is is
 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.600
and I think if poker game is is
emblematic of lots of other things you

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610
emblematic of lots of other things you
 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.190
emblematic of lots of other things you
might want to have happened with bidding

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200
might want to have happened with bidding
 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.600
might want to have happened with bidding
or other kinds of things on the Internet

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610
or other kinds of things on the Internet
 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.740
or other kinds of things on the Internet
here we hey need to have some special

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750
here we hey need to have some special
 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.659
here we hey need to have some special
properties what we call community the

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669
properties what we call community the
 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.340
properties what we call community the
fact that you could put your lock on and

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350
fact that you could put your lock on and
 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.080
fact that you could put your lock on and
then I could put my lock on and then you

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090
then I could put my lock on and then you
 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.430
then I could put my lock on and then you
can take your lock off and then I can

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440
can take your lock off and then I can
 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.380
can take your lock off and then I can
take my lock off it's kind of unusual in

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390
take my lock off it's kind of unusual in
 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.940
take my lock off it's kind of unusual in
mathematics where you sort of applying

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950
mathematics where you sort of applying
 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.320
mathematics where you sort of applying
one function then applying another

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330
one function then applying another
 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.270
one function then applying another
function then undoing the first function

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280
function then undoing the first function
 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.250
function then undoing the first function
and then undoing the second function so

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260
and then undoing the second function so
 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.570
and then undoing the second function so
these operations of locking and

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580
these operations of locking and
 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.070
these operations of locking and
unlocking actually commute with each

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080
unlocking actually commute with each
 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.650
unlocking actually commute with each
other so we can do the same thing with a

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660
other so we can do the same thing with a
 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.750
other so we can do the same thing with a
bit of math and make playing poker over

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760
bit of math and make playing poker over
 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.460
bit of math and make playing poker over
the Internet feasible then so we need

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470
the Internet feasible then so we need
 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.680

that so and K could also be a very large

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199
that so and K could also be a very large
 

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.139
that so and K could also be a very large
number so these are numbers you can't

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.149

Spades and raise that to the K power and
 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:59.069
Spades and raise that to the K power and
K is a big number here so raising a

00:06:59.069 --> 00:06:59.079
K is a big number here so raising a
 

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:00.479
K is a big number here so raising a
number to a big powers itself an

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:00.489
number to a big powers itself an
 

00:07:00.489 --> 00:07:02.069

it's something you can do efficiently so
 

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:09.479
it's something you can do efficiently so
even if K is a hundred digit number or

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:09.489
even if K is a hundred digit number or
 

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:11.399
even if K is a hundred digit number or
200 digit number we can do this very

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:11.409
200 digit number we can do this very
 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:13.769
200 digit number we can do this very
quickly taking the remainder mod P at

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:13.779
quickly taking the remainder mod P at
 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:15.569
quickly taking the remainder mod P at
every step and ending up with a result

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:15.579
every step and ending up with a result
 

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:18.509
every step and ending up with a result
which is just Q to that K power modulo P

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:18.519
which is just Q to that K power modulo P
 

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:21.029
which is just Q to that K power modulo P
so remainder after dividing by P that's

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039
so remainder after dividing by P that's
 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.169
so remainder after dividing by P that's
what this is the computer representation

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:22.179
what this is the computer representation
 

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:25.079
what this is the computer representation
of it this is the we had for the demo

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:25.089
of it this is the we had for the demo
 

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:27.029
of it this is the we had for the demo
with an envelope that's the first

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039

encryption we've done that just by

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:28.719
encryption we've done that just by
 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.389
encryption we've done that just by
raising to a power and dividing the

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:30.399
raising to a power and dividing the
 

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:32.309
raising to a power and dividing the
results by P taking the remainder so now

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319
results by P taking the remainder so now
 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.629
results by P taking the remainder so now
we want to raise have the other party

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639
we want to raise have the other party
 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.039
we want to raise have the other party
encrypt it again and that's raising to

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:35.049
encrypt it again and that's raising to
 

00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:37.019
encrypt it again and that's raising to
another power so we can take Q to the K

00:07:37.019 --> 00:07:37.029
another power so we can take Q to the K
 

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:39.899
another power so we can take Q to the K
and raise that to some new power J mod P

00:07:39.899 --> 00:07:39.909
and raise that to some new power J mod P
 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:41.309
and raise that to some new power J mod P
so the other party knows us another

00:07:41.309 --> 00:07:41.319
so the other party knows us another
 

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:43.919
so the other party knows us another
secret key so J is Brady's key so you've

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:43.929
secret key so J is Brady's key so you've
 

00:07:43.929 --> 00:07:45.389
secret key so J is Brady's key so you've
taken that you've raised it to the J

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:45.399
taken that you've raised it to the J
 

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:47.579
taken that you've raised it to the J
power so I've taken the me confusing

00:07:47.579 --> 00:07:47.589
power so I've taken the me confusing
 

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:49.139
power so I've taken the me confusing
them but you sent me yeah you've taken

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:49.149
them but you sent me yeah you've taken
 

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:51.479
them but you sent me yeah you've taken
that raise that to the J power divided

00:07:51.479 --> 00:07:51.489
that raise that to the J power divided
 

00:07:51.489 --> 00:07:53.579
that raise that to the J power divided
by P taking the remainder and so this is

00:07:53.579 --> 00:07:53.589
by P taking the remainder and so this is
 

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:55.079
by P taking the remainder and so this is
the result we have the nice thing about

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:55.089
the result we have the nice thing about
 

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:56.399

gives us exactly what we need here so

00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:16.749
gives us exactly what we need here so
 

00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:18.449
gives us exactly what we need here so
now we've got this so you sent me back a

00:08:18.449 --> 00:08:18.459
now we've got this so you sent me back a
 

00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:22.199
now we've got this so you sent me back a
doubly locked value Queen Queen to the K

doubly locked value Queen Queen to the K
 

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:25.259
doubly locked value Queen Queen to the K
to the J and so now I want to take the

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:25.269
to the J and so now I want to take the
 

00:08:25.269 --> 00:08:27.629
to the J and so now I want to take the
my key off so I can mail you back your

my key off so I can mail you back your
 

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.850
my key off so I can mail you back your
hard so I can just multiply by K inverse

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:29.860
hard so I can just multiply by K inverse
 

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.449
hard so I can just multiply by K inverse
in the exponent Q to the J to the K

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459
in the exponent Q to the J to the K
 

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:35.490
in the exponent Q to the J to the K
raised to the power K inverse so K

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:35.500
raised to the power K inverse so K
 

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.559
raised to the power K inverse so K
inverse we have to compute in a way that

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:37.569
inverse we have to compute in a way that
 

00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:38.879
inverse we have to compute in a way that
I can explain later but it really is

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:38.889
I can explain later but it really is
 

00:08:38.889 --> 00:08:41.100
I can explain later but it really is
just the multiplicative inverse of K

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:41.110
just the multiplicative inverse of K
 

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.899
just the multiplicative inverse of K
when we're dealing in the exponents like

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:42.909
when we're dealing in the exponents like
 

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:46.439
when we're dealing in the exponents like
this and so K times K inverse cancels

00:08:46.439 --> 00:08:46.449
this and so K times K inverse cancels
 

00:08:46.449 --> 00:08:49.290
this and so K times K inverse cancels
and we get this is equal to Q to the J

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:49.300
and we get this is equal to Q to the J
 

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.559
and we get this is equal to Q to the J
mod P is to say the K lock has been

00:08:52.559 --> 00:08:52.569
mod P is to say the K lock has been
 

00:08:52.569 --> 00:08:53.700
mod P is to say the K lock has been
taken off so

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:53.710
taken off so
 

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.160
taken off so
how we take off the first lock and the J

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.170
how we take off the first lock and the J
 

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.140
how we take off the first lock and the J
lock remains the key lock has been taken

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.150
lock remains the key lock has been taken
 

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.990
lock remains the key lock has been taken
off and now you can do the same thing to

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.000
off and now you can do the same thing to
 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.990
off and now you can do the same thing to
remove your lock q to the J to the J

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000
remove your lock q to the J to the J
 

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.450
remove your lock q to the J to the J
inverse there's a value is J inverse and

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:06.460
inverse there's a value is J inverse and
 

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.980
inverse there's a value is J inverse and
up in the exponent we take the remainder

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:07.990
up in the exponent we take the remainder
 

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.290
up in the exponent we take the remainder
mod P and that's just equal to Q because

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:10.300
mod P and that's just equal to Q because
 

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.230
mod P and that's just equal to Q because
J times J inverse is 1 so mod p so this

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:13.240
J times J inverse is 1 so mod p so this
 

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.110
J times J inverse is 1 so mod p so this
is this and you could get your card

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120
is this and you could get your card
 

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.970
is this and you could get your card
Queen of Spades so this is an example of

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:17.980
Queen of Spades so this is an example of
 

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:18.810
Queen of Spades so this is an example of
what you might call a cryptographic

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:18.820
what you might call a cryptographic
 

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.800
what you might call a cryptographic
protocol

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:19.810
protocol
 

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.570
protocol
so it's an example where I have some

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:21.580
so it's an example where I have some
 

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.670
so it's an example where I have some
information you have some information we

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680
information you have some information we
 

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.290
information you have some information we
want to share information there might be

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:25.300
want to share information there might be
 

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.300
want to share information there might be
some complicated rules for how we share

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:27.310
some complicated rules for how we share
 

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.220
some complicated rules for how we share
information who gets to know what when

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:29.230
information who gets to know what when
 

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.960
information who gets to know what when
that's exactly the kind of thing we have

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:30.970
that's exactly the kind of thing we have
 

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.490
that's exactly the kind of thing we have
here that happens all the time for

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:32.500
here that happens all the time for
 

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.350
here that happens all the time for
example it might be an auction we want

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360
example it might be an auction we want
 

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.000
example it might be an auction we want
to bid it for an oil field or something

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.010
to bid it for an oil field or something
 

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.830
to bid it for an oil field or something
like that and cryptographic protocols do

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:37.840
like that and cryptographic protocols do
 

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.180
like that and cryptographic protocols do
get used for these kinds of things where

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:39.190
get used for these kinds of things where
 

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.980
get used for these kinds of things where
we're bidding you have to commit to a

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:40.990
we're bidding you have to commit to a
 

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.420
we're bidding you have to commit to a
value and then later you have to reveal

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:42.430
value and then later you have to reveal
 

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.070
value and then later you have to reveal
the value so it's very much like we saw

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080
the value so it's very much like we saw
 

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.720
the value so it's very much like we saw
here where we lock things and later

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:45.730
here where we lock things and later
 

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.400
here where we lock things and later
unlock them and so on so so that's

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:47.410
unlock them and so on so so that's
 

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.050
unlock them and so on so so that's
another example various kinds of

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.060
another example various kinds of
 

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.700
another example various kinds of
economic transactions happen all the

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:50.710
economic transactions happen all the
 

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.660
economic transactions happen all the
time like this

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:51.670
time like this
 

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.640
