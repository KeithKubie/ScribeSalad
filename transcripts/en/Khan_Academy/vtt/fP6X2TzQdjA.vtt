00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.970
- [Instructor] We're told Martha
has a fixed budget of $20,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.050
and she spends it all on two
goods, good X and good Y.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.650
The price of X is $4 per unit,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.710
and the price of Y is $2 per unit.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.900
The table below shows the total benefit,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.360
measured in dollars, Martha receives

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.960
from the consumption of each good.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.010
All right, we see that
here, this is total benefit,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.540
not marginal benefit.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.000
What is Martha's marginal benefit

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.400
of the fifth unit of good X?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.090
So just to answer this
question, let's see,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.480
she has a total benefit of
$40 when she has four of X.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.790
And then when she goes to the fifth,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.930
her total benefit is an incremental $1.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.750
So she goes from $40 to $41.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.630
The marginal benefit of that
fifth one is that extra dollar.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.670
So we added a dollar of total benefit,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.170
so that's the marginal benefit.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.803
So it is $1.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.540
Calculate the total consumer surplus

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.490
if Martha consumes five units of X.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.320
Show your work.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.263
Well, the consumer surplus
is going to be the benefit,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.100
benefit

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.180
minus the cost, which
is going to be equal to,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.400
well, when she has five units of X,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.860
her total benefit is $41.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.810
So I'll write that here, $41.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.790
And then what's her
cost of five units of X?

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.510
Well, X costs $4 per unit.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.610
So five times four is $20, so
her cost is going to be $20.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.250
So her consumer surplus

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.683
is going to be equal to $21.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.210
Martha is currently
consuming four units of X

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.090
and two units of Y.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.330
Use marginal analysis to explain

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.930
why this combination is
not optimal for Martha.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.210
So pause this video, and
see if you can answer that.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.630
All right, well, let's just think about

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.270
what the marginal benefit is

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.850
from every incremental unit of X or Y,

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.720
and then let's think about the
marginal benefit per dollar.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.170
So I'm gonna make an extra column here.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.530
Let's call this marginal benefit of X,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.880
and then let's call this
marginal benefit of Y.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.390
I'm doing it over this table
just for the sake of space.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.710
And so the marginal benefit

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.480
of this first one is going to be 16.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.040
We went from zero to 16.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.320
The second one, we go from
16 to 28, so it's $12.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.780
And then to go from 28 to 36 is eight.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.580
To go from 36 to 40 is four
extra dollars of benefit.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.070
And to go from 40 to 41, we
already talked about that,

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.560
that's $1 of marginal benefit.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.970
If we talk about Y, well, the first unit,

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.550
you get $10 of benefit.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.060
The next one is the total
benefit increase eight, by $8,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.480
so that's the marginal
benefit of the next unit.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.960
The next one, to go from 18 to 24, six,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.260
to go from 24 to 28 is four more,

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.690
and then 28 to 30 is two more.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.450
And then we could use this
information to think about

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.480
marginal benefit of X

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.940
per price of X,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.550
and we could also think
about marginal benefit of Y

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.850
per price of Y.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.683
And so, let's see,

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.400
and we're gonna start
with the first units.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.900
And so for this first unit,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.400
if you take the marginal benefit of X

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.457
divided by the cost of a unit of X,

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:14.750
$16 divided by $4 is going to get four.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.950
12 divided by four is three.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.080
Eight divided four is two.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.880
Four divided by four is one.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.620
And one divided by four is 0.25.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.450
And then for Y, the cost
of Y is $2 per unit.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.200
So the marginal benefit per dollar

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.260
of this first unit right over
here is $10 divided by $2,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.480
which is five.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.740
Eight divided by two is four.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.220
Six divided by two is three.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.160
Four divided two is two.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.830
And then two divided by two is one.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.470
And so let's just think about

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.720
what would be an optimal
combination for Martha.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.910
When she's thinking about
spending her first few dollars,

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.300
she'll get a higher
marginal benefit per dollar

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.020
by going with Y, so she's
going to start here.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.390
And then after that, her
second unit of Y has the same

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.470
marginal benefit per dollar
as her first unit of X.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.390
So she's indifferent.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.760
She would do these in some order.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.400
So maybe she could do this one

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.770
and then move on to that one,

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.600
or, though, it could
go in the other order.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.980
And so far, she's only spent,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.700
let's see, $2, $2 is $4 plus another $4,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.860
she's only spent $8, and
she has a budget of 20.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.010
And then after that, her next incremental

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.560
unit of either X or Y,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.040
the marginal benefit
per dollar is the same.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.950
So just thinking about whether this

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.040
could be an optimal combination,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.390
she's already bought two units of Y.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.900
Let's just give the
benefit of the doubt here.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.340
Let's say that she goes for the X,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.220
so she buys this one here.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.170
But once she has two units of both,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.550
and she hasn't spent all of her money,

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.170
she spent $8 here plus another $4.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.420
She has $8 to spend.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.350
The next rational thing for her to do,

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.180
her marginal benefit per dollar
for that third incremental Y

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.800
is higher than the third incremental X.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.700
So it would be optimal
for her to buy a third Y.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.930
But here, we see that she
only has two units of Y,

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.760
so that's why we know it's
not an optimal combination.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.320
So we could say once

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.440
she has

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.453
two of each,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.580
the

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.760
marginal benefit of Y

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.970
per price of Y

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.610
is greater than the marginal benefit of X

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.450
per price of X for

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.963
the third unit,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.090
so she will buy

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.090
more than two Ys,

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.090
let me write, let me scroll
down a little bit, buy more than

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.980
two Ys.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.930
All right, the next they say is

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.410
what is Martha's optimal
combination of goods of X and Y?

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.350
Well, we've already started
that conversation up here.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.650
She would buy this Y, and
so far she spent $8 plus $6,

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:10.580
so she has another $6 to spend.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.890
And then now her next incremental
unit, she's indifferent,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.267
so maybe she buys another Y.

00:06:16.267 --> 00:06:20.270
$8 plus $8, this is
$16, so she has $4 left.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.130
And so then she would buy this,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.930
and she has spent all of her
money, $12 here, $8 here.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.120
So she would buy three Xs and four Ys.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.860
So I would say three Xs

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.700
and four Ys.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.220
All right part e, indicate
whether each of the following

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.010
will cause the optimal quantity of good Y

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.240
to increase, decrease, or stay the same.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.500
So look at these and pause this video,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.310
and see if you can answer those.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.130
So the price of good Y doubles.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.330
Well, if the price of good Y doubles,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.070
then the marginal benefit
per price of Y will go down.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.430
So she will buy less of
Y, so it would decrease.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.520
She would get less bang for her buck on Y,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.590
so she would buy less of Y.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.510
Martha's income falls to
$10 with no price changes.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.740
Well, if we go through
the exercise we just did,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.690
her budget would run out much faster,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.790
and so she would definitely decrease

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:16.870
the number of Ys she would buy.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.760
So the Ys would decrease.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.760
Martha's income doubles, and
the price of both goods double.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.533
Well, in that case, things
would stay the same,

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.910
stay the same.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.110
Because once again,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.000
she could buy that exact same combination.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.710
It would just cost twice as much,

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.980
but then her budget is now twice as much.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.240
So things would stay the same.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.760
She would buy the same
quantities of both Xs and Ys,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.150
and they're just asking about Ys.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.983
And we're done.
