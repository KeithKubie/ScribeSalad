know you had one candidate saying it was
 

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.140
know you had one candidate saying it was
gonna be rigged yeah it's quite right so

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:48.150
gonna be rigged yeah it's quite right so
 

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:49.340
gonna be rigged yeah it's quite right so
if it looked like it was rigged

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:49.350
if it looked like it was rigged
 

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:51.800
if it looked like it was rigged
we know benefits okay you raised the

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:51.810
we know benefits okay you raised the
 

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:53.270
we know benefits okay you raised the
point more generally about undermining

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280
point more generally about undermining
 

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:56.300

all that seemed to have been other

countries are going to going to copy it
 

00:48:02.599 --> 00:48:05.300
countries are going to going to copy it
but mine was actually my thought about

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:05.310
but mine was actually my thought about
 

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:07.280
but mine was actually my thought about
it is that it's a more it's a more

it is that it's a more it's a more
 

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:09.950
it is that it's a more it's a more
organic and accidental process so just

00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960
organic and accidental process so just
 

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.390
organic and accidental process so just
by the logic of having a network

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:15.349
by the logic of having a network
decentralized system which the internet

00:48:15.359 --> 00:48:16.339
decentralized system which the internet
still is yes of course there's

00:48:16.339 --> 00:48:16.349
still is yes of course there's

centralized companies with lots of data

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060
centralized companies with lots of data
 

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.270
centralized companies with lots of data
but the general logic of it is is

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280
but the general logic of it is is
 

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.790
but the general logic of it is is
decentralized and it's cross-border

00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800
decentralized and it's cross-border
 

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:26.900
decentralized and it's cross-border
and so the inevitably that is going to

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:26.910
and so the inevitably that is going to
 

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:29.450
and so the inevitably that is going to
make it very difficult for governments

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460
make it very difficult for governments
 

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.790

who are very happy to play on that to

thoughts anybody I could give a quick

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:00.380
thoughts anybody I could give a quick
 

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.100
thoughts anybody I could give a quick
answer I think it will support the

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:03.110
answer I think it will support the
 

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:06.850
answer I think it will support the
attacker because I think we we have the

00:55:06.850 --> 00:55:06.860
attacker because I think we we have the
 

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:08.350
attacker because I think we we have the
arms race that we've talked about

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:08.360
arms race that we've talked about
 

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.050
arms race that we've talked about
already and Jay said at the beginning

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:11.060
already and Jay said at the beginning
 

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.970
already and Jay said at the beginning
that it's you know we're trying to catch

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:12.980
that it's you know we're trying to catch
 

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.920
that it's you know we're trying to catch
raindrops and there's just content and I

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:14.930
raindrops and there's just content and I
 

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.690

think with the continued advance of

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:16.700
think with the continued advance of
 

00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:19.660
think with the continued advance of
artificial intelligence that is going to

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:19.670
artificial intelligence that is going to
 

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:22.300
artificial intelligence that is going to
make this even more difficult it is

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:22.310
make this even more difficult it is
 

00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:24.970
make this even more difficult it is
essential to me that governments are the

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:24.980
essential to me that governments are the
 

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.730
essential to me that governments are the
ones in the end that are the leaders in

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:27.740
ones in the end that are the leaders in
 

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:29.770
ones in the end that are the leaders in
artificial intelligence and it is going

00:55:29.770 --> 00:55:29.780
artificial intelligence and it is going
 

00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:32.410
artificial intelligence and it is going
to have to be so highly regulated so

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:32.420
to have to be so highly regulated so
 

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.180
to have to be so highly regulated so
it's a very different world in a sense

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:34.190
it's a very different world in a sense
 

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:37.690
it's a very different world in a sense
that we're about to move into do you

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:37.700
that we're about to move into do you
 

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:40.570
that we're about to move into do you
think AI is regulatable if there is such

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:40.580
think AI is regulatable if there is such
 

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:48.040
think AI is regulatable if there is such
a verb is not I think I mean yeah the

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:48.050
a verb is not I think I mean yeah the
 

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:49.420
a verb is not I think I mean yeah the
last question I I have a different view

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:49.430
last question I I have a different view
 

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:52.690
last question I I have a different view
philosophically and technically and

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:52.700
philosophically and technically and
 

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:54.550
philosophically and technically and
maybe it's the case that it won't be

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:54.560
maybe it's the case that it won't be
 

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.200
maybe it's the case that it won't be
possible to regulate it in the same way

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:56.210
possible to regulate it in the same way
 

00:55:56.210 --> 00:55:57.910
possible to regulate it in the same way
but I think that what I'm worried about

00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920
but I think that what I'm worried about
 

00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.590
but I think that what I'm worried about
is that the greatest advances in

00:55:59.590 --> 00:55:59.600
is that the greatest advances in
 

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.060
is that the greatest advances in
artificial intelligence in the end will

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:01.070
artificial intelligence in the end will
 

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:03.100
artificial intelligence in the end will
fall to private companies they will have

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:03.110
fall to private companies they will have
 

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:06.040
fall to private companies they will have

not work well with democracy it is
that's important so governments are

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:15.230
that's important so governments are
 

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:18.370
that's important so governments are
going to have to step in yep actually

00:56:18.370 --> 00:56:18.380
going to have to step in yep actually
 

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:21.610
going to have to step in yep actually

actually make makes he wrote a paper

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:25.460
actually make makes he wrote a paper
 

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.160
actually make makes he wrote a paper
about this and there's also a YouTube

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:27.170
about this and there's also a YouTube
 

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:29.080
about this and there's also a YouTube

he actually made the case that if this

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:31.730
he actually made the case that if this
 

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:34.720

basically so you're using this

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:44.010
basically so you're using this

and the algorithms which is there to
profile people to such an extent that

00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460
profile people to such an extent that
 

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:51.920
