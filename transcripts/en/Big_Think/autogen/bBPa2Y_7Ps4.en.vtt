what's happening here right because all
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.580
what's happening here right because all
you'll have to do is the thought

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
you'll have to do is the thought
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.469
you'll have to do is the thought
experiment and the thought experiment is

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479

end zone for a touchdown and just take a
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.719
end zone for a touchdown and just take a
minute and think about what those

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
minute and think about what those
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.300
minute and think about what those
headlines would have been the next day

why he's the best coach in the NFL and
deserves that ring now obviously whether

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
deserves that ring now obviously whether

a good one

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
a good one
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.410
a good one
but we act like it does and that's what

but we act like it does and that's what
 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.760
