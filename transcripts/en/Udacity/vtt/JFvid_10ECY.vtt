00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.611
Let's move on to another type of depressant. That's opioids. Opioids are

00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:10.122
medically very useful, because, they're effective pain relievers. Opiates

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:16.520
include morphine, heroin, as well as oxycodone, among other drugs. The main

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.285
ingredient of these painkillers comes from the opium poppy. Although, some of

00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:26.285
the drugs use a synthetic version. Acute effects of opiates are pain relief,

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:31.115
confusion, lower blood pressure, decreased respiration, euphoria or a dreamlike

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:37.237
state as well as decreased coordination. In addition, they can produce nausea

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:42.735
and vomiting as well as. Constipation just as have seen with other drugs.

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:47.127
Opioids can be very helpful when properly used as medical treatment, for

00:00:47.127 --> 00:00:53.307
example, receiving morphine after having a surgery. However, these are often

00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:58.630
abused. As with other central nervous system depressant, we see people display

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.709
tolerance to the effects of these drugs. Meaning, the person will have to take

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:08.314
more of the drug to produce the original effect. Now let's go back to Susan to

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:12.043
talk a little bit about heroin, a commonly abused opioid.
