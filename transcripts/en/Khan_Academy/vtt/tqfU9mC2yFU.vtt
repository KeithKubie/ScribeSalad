00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.150
Welcome back.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.010
I don't know what
I was thinking.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.420
Sometimes my brain
malfunctions.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.160
But just going back to that
problem we were doing, actually

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.970
I think we should do it.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm a little
schizophrenic today.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.210
So let's figure out
the equation for the

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.220
volume of a sphere.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.630
So what's the equation?

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.900
It's x squared plus y squared
is equal to r squared.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.630
And let's just write y as
a function of x, just so

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.370
we can do it the way we
did that last problem.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.200
So you get y squared is equal
to r squared minus x squared.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.800
y is equal to the square root
of r squared minus x squared.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.410
And let's draw it.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:45.190
So if this is my y-axis, this
is my x-axis, and the

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.420
equation-- draw it straight--
that's my x-axis, and then I

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.190
actually have a circle tool,
let me see if I can use it

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:10.760
effectively-- well,
close enough.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.190
There you go.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.390
I think you get the point.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.360
But anyway.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.570
This is just going to be the
upper half of the circle.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.330
Actually, I should probably
just undo that circle tool

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.590
and try to draw it by hand.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.950
So y equals the square root of
r squared minus x squared.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.470
That's just going to be the
upper half of the circle.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:34.000
So it will be the positive x
quadrant-- and then actually,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.200
I should have drawn
the whole hemisphere.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.350
But anyway.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.970
Actually, let me do that,
because I think it'll

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.140
make-- edit, undo, let me
clear all of this out.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.630
Sorry for wasting your time,
but I think it'll be effective.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.990
OK.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.775
So let me redraw.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.720
So this, that's the y-axis,
that's my x-axis, and then

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.340
this-- the square root is,
since it's a function, it can

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.020
only have one value, so we
assume it's defined as the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.500
positive square root.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.490
So if we were to graph that,
it would look like this.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.590
Something like that, where this
would be minus r and that's r.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.910
So if we want to find the
volume of a sphere with radius

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.910
r, we just have to rotate this
function around the x-axis.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.740
This is the x-axis,
that's the y-axis.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.330
So let's see what we can do.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.690
Let's just visualize
the disks again.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.850
So let me make a disk.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.790
So let's say that that's the
side of one of the disks again,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.670
and as we know, the depth of
the disk is just

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.590
going to be dx.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.000
That's how wide
that disk is, dx.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.210
And its radius at any point is
f of x, and in this case, it's

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.180
y is equal to square root of
r squared minus x squared.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.740
So what's the surface
area of each disk?

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.880
What's this?

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.900
The surface area of
each of the disks.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.420
I hope you know
what I'm saying.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.850
So area is equal to pi r
squared, the radius at any

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.490
point is equal to this, radius
is equal to y which is equal to

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.770
square root-- and remember,
this is not this r.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.520
This is the radius
of this disk.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.500
I know it might be a
little confusing.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.940
y is equal to the square root
of r squared minus x squared.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.680
So the area is going to equal
pi times this squared.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.650
So if you square this quantity,
you just get rid of the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.560
square root sign, right?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.600
So pi r squared minus x
squared, and that's the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.020
area, and so what's the
volume of that disk?

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.900
Well just like we've done in
every video up to this point,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.350
the volume of that disk is just
that, so the volume of that

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:05.470
disk is just this pi r squared
minus x squared times dx.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.860
And so if we want to figure out
the volume of all these disks,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.255
I have a disk here, a disk
here, going around and around

00:04:10.255 --> 00:04:12.330
and around and around and
around and they get smaller and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.340
smaller until we have a sphere.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.020
We just take the integral, the
upper bound is positive r, the

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.940
lower bound is minus r, and we
take the integral of

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.980
this expression.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.240
pi-- let me distribute it,
because that's going to make it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:37.090
easier-- pi r squared, which is
just a constant term, minus pi

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.560
x squared, all of that dx.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.870
So what's the antiderivative
of that expression?

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.270
The antiderivative
within the parentheses.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.630
Well, this is just
a constant term.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.090
pi r squared, that's just a
number, because we're just

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.550
taking the integral
with respect to x.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.660
So the antiderivative of pi r
squared is just pi r squared x,

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.370
the derivative of pi r squared
x is just pi r squared, minus--

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.160
and we did this in
the last video.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.670
Actually, well now, it's the
antiderivative x squared, which

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.860
is x to the third over 3, and
the pi is just a constant, so

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.670
pi x to the third over 3, and
we're going to evaluate

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.440
that at r and minus r.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.940
Let me erase some stuff, looks
like I'm running out of space.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.840
Hopefully all of that
you know by now.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.620
OK, back to the pen tool.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.910
OK.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.080
So let's evaluate it at r.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:58.920
So this is pi r squared, and
then for x, we'll substitute

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:07.440
the positive r times r minus pi
x cubed, but now we have this r

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:21.870
here, so r cubed over 3 minus
pi r squared, and then we have

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.290
a minus r here, because we're
evaluating the antiderivative

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:36.120
at minus r, times minus r,
minus pi minus r cubed.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.240
So what's minus r cubed?

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.370
It's r cubed, but we'll
keep the minus sign.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.540
r cubed, and at that minus
sign, let's just make

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.650
that-- that'll turn that
into a plus-- over 3.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.070
Let's see if we can clean
this up a little bit.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:07:01.300
So that first term is pi r
cubed, r squared times r, minus

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:08.780
essentially 1/3pi r cubed.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.310
And then, what is this?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.410
This is pi r cubed, but then
we have a minus sign up.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.090
This is minus pi r cubed, and
then we have a minus sign up

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:28.310
here, so this becomes plus pi r
cubed, and then minus-- because

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.830
we have a plus here and a minus
out here, so distribute it--

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:37.610
so minus 1/3pi r cubed.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.420
And let's see, what do we have?

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.680
We have essentially 1.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.780
If we just distribute out the
pi r cubes, we have pi r cubed

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:57.200
times 1 minus 1/3
plus 1 minus 1/3.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.820
Well that's 2 minus 2/3, or
another way, let's see, is 2

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.120
minus 2/3-- this is turning
into a fractions problem-- and

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.970
what's-- well, that's 6/3
minus 2/3, it equals 4/3.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.280
So this is equal to 4/3.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:23.780
So the volume of the sphere is
equal to 4/3 pi r cubed, which

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.240
is the equation for the
volume of a sphere.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.760
And actually, now that
I realize, it did take

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.190
me eight and a half
minutes, so I am glad.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.310
My first intuition is always
correct, I am glad I did

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.170
this in a separate video.

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.650
But that should be pretty
interesting to you.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.840
And it makes a lot of sense.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.800
It's going to be a cube of
the radius, pi is involved.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.950
The 4/3 is interesting, just
in terms of how it relates

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.400
to everything else.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.950
Area is pi r squared, and then
all of a sudden you get a 4/3

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.360
here, so it is something
for you to think about.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.130
Anyway, hopefully
you found that fun.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:56.930
I'll see you in the next video.
