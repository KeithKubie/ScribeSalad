Katina: Thank you all for coming to this "Authors
at Google" Talk. My name is Katina Johnson,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.769
and I'm a Manager in Online Sales and Operations.
I'm please to introduce our guest speaker

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.960
today, Amy Goodman. Goodman is an award winning
journalist, investigative journalist and syndicated

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.529
columnist. Um...she’s an author and host
of Democracy Now which airs on more than 800

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.970
public TV and radio stations worldwide. She's
had four New York Times best sellers, three

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.669
of those were co-authored with her brother,
uh, journalist David Goodman. And, in fact,

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.579
when Amy was here last, it was in April of
2008. She and her brother promoted their book,

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.440
"Standing Up To the Madness." That was also
a time when the presidential, uh, campaign

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.390
was starting to heat up, and with all that's
happened in politics in the last couple of

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.899
years since then, it seems as like there's
even more madness to, to stand up to now.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.900
Um, and that's exactly what her role has been
during her career as a journalist. So today

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.359
she's going to talk about her most recent
book, "Breaking the Sound Barrier". It's a

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.220
collection of wide-ranging articles that cover
a lot of the hot button issues, uh, like the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.280
wars and one that definitely front-of-mind
in the news, immigration. Bill Moyers, who

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.530
wrote the introduction, describes it as a
reality check. He goes on to say that you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.720
can learn more of the truth about Washington
and the world from one week of Amy Goodman's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.080
"Democracy Now" than from a year of Sunday
morning talk shows. So, we only have an hour

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.020
today. She's going to talk for about 45 minutes,
uh, but I suspect that there's a lot that

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.250
we can learn from her right now. So please
join me in welcoming Amy Goodman.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:47.660
Amy Goodman:
Well, it's great to be here and hello to everyone

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.220
in the satellite facilities. Um, well, I,
why don't I start off by asking how many of

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.410
you have ever seen, or heard, or read "Democracy
Now" online? Where do you watch it? Online?

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.610
Male audience member:
Online?

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.610
Amy Goodman:
Uh, radio?

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.020
Male audience member:
KPFA?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.060
Amy Goodman:
KPFA? Television? KRSB, CBS, and Public Access

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.030
in Marin County, and depending on where you
are. Uh, well, I originally come from Pacifica

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.140
Radio which was founded 61 years ago um...
in the Bay Area, uh, in Berkeley, KPFA the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.750
first station. And it was founded by a man
named Lou Hill. He was a WWII conscientious

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.849
objector. Uh, When he came out the detention
camps, he said that there has got to be a

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.200
media outlet that is run not by corporations
that profit from war, but run by journalists

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:49.560
and artists, and that's how Pacifica was formed.
Um, the first Pacifica station, KPFA '49 and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:03:00.639
KCFK in Los Angeles '59, 1960 my station in
New York, WBAI, WPFW in Washington 1977, KPFT

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:06.580
in Houston 1970. Those are the five Pacifica
stations. That station in Houston is the only

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.010
one in the country who transmitter was blown
up. Uh, in the first few months of operation

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.340
the Ku Klux Klan strapped dynamite to the
base of the transmitter and blew it to smithereens.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.909
And when they got back on their feet, they
blew it up again. Now the silver lining was

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.590
it's not as if they had money for advertising
or anything, so it certainly blew it into

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.189
the conscientiousness of the potential listening
audience of the people of Houston. I don't

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:35.390
remember if it was the Grand Dragon or the
Exalted Cyclops because I often confuse their

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.400
titles, but he said it was his proudest act.
And I think that's because he understood how

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.629
dangerous Pacifica is, how dangerous independent
media is because it allows people to speak

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:55.230
for themselves. And when you hear someone
speaking from their own experience whether

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:02.430
a Palestinian child, an Israeli grandmother,
an Afghan aunt, an uncle from Afghanistan.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.889
You come to understand them a little better.
You don't necessarily have to agree, but you

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:13.489
understand where they're coming from. We need
a media in this country that builds bridges

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.840
between communities rather than advocates
the bombing of bridges. The media can be a

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.639
great force for peace. But that's not how
it's used in this country. I just came from

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:35.699
uh Stanford, speaking last night, to a conference
today on the future of journalism. And for

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:45.500
all of the new wave interesting ways of distributing
media and all the new possibilities and what

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.080
with newspapers folding, what does it mean,
and where is journalism going, I think we

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.199
still have to get back to the very important
basics of journalism, holding those in power

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.099
accountable, simple as that. Uh, my brother,
David, and I wrote these three books: the

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.690
first is called the "Exception to the Rulers",
and that's what media should be; that's the

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.569
motto of democracy now, The Exception to the
Rulers. The second one is called "Static",

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.289
and the reason we call it that is because
in this high tech digital age with high definition

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.889
television and digital radio still all we
ever get is static. That veil of distortion,

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:27.240
lies, misrepresentations, and half truths
that obscure reality when what we need is

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.300
the dictionary definition of static, criticism,
opposition, unwanted interference. We need

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.379
a media that covers power, not covers for
power. We need a media that is the fourth

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:46.479
estate, not for the state. And we need a media
that covers the movement that creates static

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.479
and make history.

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:51.729
Um, and that's not the kind of media we have
in this country. People talk a lot about how

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.789
the reason newspapers are being shuttered
around the country is, well because of the

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:03.220
internet. There's other ways to get information.
I think that's partly true. But I also think

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:14.050
newspapers buried themselves by not telling
the truth, by icing out the voices of dissent

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.580
that really are what could have saved them
and all of us. I mean, let's just look at

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.930
the lead up to the invasion of Iraq. And the
reason I go back to this, it is so important.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:35.020
A country can't make a more serious decision
than going to war, than sending young men

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.490
and women and not-so-young men and women to
kill or be killed. And so we should talk about

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:45.810
it all the time when we're doing it, and we
are doing it big time. In Iraq we just passed

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:52.539
the seventh anniversary of the war. In Afghanistan,
we're on nine years, longer than the U.S.

00:06:52.539 --> 00:07:00.889
was involved in Vietnam. It's truly astounding.
Um, about five weeks before the U.S. invaded

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:07.419
Iraq, uh, General Collin Powell, then Secretary
of State, gave his push for war at the United

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:14.240
Nations. Um, the group FAIR, Fairness And
Accuracy In Reporting, did this study of the

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.060
two weeks around that speech that was February
5th, 2003. They looked at the four major nightly

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:26.469
news casts, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening
News, ABC World News Tonight, and uh, PBS

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:34.370
News Hour with Jim Lehrer. Four news casts,
the agenda-setting news in this country. In

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:41.300
that two week period, there were 393 interviews
done around war. Guess how many were with

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.680
anti-war leaders? Silence. [Audience guessing.]
Underestimate 0.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.310
(audience murmuring)
But you're close.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.949
(audience murmuring)
Still an underestimate, 1.

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:59.960
(More audience murmuring)
Uh, you overestimated, 5. So, 3. Three of

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:07.629
almost 400 were with anti-war leaders. That
is no longer a mainstream media 'cause about

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:13.690
half the population was opposed to war then.
But they brought out 3 of 400 voices? That's

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.960
an extreme media beating the drums for war.
And I really do believe that those who were

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.650
opposed to war, those who were opposed to
torture are not a fringe minority. Not even

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:31.300
a silent majority, but the "silenced" majority;
silenced by the corporate media which is why

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:39.479
we have to take it back. It really does matter.
I think the media are the most powerful institutions

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:45.362
on earth. More powerful than any bomb, more
powerful than any missile, and the Pentagons

00:08:45.362 --> 00:08:51.890
deploy the media, so we've got to get it back.
I think the embedding process brought the

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:57.490
media to an all-time low. You know, the embedding
process where reporters get embedded, and

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:03.190
the front lines of troops which Victoria Clark,
who was spokesperson for the Pentagon, helped

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:09.480
craft the whole "embed" program, called it
a spectacular success which, of course, why

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:17.760
it's a very serious failure. Um, the idea
of the embedding process is you get this,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:23.600
you know, immediate view, yes, but from only
one perspective - from the trigger end of

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:28.940
the war. I'm not say reporters aren't brave
who are embedded, but when you're sleeping

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:34.000
with the troops, eating with the troops, when
your life is in their hands, you are going

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.279
to report a certain way. And you have a certain
perspective. If you're going to have reporters

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:46.230
embedded in troops, you need reporters embedded
in Afghan hospitals, in Iraqi communities,

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.750
in the peace movement around the world to
understand the full effects of war. And the

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:58.290
problem isn't only the embedding process in
troops, uh, covering troops; it's being embedded

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:05.520
in the establishment in Washington. You know
how often you hear these softball questions

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:12.130
at the White House; we call it the access
of evil. Right? Trading truth for access,

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:18.790
and it not worth it. It's a disservice.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:24.880
We have to protect journalism, and we have
to promote journalism. Reporters around the

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:32.360
world face very serious consequences for their
work, especially Arab media workers and journalists

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.550
in Iraq and Afghanistan. I want to talk about
Wikileaks in a minute.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.390
Um, but I want to talk about something less
serious, but it does have serious ramifications.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:47.440
And that was the recent trip that I took with
my colleagues just from here to Vancouver,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:55.190
or attempted to take. It was Thanksgiving,
and um, uh, I was on a book tour for "Breaking

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:59.850
the Sound Barrier". And since everyone was
eating turkey here, we thought we'd talk turkey

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:06.540
in Canada. So we headed from Seattle to the
border and then up to Vancouver. I was going

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.310
to be speaking from the Vancouver Public Library.
Wherever we go, we hold fundraisers for the

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:16.579
community stations that run "Democracy Now",
and there are three radio stations in Vancouver.

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:23.209
So we're crossing the border, it's Wednesday
of Thanksgiving, and we hand them our passports,

00:11:23.209 --> 00:11:28.300
and they pull us over. They flag us. And they
tell us that we've got to go into this big

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:33.620
border facility. So we go in. It's pouring
rain, and it's really close to the talk. So

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.899
I have to get out of there so that I can go
up to the library. And, uh, you know, they

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:43.320
call me up, uh, to the counter. They say,
uh, "Amy, we want your notes." I said, "My

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:50.160
notes for what?" They said, "Your notes for
your talk tonight." Well, now, I don't really

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:56.481
speak from notes, so I went out to the car,
and I got a copy of the book. And I came in,

00:11:56.481 --> 00:12:00.700
and I gave it to them. And there were three
guards. You know they were all armed. One

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.880
of them was entering everything I was saying
into a computer. Another was handwriting down

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.089
everything I was saying, and the other started
reading the book which I took as a good sign.

00:12:10.089 --> 00:12:11.089
(laughter)

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:16.509
So they said, "What are you going to be talking
about tonight?" And I was very taken aback,

00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:21.111
and, but it sort of a no-man's land there.
You don't know what your rights are, and I

00:12:21.111 --> 00:12:27.050
really had to get there. So I said, "Well,
I was going to start with the last column.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:32.089
What I basically do is I, uh, read excerpts
of columns", I said, "and I riff off them."

00:12:32.089 --> 00:12:43.029
So I was going to start with the last column,
um, which is about Tommy Douglas, title "Healthcare

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:48.690
Reform Needs an Action Hero". Tommy Douglas,
who is considered the greatest Canadian. He

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.760
was the Premier of Saskatchewan in the early
60's. Well, when he was a kid he almost lost

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:58.080
his leg, and a doctor offered to, uh, help
him for free. He was poor, and so when he

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.880
grew up and he became a politician, he thought,
"The one thing I want to bring to Canada is

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.529
single-payer healthcare, is national healthcare
system." It's what they call Medicare. And

00:13:06.529 --> 00:13:13.019
so, as Premier of Sasketchewan he introduced
it. And his major opponent was the American

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:18.449
Medical Association, right? Based here. Why?
Because they were afraid the contagion would

00:13:18.449 --> 00:13:25.459
spread south. And they led a, like three-week
strike of Canadian doctors, but Tommy Douglas

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:31.600
won. And they adopted Medicare in Saskatchewan.
Then he traversed Canada until it was adopted

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:39.149
everywhere. Extremely popular program in Canada.
Um, I'm telling the guards this story, the

00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:42.680
Canadian guards. This is the Canadian side
of the border. I said, "I don't really get

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.490
it. I'm being detained here. Sara Palin just
came here and trashed your system! She was

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.649
able to go all over Canada!" Anyway, so I
said, "So, I wrote my column on it because..."

00:13:52.649 --> 00:13:59.210
Well, this is how I started it. "Imagine the
scene, America 2009. 18,000 people have died

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:04.060
in one year, an average of almost 50 a day.
Who's taking them out, or, what's killing

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.790
them? To investigate, President Obama might
be tempted to call on Jack Bauer, the fictional

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:14.310
rogue intelligence agent from the hit TV series,
"24", who invariably employs torture and a

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:18.639
host of other illegal tactics to help the
President fight terrorism. But terrorism isn't

00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:23.970
the culprit here. It's lack of adequate healthcare.
So maybe the President's solution isn't Jack

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:32.360
Bauer, but rather the actor who plays him".
You know who the star of "24" is? Kiefer Sutherland.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.250
Well his family has very deep connections
to healthcare reform. His grandfather is Tommy

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:43.791
Douglas, the man who brought single-payer
healthcare to Canada. Um, "Yes, Kiefer Sutherland

00:14:43.791 --> 00:14:49.560
is the grandson of Tommy Douglas. Um, his
mother is Shirley Douglas, his father is Donald

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:56.020
Sutherland. And Kiefer Sutherland, if he spoke
out here, would have a tremendous impact.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:01.560
You know, he speaks to a very right-wing audience.
He, uh, "24" is like Rush Limbaugh's favorite

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:08.110
show. Glenn Beck loves it. Rush Limbaugh visited
the set of 24. Um, "he should learn from the

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:12.709
real life actor who plays his hero, Jack.
Limbaugh and his cohorts might find truth

00:15:12.709 --> 00:15:17.600
not as satisfying as fiction". Now Kiefer
Sutherland does speak out in Canada. He was

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.529
speaking at a big rally in Alberta. He said,
"Private healthcare doesn't work. America's

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:27.940
trying to change their system. It's too expensive
to get comprehensive medical care in the U.S.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.070
Why on earth are we going to follow their
system here?" Kiefer Sutherland said, "I consider

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.769
it a humanitarian issue. This is an issue
about what is right and wrong, what is decent

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:44.750
and what is not". "Maybe Jack Bauer can save
the day," I said to the Canadian border guards.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.750
(laughter)

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.560
It's getting really late, and they said, "What
else are you talking about?" "So I said, Well,

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.860
I thought I would talk about the global economic
meltdown." "What else are you talking about?"

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:59.319
they said. I said, "Well, uh, I was going
to talk about global warming." "What else

00:15:59.319 --> 00:16:03.290
are you talking about?" I said, "Well, maybe
this would be the trigger. I was going to

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.730
talk about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"WHAT ELSE are you talking about?" I said,

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.920
"Well, I only have an hour. That pretty much
does it.”

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:11.920
(laughter)

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.870
"And they said, "Are you denying you are talking
about the Olympics?"

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:14.870
(laughter)

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.870
I said, "The Olympics?"

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.870
(laughter)

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.870
I mean anyone who knows me, I'm not really
into watching organized sports, though I do

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:28.690
like to play sports. And I didn't even know
what they were talking about. This is how

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:35.850
limited my world it. Um, I said, "Do you mean
when President Obama to Copenhagen to try

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:39.600
to get the Olympics to Chicago?" And he said,
"Yeah, and you didn't get them." I said, "I

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.800
know we didn't get them. I said, "You mean
the "real Olympics?" He said, "I'm talking

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.079
about the Vancouver Olympics." I said, "Oh."

00:16:47.079 --> 00:16:54.579
I mean it really wasn't on my radar at all.
And I said, "No, well until now I wasn't planning

00:16:54.579 --> 00:17:01.569
to talk about the Olympics." And because I
was so incredulous, he clearly didn't believe

00:17:01.569 --> 00:17:06.390
me. He told me to sit down, and they went
through our car. Um, I was with two colleagues;

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:10.699
one of them is Chuck Scurich. He's handing
Daily Digest if you want to sign up for our

00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:14.720
daily headlines and news alerts. And folks,
in other places, you can just go to our website

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:21.539
and sign up. But I was there with Chuck and
Dennis Moynihan, who edited the columns. And,

00:17:21.539 --> 00:17:27.110
uh, they went through everything. They went
through our computers. They were on our computers

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:31.409
when I went out to check on them, going through
all my notes. It was a very serious violation.

00:17:31.409 --> 00:17:34.299
And when they came in, they brought me in
a back room. They took four pictures of me

00:17:34.299 --> 00:17:39.140
and my colleagues." They stapled what they
called "control documents" into our passports.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:43.320
I said, "I didn't think we needed visas to
come into Canada." And they said, "These aren't

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.340
visas; they're control documents". And they
said we had to leave within 48 hours. And

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:52.539
if you think I talk fast? You should see how
fast I talked for the next 48 hours to get

00:17:52.539 --> 00:17:55.630
everything in. And then we left. And when
I would tell people they would say, "This

00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:02.160
is Canada?" But we learned so much, uh, as
a result. Yes, we made it to Vancouver. Thank

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.140
goodness for Canadians; they'd all gone out
for beer. And they all came back and brought

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.840
their friends. So it was a packed audience.
And it became the top story in Canada. You

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:13.919
know, American journalist detained at the
border. And CBC and the Toronto Globe and

00:18:13.919 --> 00:18:17.840
Mail and the Toronto Sun. I mean, everywhere
I was going, I was being interviewed. But

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.700
when I watched their pieces, the piece right
after the one covering me, for example, is

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.810
about the Vancouver City Council and how it
had passed legislation that if you had a sign

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:32.030
in your house that said anything against the
Olympics, your house could be raided. Oh,

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:36.010
athletes weren't allowed to speak out against
corporations that sponsored the Olympics.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.940
It was very serious! The issue of free speech
was serious! And you know, two nights ago

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.860
I was speaking at University of Wisconsin
Eau Claire, and, um, (clears throat) that

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:54.040
afternoon, they, uh, the students invited
people for a free lunch if they were willing

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:59.059
to give up free speech which is very cool.
It was the journalists' organization there.

00:18:59.059 --> 00:19:03.631
They said anyone who wants, who is willing
to give up free speech and freedom of the

00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:08.169
press, come on in and have lunch. And then
they had protests outside, and you know they

00:19:08.169 --> 00:19:11.429
sort of played this all out. But, you know,
freedom of the press, freedom of speech is

00:19:11.429 --> 00:19:16.580
extremely important. And it was violated there,
especially as they went through our notes.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:22.799
Then, um, we've got to take these things seriously.
Like what happened at the Republican Convention

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:28.559
just two years ago. Uh, let's see. I was here
two years ago. It was a couple months before

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:34.520
the Convention, and of course, "Democracy
Now" was out in force, "Breaking With Convention",

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.059
"War, Peace and The Presidency, from the streets
to the suites to the convention floor." We

00:19:39.059 --> 00:19:45.250
went to Denver; then we flew on to Minneapolis,
St. Paul to cover the Republican Convention

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:51.580
after the Democrats. It was the first day
of the Convention, Labor Day. Um, for the

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:57.650
Republican Convention there was a major protest
that morning of 10,000 people led by soldiers.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:02.100
Amazing! Some in full military regalia who
were saying no to war. You know, they take

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.890
great risk in doing this. There is a real
untold story of thousands of soldiers who've

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.691
said no to war, by the way, who've refused
to go. They are according to the Pentagon

00:20:11.691 --> 00:20:15.510
numbers, but they don't like to talk about
it. And then there are those who go to fight

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:21.860
in Iraq, who go to fight in Afghanistan, or
go again, and again, and again, and again,

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.529
and then they refuse or they just come home
to talk about it. And they were the ones who

00:20:25.529 --> 00:20:30.621
were leading this protest of 10,000. And we
were out covering it, of course. And my colleagues

00:20:30.621 --> 00:20:35.200
went back to SPNN which is St. Paul Neighborhood
Network, the public access station we were

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.559
broadcasting from, and I went off to the Convention
floor to start to cover the Convention. I

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:47.260
was interviewing delegates from the hottest
state, from Alaska. And, um, and then I got

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.630
a call on our cell phone from, um, from our
senior producer, Mike Burke. He said, "Come

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:57.251
quickly to 7th and Jackson. Two of our producers,
Nicole and Shariff, were arrested." He said,

00:20:57.251 --> 00:21:01.429
"They were hurt. You've got to get over there."
Uh, that's Nicole, uh, the producer, senior

00:21:01.429 --> 00:21:06.950
producer, and Nicole Salazar, our multi-media
producer. So I raced off the Convention floor,

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:12.150
and I had all the credentials on that allow
me to interview presidents and vice presidents

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:16.980
delegates, and I was with our cameraman, Rick
Rowley of Big Noise Films. We raced down the

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.740
street to St. Paul, got to 7th and Jackson,
a big parking lot, and the riot police had

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.679
surrounded the area. They had it totally contained.
I raced up to them. I was out of breath. I

00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:30.590
went up quick. I said, "You can see I have
just come from the Convention floor. I'd like

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:34.490
to speak to your commanding officer. Uh, you
can see I am a credentialed reporter. We have

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:38.650
two reporters inside, also fully credentialed.
We need to have them released immediately."

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:43.180
I mean it wasn't seconds before they ripped
me through that line, twisted my arms back,

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.320
slapped handcuffs on me, pushed me up against
the wall and onto the ground, and arrested

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:53.140
me. Charged me with a misdemeanor, interfering
with a peace officer. Uh, if only there was

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:58.280
a peace officer in the vicinity. So I was
on the ground, looking desperately for Nicole

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.169
and Shariff. I see Shariff across the parking
lot, arms behind him back, his back, his arm

00:22:02.169 --> 00:22:06.060
is bleeding. I demand to be brought to him.
Finally they bring me to him, and I was...

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:10.610
they had really, um, set the handcuffs, made
the handcuffs very tight. I was asking them

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:15.740
to loosen my handcuffs, so they tightened
them. So we're standing together, Shariiff

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.590
and I. We both have our credentials on. And
we're demanding to be released whereupon the

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.970
Secret Service came and ripped the credentials
from around our necks. Um, then police, uh,

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:33.370
pulled me over to the police wagon. Um, and
inside there was Nicole. So we're both in

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:38.289
the police wagon, and Nicole described quickly
to me what had happened. Her face was bleeding,

00:22:38.289 --> 00:22:43.460
she was handcuffed, and she had her press
credential on. Um, she said they were at St.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:48.909
Paul Neighborhood Network, digitizing tape,
and, um, they heard a commotion outside. And

00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:53.090
so they dec... they raced down with camera
and microphone. Like if they hadn't, they

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:58.340
wouldn't have been their job. And they raced
out. They saw protesters. They saw police.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:03.120
She started filming, Shariff had the microphone,
and then the riot police came at them. Um,

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.070
en masse, and they're shouting at Nicole and
Shariff, "On your face, on your face." Nicole

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.390
is filming, she is holding her press pass
up, she shouting back, "Press, Press." And

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:18.980
they take her down on her face. Her camera
tumbles down. The first thing they do is they

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:23.559
pull the battery out of her camera. If you
were wondering what is was they wanted to

00:23:23.559 --> 00:23:29.320
stop happening. Um, she's on her face. They
have their, her, their knee or boot in her

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.720
back, and they're dragging on her legs. So
it's dragging her face in the dirt which is

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.529
how it got bloodied. And then Shariiff, very
cool guy, he's telling the police to calm

00:23:37.529 --> 00:23:41.659
down. They take him, throw him up against
the wall, kick him twice in the chest, and

00:23:41.659 --> 00:23:47.279
take him down. That's how they bloodied his
arms. So they bring me to the police garage

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:53.559
where they've erected cages for the protesters.
They bring Nicole and Shariff to jail. Um,

00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:59.500
I faced, I was charged with a misdemeanor;
they faced felony riot charges. Now, if it

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:04.860
weren't for You Tube, if it weren't for all,
oh, all different means of media getting out,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.029
I don't know when we would have gotten out.
But within a few hours, I think the video

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:13.790
of our arrest went up on You Tube within a
half an hour. And the response, apparently,

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:20.660
was just enormous. Uh, the old fashioned way,
faxing, calling, emailing, people were tweeting

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.870
in, but there was huge demand for our release.
In a few hours I was released and then Shariff

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:31.049
and Nicole. In fact, Shariff was in jail with,
uh, in the same cell with the AP photographer

00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:37.039
who wasn't released when Shariff was. That's
the power of organizing through community

00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:45.390
media. That's the power of making a demand.
When I got out they took me to, um, I was

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:48.460
called back to the Convention Center 'cause
the media wanted to interview me about what

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.230
had happened. You know more than 40 journalists
were arrested that weekend, and this is completely

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:56.950
unacceptable. But, so, I'm brought to the
Convention Center. I'm in the NBC Skybox,

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.850
and I was being interviewed. And when they
turned the camera off, there's an NBC reporter

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.330
who's standing next to me. He'd been listening
to what happened, and he said, "I don't get

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:08.110
it. Why wasn't I arrested?" I said, "Oh, were
you out covering the protest?" He said, "No."

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:12.700
So I said, Well, I'm not being arrested in
the Skybox either." (Audience quiet laughter.)

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:20.029
But, um, you know like Woody Allen says, 90%
of life is just showing up? So ya gotta go

00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:26.179
there. And, and it's not just because we're
curious. It's because it's our job. You know,

00:25:26.179 --> 00:25:30.700
yes, it's our job to get what's happening
on the Convention floor, the orchestrated

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:36.010
message of the delegates. And there are differences
between them and that's interesting. Um, it's

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:40.581
our job to get into the corporate suites,
to see who's sponsoring what. I don't know

00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:45.340
how many strawberries and hor d'oevres I reach
for and have a door slammed in my face. You

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.159
know, trying to find out who's sponsoring
the Republican Governors' Association in St.

00:25:49.159 --> 00:25:54.620
Paul. Who's sponsoring the Democratic Senate
Campaign Committee in Denver, and really following

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.610
the money. You know it's just a basic tenet
of good journalism. And it's our job to go

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:04.750
into the streets. That's where the uninvited
are guests are. The thousands of people who

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:11.730
have something else to say. Democracy is a
messy thing, and it's our job to capture it

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:19.279
all. And we shouldn't have to get a record
to put things on the record. It's that important.

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:24.840
Now, clearly in these cases, it's not that
dangerous, and we're also American reporters.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:30.230
And that makes a huge difference which brings
me to what's happening in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:37.240
and the incredible bravery of the reporters,
especially Iraqi reporters in Iraq. I mean,

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:43.220
what they face, um, Arab media workers in
both Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:48.899
Tonight I'm going to be going to the University
of California Davis, and I'll be interviewing

00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:55.951
a prison guard on stage, a prison guard from
Guantanamo. And then by video hookup we'll

00:26:55.951 --> 00:27:02.980
be speaking with Omar Deghayes who was a prisoner
at Guantanamo for many years. We'll be hooking

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:09.760
up with him in London, in Britain. But it
makes me think of, for example, Samir Harrag.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.919
Do you know who he was? He was the Al Jazeera
reporter. He was picked up going over the

00:27:15.919 --> 00:27:23.299
border from Pakistan to Afghanistan. He was
held for more than six years at Guantanamo.

00:27:23.299 --> 00:27:29.850
Never charged. He was interrogated repeatedly,
well over a hundred times, repeatedly asked

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:36.289
about his bosses at Al Jazeera. Can you imagine
being picked up, and you have to put yourselves

00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:43.970
in their shoes, and well, being asked about
your bosses? Um, for more than six years.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:51.470
And then, he's released. Then he's released.
Never charged. He's back at Al Jazeera.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:57.610
But actually he's lucky. What about Tariq
Ayoub? He also worked for Al Jazeera. He was

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:03.640
the 34 year old Jordanian reporter who had
just come over the border from Jordan to work

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:10.149
for Al Jazeera in Baghdad. This was in 2003;
this was a few weeks after the U.S. invaded.

00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:15.900
The U.S. invaded March 19th, 2003. Three weeks
later, April 8th, the day before the fall

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:23.500
of Baghdad. Uh, Tariq has just arrived, and
he was setting the camera on the roof. You

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.269
know you put the cameras on the roofs to be
able to film, but also it's very dangerous

00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:30.669
so you try to come back down very quickly
and just have the camera upstairs. Well, that

00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:35.540
morning was horrendous. It started with Abu
Dhabi TV. They were getting shelled by the

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.769
United States, and the broadcasters were on
television in Baghdad and begging people to

00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:49.000
come to their aid. That was Abu Dhabi. And
then they started strafing Al Jazeera. Al

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.150
Jazeera had given their coordinates to the
U.S. military repeatedly. Maybe that was their

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:59.450
problem. You know they were bombed in Afghanistan,
and then in Iraq. But this time Tariq had

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:05.179
just gone upstairs to the roof; he'd just
set the camera, and he was immediately killed.

00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:10.310
Um, I've spoken to his wife since. Her name
is Dima Tahboub. At the funeral she said,

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:19.070
"Hate breeds hate. The U.S. says they're fighting
terror. Who's involved in terrorism now?"

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:26.059
And then the U.S. military set their sights
on the Palestine Hotel. You remember the Palestine

00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:32.840
Hotel where hundreds of unimbedded reporters
were. Videographers, photographers, reporters,

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:38.640
cameramen. And there were two who were on
the balcony of their rooms. One was Taras

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:44.960
Protsyuk. He was a Ukranian cameraman who
was reporting for Reuters. And then there

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:53.980
was Jose Couso. Jose Couso worked for Telecinco.
I think the Spanish crew in Baghdad was the

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:59.779
largest national crew from any country at
the Palestine Hotel. They filmed their own

00:29:59.779 --> 00:30:07.440
deaths. As U.S. military opened fire on the
Hotel, they killed both cameramen. Um, His

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:14.500
brother, Javier, and his mother has been fighting
for years now to get justice, to bring those

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:22.360
responsible to justice. These are the dangers
that reporters face on the ground which brings

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:28.559
me to collateral murder in Iraq. I'm sure
that some of you here at Google have watched

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:36.580
the videotape from Wikileaks. Uh, you know
Dan Ellsberg, an American hero, the man who

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:42.090
worked for the Pentagon and the Rand Corporation
40 years ago, had Top Security Clearance and

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:47.440
decided... If you ever wonder, by the way,
if protest matters, he would look outside

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.370
his Pentagon window and see sometimes massive
protest, sometimes a few stragglers holding

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:58.929
signs against the Vietnam War, and it just
started to get to him. And then heard about

00:30:58.929 --> 00:31:04.960
and met young people who were going to jail
saying they would not fight in the war. And

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:10.549
he thought, "What am I doing to bring this
war to an end? And he realized right behind

00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:16.779
him in his safe he had the 7,000 page Top
Secret history of U.S. involvement in the

00:31:16.779 --> 00:31:21.120
war in Vietnam that only a few people had
that had been commissioned by the Secretary

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:29.110
of War, Robert McNamara. And he decided to
open the safe and release the history. 7,000

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:37.960
pages he Xeroxed and secreted them, and secreted
them out every single night until he had them

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.980
all. And he gave them to the New York Times.
He wasn't sure the Times would ever publish

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:49.529
them. It took many months. He was nervous;
he went underground with his wife, and he

00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:56.809
gave one stack of these 7,000 pages to Howard
Zinn, the great historian, to keep at his

00:31:56.809 --> 00:32:03.190
house. I understand Howard was here. It is
such a shame that a few months ago we lost

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:09.039
this great humanitarian, historian who wrote
"People's History of the United States!" What

00:32:09.039 --> 00:32:18.149
a remarkable gift he gave to all of us documenting
the people's movements in this country. Um,

00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:23.580
every week I do this column, and when Howard
died...actually "Democracy Now" was broadcasting

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.720
that week from, uh, from Park City, Utah.
We were at the Sundance Film Festival, and

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.530
I got this call from his co-editor of "Voices
of People's History of the United States,"

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.090
Anthony Arnove. That was a Thursday afternoon.
We were all set for our show on Friday, the

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:44.710
closing broadcast from Park City, and, um,
he said, "Howard just died. He took a break;

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:50.450
he was in California. He went swimming, and,
uh, and he had a heart attack.”

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:54.669
Well, I mean, Howard had an amazing life.
He lived to be 87 years old.

00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:56.889
(coughing)

00:32:56.889 --> 00:33:03.539
If you haven't read his book, or you know
it, and you mean to, but you haven't actually

00:33:03.539 --> 00:33:07.889
read it, you really should. And you don't
have to take it in all at once, but the idea...

00:33:07.889 --> 00:33:14.250
Well, Howard said it very well. "The history,
not through the eyes of presidents and generals,

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:21.000
but through the voices of ordinary people,
of rebels, of dissidents, of women, of black

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.580
people, of Asian Americans, of immigrants,
of socialists, and anarchists, and troublemakers

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:32.440
of all time". I've been to a number of memorial
services for Howard Zinn now, and, um, uh,

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.390
Marian Wright Edelman, who founded the Children's
Defense Fund, she was one of his students

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:42.570
at Spelman. Alice Walker, also, as she said
he was her favorite teacher and also her funniest

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:49.750
teacher at Spelman. Um, Marian Wright Edelman
described, uh, how daring Howard was with

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:54.610
the students, how he would model for them.
Uh, you know they would wear, this is, uh,

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:59.820
uh, a historically black college of women,
and in the day, they would wear white gloves

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:06.120
and hats. And he would take them on a field
trip each year or each semester. And Marian

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:12.180
Wright Edelman was on them to go to the Georgia
State Legislature, and to sit in the gallery

00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:17.250
to watch the Legislators. And they would sit
in the all-white section, all these African-American

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:22.910
women with their white gloves and their hats.
And the Georgia Legislature would come to

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:29.270
a halt. You know, this defiance, this impudence,
unacceptable. And they would then all stand

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:38.610
up and tip their hats, smiling broadly and
walk out. Um, she said he taught her courage.

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:44.480
Well, Howard Zinn was thrown out of Spelman
because, as Alice put it, "He loved us too

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.840
much. He was thrown out because he loved us."
Alice Walker, the Pulitzer Prize Winning author

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:55.770
now. And he was pretty excited because he
was going down to Spelman. It was 42 years

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:01.800
after he hadn't had his contract renewed.
In other words, he was fired. 42 years later

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.530
they invited him to come back and give the
commencement address, and they were giving

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.950
him an honorary degree. So, if you ever think
times don't change, they do.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:17.890
Well, I mention Howard because, uh, Daniel
Ellsberg gave him a copy of the Pentagon Papers.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:24.660
But the New York Times did publish the Pentagon
Papers. And when Daniel Ellsberg speaks today,

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:30.330
he doesn't just rest on his laurels helping
to avenge the Vietnam War by releasing these

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:37.210
documents. In fact I introduced him at, in,
Portland, Oregon to the big event of 5,000

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:42.730
Unitarian Universalists. And, um, I said,
"I want you to tell the story of how you actually

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:47.110
did this." It's an amazing story, by the way.
And he said, "I don't want to talk about it.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.110
I want to talk about now."

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:49.110
(gesturing)

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:54.271
He, "This is 40 years ago", he said. "You
need to make sure that the Pentagon Papers

00:35:54.271 --> 00:35:59.540
are released today. Not those, but the ones
now. The ones that will end the war in Iraq

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:05.790
and Afghanistan." I mean he is always looking
forward, and it's very important and very

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:06.790
significant.

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:11.670
And I think that's what Wikileaks is doing,
providing a forum for people to anonymously

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:20.310
release documents. Um, and he was encouraged
by the release of, the leak of the Eikenberry

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:24.880
Memos. You know who Eikenberry is? Karl Eikenberry
is the General who is now the U.S. Ambassador

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:35.380
to Afghanistan. He wrote memos to Secretary
of State, Hilary Clinton, that got leaked.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:42.100
Um, the Eikenberry Memos recommend policies
opposite those of Generals David Petraeus

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:46.500
and Stanley McChrystal who advocated for the
surge and a counter-insurgency campaign in

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:51.520
Afghanistan. Eikenberry wrote that President
Hamid Karzai’s not an adequate strategic

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:55.570
partner, that sending additional forces will
delay the day when Afghans will take over

00:36:55.570 --> 00:37:00.050
and make it difficult if not impossible to
bring our people home on a reasonable timetable.

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:06.120
But Petraeus and McChrystal prevailed. The
military's just about to launch a major offensive

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:13.281
in Khandahar. Um, meanwhile, with shocking
candor, General McChrystal said in a video

00:37:13.281 --> 00:37:18.010
conference a few weeks ago, regarding the
number of citi.., civilians killed by the

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:24.170
U.S. military. This is General McChrystal,
not like a peace activist. He said, "We have

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:31.080
shot an amazing number of people, but to my
knowledge, none has ever proven to be a threat."

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:36.330
U.S. troop fatalities, meanwhile, are occurring
at the twice the rate of a year ago. (Clears

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:41.640
throat.) So he was encouraged by the person
who released the Eikenberry Memos, but this

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:48.190
Wikileaks video is quite astounding, and you
can go to democracynow.org and hear a series

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:56.870
of programs on this. Um, and you can go, of
course, to wikileaks.org and collateralmurders.org.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:03.940
Um, the U.S. military video that was released
just a few weeks ago shows the indiscriminate

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:11.970
targeting and killing of civilians in Baghdad.
Wikileaks, this, oh, media watchdog website,

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:16.640
obtained the video and made it available on
the internet. The video was made July 12,

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:23.840
2007, by a U.S. military Apache helicopter
gunship and includes audio of military radio

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:31.050
transmissions. Two Reuter’s employees, a
photographer, and his driver were killed in

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:35.990
the attack along with at least eight other
people, and two children were seriously injured.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:40.400
The radio transmissions show not only the
utter callousness of the soldiers, laughing

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:46.350
and swearing as they kill, but also the strict
procedure they follow ensuring that all of

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:51.080
their attacks are clearly authorized by their
chain of command. They don't just open fire;

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:57.270
they always ask for permission. The leaked
video is a grim depiction of how routine the

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:02.391
killing of civilians has become, and it's
a stark reminder of how necessary journalism

00:39:02.391 --> 00:39:09.400
is and how dangerous its practice has become.
The photographer, Namir Noor-Eldeen, was 22

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:16.800
years old. His driver was Saeed Chmagh. He
was 40. Reuters demanded a full investigation.

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:22.230
Noor-Eldeen, despite his youth, had been described
by colleagues of one of the pre-eminent war

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:28.010
photographers in Iraq. Chmagh was a family,
was a father of four. The video shows a group

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:33.350
of men in an open square in Baghdad leading
the two Reuters employees to a building nearby.

00:39:33.350 --> 00:39:38.900
Noor-Eldeen and Chmagh are shown carrying
cameras. A U.S. soldier in a helicopter says,

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:44.310
"Ok. We got a target 15 coming at you. It's
a guy with a weapon." There's much back and

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:48.160
forth between two helicopters and ground troops
and armored vehicles nearby.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:54.380
"Have 5 to 6 individuals with AK-47s. Request
permission to engage. Roger that. We have

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.580
no personnel east of our position, so you're
free to engage. Over." The helicopter circles

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.800
around with the crosshairs squarely in the
center of the eight men. Wikileaks and its

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:10.190
partner for the story, the Icelandic National
Broadcasting Service, added subtitles to the

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:15.530
video as well as arrows indicating who the
Reuters workers were. Sustained automatic

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:20.770
weapon fire erupts; most of the men are killed
instantly. Noor-Eldeen runs away, and the

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:28.100
crosshairs follow him shooting non-stop until
he falls dead. The radio transmission continues.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:32.970
"All right. Ha, ha, ha. I hit him." And then,
"Yeah, we got one guy crawling around down

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:40.660
there." That's Saeed Chmagh, the father of
four. He is seriously wounded; he's dragging

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:47.040
himself away from the other bodies. A voice
in the helicopter seeking a rationale to shoot

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.830
says, "Come on, Buddy. All you gotta do is
pick up a weapon. If we see a weapon, we're

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:56.380
gonna engage." A van pulls up; it's a dad
with his two children inside because they

00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:04.210
see a wounded person, and they want to pick
them up. The men who come out of the van are

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:10.260
clearly unarmed. They lift Chmagh up, ostensibly
to carry him to medical care. The soldiers

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:15.430
on the Apache sought and received permission
to engage the van. They open fire tearing

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:20.290
apart the front of the van, killing the men.
The weapon used was a 30 millimeter machine

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:25.870
gun used to pierce armor with everyone in
sight apparently dead. U.S. armored vehicles

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:31.910
move in. When a vehicle drives over Noor-Eldeen's
corpse, an observer in the helicopter says,

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:37.350
laughing, "I think we just drove over a body."
The troops discover two children in the van

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:42.580
who’d miraculously survived. One voice on
the military radio requests permission to

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.840
evacuate them to a U.S. military hospital.
Another voice commands them to hand the wounded

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:51.610
children to Iraqi police for delivery to a
local clinic ensuring delayed and less adequate

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:57.960
treatment. The U.S. military inquiry into
the killings cleared the soldiers of any wrongdoing.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.870
And Reuters' freedom of information requests
for the video were denied. Despite the Pentagon's

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:07.250
whitewash, the attack was brutal and might
have involved a war crime since those removing

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:12.140
the wounded are protected by the Geneva Conventions.
Wikileaks says that it obtained the video

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:18.610
from a number of military whistleblowers.
Wikileaks.org founded in late 2006 as the

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:23.300
secure site for whistleblowers to safely release
documents. It's come under attack from the

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:29.170
U.S. and other governments. I go on from there
in that column, but this is so important.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:37.420
Such an important development. We've got to
show the pictures. We've got to show the images.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.620
You know I begin breaking the sound barrier
with a column from three years ago, right

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:47.170
around the time Colin Powell was giving that
push for war at the U.N. And it's about the

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:52.790
image behind the microphone in front of the
U.N. Security Council. See, for a quarter

00:42:52.790 --> 00:43:04.330
of a century a tapestry of Pablo Picasso's
Guernica has hung at the U.N. Um, one minute,

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:13.010
um, during the Franco years the Spanish city
of Guernica was bombed, and Pablo Picasso

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:21.070
was so horrified in Paris, he just painted
in a three week frenzy. And the resulting

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:27.110
painting, Guernica, has become the most famous
anti-war symbol around the world because it

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:33.990
shows the pain and the agony of war etched
in the faces of the people and the animals.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:41.350
And he said he would never let his painting
be shown in Spain under the fascist General

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:45.920
Franco. And so it traveled the world, and
he was afraid it would get destroyed. So he

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:54.600
had three tapestries made by Parisian weavers.
Perfect tapestry reproductions of Guernica,

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:58.650
and one of those hangs at the U.N. It has
for a quarter of a century right behind the

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:05.920
microphone in front of the U.N. Security Council.
And when the war was about to begin, and Colin

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:11.430
Powell and other U.S. and U.N. officials were
make pro-war announcements, it wasn't lost

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:18.770
on them the irony of having this famous anti-war
symbol be their backdrop. And so they shrouded

00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:27.600
Guernica. They covered it with a blue curtain.
It is our job to open up those curtains, to

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:36.950
show the images. I really do think that if
for one week we saw the images of war above

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:45.310
the fold in every newspaper surviving in this
country, the top of every newscast on television,

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:51.380
the top of every website, if we saw the images
of babies dead on the ground, of women with

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:57.810
their legs blown off by cluster bombs from
Iraq to Afghanistan to Pakistan, if we saw

00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:05.340
the soldiers dead and dying for just one week.
Americans are a compassionate people. They

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:08.920
would say, “No, war is not the answer to
conflict in the 21st century. Democracy now!”

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920
(applause)

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.880
(inaudible speaking)
(Ms. Goodman checking phone and time.)

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:26.970
Katina Johnson:
Ok. We have a few minutes for questions. Um,

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:32.020
my one request would be that if you do have
a question, please come to the mic so that

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.500
we can make sure that it is recorded.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:42.440
1st audience member (male):
Thanks. Hi. Um so it seems that, uh, a while

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:48.950
back, Noam Chomsky wrote a fantastic book
"Manufacturing Consent" which meticulously

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:55.841
laid out how mainstream media does just that.
Manufactures a consent, uh, of the people.

00:45:55.841 --> 00:46:01.420
Um, since then, it doesn’t seem that there
has been any progress. In fact, possibly an

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:07.730
opposite trend as media continues to manufacture
consent, uh, throughout major, uh, broadcasts

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:14.630
throughout the world almost. Uh, I’m just
wondering if that’s reversible? If that

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:19.910
needs a grassroots organization to supersede
that like Wikileaks, like the internet, like

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:25.470
You Tube, like other, um, democracy based
systems. Um, or if there is any genuine hope

00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:31.030
in, uh, a top down change, um, from these,
you know, major (inaudible).

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.150
Amy Goodman:
Oh, I think there is because these networks

00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:37.890
that, uh, act as a conveyor belt for the lies
of the government won’t survive. I mean

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:45.541
you know when, uh, President Bush, uh, you
know, started intoning “WMD?” If he had

00:46:45.541 --> 00:46:50.230
just had a megaphone on the steps of the white
house, he might have convinced a few people.

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:55.230
But he had something more powerful. He had
the media institutions of this country. And,

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:59.740
when it turned out to be not the case that
there were weapons of mass destruction, that

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:07.060
exposed more than Bush. It exposed the media
of this country. And I think that’s why

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.200
people turned away. They didn’t believe
the newspapers, right? They saw the media

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.800
was manufacturing consent for war. I think
it’s part of why democracy now, democracynow.org

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.860
has grown so much. You know our audience is
bigger than CNN, is bigger than MSNBC, on

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:26.300
over 800 stations and online at democracynow.org,
video and audio pod-casting, headlines in

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:32.160
Spanish. It’s because people were looking
for other sources, other ways of getting information.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:38.550
So I really do think that, um, they don’t
have a choice any more. You know right before

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:44.870
the invasion, Phil Donahue was the top host
on MSNBC. You might remember. You know Phil

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:49.160
(who had the Donahue show)? But then he came
back; that was on NBC. Then he came back on

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:55.770
MSNBC, and he had a talk show every night
at 8, and it was the highest rated show. Um,

00:47:55.770 --> 00:48:01.610
we write about this, and I think “Exception
to the Rulers”. This memo surfaced after…

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:07.750
(pause) he was fired on the eve of the invasion
even though he was the most popular. Um, and

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:12.430
this memo surfaced where NBC said, uh, “As
we move into war we’re not going to have

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:19.590
this anti-war face, um, uh, on our network
as the other networks are waving the American

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:26.010
flag”. And, it is very serious the level
of censorship and self-censorship in this

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:27.010
country.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:30.240
It doesn't usually come down as a corporation
comes into the newsroom and says, “You will

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:35.260
not do this story.” It's not as obvious
as that. The most serious is the self censorship.

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:40.610
You know, you’re a young reporter. You come
to a newspaper or to a network, and you know

00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:45.560
stories get you marginalized, and you know
what stories or things that you say that will,

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:50.910
you know, will have you rise in the ladder.
And that's what has to be challenged, um,

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:56.690
is breaking this consensus that isn't the
consensus of the American people, but the

00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:03.340
consensus of this minority elite in the networks.
I do have hope, um, as we break stories at

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:09.320
Democracy Now that are picked up by other
networks. Um, I call it trickle-up journalism,

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.610
and I think that really is the hope.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:13.440
Audience member:
Great, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.470
continuing what you are doing.

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:19.110
2nd audience member (male):
Hey, Amy, I'm a huge fan of the show, I love

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:22.750
the show. It's such a service to democracy.
I still don't really have a question in my

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:27.410
head. But I would just be really upset if
I were here in front of you, and I didn't

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:28.410
ask a question, so...

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:32.360
(laughter)
so uh, um.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.810
Amy Goodman:
Oh I know... I, I hear your question. How

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:37.550
can you help get word out? Is that your question?

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:38.680
(indistinct chatter)
(laughter)

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.680
(applause)

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:40.680
Audience member:
Sure.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.190
Amy Goodman:
Well, I think we have fliers in the back and

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:47.410
people can download them. And really the way
we get word out, and thank you for asking

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.510
such an insightful question,
(Laughter)

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:54.610
Um, is by telling people. Spreading the stories,
signing up for the daily digest, spreading

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:58.680
them around, passing them out to your friends
is really how that the, the show is grown

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:04.420
and in this area if you don't have democracy
now on TV or radio, get it on your station.

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.420
We're putting the public back in public media.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.670
Audience member:
Yeah, I tell, uh, I do tell everybody, I tell

00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:10.530
my Republican father about you and your show.
I try to, I try to get him to, to listen and

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:15.740
when I've followed, you know, any like the
Pat Tillman story that you had on which was

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:20.770
absolutely, absolutely brilliant. I subsequently
saw the, uh, Pat Tillman documentary at sun,

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:21.770
uh, Sundance.

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:23.540
Amy Goodman:
Amazing. Mmhmm.

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:28.500
Audience member:
And I, I read the John Krakauer book and what

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:34.550
really struck me is, um, after I educated
myself, basically, I had learned everything

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:38.960
from your, you know, twenty minute, forty
minute segment on your show about that and

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:43.460
it was just factually just perfectly accurate
and completely squared with those other two

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:44.460
accounts, so...

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.830
Amy Goodman:
I mean your Republican father. We have many

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:53.120
Republican fathers who watch democracy now.
It is, I, not only a bridge between communities,

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.770
but between generations cause it's not about
a political ideology, it's about having people

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:06.250
speak for themselves and there is an authenticity
in that, um, that affects everyone. It's news

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:17.270
with a heart, news with passion and, um, I
hope you tell people about it.

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:18.270
Audience member:
I will. Thanks.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:19.270
Amy Goodman:
Thanks.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:20.270
3rd audience member (male):
Hi, um.

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:21.270
Amy Goodman:
Hi.

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:22.270
Audience member:
I have question about you, uh, suggesting

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.270
that news we get should publish the real pictures
of what is happening. So, when I first came

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:30.490
to this country I come from India. When the
elections is like a big festival. Like people

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:33.960
going in cars and megaphones screaming at
people.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.130
Amy Goodman:
In India.

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:39.010
Audience member:
In India, yeah. And, there are fights. All

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:44.190
kinds of things happen, so, people know there
is an election. That is when they see an election

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:45.190
here it’s so sanitized on television in
a beautiful conference hall. People wearing

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:49.600
labels and all that. There is no excitement.
There is no life in the elections. It is like

00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.980
packaged stuff being delivered to people.
So, the first thought that came to me was

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:56.250
this country can easily take them all. It's
like on cable television, you put anything.

00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:01.310
People just consume and change their mind.
It's so I, I really like your idea of putting

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:09.600
out real pictures of war to influence people.
But, I also feel that people get desensitized

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.270
after seeing so much of this happening, so.

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:15.600
Amy Goodman:
I don't think people get desensitized, I think

00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:19.690
you get desensitized when you don't see it.
When you know somehow it's out there, but

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:25.220
if you're not seeing the images, well then
it must not be that bad. You know I contrast

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:29.650
what we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan, you know,
President Bush immediately invoked an executive

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:36.190
order that said you can't, um, photograph,
videotape, film the flag draped coffins of

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:42.240
the soldiers coming home. This went on for
a long time, um, and then you contrast that

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.520
with what happened with Katrina, with the
hurricane in New Orleans. Right afterwards,

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:51.131
I mean, Bush doesn't send in the National
Guard, right? But they do try to invoke this

00:52:51.131 --> 00:52:56.680
executive order that you can't show the bodies
that are floating in the water. And the editor

00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:01.930
of the Times Picayune said, “You've got
to be kidding! That's the story!” And, you

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:07.330
think about the reaction to what happened
in New Orleans because here you have Bush

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:11.920
not responding. And so you have all these
reporters from the corporate networks going

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:19.580
down, and they're not being spun, right. There's
no one there to embed with, and so you see

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:24.940
these images like I remember seeing this young
woman reporter from CNN, and she's reporting.

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:29.940
And a man comes up, and he's holding his boy,
and he's clearly in shock, and he said he

00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.920
had just come out of the water. He said he
was holding his wife's hand, and as her hand

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.781
slipped out of his, she said, “Take care
of the children.” And he told the story,

00:53:37.781 --> 00:53:41.450
and he turned around with his boy, and he
walked off into the water. And the reporter

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:49.410
started to cry. And then you see the bodies
floating by, and that's what reporting from

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:56.440
ground zero looks like, unimbedded, unfiltered
reporting, and I think it shocked this nation.

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.580
That's the power of the image.

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:02.020
Audience member:
Maybe for the first time that I've seen such

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:09.340
images for a long time; at some time you just
switch off. People get used to it despite

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:10.660
fear, so. Thank you.

00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:12.970
Amy Goodman:
Well, thanks for your comment.

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:14.950
4th audience member (male):
Hello, um.

00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:15.950
Amy Goodman:
Hi.

00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:19.900
Audience member:
Thank you, first of all. Um, my name is Uda

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:25.940
Roseling. I would like to ask a more sensitive
question. Being Google and You Tube, etc.,

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:30.774
we obviously can play the role of the good
guy and often, uh. What is your general advice

00:54:30.774 --> 00:54:35.380
for Google to remain part of the good world,
and not doing evil as Google is growing bigger,

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:43.240
and bigger, and bigger? In general, I would
like to hear your opinions about that. In

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:54.350
specific, I would like to hear your comments
about the previous speaker in this series

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:59.240
of authors, eh, Kissinger, who was invited
to give a presentation here. Thank you.

00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.240
(chatter)

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.240
Amy Goodman:
Kissinger called Daniel Ellsberg the most

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:06.581
dangerous man in America and, uh, that's now
the name of the Oscar-nominated film about,

00:55:06.581 --> 00:55:11.770
uh, Dan Ellsberg. And I encourage everyone
to watch it. I had an interesting encounter

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:17.060
with Henry Kissinger years ago. Eh, um, two
nights ago when I was in Wisconsin I, uh,

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:23.330
um, when we did the Q and A after, a young
man, graduate student, spoke and he was from

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:29.160
East Timor. Um, Kissinger had a great deal
to do with the genocide in East Timor. He

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:35.831
was Secretary of State in 1975 under President
Ford. And Kissinger and Ford, well, this is

00:55:35.831 --> 00:55:42.050
after let’s say, uh, Kissinger and Nixon
with the war in Vietnam, of course. I don't

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:48.810
know how many millions of Vietnamese, Laotians,
Cambodians died. Fifty five thousand US troops.

00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:56.790
Then Argentina, um, deeply involved with supporting
the Junta there in Argentina. Tens of thousands

00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:03.430
of dissidents died in Argentina with the U.,
with Kissinger in particular supporting, um,

00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:10.000
the murderous generals in Timor. He went and
met with the long-reigning dictator, Suharto,

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.310
in 1975, the day before Indonesia invaded
Timor. With, he went with Ford. They met with

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:22.110
Suharto. They gave the go-ahead for the invasion.
90% of the weapons used were from the United

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:28.240
States. Ford and Kissinger flew off. They’re
meeting the next day with, uh, another, uh,

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:33.730
leader, uh, Ferdinand Marcos, and as they
flew out, the Indonesian soldiers landed by

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:38.220
air and by sea in Timor. And they closed the
country to the outside world, and they commenced

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:43.150
the slaughter that lasted for a quarter of
a century and killed off a third of the population.

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:48.410
Just to give you a little background, when
I had a chance to meet Henry Kissinger, he

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:54.490
was, uh, flapping his book "Diplomacy" at
an event in New York, and we had gone to see

00:56:54.490 --> 00:57:01.550
him speak. And the first person to ask a question
was a young Timorese man; his name is Constancio

00:57:01.550 --> 00:57:09.120
Pinto. He's now the Timorese Ambassador to
the United States, and Constancio talked about

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:16.580
the missing chapter in diplomacy. Um, he asked
him about Henry Kissinger’s role in Timor.

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:22.890
And he said, “Why did you do this to my
people?” And Kissinger’s face got bright

00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:28.820
red. There was a Portuguese film crew there
that was filming, and they said they just

00:57:28.820 --> 00:57:36.680
saw his face transform. And he clearly needed
to buy some time to figure out what to say

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:43.860
to this very peaceful earnest question of
one of the survivors of Timor. And he said,

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:51.230
“First of all I want to thank you for not
ripping up this place.” Um, the next person

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:58.580
to speak was Allan Nairn who is an investigative
journalist of, uh, impeccable credentials,

00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:06.420
incredibly brave reporter. Um, and he got
up, and he asked him about the cables that

00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:13.810
he sent back to the United States as people
high up in the State Department were writing

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:18.690
cables to Kissinger and to Ford, but to Kissinger
cause they were in the State Department. He

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:23.590
was Secretary of State, saying, “We are
not going to be able to justify the Indonesian

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:29.360
invasion of Timor. We won't be able to continue
to sell the weapons to Indonesia because they

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:33.030
are using them for offensive purposes. What
are we going to do?”

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:37.360
When he got back to the United States he held
a high level meeting of the State Department

00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:42.830
officials, and he castigated them for leaving
a paper trail. And he said, “We will not

00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:49.900
kick our ally in the teeth.” He knew exactly
what was happening, and they tell that now

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:56.900
because this is just not a story from more
than 25 years ago. Um, you may know about

00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:03.090
Timor and, uh, the Santa Cruz massacre in
1991. It was 17 years into the occupation.

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:09.410
I got a chance to go to Timor with Allan Nairn,
and it was November 12th, 1991. The Indonesian

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:13.840
military occupied the whole island. The people
were holding a procession for a young man

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:17.890
who had been killed two weeks before. There
were thousands of Timorese. They were at the

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:21.190
cemetery; it was about 8 o’clock in the
morning. We were interviewing people. This

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:25.250
was a land where there was no freedom of press,
no freedom of speech, no freedom of assembly,

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:31.440
and yet they marched to the cemetery putting
up their hands in the “V” sign saying,

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:38.050
“Viva East Timor, viva independence!”
And soldiers marched up on them, 10 to 12

00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:44.590
abreast, holding their U.S. M-16s at the ready
position. Alan and I thought maybe if we walked

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:50.000
to the front of the crowd they would not commit
a massacre because, though we knew they committed

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.480
many, they had never done it in front of western
journalists. We always hid our equipment,

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:58.040
but this time we put on headphones. I held
up my microphone like a flag. I slung my radio

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:02.490
and my tape recorder over my shoulder. Alan
put the camera above his head. We walked to

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:06.980
the front of the crowd. The soldiers marched
up, they swept around the corner, they swept

01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.310
passed us. And without warning, without hesitation,
without provocation they opened fire on the

01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:15.550
crowd gunning people down from right to left.
The first to go down, a little boy behind

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:21.270
us putting his hands up in the V sign, exploded
from the gun fire. The soldiers went after

01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:25.750
us, a group of them; they brought me down,
beating me. Alan got a photograph of them

01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:30.520
opening fire on the crowd and then he threw
himself on top of me to protect me from further

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:34.700
injury. And they took their US M16's like
baseball bats and they slammed them against

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:40.100
his skull until they fractured it. So we were
laying on the ground, he was covered in blood,

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:44.800
they were killing everyone around us, and
a group of soldiers put the guns to our heads.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:52.800
Our guns, US M16's. Umm, and they were shouting
Polotic in Australia. Polotic, they were saying.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:59.780
It was political to witness this, for us to
witness this. But that's our jobs as journalists,

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:04.350
to go to where the silence is. And they were
shouting Australia because they were demanding

01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:10.140
to know if were from Australia. That's because
seventeen years before when Indonesia invaded,

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:14.520
umm... there were five Australian based journalists
covering the invasion. They lined them up

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:19.130
against a house, the Indonesian soldiers and
they executed them all. The sixth, Roger East,

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:23.430
was reporting from a radio station in Dili,
the capital of Timor, the day after the invasion.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:28.000
They dragged him out of the radio station
and as he shouted "I'm from Australia!" they

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:34.420
shot him into the harbor with thousands of
Timorese and killed him. Umm...so the Australian

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:39.310
government hardly protested their killings.
We believe because years later Australia and

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:44.970
Indonesia would sign the Timor Gap Treaty
dividing up Timor's oil between Australia

01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:50.170
and Indonesia. Oil is the source of so much
pain in the world. So as we lay on the ground,

01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:54.400
Alan covered in blood, the soldiers with their
guns at our heads at the ready position, at

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:00.810
the ready position, umm...we shouted back
"America!" They stripped us now of everything.

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:05.530
The only thing I had left was my passport,
and I threw it at them as we shouted "America!”

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:09.980
I get kicked in the stomach. When I get my
breath back, I'd say "America!” And at some

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:14.770
point they pulled the guns from our heads.
We believe because we were from the same country

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:18.900
their weapons were from. They would have to
pay a price for killing us that they would

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:24.560
never had to pay for killing the Timorese.
They killed more than 270 Timorese on that

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:33.210
one day. And that was not one of the larger
massacres. So, when Alan stood up to ask Kissinger

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:40.890
about why he had authorized this invasion,
Kissinger was enraged. And he said, "It's

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:46.830
people like you that prevent diplomacy from
taking place." Well, Kissinger’s kind of

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:51.980
diplomacy. And then I asked him about, um,
sitting on the Board of Freeport McMoRan and

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:59.030
how Freeport McMoRan, the gold and copper
mining company in, ah, in Indonesia, was lobbying

01:02:59.030 --> 01:03:06.350
against any kind of cutting of aid to Indonesia
because of its human rights abuses. So that's

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:12.570
then. Now let's come to today. Alan's in Indonesia.
He's in a great deal of danger right now because

01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:16.711
you know when Obama was supposed to go to
Indonesia a few weeks ago? Uh, but because

01:03:16.711 --> 01:03:23.760
of the healthcare debate he put off the trip
until June. Um, it's going to be a big homecoming;

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:27.510
you know it's going to get a lot of attention.
It's going to be a big personal story for

01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:32.050
Obama because he grew up partly in Indonesia.
He went to elementary school there 'cause

01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:35.930
his Mom married an Indonesian student at the
University of Hawaii. Suharto called all the

01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:41.320
foreign students back, and so the family moved
to Indonesia. There's all these statues to

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:46.480
Obama and everything, and they're very proud
of President Obama. So that's the story that’s

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.500
going to be told. But what's going on behind
the scenes is President Obama is attempting

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:56.230
to restore full military aid to the Indonesian
military and to the Kopassus, the feared military

01:03:56.230 --> 01:04:01.810
unit in Indonesia. Saying that that story,
well, he doesn't disagree with it. It is the

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:06.750
old Indonesian military. Now this is about
the new Indonesian military. But what Alan

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:13.280
has exposed in the last few months is that
this same Indonesian military has been engaged

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.780
in a series of assassinations of political
activists in Ache. And that it is going on

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:25.180
in this past year. There is a fierce battle
going on between the White house and Congress

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:31.590
as Obama tries to restore the aid. It's a
huge story in Indonesia. Alan's exposing this.

01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:39.790
And as a result of him exposing it on Democracy
Now and at his blog at Allannarin.com, A-L-L-A-N-N-A-R-I-N,

01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:45.990
um, the Indonesian military says they're going
to arrest him. Um, it's the zipper under the

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:51.410
news. Uh, when he went on a big TV station
they cut him off after two minutes. And the

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:56.080
producer came on, actually very apologetic
and said, "I am so sorry. I know we said we'd

01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:00.350
have you on for half an hour but a new policy
has come down." And Alan said, "What is the

01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:05.090
policy?" "Shit, I don't know. But it means
that you can't be on our station." And then

01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:10.240
when the other major TV news channel, a few
weeks ago tried to have him on, the head of

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.040
Kopassus said, "He will not be allowed on
unless we're on." And so they said, "Ok, would

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:20.740
you come on as well?" And they said, "No."
Um, but Alan says, "Arrest me," he says. He

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:27.910
wants to be arrested, he says, if he can try
this in an open court and call, subpoena the

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:32.730
Generals and the U.S. officials involved in
these assassinations. He said, "If what I'm

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:38.190
saying is what you say is slandering the Indonesian
military, well, then you can put me in jail.

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:42.690
But let's try this in open court." And that’s
the situation he's in today. And I hope everyone

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:50.140
continues to follow it. Um, I would have liked
to raise that with Henry Kissinger. I think

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:56.200
it is a real injustice when you see Henry
Kissinger on television, and he is treated

01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:02.720
simply as an elder statesman without describing
the policies that he presided over for so

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:08.560
many years. I think you could start by simply,
when he's speaking…you know the lower third

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:14.280
on television? That's the I.D. that talks
about the name and what they did. If it would

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:20.480
just flash the number people who died under
his reign here, and also flash how much money

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:27.430
he makes, um, consulting with various countries.
They often, and it's not only Kissinger. So

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:33.010
often when you're watching television when
it comes to the Generals or quote "Elder Statesmen,"

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:37.530
tell us who it is they're working for now.
It's not just advice they're giving from the

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:43.550
past, from their past expertise. They are
making money, particularly David Barstow,

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:47.910
the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times
reporter exposes this, when you have retired

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:51.880
Generals on. They're working for military
contractors, and you should know who they're

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:59.020
working for, uh, when they offer their advice.
As for Google…

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:01.420
(pauses and crowd laughs)

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:07.980
Um, well, I hope you have major discussions
here, around, and I am not that knowledgeable

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:13.960
about, um, as knowledgeable as you all are.
But, for example, the issue of the libraries.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:22.450
Um, this is of grave concern. Obviously I'm
a book lover, um, and I am deeply concerned

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:29.710
about the privatization of knowledge in the
world. I think that, um, Brewster Kahle, who

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:36.270
does Archive.org, you know a public, uh, Archive.org
is where Democracy Now, you can see all of

01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:42.850
our past shows right to the beginning. But
the idea of keeping the knowledge, the information

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:49.690
open and accessible to the public, ah, the
legacy of everyone. Of course, the fear is

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:56.070
as Google works out these secret deals with
libraries around the country, and I guess

01:07:56.070 --> 01:08:02.300
probably around the world, that what happens
next? You know, what gets privatized, what

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:08.890
books won’t we have access too, what information
will you all be making money off of, um, that

01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:15.250
we all won't be able to access. And these
are the serious concerns. It starts off just

01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:21.700
by saying let's digitize it all, you know,
because preserve it. But is that ultimately

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:27.980
what will happen? And right now the question,
you know, that, the question, the issues raised

01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:35.020
are, we have no intention to make it not accessible.
But, you know times change, and maybe there

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:44.060
are intentions not to make it accessible to
all. But we have to preserve the public commons.

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:51.790
You know, that is what will save us, and that
is what I’m deeply concerned about when

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:53.359
this information goes private. Yes?

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:56.420
5th audience member (male):
Hi, Amy. Thanks very much for coming. Uh,

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:03.881
I think a lot of us were very hopeful when
the Obama administration came on board, and,

01:09:03.881 --> 01:09:11.130
uh, since lost some hope with respect to decisions
such as corporate bailouts, and Alaska oil

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:18.210
drilling, and escalation of the war in Afghanistan.
What would you say to us who have lost hope

01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:23.350
or are somewhat disillusioned by this administration?
And then secondly, would you ever consider

01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:25.870
running for office yourself? Please?

01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.090
(laughter)

01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:32.220
Amy Goodman:
Um, on the issue of, like of oil drilling

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.670
is, of course, grave concern as we look at
what's happening off the coast of Louisiana.

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:39.960
Could be the biggest oil spill in the history
of this country right now that’s unfolding

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:44.480
as we speak. We broadcast from Stanford today,
and I encourage you to go to our site DemocracyNow.org

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.770
cause we had a very interesting interview
talking about what this could mean, but as

01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:59.940
for hope, um, you know what happened on election
day in 2008 was historic. There is no question

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:07.870
about that you know. The election of an African-American
President in a land with a history, legacy

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:14.940
of slavery just...unbelievable! And what it
meant for people all over the world. Last

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:20.290
week we broadcast from Cochabamba. From Bolivia,
I didn't get a chance to talk about that,

01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:29.230
but an amazing summit of 15,000 people, mainly
indigenous, um, as an answer to what happened

01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:34.000
in Copenhagen. You know the climate talks.
And this was a people summit because it's

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.790
people in the south that are most gravely
affected by this. Here you have this Andian

01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:43.710
nation of 10 million. Their glaciers are melting,
the cities, the largest urban areas will run

01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:48.490
out of water through no fault of their own
because of what we're doing in the north and

01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:55.980
the, you know, most industrialized countries
in the world. Um, and I interviewed President

01:10:55.980 --> 01:11:01.520
Morales for the last broadcast last Friday,
the Bolivian President. He had something interesting

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.210
to say. I asked him what he thought of President
Obama

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:06.670
(coughs)

01:11:06.670 --> 01:11:14.980
because after the Copenhagen Accord, um...which
Ecuador and Bolivia did not sign onto because

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:19.560
they felt it wasn't binding and would not
do enough. The U.S. cut millions of dollars

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.310
in aid to both countries. Uh, I think it was
two and a half million to Ecuador. They cut

01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:29.690
three million to Bolivia, and much of it was
for climate change projects to punish them

01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:33.810
for not supporting the Accord. And he was
saying "This is what democracy looks like?

01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:39.420
I’m sure you can say no, but then they're
going to hurt you." And interestingly, on

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:44.650
Earth Day the Ecuadorian Foreign Minister
spoke at the big rally in Cochabamba and he

01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:50.150
said, "I will give the U.S. two and a half
million dollars if they will sign onto the

01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:58.810
Kyoto Accord." But Morales said, "What can
I say; that your first African-American President

01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:03.860
would discriminate against the first indigenous
president of Bolivia?” 'Cause Morales is

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:11.650
the first indigenous President. But, in answer
to the question of hope, a few weeks after

01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:17.170
President Obama was elected, I was invited
on CNN to, you know, responded to, it was

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:21.850
the day that President and Mrs. Obama went
to the White House to meet with the Bush's.

01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:26.920
You know he was selected but they weren't
yet moving in. And so it was in the afternoon.

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:31.760
I was sitting in the CNN studios, and they
were chattering about something, and then

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.960
the Obamas were walking into the White House,
and they asked me about something else. I

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:43.440
said, “No, wait, wait. We have to take pause.
I mean, look at what's happening right now.

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:51.310
Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson
Obama are walking into the White House in

01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:58.010
which they will live. Michelle LaVaughn Robinson
Obama, her grandfather comes from South Carolina.

01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:01.990
They are the descendants of slaves which means
their children, Malia and Sascha, are the

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:06.360
descendants of slaves, and they will live
in the White House. The most famous house

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:12.560
in the world that was built by slaves. Let's
take pause.”

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:22.260
Now, what about all of the policies in the
last year? Particularly, the surge in Afghanistan?

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:28.760
President Obama making Bush's war Obama's
war? Receiving the Nobel Peace Prize as he

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:37.230
announces the surge? Talking about Dr. King,
I think six times in that Nobel acceptance

01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:44.930
speech. Dr. King, who on April 4th, 1967,
a year to the day before he was assassinated,

01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:49.930
gave that famous address at Riverside Church.
Even those in his inner circle said, "Don't

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:53.950
do it. Don’t take on the war in Vietnam.
You've gotten so much for Civil Rights and

01:13:53.950 --> 01:14:00.250
Voting Rights. This is not your issue." And
he said, he talked about the country he loved,

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:09.910
and he said, "My country is the greatest purveyor
of violence on earth." Dr. King did. And,

01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:15.390
you know, I think for a long time people have
felt in this country that they have hit their

01:14:15.390 --> 01:14:22.750
head against a brick wall. And that brick
wall has now become a door. And the door is

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:30.830
open a crack. And the question is, will you
kick it open, or will it be slammed shut?

01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:37.060
And I don't think it's up to president Obama.
I think that's up to all of you. I mean, he

01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:45.920
was elected by millions of new voters, especially
young voters, anti-war voters, amazing coalition

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:55.300
inspired by him. But, I mean, the good thing
is this Community Organizer, the Community

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.660
Organizer and Chief now has become...

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:03.150
Well, the Community Organizer first, let me
address that one. That’s an amazing thing.

01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:08.490
So now parents all over the country are saying
to their kids, “Maybe you can be a Community

01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:13.520
Organizer too.” That's pretty amazing. But
the Community Organizer and Chief has become

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.170
the Commander and Chief. And who is going
to do the community organizing now? And that's

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:25.730
up to all of you. Maybe the answer is in something
in Obama once said. I heard the story. I wasn't

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:32.720
there, but a year and a half before the election
he was campaigning in New Jersey, and he was

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:37.860
at one of these fundraisers in the backyard
of a house in Montclair, New Jersey. And people

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:41.070
were asking him questions. He was about to
go, and this guy raises his hand and said,

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:50.170
"What about the Middle East?" And Obama related
the story of, ah, A. Phillip Randolph, the

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:53.500
greatest Community Organizer of the twentieth
century. You know, he organized the Brotherhood

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:58.910
of Sleeping Car Porters, the black porters
on the Pullman trains. He organized the 1963

01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:05.960
march on Washington. And Eleanor Roosevelt
took A. Phillip Randolph to meet F.D.R. and

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:11.190
A. Phillip Randolph said to F.D.R., talked
about the condition of black people in this

01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:15.470
country and working people in this country.
And F.D.R., this is the story Obama told,

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:20.560
F.D.R. turned to A. Phillip Randolph and said,
"I don't disagree with anything that you’re

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:27.190
saying, but you've got to make me do it. Make
me do it.” And that's what Obama said on

01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:31.790
the issue of the Middle East. "Make me do
it". And I really think that's what democracy

01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:37.920
is all about. If you feel strongly about something,
about the critical issues of the day, you

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.300
gotta make him do it.

01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.150
Katina Johnson:
All right. I just want to say thanks so much

01:16:43.150 --> 01:16:45.760
for what you do. It's deeply needed, and thanks
for coming today.

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.210
Amy Goodman:
Thank you very much.
