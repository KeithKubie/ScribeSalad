00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.390
- Let's say someone walks up to you on the street

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.150
and says, "Quick!

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.520
"73 plus blank is equal to 57."

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.170
What would blank be?

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.200
Well, there's a couple of ways to think about it.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.840
Blank is essentially what you have to

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.620
add to 57 to get to 73.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.270
It's the difference between 57 and 73.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.620
And so you could think about it as,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.890
"Well, let me start with 57..."

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.940
And this is actually how I would do it in my head.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.780
I would start with 57,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.450
and I would add numbers that get me

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.169
to nice round numbers until I get to 73.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.820
So I'd start with 57, and I would say, "Let's see.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.590
I could get to 60 pretty easily by adding three."

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.150
So that's going to get me to 60.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.989
And from 60 to 73, well, I can imagine I'm gonna add 13.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.250
That's easy for my brain to compute.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.790
Or I could say I'm gonna add 10 to get to 70.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.820
And then I could add another three.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.720
But my brain can say 60 plus 13.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.449
Yeah, that's gonna be 73.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.140
So now this whole thing is 73.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.700
So what did I add to 57 to actually bridge the gap?

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.170
I added three plus 13.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.600
So I added 16.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.660
So 16 plus 57 is equal to 73.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.190
Now there's other ways that you could try to tackle it.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.300
You could say, "Look!

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.620
This blank is the difference between 73 and 57."

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.460
So you could write this as 73 minus 57

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.259
is equal to blank.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.000
And this would get you the same value.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.900
It would get you 16.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.900
And there's multiple ways to compute this.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.290
But this is the way that I would

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.970
actually try to tackle this in my brain.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.590
Let's do a few more examples.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.200
This is strangely, strangely fun.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.650
So let's say that someone,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.790
another person walks up to you on the street

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.200
and says, "Quick!

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.339
"94 minus blank

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.870
"is equal to 57."

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.990
So this is saying, "What do I have to subtract from 94

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.660
"to get to 57?"

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.420
Well, I could do it in the similar way,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.620
I'm subtracting this time,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.350
where I could keep subtracting numbers

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.620
that make the math easy in my head until I get to 57.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.400
And this is actually how I would do it in my head.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.220
I would start at 94.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.650
And then I would subtract four to get to 90.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.590
So that's 90 right over there.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.520
And let's see.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.400
Then I could subtract 20 to get to 60.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.720
I don't want to get lower than 57.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.520
So I'm going to subtract 20, 90 minus 20.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.900
Oh, sorry, I could subtract 30 to get to 60.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.290
So I could subtract 30 now.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.970
So 90 minus 30, this is going to be equal to 60.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.790
And then to go from 60 to 57, pretty straightforward.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.769
I just have to subtract another three.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.739
60 minus three, this is going to be 57.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.190
So how much did I subtract?

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.200
I subtracted four, 30, and three.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.420
So let's see.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.950
I subtracted, this is 34, 37.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.100
I subtracted 37, just like that.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.869
Now another way you could have done it,

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.850
you could have said, "Look!

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.750
"37 is the difference between 94 and 57."

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.390
So you could have thought about it.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.600
Well, if I start at 57, what do I have to add

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.940
to get to 94?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.200
And you could have tackled it exactly

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.210
the way that we did the last problem,

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.900
where you could, here I'm gonna add three.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.940
If I add three, I get to 60; then if I add 30, I get to 90.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.750
And then if I add another four, I get to 94.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.880
So I added 37.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.609
Now there are clearly other ways to do this,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.450
especially if you have paper around.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.750
But this is actually how my brain would tackle it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.850
if someone walked up to me in the street

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.370
and asked me to solve these problems.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.910
Now let's do one more.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.549
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.620
Let's see where I have a clear space.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.720
So let's say that someone asks,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.600
"You have 36 is equal to blank

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.800
"minus 41."

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.700
So the way I think about this is,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.390
they're saying that 36 is the difference

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.990
between blank and 41.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.100
Or another way to think about it is 36 plus 41

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.169
is going to be equal to blank.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.599
You could draw this on a number line.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.390
If these two statements being the same

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.150
doesn't make full sense,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.940
you do a number line right over here.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.620
And then they're saying, "OK,

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.200
"we're gonna start at some mystery number.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.390
"We're starting at some mystery number.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.650
"That's our blank.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.490
"We're gonna subtract 41.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.970
"We're subtracting 41,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.140
"and we're getting to 36."

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.200
So this is the exact same thing as saying,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.940
"If we start at 36, and if we were to add 41,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.620
"we get back to our blank right over here."

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.190
So what's 36 plus 41?

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.000
Well, let's add our ones first.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So we have six ones plus one one.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.620
That is seven ones.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.140
And then we have three tens plus four tens,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.610
which is seven tens, 77.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.810
So this is 77.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.350
And we're done.
