1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.690
So so far.
Here's what we've done.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.440
We've been studying the whole time,

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.890
this analog of Newton's law.
How week was I alpha,

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.620
so after teaching you what towers and what I is and what Alpha is.

5
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.120
In the early days I concentrated on problems where Tau is not zero.

6
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.920
That is some object on with some tarps that acting and in response to the

7
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:33.450
torques
and response to the torques,

8
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:34.620
the body will accelerate.

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.780
Then we went to another class of problems where there are no external torques.

10
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.120
It only talks from inside.
Excuse me,

11
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.120
will you people who come late use the other door?
Yeah.

12
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:53.010
You're blocking actually the taping right now.
Yes.
All right,

13
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.353
so

14
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.650
today I'm going to consider an extreme case where that is not target or

15
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.960
there's no target.
We Know Alpha is zero and the angular velocity is funds,

16
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.930
but I'm going to take a case where even angular velocity is zero.

17
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.750
There is no emotion,
there is no chart.

18
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.020
So you can say you know what's there to study.
Well,

19
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.370
sometimes it's a great interest to us that the object has no angular velocity.

20
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.740
Common example is you are trying to do something in your house,

21
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:33.050
you get up on a ladder or somewhere there,
uh,

22
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.440
this ladder should have no angle of velocity,
right?
That is a,

23
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.010
that's not a trivial statement to person who is going up there.

24
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:45.420
So you want to ask what does it take to keep the ladder from falling over?

25
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.440
Okay,
that's what we're going to discuss.

26
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.673
All right,

27
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.690
so let me start with the simple problem and take some horizontal rod like this.

28
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.130
And I say what does it take to keep the rod from moving around?

29
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.630
And the first thing you know is the forces on it should add up to zero because

30
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:10.260
otherwise f equals I may tells you this rod is going to be flying off somewhere.

31
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.400
So I've taken a body that rod of Linkedin and I don't want it to move at all.

32
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.160
So totally forces adding up to zero we know is not good enough because he had a

33
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.160
problem where I applied to forces equal an opposite add up to zero.

34
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.360
But that doesn't,
that doesn't do it.
This rod will still rotate.

35
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.740
It is still true that when the total force adds up to zero,

36
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.710
the center of mass will not accelerate.

37
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.040
But that doesn't mean the body will not move because keeping the center of mass

38
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:42.810
fixed,
the body can rotate.

39
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.060
All right,
so you have to ask yourself,

40
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.730
what does it take to keep it from rotating?

41
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.520
Then we know that the concept rotation is a torque.

42
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.810
So I'm going to write down now the conditions for our body,

43
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.440
a planar body laying in the plane of the blackboard to stay still and not move.

44
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.670
They are that all the forces in the x direction.

45
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.020
I use some labor force number one first number two,
natural data,
zero,

46
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.670
all the forces in the Y,

47
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:20.200
that action that should add up to zero this and make sure that central mass as a

48
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.370
whole is not going anywhere.

49
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.870
And finally the keep the body from moving or spinning.

50
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.970
All the parks should add a position.

51
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.710
So bulk of the lecture today will just be dealing with this condition.

52
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.530
So what are we going to study today is a collection of objects that are somehow

53
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.750
subject to variety of forces but still in equilibrium,
in static equilibrium.

54
00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.490
That means they are not moving.

55
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.290
So simplest problem from the family is a seesaw.

56
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Let's say that to a point where the CSI supported and let's say we put one kid

57
00:03:58.851 --> 00:04:03.851
here applying some force f one f one is the AMG for the kid

58
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.670
and let's say this end,
you say distance x one from the support.

59
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.620
The question is,
oh,
how much of a kid should I put here to keep this in balance?

60
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.010
It should not move under the combined weight of these two kids.

61
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.920
So I take the body and it right down on the forces on it.

62
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.710
So I have f one coming down here at f two

63
00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.703
there.

64
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.660
Then that is of course that cannot be the whole story because [inaudible] not

65
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.410
going into the ground.

66
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.730
That is the support and a normal force from the support

67
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.190
and the these two forces together should conspire to keep the body in

68
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:57.720
equilibrium.
So let's see.
So here's what I want you to understand.

69
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.070
F One is known.
Let's give it some name,
100 newtons.

70
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.980
This distance x one is also known that this is x two is also known.

71
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.040
I'm planning to find out what force F two is needed.

72
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.640
So F two is what I'm trying to solve for.
So I write all the equations I know.

73
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.970
So how does on telly,
there's nothing going on.
So it's zero equals zero

74
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.640
in the vertical direction,
I have f one pushing down,

75
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.270
pushing down equals n

76
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.650
and that's not going to be enough to solve this problem because I have two

77
00:05:36.651 --> 00:05:40.340
unknowns.
I don't know.
Anne and I don't have to,
I just know this guy.

78
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.990
So that's where the park equation's gonna come in?

79
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.180
No.
Yeah,
this is a Saturday.
When you do the Torque in this problem.

80
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.260
So how'd you find the target?
Do you do any force?

81
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.890
Can you tell me what you're supposed to do?

82
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.020
<v 1>Yeah.
Yes.
You,
yes.</v>

83
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.840
<v 0>Right.
What are,
should I use for this force?</v>

84
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.500
<v 1>Pardon me?
X One.
Uh,</v>

85
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.580
<v 0>okay.
Why did you choose that?</v>

86
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

87
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.180
<v 0>Okay.
Her answer was,
that's the pivot.
So I chose the distance.</v>

88
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.000
The point is when we say the body has no net torque with means,

89
00:06:33.001 --> 00:06:34.860
it's not rotating around some axes,

90
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.960
if that is an access around with the body is rotating than being on how to take

91
00:06:39.961 --> 00:06:43.860
the torque through them.
That access when a body is not rotating,

92
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.580
it's not the trading about any access whatsoever.

93
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.860
So you can say it's not rotating through an accident I had brought through here.

94
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.820
So I will take all the target,
the SPEC that point seminars can say no,

95
00:06:56.821 --> 00:07:00.780
it's not rotating to that either.
I will take all parks from that point.

96
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.330
If you change your mind on value,

97
00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:07.690
you're taking the torque than the talks are all changing because in the force

98
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:09.750
time,
distance,
the distances are going to change.

99
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.240
So now we have a predicament where for every possible point around which I

100
00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:16.020
computer Torque,

101
00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.000
I will get a condition involving the different forces and the distances from

102
00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:21.834
that point.

103
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.390
So I can write down the infinite number of equations for each different choice

104
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:30.020
of pivot point.
But I only have two unknowns.

105
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.520
F Two and n

106
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.250
two unknowns can only satisfy two equations,
not 2000 equations.

107
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.200
So we got to the hope that the extra equations I get by varying the pivot point

108
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.380
all say the same thing and that's what I will show you.

109
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:47.750
Now I will show you

110
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.610
first that if you have a bunch of forces that add up to zero,

111
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.113
<v 1>okay,</v>

112
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.750
<v 0>then it doesn't matter around which point you compute the torque.</v>

113
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.220
If it was zero on one point [inaudible] around any other point,

114
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.680
suppose I picked some point here and I take each force,

115
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.750
multiply the distance of that force from that pivot point and they added up to

116
00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:17.080
zero.
Now you come along and say,
no,

117
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:20.410
I want to take the target on that point,

118
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:26.200
what you will be computing will be the same force but to every exci you will add

119
00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:30.220
a distance.
A is the distance way which you moved your access.

120
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.840
No,
let's open this out.

121
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:40.310
You will find it is f I x plus a time,

122
00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:42.660
some of all the FIS.

123
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.220
This is zero because for me the target on that point managed and this is zero

124
00:08:52.501 --> 00:08:57.270
because all the forces add up to zero.
In other words,

125
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.380
if you find any one point and make sure the products around that point don't

126
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:05.970
cause live,
they all add up to zero.
Then the torque around any other point,

127
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:10.971
we'll also add a zero provided the sum of the forces adds up to zero and of

128
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:12.930
course that's the problem you're looking at.

129
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.560
So you got to realize that when you take the Torque,

130
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.600
you may pick any point you like.

131
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.590
Now that's where the strategic issue comes up.

132
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:28.580
If you were to ask simply to find what f two is,

133
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.250
not to completely solve the problem,

134
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.640
which would be also finding what the normal forces,
someone said,

135
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:36.920
just find f two I don't care what Ennis,

136
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.020
then that's the particular choice of pivot point that is optimum.

137
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.350
That choice is the one in which this normal force doesn't get to enter the

138
00:09:48.351 --> 00:09:51.110
torque equation.
And I think you all know what I mean.

139
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.480
Pick the that point is the point around which you take the torques than n drops

140
00:09:56.481 --> 00:10:01.280
out.
But this is the usual model.
When you take torques,

141
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.330
always take the torque through a point where

142
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:10.520
an unknown forces acting because the unknown fourth doesn't contribute to the

143
00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:11.354
target equation.

144
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.560
So in principle you can take the target on any point and you can satisfy

145
00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:20.240
yourself in your spare time.
It doesn't make matter which point you take.
Uh,

146
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.660
it'll be the more complicated way to solve the problem because and will come

147
00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:25.640
into the picture and know and asked you what Ennis.

148
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.570
So we pick the point of support and then of course here's the point of support

149
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.380
and what did I have f one here at distance x one I had have to at a distance x

150
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:43.850
two this is the point around with them doing the torques and doesn't count.

151
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.130
Then you get the condition f one x one equals f two extra

152
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.930
from that you can solve for f two for example,

153
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.260
if this was one meter and this was six meters and this was a 10 newtons here,

154
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.890
then 10 times one has to be six times f two

155
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.400
so 10 equals six f two F two will be 10 over six news

156
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.250
I don't want to use and because uh,

157
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.550
and it's all sustaining for the force here.
That's what we find have to,

158
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.500
once you found f two in case you want to know what is the support going through,

159
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.580
you know,
how much load is it carrying?

160
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:34.270
You can come back now and add F1 which was given to you and the f two you then

161
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.060
solve for.
Then if you want to,
you can find it.

162
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:45.670
Even if you were asked to find and it's best to first take torque around the

163
00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.230
point and so end doesn't enter,

164
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.710
find f two then it's very trivial to at f one and f two to get at.

165
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.150
This is the easiest prototypes.
Guys have to know how this is done.

166
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:59.590
Everything I do will be more and more bells and whistles on the simple notion of

167
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:03.260
how to take the torque.
All race.
No,

168
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.220
I'm going to take a slightly more complicated problem.

169
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.610
So here's a wall and that is it.

170
00:12:10.611 --> 00:12:14.480
Rod here off length,
l and mass m

171
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:21.090
and it's supported by some kind of pivot on the wall and I want to hold it up by

172
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:24.970
supporting it here with the force f

173
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.500
and the question is what form should they apply?

174
00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.513
<v 1>Okay.</v>

175
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.210
<v 0>Okay.
So</v>

176
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.910
we know that if I draw the free body diagram of the ride,

177
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.250
I have my force F

178
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.430
I have gravity acting down everywhere on the ride.
Then the pivot,

179
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.360
namely the wall,
it can exert a certain vertical force.

180
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.580
It can also exit a horizontal force.

181
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.170
No one tells you the wall is frictionless at anything or the pivot is

182
00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:03.130
frictionless.
So the wall is exerting in general of force.

183
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:07.540
It just had some oblique angle which are broken up conveniently in horizontal

184
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:08.440
and vertical parts.

185
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.960
What about gravity and

186
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.710
the target due to gravity is what I want to discuss.
No.
First of all,

187
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.450
I am only asking you to find the force I have to apply to support the rock.

188
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.320
So just like the other problem,
I'm not asking you to find Vnh.

189
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.640
So the trick once more is to jump straight to the torque equation.

190
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.560
Forget about the force equation,
the [inaudible] equation,

191
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.710
and take the target on this point.
Then this guy is out.

192
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.240
No matter what's going on,
doesn't matter that are due to the pivot is out.

193
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.010
So we have to equate that park due to the forest.

194
00:13:49.011 --> 00:13:54.011
They apply to the torque due to gravity pulling the rod down dark here to force.

195
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.070
I apply that Torque is equal to f times the length of the ride

196
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.340
because it's f times r time.
The sine of the angle between them and sign up.

197
00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:07.560
The angle is night is sign of 90 which is one.

198
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.730
How bout the torque due to the pull of gravity?

199
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.920
Anybody know what we're supposed to do here?

200
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.310
<v 1>Yep.
Yeah,
we'll homogeneous [inaudible] central.</v>

201
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.490
<v 0>Okay.
Now why is that?
Why is it okay to replace the Torque by you?</v>

202
00:14:26.491 --> 00:14:27.920
The center of mass?

203
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.693
<v 1>Yep.</v>

204
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.280
<v 0>Either of you can answer,
yes</v>

205
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.110
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

206
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.550
<v 0>right,
but why am I allowed to pretend?
See,
we can pretend a lot,</v>

207
00:14:42.551 --> 00:14:47.440
but if it occasionally has to correspond to reality so that it works,
so why?

208
00:14:47.441 --> 00:14:49.600
Why is it okay to pretend that's the correct answer?

209
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.640
<v 1>Cool.
Uniform density,</v>

210
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.210
<v 0>right,
but if I really wanted to prove it,</v>

211
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:59.630
somebody has a way to really nail it down and show that it's okay.
Yes,

212
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.230
rod is a bunch of little thank you.
Yes,

213
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.010
your answer's right,
but I'm just going to,
I know where you're going.

214
00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:11.120
That's the right answer.
Look,

215
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:15.260
what you want to do is you always have to go back to first principles.

216
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.100
You cannot take anything on faith because you picked it up on the street or

217
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:21.500
someone whispered this to you and not good enough.

218
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.540
That's the one lesson I want to show you throughout these lectures is I cannot

219
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:29.420
invoke new laws or new principles.

220
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.140
The only principle we know is f equals Ma.

221
00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:34.670
You got to go back to that all the time.

222
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.270
Of course there's the other principle that gravity's and extra force in the
body,

223
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:43.520
but this is an extern,
this an extended object.
It's got a center of mass,

224
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:46.810
but gravity's not necessarily acting.
It's pulling each part of it down.

225
00:15:46.811 --> 00:15:51.330
So I want to show you that in the end of course the answer is as if all the mass

226
00:15:51.331 --> 00:15:55.580
for concentrated here for the purposes of topics.
But I want to show you why.

227
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.300
So the trick of proposed by this gentleman here,

228
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.910
imagine dividing the rod into tiny pieces,

229
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.900
each of which is small enough to say it as a definite location XII.

230
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.393
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

231
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.740
<v 0>the Torque due to gravity acting on that little fellow is the mass of the Little</v>

232
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.720
Guy Times x times g because mg is the force in mdms.
Exxon is the torque.

233
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.720
You want to sum it over all the little pieces,

234
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.120
some of our eyes summing over all the little pieces.

235
00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.520
So let me make my life easy or dividing by the total mass and multiplying by the

236
00:16:30.521 --> 00:16:35.310
total mass.
If I started this combination,
am I excise some though?
Right?

237
00:16:35.311 --> 00:16:37.690
Divided by M,
that is the center of mass.

238
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.980
So it does look like mg x,

239
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.840
where x is the center of mass of the Rod.

240
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.220
No,
the rod really,
it doesn't have to be uniform for me to say this.

241
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.080
It doesn't have to be uniform.
Right?
The mass can be distributed anyway.

242
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.650
It likes each and mind need not be the same,

243
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.590
but it's very important that gravity be constant.

244
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.690
We demand that the force of gravity have a constant value over the length of the

245
00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:06.660
rod and it's not obvious.
There's always true.

246
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.730
I mean if I took a tiny rod,
force of gravity is constant,
took a very big rod,

247
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.140
comparable,
decisive,
the earth.

248
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.570
Of course the pull of gravity is bearing on the length of the room,

249
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.460
but for all Robertson in the laboratory scale,
that's not enough.

250
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:25.450
It's not an issue and that's where this result comes from.
Okay,

251
00:17:25.451 --> 00:17:27.340
so now that we know whether is all comes from,

252
00:17:27.341 --> 00:17:30.850
we will now apply it in the torque equation.
This is the target.

253
00:17:30.851 --> 00:17:35.851
You're the four say apply FX that's big equal two mg times x,

254
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.510
but exit the location of the center of mass.

255
00:17:40.511 --> 00:17:45.490
Now that is going to be half the link to the right.
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.230
This FX is fl.

257
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.040
<v 1>Okay.
We</v>

258
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.510
<v 0>canceled the l.</v>

259
00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:55.950
Then you find the force at play is m g divided by two.

260
00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:58.653
<v 1>Yep.</v>

261
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.220
<v 0>If the people that is exerting what force</v>

262
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.510
<v 1>they get,
that credit has a horizontal.
Yeah,</v>

263
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:17.750
but it won't cost a torque.
You're finding like the net,

264
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.300
<v 0>uh,
I am finding no,
he had,</v>

265
00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:27.230
what I'm calculating is not the net force and finding the torque.

266
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.850
Our own this point,

267
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.840
you're the pull of gravity on the different segments that make up the rock.

268
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.430
<v 1>Can I get that?
But like why?</v>

269
00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:40.451
<v 0>Oh,</v>

270
00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:45.451
but the pull of gravity is straight down and the separation is horizontal.

271
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.800
<v 1>That the question though,
I want to know about what's your plan?</v>

272
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:56.680
<v 0>Well,
I'm,
Oh,
the force I'm applying.
Oh,
I'm applying a force here.
Straight up.</v>

273
00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:58.930
Oh,
you want to know?

274
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.423
<v 1>Ah,</v>

275
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.410
<v 0>well you're quite right.
You're saying we don't know a priority,</v>

276
00:19:09.411 --> 00:19:12.830
but at the force I'm applying is vertical or horizontal,
right?

277
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.700
Maybe that's your question.
That's actually a valid question.

278
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.620
It's clear that I have to play where they can force and possibly a horizontal

279
00:19:21.621 --> 00:19:25.520
forced to compensate this one need that is horizontal force in the wall.

280
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.650
You're quite right.
Absolutely correct.

281
00:19:27.651 --> 00:19:32.090
So this f I should also divide the force that I apply into vertical part,

282
00:19:32.091 --> 00:19:35.200
I call f and a horizontal part that I call it Brian.

283
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.600
Then it'll turn out that in this problem in its prime is not needed.

284
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.000
You can start off telling to doubly,
if you're holding up a plank,

285
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.090
you know one end is anchored and you're trying to support.

286
00:19:47.091 --> 00:19:51.820
It is enough to apply vertical force,
but I don't have to presume that a,

287
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.350
so if you want,
you can think of applying horizontal force.

288
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.200
It's not necessary to hold this in equilibrium.

289
00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:02.350
Maybe the main point is a purely vertical force will suffice to keep this in

290
00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:05.320
equilibrium is the point that I'm making.
In fact,

291
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.510
if that force is equal to mg over to it won't rotate.

292
00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.840
Now we can go back.

293
00:20:11.841 --> 00:20:16.841
Now that I find the force I have to play in this direction at what the forces at

294
00:20:17.301 --> 00:20:20.690
the pivot,
but the vertical force on the pivot is pointing up.

295
00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.610
My fourth that I calculated is pointing up and together they should add up to
mg.

296
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:30.620
<v 1>No ma'am.</v>

297
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.700
<v 0>Fse called mg over to,
so the vertical force will be mg over to.</v>

298
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:39.960
Now,
how does Auckland Force in this problem?

299
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.960
There is no need for you to apply the horizontal force.

300
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.410
There's no need for the pivot to fight you back with a horizontal force.

301
00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.220
It's not needed for the equilibrium,
but suppose you insisted,

302
00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.340
not only are they lifting it,
but you're leaning into the Rod.
Yes.

303
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.960
Then you will apply horizontal force.

304
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.550
It's not going to contribute the torque equation,
but if you push it in there,

305
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.500
the walls got to push you out and eight prime will be equal to eight.

306
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.310
<v 2>Okay?</v>

307
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.670
<v 0>In fact,</v>

308
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:09.470
let's turn to a problem where the support in fact exerts a horizontal and

309
00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.940
vertical force,
so that's the next level of difficulty.

310
00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:18.770
This is one of the standard problems in this section and it goes like this.

311
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.720
You had a set a rod?

312
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:22.960
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

313
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.510
<v 0>and are supported by a wire</v>

314
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.700
and the wire has certain tension.
T is anchored to the wall.

315
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.610
The length of the rod is El Moussa,
the artist am

316
00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:37.180
and I.

317
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:42.000
The this end is some pivot which is exerting some unknown forest which can have

318
00:21:42.001 --> 00:21:43.470
a horizontal and vertical part.

319
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:47.490
You'll have a whole design depart and the vertical part B.

320
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:53.280
Now I know for sure doesn't horizontal part I think you can tell.

321
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.710
Can you guys tell in your mind whether it's horizontal part,

322
00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.450
this force that supporting it is pushing the rod into the wall and also pulling

323
00:22:00.451 --> 00:22:04.140
it up.
The part that's pushing it to the left has to be compensated by h.

324
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.320
What's up boys?
The question they ask you is what does the tension on that rope

325
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.410
and suppose that's the crucial issue because of the tensions.

326
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:19.390
Too much rope is going to break if you want only the tension.
Once again,

327
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:23.320
the trick is forget the force equation.
Go to the park.

328
00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:27.160
Equation is we go to the torque equation.
You banish both VNA.

329
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:28.510
I hope that's clear to all of you.

330
00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.760
A force going through the pivot point in any direction is incapable of producing

331
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:37.990
any torque that's so intuitively clear.
We need not belabor that.

332
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:43.110
If you want a formula in f times r time signed data Arctic zero so we don't care

333
00:22:43.151 --> 00:22:43.984
what the angle is.

334
00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.850
So once again we'll take parks around this point and see what it will tell us.

335
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.370
So the tar due to gravity,

336
00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:58.371
we all agreed we can now replace by AMG l over to turning it this way.

337
00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:04.850
So this force exerts a torque which is equal to the value of the tension,

338
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:09.360
the length of the Rod and sine of the angle between the two,

339
00:23:09.361 --> 00:23:10.470
which is this angle here.

340
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:17.210
So the nice thing is you can solve for the tension theoretically in one shot,

341
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:21.470
which is this mg over to sine theta.

342
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.450
That's why data cannot be too small.

343
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.920
If data's too small or some point p will become so large that the string will

344
00:23:34.921 --> 00:23:37.090
break.
So we knew we wanted to anchor a sign.

345
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:42.300
You got to try to take a big angle like that.
So that same data is not too small,

346
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:47.690
so one of the problems you could be asked is what's the minimum angle so that

347
00:23:47.691 --> 00:23:48.800
the rope doesn't break.

348
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.950
Given that it can support a maximum tension of thousand newtons.

349
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:56.240
Well then you put a thousand newtons here,
you know the m and the g,

350
00:23:56.241 --> 00:23:57.340
you saw it for the data,

351
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.800
which it crosses those newtons and your data should be bigger than that.

352
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:08.770
<v 1>Yep.
Where do you get the fact that Derek is equal to that?</v>

353
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.860
<v 0>That was the definition of the torque.</v>

354
00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.180
If you go back then you got to go back to what we did earlier than you will
find.

355
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.980
I did use the other day.

356
00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.520
I said maybe I'll remind you how that happened.

357
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:29.080
I'm trying to find the analog of f equals Ma analog of Mas.

358
00:24:29.081 --> 00:24:31.000
I alpha and I said,

359
00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:34.570
who is the guy who can play the role on the left hand side and I found the

360
00:24:34.571 --> 00:24:39.250
quantity that plays the role of IMF that's equal I l four is the first time,

361
00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:43.330
distance time signed data.
Okay,

362
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.740
so that you look,
you got to understand why torque has assigned data in it.

363
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.310
If you want to rotate the body,
take anybody that you want to rotate,

364
00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:57.040
you know here is a rod and you want to rotate it.
You pick a point,

365
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.240
you want to play a force.

366
00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.960
We know intuitively that any force applied along this direction,

367
00:25:01.961 --> 00:25:03.700
there's no use in terms of rotating it.

368
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:09.760
The best way to apply a force of a given magnitude is to be perpendicular to it,

369
00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:12.970
but if for some reason you can only apply some angle,

370
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.630
then this part of the forest is good for rotation and that part of the forest is

371
00:25:16.631 --> 00:25:20.770
not good for rotation and the scientist projects out this part,

372
00:25:20.771 --> 00:25:21.910
if that angle is data,

373
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.900
that FCI data is really the perpendicular part of f.

374
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.330
So that's how the tarp was defined.

375
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.110
Okay,
so we found the tension here.

376
00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:36.700
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

377
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.640
<v 0>if that's all you want to know,
that's the end of the problem.
You got attention,</v>

378
00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.680
but you may be asked to do more.

379
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.340
You could be asked to now find what's happening at the pivot.

380
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.850
Then you've got to go back to the forces.

381
00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.030
So in the horizontal direction in the x direction,

382
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:56.590
the total forces have to add to zero.
So eight should be equal to f.

383
00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.220
It should be equal attention time,

384
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:04.230
school signed data because this tea has a t sine theta that way and the tico

385
00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.250
same data that way.

386
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:07.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

387
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.050
<v 0>And this is tico scientists.</v>

388
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.130
So tico Santana is pushing in the wall should push out and now I know the value

389
00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:16.964
of tea.

390
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:22.230
I put that in mg over to cotangent data because their school sign oversight.

391
00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.180
All right,
so that's the horizontal part.

392
00:26:31.181 --> 00:26:34.060
How about the vertical park in the vertical direction?

393
00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:39.660
Upward vertical force plus design data has to be the downward force,

394
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:41.613
which is AMG.

395
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:45.320
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

396
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.950
<v 0>well we know what the scientists is.
We just did that.
These scientists,</v>

397
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.460
if you look up here,
do you signed it as mg over two

398
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.170
equals AMG.
That means V's mg over to

399
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.030
that means a pivot.
Provoke provides half the support,

400
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:07.060
half the mass and the tensions vertical part provides the other part.

401
00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.320
So I will give you a couple of seconds to think about this.

402
00:27:12.321 --> 00:27:15.890
This is the kind of problem you guys should be easily able to do.

403
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:21.440
You isolate the Rod,
you write all the forces on it.
If you want.
Maybe this,

404
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.090
if this pixel is not clear to you,

405
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:27.860
what I have in mind is I pull out the rod and say,

406
00:27:27.861 --> 00:27:32.270
why is this rod not turning and moving under all the forces acting on it.

407
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:36.890
Then I read the forces on it.
Uh,
the tension is acting in that direction.

408
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.360
The pivot has a vertical force pivot as horizontal force and gravity.

409
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:45.980
For this purpose I will replace as acting there under the action of all these

410
00:27:45.981 --> 00:27:49.040
forces that are artist,
neither translating,
not rotating.

411
00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.070
That means the x component of the foresight to zero.

412
00:27:52.071 --> 00:27:54.940
The white component answer to zero,
the tar cats disease.

413
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.930
If you've got to the equations,

414
00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.530
you can plug the numbers into any of them in any order you like.
In the end,

415
00:28:01.531 --> 00:28:02.700
you'll all get the same answer,

416
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.230
but the way to get the answer to most effectively is to take the torque equation

417
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.950
because the beauty of the target equation is that neither the vertical partner,

418
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:14.010
they horizontally part,
not anything to do with the pivot enters that,

419
00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:16.860
so bear that in mind.

420
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.330
Now you can embellish the problem.
I don't want to do that.

421
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:22.410
You can hang a weight here.

422
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.700
I don't think that should cause any problem support.

423
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:30.330
There's an extra way to little m on top of the mass of the Rod.

424
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.750
I'm actually hanging.
You wait here.
Well,

425
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.680
all you have to do when you go to the torque equation is to remember that this

426
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:40.770
weight going this way,
we'll provide an extra torque.

427
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.450
There'll be little m times g times the whole length of the rod because I'm

428
00:28:45.451 --> 00:28:46.740
taking the target on that point.

429
00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:50.460
You put that in new salt for the tension t.

430
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.800
Then go back and again do the first part.

431
00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:02.860
Any questions about this so far because I'm going to do now the last of these

432
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:08.540
equilibrium problems before I do something else.
The last year,

433
00:29:08.541 --> 00:29:09.530
the equilibrium problem.

434
00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:14.660
It's very standard fair for this course,

435
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.920
which is the problem I mentioned in the beginning to motivate all of this and

436
00:29:18.921 --> 00:29:23.030
that is if I have a ladder leaning on a wall,

437
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.750
awesome angle data,
you're going ask yourself,

438
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.940
is that a limit to the data?

439
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.680
You think that's going to be some kind of limit and if so,
what kind of limit?

440
00:29:39.681 --> 00:29:41.770
Will it be a lower limit or an upper limit?

441
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.750
What do you like to guess?
A lower limit on the Taita.

442
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.890
By that you mean what if data is less than some amount?
What will happen?

443
00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:00.530
It'll fall very good.
So for,
for equilibrium there'll be a lower limit on data.

444
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:05.150
I think it's clear to all of us that if you trying to claim a building and you

445
00:30:05.151 --> 00:30:08.420
put a ladder like this years asking for trouble,

446
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.240
<v 1>right?
Yup.</v>

447
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:19.380
<v 0>No,
I agree.
You mean 91 degrees lateral like this?</v>

448
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:23.730
Yes.
I agree with you.
I don't recommend that either.

449
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:30.470
So between are you a mathematician because they always find out something wrong

450
00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.340
in anything I say,
I say good morning.
They say,
well,
not quite.
You know,

451
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.600
let's look into this.
Philosophers even more difficult.
What is good?

452
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.810
What is morning?
It's morning here.
It's my time in California,

453
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.580
but look,
every time I make up an exam for a question,

454
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:52.230
I ran it by a lot of students,
a lot of TA's.
Because when I'm talking to you,

455
00:30:52.231 --> 00:30:54.750
I have a certain notion of what I'm talking about,

456
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.500
but the same words can mean something else and quite often I am tripped up by

457
00:30:58.501 --> 00:30:59.490
this though.

458
00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:03.880
This is the first time at this question has come up so you learn something

459
00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.030
everyday.
All right.
Anyway,

460
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:11.060
let's say we are going to limit ourselves zero to 90 and what angle can it take?

461
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.490
What's the minimum angle?
What do you think is going to control that angle?

462
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.780
<v 1>Yep.
Yes.</v>

463
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.760
<v 0>The court between the what?</v>

464
00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.450
<v 1>Right.
Okay,</v>

465
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.670
<v 0>so in fact it turns out even the conference,</v>

466
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.820
the friction with this wall may help,
but we are going to rely on a problem,

467
00:31:32.821 --> 00:31:37.350
but the wall is frictionless and the floor has the friction and it's got a stat,

468
00:31:37.351 --> 00:31:40.350
static friction mew,
which I'm just going to give to you.

469
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:45.400
So here to summer challenge.
Now we want to see why this arrived.

470
00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.220
It's not falling,

471
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.790
so let's just write down all the equations so whenever they get any irritation

472
00:31:50.791 --> 00:31:54.450
problem.
Rule number one is don't panic.

473
00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.620
Just write down the three great conditions and it'll all happen.

474
00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.210
The first condition is a well zero conditioners.

475
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.690
Draw the forces on this guy.
So what forces do you want to draw?

476
00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.230
I think we have learned over and over.

477
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.060
AMG can be assumed to be acting in the middle of the Rock Center of the Rod.

478
00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.100
The Wall is very important.
If it's a frictionless wall,

479
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.880
then the only force that can exert is perpendicular to itself.

480
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.230
That's the meaning of frictionless.

481
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.960
You cannot apply a force along the length of the Rod,

482
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.780
so let's give that nameW or a wall.

483
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.830
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

484
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:37.420
<v 0>I come to the floor.
Now the floor is exerting a force and standard name,</v>

485
00:32:37.421 --> 00:32:39.100
flip normal or perpendicular.

486
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.530
Then it's exerting a frictional force F,

487
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.970
which will be inward because the ladder,
the strange was slide out.

488
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:50.420
You will apply a static friction force inward to keep it from moving.

489
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.290
That's it.
These are the forces and subject to these forces.

490
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.340
We have to write down all the conditions,
the Sangha list data here

491
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.780
for the x motion.
The fact that all the,
maybe I should write it,

492
00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:07.860
some of all the ex forces is zero.

493
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.520
Simply says w equals f.

494
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:20.920
Some of all the white forces equal tells me n equals g,

495
00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:28.883
<v 1>right?</v>

496
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:32.290
<v 0>All that is left with the torque and that's where you have the choice.</v>

497
00:33:32.291 --> 00:33:35.680
You can take the torque around any point you like.
You can take that point.

498
00:33:35.681 --> 00:33:40.150
In fact,
you can take a point here,
okay.
If you want to really punish yourself,

499
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.870
you can take a target on some crazy point and then an f will all come into the

500
00:33:43.871 --> 00:33:47.410
problem and you will have to work that much harder.
So the trick again,

501
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:52.150
take the Torque here than an effort gone.
And what do I have?

502
00:33:52.151 --> 00:33:55.810
I have MD try and rotate it this way.
I've w trying to rotate it that way.

503
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.390
I'm just going to balance the magnitudes of the two torx.

504
00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:03.930
So what equations will they get for W it is w times l claim signed data.

505
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.220
Now here is where you shouldn't simply write it down.

506
00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.490
You got to make sure that you would have written this down.

507
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.740
Going back to the definition of Torque force times distance from the pivot point

508
00:34:17.741 --> 00:34:21.970
times the sine of the angle between the force and the line of separation.

509
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.620
W is the force,

510
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:28.780
the distance is l the length of the ladder and this state and that pay the equal

511
00:34:28.781 --> 00:34:30.550
by some theater.

512
00:34:30.551 --> 00:34:33.340
And we learned in high school that if you've got two parallel lines,

513
00:34:33.341 --> 00:34:36.370
the angle is the same.
So the [inaudible] are you want to use as that.

514
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.873
<v 1>That's the torque.</v>

515
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.060
<v 0>That's the duty at the wall.</v>

516
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.300
The tarp due to gravity is mg l over to co signed data.

517
00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.480
Now wait,
do they write co-signed data?

518
00:34:54.481 --> 00:34:58.560
Am I making a mistake instead of signed data?

519
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:00.360
Why is it cause signed data?

520
00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.393
Oh yes.

521
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.900
<v 1>Cause that angle ladder is,</v>

522
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.950
<v 0>yeah.
So let me repeat the answer.
They knew,
right?</v>

523
00:35:15.951 --> 00:35:17.790
Torque is MGL signed data.

524
00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:21.740
That data is not some fixed angle that somebody drew in the diagram.

525
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:24.860
It varies from forced to force.

526
00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.300
It's the angle that force makes with the line connecting the point of

527
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:31.970
application of the force of the point of rotation.

528
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.400
So mg is acting here.

529
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.790
You want the angle between the bad x and of MD and the dynamics and of the line

530
00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:40.080
of separation,
which is this angle.

531
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:44.330
So you really want to sign of this angle but sign up that angle is costly of

532
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.540
this angle
so you can cancel that.

533
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:54.370
I find w equals AMG over to core tangent theta.

534
00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.690
Yes.
The torque equation tells me that's the Wy need.

535
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.250
The Wall's going to push out with that w and you better be able to fight that

536
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:11.200
the fight that that w should be equal to f just what we got here.

537
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.390
That's fine too.
But now we have a restriction.
F cannot be arbitrarily big.

538
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.640
F is less than or equal to the Coefficient of static friction times the normal

539
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:24.474
force.

540
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:33.020
Yup.
You explain.
Yes.

541
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:37.790
So I wanted to find the torque due to the force of gravity acting.

542
00:36:37.791 --> 00:36:41.660
Then with respect to this point,
by the definition of the Torque,

543
00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.190
you take the force,

544
00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.470
you're joined the point of application of the force of the point around which

545
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.970
are doing the torque and take the angle between those two lights.

546
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.000
So it's really that angle,
which is not the taper here.

547
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.390
But if I draw the picture here,
you can see this is data,

548
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:01.530
this is 90 minus data,
this angle that I want.

549
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.010
But then sign of 90 minus data is called same data.

550
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:11.260
And that's why you use that
sign up 90 minus status quo.

551
00:37:11.261 --> 00:37:11.821
Same data.

552
00:37:11.821 --> 00:37:15.570
Because when you change data at 90 minus theta watch becomes what's opposite

553
00:37:15.571 --> 00:37:17.490
becomes our Jason and I.

554
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:20.610
Jason Becomes opposite in any right triangle if that's your angle,

555
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.430
that's called the adjacent side.
But if that's your angle,

556
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.760
that's not the ideas inside.

557
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:28.880
So sign and cosign exchange places when data goes to 19 minus data.

558
00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.990
All right,
so coming back again,
I did this cancellation,

559
00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.760
I got that to be equal to the force of friction,
but that's bounded by this.

560
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.910
But I know n equals MD.
So bring this equation here.

561
00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.040
So that's equal to news times mg.

562
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:51.330
So I have the restriction that empty quarter empty over to coordinate Taito.

563
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:55.740
So let's compare that.
Did that.

564
00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:00.800
And we find the restriction that mg over to court and then data less than or

565
00:38:02.611 --> 00:38:05.040
equal to u s times mg

566
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.510
cancel the mg and you find corta engine data

567
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.300
has to be less than or equal to two times from us.

568
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:26.310
I like to write it as 10 data has to be bigger than that equal to one over two

569
00:38:26.621 --> 00:38:27.550
times for us.

570
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.980
Do you know how he went from here to here?
If this number is smaller than this,

571
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.980
the reciprocal of this number is bigger than the reciprocal of this.

572
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:43.981
Number three is smaller than ten one third is bigger than one 10th same thing.

573
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.040
So I'm somehow used to tangent better than with cortex.

574
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:53.200
And so I flip this over and I flipped that over and also change less than two

575
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:57.700
bigger than this way we can understand Panthera has to be bigger than some

576
00:38:57.701 --> 00:38:58.270
number.

577
00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.540
That means data has to be bigger than some number because canthia increases with

578
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:05.020
Taylor.
So you tell me what your coefficient of friction is.

579
00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:10.420
Maybe it's 0.5 then this is one 10th dealers should be bigger than one data

580
00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:12.010
should be bigger than 45 degrees.

581
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:17.920
Okay.
Are a Pi over four

582
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.020
maybe I should keep using radiant.

583
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.300
So you guys get used to radiants as the way to think about it.

584
00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.530
So what's the famous show and CNN?
Anderson Cooper.
What?

585
00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:38.290
Anderson Cooper two Pi.
Cause that's what it is for this class.
Think gradients.

586
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:42.860
Are you going to screw up somewhere?
Okay.
Angle is what we use every day.

587
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:45.880
But radiants what we use here,
when I write a 10 data,

588
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.480
and I don't tell you what it is or if I tell you tangential velocity is Omega

589
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:56.560
Times are that velocity,
angular velocity.
Omega is Radians per second.

590
00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.160
A lot of people get tripped over this,
okay?

591
00:40:00.161 --> 00:40:03.310
It's a very natural way to measure angles and you guys get used to that.

592
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:10.270
Okay?
So this is a collection of problems all in the x,
y plane.

593
00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:16.390
Rigid body dynamics is quite manageable as long as everything license the x,

594
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:19.570
y plane.
If the plane of the black borders,
the x,
y plane,

595
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.210
notice that everything is happening.
The X,
y plane,

596
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:26.530
all the mass is concentrated on the plane.
All the forces are on the plane,

597
00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:28.390
all the vectors separating.

598
00:40:28.391 --> 00:40:32.020
The point of the Torque to the point of the forces in the plane,

599
00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:38.280
but now you have to deal with the fact that in real life objects are not just

600
00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.590
planners,
they are chunks like a top or a potato.

601
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:46.420
So living in three dimensions and rigid body dynamics and three dimensions,

602
00:40:46.421 --> 00:40:51.340
one of the most complicated fields.
Uh,
so we're not going to do that.

603
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:57.180
We're going to take a rather simpler version of the rigid body problem.

604
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:03.490
Basically the problem of torques and forces in three d but applied in a very

605
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:04.510
limited context,

606
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:10.710
limited context I've set for myself right now is to just apply to a single point

607
00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:12.664
mass.

608
00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:18.660
What does the analog of Thai [inaudible] equals I alpha when the mass is not

609
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:22.660
moving the x,
y plane,
but just running around all over three dimensions.

610
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:27.070
How do we define torque?
How do we define Anglo momentum in three d?

611
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:30.520
You will find that as a,
it's not a straightforward extension.

612
00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:35.000
You have to think a little harder.
Let me motivate the problem.

613
00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:36.670
We have supports.

614
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.700
I have a spot in the x white plains,
right?

615
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:43.670
It's a sheet of metal or something.
And it is

616
00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.250
spinning and it Torque is applied here.

617
00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.670
This is our and a force emphasis on life.
Yes.

618
00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.940
The second the problem we have been studied,

619
00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.680
we know that the Torque in this case is going to rotate it in a counter

620
00:42:02.681 --> 00:42:07.670
clockwise direction if the force or opposite alerted it in a clockwise
direction.

621
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.130
So whenever I did a toric calculation,

622
00:42:10.131 --> 00:42:14.090
the torque West Ada plus something or minus something plus men counterclockwise

623
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:16.580
minus man clockwise,
if I got 10 different torques,

624
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.680
I just add up all of them with proper attention to plus and minus signs.

625
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.450
But now imagine that this body is actually,

626
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:29.990
you don't even need a potato for this.
This take the same flat sheet,

627
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.090
but there's now not living in the x y plane but floating somewhere in space.

628
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:40.330
And somewhere there honors surface is a force pulling it with the separation are

629
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.840
what does that Torque do?

630
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:50.030
The torque will certainly provide a counter.
Uh,

631
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.240
let me see a counterclockwise rotation.
But around this axis

632
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.080
piercing the sample so we know it's counterclockwise,

633
00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:02.990
but enough it's not enough to say it's counterclockwise because in this problem

634
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:05.240
it is counter clockwise around that axis.

635
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:11.240
So when a body is rotated in more than two dimensions,

636
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:14.420
the body will tend to rotate around an axis,

637
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:18.770
either clockwise or counter clockwise,
but they access itself has to be specified

638
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:23.210
as long as your body was stuck to the x,
y plane,

639
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.460
it had to rotate around the Z axis.

640
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.370
I'm just telling you if a liberate the condition and throw it in free space like

641
00:43:28.371 --> 00:43:31.310
a Frisbee Frisbee can rotate at any instance.

642
00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.270
Here's the flying frisbee is rotating around some access.

643
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:40.580
So in order to say that the Torque is producing rotations,

644
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.900
they want to characterize not only the magnitude of the Torque,

645
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.270
but also tell you the direction in which it will produce rotations.

646
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.720
So that is a trick we use.

647
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:56.420
The trick is we are going to somehow indicate that the effect of this store is

648
00:43:56.421 --> 00:43:59.000
to produce a rotation around that axis.

649
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:05.410
So we are going to introduce a new vector Tau Tau,

650
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.410
which is so far a scalar is going to be now promoted to a vector

651
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:14.990
and the vector will be denoted by this symbol called the cross product.

652
00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:22.020
But I will not tell you how to get towers director we know are and we know f or

653
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.060
the Torque we suddenly learn is actually a vector

654
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.920
barely fits the vector.
It needs a magnitude and it needs a direction.

655
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:37.010
The magnitude of the vector is the old thing for sine theta.

656
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:41.860
<v 2>Okay,</v>

657
00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.830
<v 0>I hope you people understand that in three dimensions,</v>

658
00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:48.550
even in three dimensions if odd,
an f four two vectors,

659
00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:53.670
you know they can move around like these two fingers did define a plane and in

660
00:44:53.681 --> 00:44:58.600
that plane that is a clear angle between these two vectors.
That's the angle.

661
00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:03.270
I mean so he is the vector are if you want a extend,

662
00:45:03.271 --> 00:45:05.620
the vector are like that.
That's the day that I'm talking about.

663
00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:09.470
Now once you have two vectors,

664
00:45:09.471 --> 00:45:14.471
defining a plane is one vector here and I did a vector that is perpendicular to

665
00:45:15.261 --> 00:45:20.180
that plate.
Every plan has a perpendicular.

666
00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:25.070
There's only one ambiguity.
He said,
if I give you something planner like this,

667
00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:26.750
I can draw two perpendicular perpendiculars,

668
00:45:26.751 --> 00:45:30.350
one going up and one going down both at perpendicular to the plane.

669
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:35.980
So we have to make a choice on what direction I want associated with this top.

670
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.010
And that's where you use the right hand rule.

671
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:45.310
The rule says there are lots of names for this room.
Ah,

672
00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:49.060
let's first take a simple case.
It is our,

673
00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.120
and let me bring the f back then and ride like this.

674
00:45:54.220 --> 00:45:56.290
I wanted to find the cross product.

675
00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:00.920
Our Cross F is magnitude is this length of our length of f.

676
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:03.400
Sign up the angle.
I'm trying to pick a direction.

677
00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.390
Either the direction in this case is going to be out of the blackboard or into

678
00:46:07.391 --> 00:46:11.410
the blackboard.
And the convention is stayed at in many different ways.

679
00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:17.400
One convention is you take this are and you turn a screwdriver from ripe from

680
00:46:22.361 --> 00:46:27.220
art to f k you guys,
imagine in your mind,

681
00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:32.080
take a screwdriver,
turn the screwdriver from art f,
which way will this?

682
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.380
That's right.
You see,
that's what all the rap guys are doing.

683
00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:39.970
They're trying to use the right hand rule because right hand rule says that if

684
00:46:39.971 --> 00:46:42.560
you ever are,
and if you have an f that's the tar.

685
00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.160
I have not followed the lyrics pretty closely,

686
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:48.340
but I believe they're muttering something about forces and torques.

687
00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.340
Okay,
so here it is.
Here's the right 10 rule.

688
00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.370
If this is our and that is f and that's the Torque,

689
00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.460
but I find it much easier to do another right hand rule,

690
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:04.840
which is the witness like this.
You can see that in books to curl your fingers.

691
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:09.460
The rule says from art to F and whichever way your thumb points,

692
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.350
that's the direction of our cross.

693
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:17.900
I think it's pretty clear that if you write it that way,

694
00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.780
our cross f this minus f Cros are,

695
00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:24.740
so you've gotta be very careful when you take this cross product,

696
00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.620
the audit in which you multiply directors.
Very important.

697
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:35.980
Okay,
so in this example,
our cross fit you guys ready?
Now you should have made,

698
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:39.020
I'm not going to tell you the answer,
but think for a second.
Our Cross.

699
00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.670
In this example,

700
00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.000
if you turn a screwdriver or do the right hand rule is coming onto the

701
00:47:44.001 --> 00:47:46.730
blackboard,
that is the direction of the torque.

702
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:50.450
You can imagine these two vectors which are then the x,
y plane,

703
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.630
lift them up and turn them into free space.
It doesn't matter.

704
00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:58.070
They still define a perpendicular direction uniquely by turning the screwdriver

705
00:47:58.071 --> 00:48:01.040
from art to effort,
curling your fingers,
doing whatever you want.

706
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:04.820
That's the direction of Torque.
Torque is a vector

707
00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.940
by the way.
That's an accidental property of living in three dimensions.

708
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:14.150
If you take two vectors a and B,

709
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:18.050
we can define across product c equals a cross fee.

710
00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:25.970
The rule for what C is equal to is that the length of c is the length of a

711
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.100
length of be.

712
00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:31.230
The sine of the angle between them and the direction of c is found by taking the

713
00:48:31.231 --> 00:48:35.340
plane and with a and B lie and drawing a perpendicular to the plane in the sense

714
00:48:35.341 --> 00:48:37.470
that you rotate a screwdriver from a to B.

715
00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:40.860
If you're living in four dimensions.

716
00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:44.550
If I give you two vectors like these two fingers,

717
00:48:44.551 --> 00:48:45.870
well that's the perpendicular to it.

718
00:48:45.871 --> 00:48:48.090
You can see but there's one other whole fourth dimension.

719
00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:53.091
You don't see the four dimensions that is not one perpendicular direction to a

720
00:48:54.001 --> 00:48:54.400
plane.

721
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.500
There are two perpendicular directions so you cannot take the cross product and

722
00:48:58.501 --> 00:49:02.880
turn it into a vector in four dimension is a beautiful property of three

723
00:49:02.881 --> 00:49:03.714
dimensions.

724
00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:07.930
That one is able to take two vectors and manufactured from them at third vector

725
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:14.920
so that's an accident of three d but we live in trees so we explored this a lot

726
00:49:14.921 --> 00:49:17.320
and it's a natural quantity to bring in.

727
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:22.090
When you talk about torques now the whole cross product is something one can go

728
00:49:22.091 --> 00:49:24.700
on and on.
I don't want to talk for too long.

729
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:27.460
Let me just point out a couple of properties in the cross product.

730
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000
One is that a cross B is equal to minus v Cross a because when he turned a

731
00:49:33.671 --> 00:49:37.780
screwdriver from ADB it advances one way.
If it's B two eight goes the other way.

732
00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.250
One particular consequence of this is that a across is zero.

733
00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:44.600
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

734
00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:48.320
<v 0>because a cross it is minus eight cross a what that means the across eight zero.</v>

735
00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:52.910
It also follows from the fact that the angle between a and a zero degrees,

736
00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.590
so the science data managers,

737
00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.910
if you want to get practice,
you can practice some simple cross products.

738
00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:06.040
Here's a unit vector and I,
here's a unit vector Jay,
here's the unit vector cake,

739
00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:09.650
so let's try,
I crossed Jay,

740
00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:15.140
I crossed this a vector perpendicular to ing,
namely pointing in the z direction,

741
00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:20.480
who's length is equal to one times one time sign of 90 which is one that for

742
00:50:20.481 --> 00:50:21.980
this is a non other than k

743
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:28.590
I crossed j is k but that's equal to minus of deer cross Psi.

744
00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.890
If you went from day to I turned a screwdriver from J to why this group,

745
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.750
we'll go down the Z axis I across j and j crowns,

746
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:40.400
I are opposite of each other and I cross eyes.
By the way,

747
00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:43.520
you will find with your hands one turn would be easy.

748
00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:46.670
Other would require all kinds of contortions.
So what I suggest you do,

749
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.190
do it for the easier one and then flip the sign.

750
00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:53.900
Cause I saw you going through some,
uh,
an honestly a tournament in the front row.

751
00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.900
I have the same problem I've seen people doing,
you know,

752
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.980
at my age I should even be doing the cross product because you're going to end

753
00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:03.680
up in the hospital.
So anyway,
it's a game for the young,

754
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.420
you can do the cross product your way,

755
00:51:05.421 --> 00:51:09.320
but one day you will learn to follow my way,
which is do the easy product,

756
00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:14.660
then turn the sign around.
All right,
so I don't want to spend too much time,

757
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:17.090
but let me just mention one thing because the homework problem.

758
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:20.910
Remember the dark product,
I said it's a dot.

759
00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:24.260
B is length of a length to be cosine of the angle between them.

760
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:28.790
But I told you another way to do a dog be a x,
B x Plus Ayby.

761
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:34.460
You get that by writing a as any a x plus j times a y likewise for B and taking

762
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:37.730
all the different dark products you get when you open up the brackets.

763
00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:42.920
That's where you get a x,
B x plus Ayby there because I.
Dot.

764
00:51:42.921 --> 00:51:47.921
I is one in JLR days one and I'd RJ vanishes for the dark product trust product.

765
00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:49.730
Exactly the opposite.

766
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:55.330
If you write I times x Cause Day Times a y let's k times Izzy cross product,

767
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:02.990
but similar things for beats I times be explicitly a times B,

768
00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:05.660
y et cetera.
K Times busy.

769
00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.830
That in principle nine terms you can get in the cross product,

770
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:13.610
three of them will vanish because when you take icrossing you will get zero.

771
00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:14.980
When you take across there,

772
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:18.200
you will get something Munich Take Jay Cross I you get minus something.

773
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:23.360
You put them all together.
I won't do this now.
It will look like I times x,

774
00:52:23.361 --> 00:52:28.361
B y minus Ayb x plus the time something in Cape Time,

775
00:52:29.161 --> 00:52:32.840
something I don't,
I don't need this.
I'm not going to dwell on this.

776
00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.150
It's good enough for our purposes to know.

777
00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:38.330
The cross product can be visualized as the bactrim.

778
00:52:38.331 --> 00:52:42.680
Perpendicular the two vectors,
farming the product and of length equal to length.

779
00:52:42.681 --> 00:52:45.200
Availing to be sine of the angle between.

780
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:48.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>

781
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:53.270
<v 0>Okay,
so why did I introduce across product?
Well,
here is the point.</v>

782
00:52:55.090 --> 00:53:00.090
I've introduced Torque as our cross f I hope you know what that means.

783
00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:07.170
If a forces acting at the point with vector are measured from some origin that

784
00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:09.320
are geared,
that forces our that.

785
00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:16.290
Now I'm going to introduce for a single point mass somewhere here and angular

786
00:53:16.841 --> 00:53:17.674
momentum,

787
00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:22.660
which is also going to be a vector previously angular momentum Iomega is not a

788
00:53:22.661 --> 00:53:25.110
vector.
We just saved spinning clockwise or counter.

789
00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.290
Now for a single point mass moving in some direction,

790
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.280
I'm going to introduce the angular momentum to be art cross p.

791
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.630
This is an inspired definition and you will find it's a good definition because

792
00:53:39.631 --> 00:53:40.830
things will work out.

793
00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:45.400
What's the first thing I want this definition dissatisfying.

794
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:48.730
Anybody have an idea of what we expect?

795
00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:52.150
What relation to expect between Torque and l?

796
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.313
<v 1>Elevate</v>

797
00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.210
<v 0>torque should be the database to avail.
Yeah,
right?</v>

798
00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:04.550
So what are you going to say that?
So I expect if things are working out,

799
00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:08.510
how should be DLD.
So let's see what the l d t is.

800
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:14.270
The rate of change of angular momentum is going to be the R D t

801
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:21.610
Christ be less our cross.
The PDT.

802
00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:27.020
Just use the rule of calculus.
I mean you got a product,

803
00:54:27.021 --> 00:54:29.450
you take a little bit of this and then the database to have that.

804
00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:35.200
But d r d t is the velocity price momentum less our cries,

805
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:40.670
the force,
the rate of change of momentum is the force.

806
00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:48.230
No,
this guy would be like,
that's the torque.
This guy we don't like,

807
00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.550
but that'd be zero.

808
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:52.913
<v 1>So</v>

809
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:56.440
<v 0>you know why that does zero B Crosby</v>

810
00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:03.440
<v 1>multiplied last few times.
The mass times velocity,</v>

811
00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:09.440
the loss,
the cancer that no.

812
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:14.220
<v 0>Yes,
because P is equal to n B where V is the same philosophy,
right?</v>

813
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:18.120
So velocity and momentum or parallel,
it just connected by a number APP.

814
00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:19.890
But if you take to paddle vectors,

815
00:55:19.891 --> 00:55:22.560
that cross product we'll manage because scientists to zero.

816
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:27.450
So luckily that drops out and we do have this very nice result that if I defined

817
00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:30.550
I ain't gonna momentum this way,
then great 15 them.

818
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:32.740
Angular momentum is the torque.

819
00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.640
But Tara was defined as art process.

820
00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:46.200
So let me convince you that these definitions than three dimensions are fully

821
00:55:47.381 --> 00:55:50.130
compatible with what we've been doing all this time and tournament.

822
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:54.160
Let me convince you,
this is not a new,
a brand new definition.

823
00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:57.880
Let's go back to two D and Why ask,

824
00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:00.490
what does all of this look like when I applied to today?

825
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:05.650
So go to the two dimensions now let's put that in the,
let's take some object.

826
00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:07.630
Take a tiny,

827
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:12.370
tiny piece of gum stuck to some rotating rigid body first.

828
00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:16.990
What did we say is the angular momentum according to this formula

829
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.830
ain't got momentum is our cross p.

830
00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:25.240
This is our right if a part of the rigid body,
it can only move that way.

831
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:31.140
Um,
first taking the case where the mass I'm considering is embedded on a rigid

832
00:56:31.141 --> 00:56:33.300
body.
Then when you rotate rotated,

833
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:36.960
it has to go along a circle with that as the radius.

834
00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:42.090
So the moment than p will look like that and the are measured from any point we

835
00:56:42.091 --> 00:56:46.230
look like this are cross p which is what I'm calling l.

836
00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:51.210
The length available be our cross p for length of our cross which would be our

837
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.400
four p.
Let me write MV

838
00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:02.310
MVP is the tangential velocity here but we both know that that is equal to m

839
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:06.990
times Omega Times are because of tangential velocity.

840
00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:12.110
There's Omega are that's something weird or long back but then this becomes an

841
00:57:13.210 --> 00:57:14.680
Omega Square are

842
00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.420
I'm sorry,
m r squared,

843
00:57:19.421 --> 00:57:23.620
Omega good and Mr squared is the moment to finish.

844
00:57:23.621 --> 00:57:26.800
You have this point mass and Omega is the angular velocity of the point.

845
00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:31.510
That's what we've been using all this time so it's fully compatible with the

846
00:57:31.511 --> 00:57:35.230
definition of angular momentum we had but it's broader than this one.

847
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:40.020
This was applicable only to bodies which is circling some point because they're

848
00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:41.140
stuck on a rigid body.

849
00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:45.730
That's why there's art I've never changed and it just went round at any
incident.

850
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:47.770
If there is some omega,
it have some anger moment,

851
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:52.720
but I want to think of you had to think about the following fact.

852
00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:57.400
Whenever you take a rigid body is made up of many bodies.

853
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.880
Each one of them has angular momentum.

854
00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:04.180
I Omega you added them all up but as a vector,

855
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.720
each one is angular momentum coming out of the blackboard are going into the

856
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:12.721
blackboard because if r and p lie in the x y plane than our cross be lies along

857
00:58:13.781 --> 00:58:16.390
the z axis either out at in.

858
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:20.770
That is why both target and angular momentum,

859
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:25.890
we're treated a scalers and not as vectors because if a vector is constraint the

860
00:58:26.161 --> 00:58:29.260
light up or down the Z axis,
you can forget about the factors that vector.

861
00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.110
We just say it's plus if it's up in minus,
if it's done.

862
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:35.860
That's why in all the early calculations they did today,
but torques,

863
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:39.550
it was treated as a scalar but actually the park was a vector coming out of the

864
00:58:39.551 --> 00:58:41.110
blackboard or going into the blackboard.

865
00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:46.270
Next I was showing you that the angular momentum you get by this definition when

866
00:58:46.271 --> 00:58:51.271
applied to a rigid body to a tiny speck on at a did body is the same as the

867
00:58:51.281 --> 00:58:52.510
angular momentum we've been using.

868
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:57.070
But now I want you to think about the following note.
Here's the x,

869
00:58:57.071 --> 00:59:00.400
y plane seen from the top.
That is somebody that is rotating,

870
00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:02.620
that's the SPEC on their body,

871
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:07.470
which one was the angular momentum written as our cross be was Iomega,

872
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:12.340
but the SPEC now flies off,
breaks loose and takes off.

873
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.030
That's it.
Still have angular momentum.
If you're doing great body dynamics,

874
00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.940
you may not be so sure whether or not it as anger moment because angular

875
00:59:22.941 --> 00:59:26.900
momentum we think of as coming from going round and round something.
Well,

876
00:59:26.901 --> 00:59:28.280
this guy's not going around anything,

877
00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:31.340
right because it's been liberated is taking off like this.

878
00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:36.060
But if you take my definition that angular momentum is our cross Spi,

879
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:40.730
you'll find that it has angular monitoring even when it's here or there or

880
00:59:40.731 --> 00:59:43.550
anywhere else,
and in fact it's the same angular momentum.

881
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:49.410
I wanted to tell you why when you are here,
let,
let's take it and epsilon,

882
00:59:49.411 --> 00:59:53.580
before it took off from this rigid body,
it was still stuck to the rigid body.

883
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:55.650
There's the momentum was in this direction.

884
00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:01.220
Our was in this direction and the angular momentum was our times is momentum p

885
01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:03.270
<v 2>okay,</v>

886
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:07.110
<v 0>what,
what vendors come here when it's come their artists is bigger.</v>

887
01:00:07.111 --> 01:00:11.970
Vector R P is the same.
Vector p is going at a constant speed.
I don't know,

888
01:00:11.971 --> 01:00:12.804
forces on it.

889
01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:18.270
Has the angular momentum changed because the artists become bigger?

890
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:23.310
But we don't want this art time speed.
If we want our time,
speed,
time,

891
01:00:23.311 --> 01:00:27.630
sine theta,
but our Tatum is in fact,

892
01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:33.240
um,
Saudi Theta is the angle between p and r are Saint Tita is that perpendicular

893
01:00:33.241 --> 01:00:35.660
distance?
That is not changing.

894
01:00:37.770 --> 01:00:41.410
Then maybe I'll draw a better figure so you understand what I mean.
Uh,

895
01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:44.130
take a body in the x,
y plane.

896
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.790
It had just moving like this at constant momentum.

897
01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.700
What does angular momentum is what we're asking.

898
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.420
The easiest time to complete the Agora momentum is when it's here.

899
01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:02.550
Then the angular momentum is that distance r times the moment than p time signed

900
01:01:02.551 --> 01:01:06.960
up 90 which is one
if you are over here,

901
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:08.743
<v 2>yes.</v>

902
01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:11.360
<v 0>Then what happens is p is still the same vector.</v>

903
01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:15.440
P R looks like a longer vector but Teva here,

904
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.770
if you put it in our center is still the perpendicular distance.

905
01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.560
In other words,
the angular momentum of a particle with respect to some origin.

906
01:01:25.090 --> 01:01:25.230
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

907
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:28.320
<v 0>it's the product of the momentum times.</v>

908
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:33.500
The perpendicular distance you get by extrapolating is velocity so you can drop

909
01:01:34.861 --> 01:01:35.850
a perpendicular on it,

910
01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:41.910
draw a line through the momentum and drop a perpendicular honored from the audit

911
01:01:41.911 --> 01:01:45.040
in that distance times is momentum is the anger moment,

912
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.900
so every particle,

913
01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:57.670
unless it's going through the center of written finding and the Anglo momentum,

914
01:01:57.671 --> 01:02:01.690
we'll have an anger moment.
It doesn't have to rotate is the main point.

915
01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.140
Even a particle and a straight line as Anglo momentum,

916
01:02:05.141 --> 01:02:08.230
but I'm trying to show you the angular momentum here is not changing with time.

917
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:13.050
It's not changing because even as it moves this component of our,

918
01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.760
the art is not changing.
You can see that

919
01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:20.500
no matter where you are,
this distance is not changing.

920
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000
That's the key to the angular momentum being a constant.

921
01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.870
Alright.
No.
If you've got many,
many bodies,

922
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.200
you glue them together or they have interrupt Tomic forces and they form a rigid

923
01:02:31.201 --> 01:02:36.180
body,
then you can use Tobik wills are cross f or d and d.

924
01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:37.014
T.

925
01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:40.443
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

926
01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.590
<v 0>the l I t t is tell why I ain't got a momentum of body ice changing due to the</v>

927
01:02:45.591 --> 01:02:46.401
torque and body.

928
01:02:46.401 --> 01:02:51.401
I you add everything left hand side would be the total rate of change of angular

929
01:02:52.431 --> 01:02:55.790
momentum.
Right and side will be the total torque.

930
01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:57.383
<v 1>Yes.</v>

931
01:02:58.810 --> 01:02:58.931
<v 0>No,</v>

932
01:02:58.931 --> 01:03:03.870
the total torque on the rigid body made up of many point particles.

933
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:06.330
Even if it's not a rigid body,

934
01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:10.740
just take a bunch of bodies moving around and find the rate of change of total

935
01:03:10.741 --> 01:03:14.400
angular momentum.
That's the sum of the total torics.

936
01:03:14.401 --> 01:03:19.401
You can divide the torque into the external torque and the torque internally due

937
01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:24.480
to the forces of one part of the system on another part,
the system.

938
01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:26.043
<v 1>Okay.</v>

939
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:30.240
<v 0>Yeah.
I'm going in the same way as they did with momentum.</v>

940
01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.460
The rate of change of total momentum of a system.

941
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.840
It's the external force plus internal forces it remember the internal forces

942
01:03:36.841 --> 01:03:41.430
cancelled in pairs and therefore we could drop that and therefore rate of change

943
01:03:41.431 --> 01:03:44.670
of total moment.
There must be external force for Torque.

944
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.170
You made it like again cancelled the internal forces internal torques because

945
01:03:49.171 --> 01:03:52.710
the forces are opposite but it's not so obvious you can cancel them

946
01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:57.660
because even though the force that I exerted on you when you exert on me are

947
01:03:57.661 --> 01:04:00.210
equal and opposite to find the Torque,

948
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:04.950
you multiply the force you exert on me cross product with a distance of me from

949
01:04:04.951 --> 01:04:09.720
the origin betters with you is the distance of you from the audit so they don't

950
01:04:09.721 --> 01:04:13.830
necessarily canceling and you can show that only if the fours,

951
01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:17.130
one body et cetera on the other was in the line joining them.

952
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:20.970
Then that would cancel and angular momentum would be conserved.

953
01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:26.740
So angular momentum.
Conservation requires more than just usual momentum.

954
01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:31.770
Conservation only for the microscopic level forces that bodies exert on other

955
01:04:32.131 --> 01:04:35.730
bodies is in the line.
Joining them is angular momentum conserved.

956
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:39.720
Fortunately that turns out to be true for every force we know.
Gravitation,

957
01:04:39.721 --> 01:04:42.090
Coulomb's law,
electrostatic forces,

958
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.750
all of them had the property that a exerts a force and be in the lion joining.

959
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.980
So let's take that for granted and then do the last problem I want to do for you

960
01:04:51.991 --> 01:04:54.000
guys,
which is the gyroscope.

961
01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:57.873
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

962
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.730
<v 0>so here is the gyro.
Now again,</v>

963
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:06.480
I have to draw this gyros and other humiliating experience.

964
01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:11.481
I'm going to try to hear to say little tower on with the Gyro is supported.

965
01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.160
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

966
01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.620
<v 0>maybe we can draw it this,</v>

967
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:18.700
<v 2>uh,</v>

968
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:23.700
it's a disk in this case which is spinning like that.

969
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.810
Everybody with me now

970
01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:30.820
that is a little tower on the apex of that.

971
01:05:30.821 --> 01:05:35.821
You take a massless rod if you like for the Gyro here and first of all suppose

972
01:05:35.911 --> 01:05:39.550
is not spinning.
I'm going to,

973
01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:42.190
I'm holding it here and I'm going to let go.

974
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.440
What's going to happen to the Gyro is what we are asked.
Gyro is not spinning.

975
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:50.190
Everybody should know.

976
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:53.530
You don't need physics 200 or 100 at anything to know what's going to happen.

977
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.030
You let it go.
It's going to fall.

978
01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.820
We want to make sure that agrees with the equation that we have.

979
01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:03.310
How we can tie alpha.
Well,

980
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:07.960
the torque on this gyro is because the mass of the rod has no mass.

981
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:10.870
The disc which is sitting there has a mass mg,

982
01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:15.910
so torque is equal to mg times l where l is the length of his rod.

983
01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:18.130
That'll produce an IOL phone.

984
01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:24.400
But let's do the Torque is a vector.
Yeah.

985
01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:28.720
<v 0>What is the vector torque?
I want you guys to think about that.</v>

986
01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:34.000
Here is are the vector r looks like this,
right horizontal.

987
01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:38.590
The vector mg looks like this free as a vector,

988
01:06:40.390 --> 01:06:44.350
so our cross f which is really not MDL,

989
01:06:44.351 --> 01:06:47.500
but our cross f is the gentle formula be to reduce the stream GL.

990
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:52.570
Now do the screwdriver rule from art to AMG.
It goes into the board.

991
01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:58.000
So we say the angular momentum of this rod gets an increment pointing into the

992
01:06:58.001 --> 01:07:00.010
board,
which would be very,

993
01:07:00.011 --> 01:07:03.010
very clear that when angular momentum points into the board doesn't mean the

994
01:07:03.011 --> 01:07:04.270
Gyro goes into the board.

995
01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.660
It just means the access around with the Jadah rotates is pointing into the

996
01:07:07.661 --> 01:07:10.450
board.
It's another way of saying it rotates like that.

997
01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:16.310
So data will pick up an Alpha,
which we also assign as going into the board.

998
01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.360
It'll just fall down.

999
01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:22.220
So if you take a gyro and it doesn't occur to you to spend the Gyro,

1000
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:25.850
you might as well get a piece of stick with an orange at the end.

1001
01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:30.800
What makes it interesting is the following fact,
you can spin the gyro now.

1002
01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:32.780
Now it's a different ballgame.

1003
01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.620
Suppose the Gyro now has an initial anger moment.

1004
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.810
Which way is it pointing?
It was the first thing you gotta understand.

1005
01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.330
This is a spinning disk.

1006
01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:48.890
Every part of it is spinning and the angular momentum,
every part,

1007
01:07:48.891 --> 01:07:51.170
if you do our cross people all point outside.

1008
01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.770
So one way to find the angular momentum of a spinning disk is to have your

1009
01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:57.380
fingers curl along that add extra rotation.

1010
01:07:57.620 --> 01:08:01.250
The thumb points in the direction of Anglo moment today I know has an angular

1011
01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:02.720
momentum l pointing that way.

1012
01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:05.850
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1013
01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:09.450
<v 0>Let me look at the top view of this gyro.
The top view of the Gyro is like this.</v>

1014
01:08:09.451 --> 01:08:10.710
This is the top of the tower.

1015
01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:16.100
It's my gyro in spinning as seen from the top like this and has got an angular

1016
01:08:17.151 --> 01:08:19.040
momentum l in this direction.

1017
01:08:23.190 --> 01:08:24.660
Good.
This is a pretty dicey thing.

1018
01:08:24.661 --> 01:08:26.400
So you might have to go home and read it again.

1019
01:08:26.401 --> 01:08:28.260
I don't know how much I can do right now,

1020
01:08:29.130 --> 01:08:33.330
but now let us look at the impact of the gravitational torque.

1021
01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:38.930
That angular momentum change Delta l is it going to tout times the time Delta t

1022
01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.360
we agreed was going into the blackboard.

1023
01:08:43.530 --> 01:08:48.530
That means this l is getting real contribution delta l in that direction and

1024
01:08:49.681 --> 01:08:52.710
that just means the data is going to come to that location.

1025
01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.990
So what happens is if you have an l to begin with,

1026
01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:02.330
you ad with a Delta l like this,
you get the new LPS,

1027
01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:04.890
Delta l which is just the rotated l.

1028
01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:11.830
That's the way the gyro doesn't fall.
It does get an Ng.

1029
01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:16.370
See for static rod got an angular momentum going into the board.

1030
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.010
It read me really means is falling down like this,

1031
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:24.110
but if a rotating Jadah got an angular momentum on top of an existing angular

1032
01:09:24.111 --> 01:09:27.440
momentum,
the new angular momentum is now just a rotated angular moment.

1033
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:29.270
So when seen from the top,

1034
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:33.890
because I know we'll be doing what's called a precession,
if you support it,

1035
01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.250
you'll just slowly go round and round with the stip here.

1036
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:44.410
Where does this remind you of anything you've seen before?
Yup.

1037
01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:49.170
Uh Huh.
Right when we did the earth rotating around the sun out,

1038
01:09:49.171 --> 01:09:53.400
any satellite going around it was the same thing here.
An apple,

1039
01:09:53.790 --> 01:09:54.750
if it's not moving,

1040
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:58.830
the force of gravity acts on it costs us an acceleration towards the center.

1041
01:09:59.430 --> 01:10:02.310
That means what you,
and I think it means falling toward the center,

1042
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:07.200
but if you take an apple with a huge velocity to begin with,

1043
01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:11.220
I had to wait an acceleration towards the center or a tiny increment of velocity

1044
01:10:11.221 --> 01:10:14.400
in this direction.
We just give it that velocity.

1045
01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:19.110
That's the velocity it has when it does come here.
Same thing with the gyro.

1046
01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:22.860
The data desk get the same angular momentum,

1047
01:10:22.890 --> 01:10:25.950
Delta l that it would whether or not it was rotating,

1048
01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:30.120
but in one case you added the zero and conclude it's going to fall down.

1049
01:10:30.490 --> 01:10:33.270
Other case you added twoL and controlled that it'll rotate.

1050
01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:38.280
So dado is constantly trying to fall down but it's chasing itself just like this

1051
01:10:38.281 --> 01:10:41.070
is constantly trying to fall down and changing itself.

1052
01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.950
So last thing I wanted calculate is the rate at which it goes round and round.

1053
01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:49.950
It's pretty easy calculation.
I will do that and I will let you go.

1054
01:10:50.850 --> 01:10:51.451
So let's ask,

1055
01:10:51.451 --> 01:10:56.451
the following question is a general was angular momentum l little later l plus

1056
01:10:58.741 --> 01:11:01.500
Delta l looks like that this is Delta l

1057
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.360
and it rotates an angle.
Delta Theta,

1058
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.240
sometimes Delta t.

1059
01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.310
Then just from the radiums business you've learned,

1060
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.780
I think you guys know the Delta l is l time Delta Theta.
If data isn't radio,

1061
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:22.080
that's why I'm cautioning you always thinking radians.

1062
01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:24.750
So if you rotate the vector Ben Angle,
Delta Theta,

1063
01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:28.590
that segment for small in the segment is El Delta table.

1064
01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:32.190
So they might both sites by the time over which happens.

1065
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:35.223
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1066
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:40.910
<v 0>Delta Airlines or Delta t on the left hand side is the Torque and this is l</v>

1067
01:11:42.361 --> 01:11:46.200
times watch called the precessional frequency Omega sub p.

1068
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.750
That's what we are trying to calculate.

1069
01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:54.650
So the precessional frequency in this problem is equal to the torque divided by

1070
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.480
angular momentum of the gyro.

1071
01:12:01.690 --> 01:12:05.560
The torque.
Now we can put the numbers in his AMG times.

1072
01:12:05.561 --> 01:12:07.540
L Anglo momentum.

1073
01:12:07.541 --> 01:12:11.740
The gyro is some one half Iomega square one half.
I'm sorry,

1074
01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.670
Time's Iomega.

1075
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:22.321
Okay,

1076
01:12:22.321 --> 01:12:26.700
so this is unfortunately we don't have the ability to demonstrate anything in

1077
01:12:26.701 --> 01:12:30.660
this room.
But if you looked at the stuff we have in Sloan,

1078
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.990
if you take a big gyro and you spin it,

1079
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.650
you suspend one and on the tip of a tower and it's spinning like this,

1080
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.980
you are some weight to it.
We'll find a stodge going around.

1081
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.750
The data is not spinning,
it'll just fall down.
If it's spinning,

1082
01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:49.260
it's got an angular momentum in that direction to which it gets an increment in

1083
01:12:49.261 --> 01:12:53.850
that direction.
So it goes on rotating,
and if you add more weights,
the gyro,

1084
01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.160
it'll rotate faster because if you add more weights,

1085
01:12:56.190 --> 01:12:59.090
the gyro besides its own mass,
you will increase this quantity.

1086
01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:06.030
All right,
so we are done with the nasty parts.

1087
01:13:06.031 --> 01:13:10.890
The next week we start relativity so that you guys can get something more

1088
01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:11.520
contemporary.
