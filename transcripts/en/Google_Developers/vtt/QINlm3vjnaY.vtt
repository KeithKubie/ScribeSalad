00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:02.220
PETE LEPAGE: You've
found the perfect image

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.950
for your responsive site.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.210
It looks great on
desktop but loses its awe

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.130
when viewed on a phone.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.410
Between the change in
orientation and the smaller

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.920
screen, all of the fine detail
becomes impossible to see.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.500
Displaying different images
based on device characteristics

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.260
is called art direction.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.180
And the picture element was
designed exactly for this.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.840
Inside is a list of source tags.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.130
Each source tag includes a
set of rules and the image

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.290
to use when those rules are met.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.030
You also need to
include an image tag.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.400
The browser enumerates
the list of sources

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.740
and checks the rules.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.930
As soon as it gets a match,
it'll use that image.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.030
If no source tags are matched
or if picture isn't supported,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.850
the browser uses the
image tag-- perfect

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.230
for backwards compatibility.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.000
Let's take a look
at this in action.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.830
The first source tag
specifies a media query

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.540
and checks if the browser
width is over 800 pixels.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.830
If it is, the full
size image is used.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.470
But if the first source
tag was not matched,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.010
the next one is checked,
testing if the browser

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.660
width is greater
than 400 pixels.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.620
If it is, the browser
will use that image.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.390
When the browser width
is less than 400 pixels

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.030
or the picture element
isn't supported,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.960
the browser uses the image
specified by the image tag.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.040
Styling the picture
element is done

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.330
by applying CSS to the image
tag, not the picture element

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.580
itself.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.700
This is also where you
should specify the alt

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.870
text and any other
attributes that are needed.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.810
There you go.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.530
You now know how
to use the picture

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.580
element for art direction.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.200
The picture element is
only supported natively

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.590
in Chrome 38.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.550
But other browser vendors have
committed to implementing it.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.860
You can use it knowing that
you won't break older browsers

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.890
or grab Picture Fill, a library
for supporting older browsers.
