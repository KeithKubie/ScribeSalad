00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.210
The purpose of this
video is to just begin

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.860
to appreciate how vast and
enormous the universe is.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.147
And frankly, our brains
really can't grasp it.

00:00:09.147 --> 00:00:11.230
What we'll see in this
video is that we can't even

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.564
grasp things that are
actually super small compared

00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:14.730
to the size of the universe.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.230
And we actually
don't even know what

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.890
the entire size of
the universe is.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.306
But with that said,
let's actually

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:21.750
just try to appreciate
how small we are.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.900
So this is me right over here.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.850
I am 5 foot 9 inches, depending
on whether I'm wearing shoes--

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.377
maybe 5 foot 10 with shoes.

00:00:30.377 --> 00:00:32.460
But for the sake of this
video, let's just roughly

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.960
approximate around 6
feet, or around roughly--

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.160
I'm not to go into the details
of the math-- around 2 meters.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.620
Now, if I were to lie
down 10 times in a row,

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.480
you'd get about the
length of an 18-wheeler.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.020
That's about 60 feet long.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.770
So this is times 10.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.550
Now, if you were to put an
18-wheeler-- if you were

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.560
to make it tall, as opposed to
long-- somehow stand it up--

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.500
and you were to do
that 10 times in a row,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.330
you'll get to the height of
roughly a 60-story skyscraper.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.200
So once again, if you took me
and you piled me up 100 times,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.990
you'll get about a
60-story skyscraper.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.200
Now, if you took that
skyscraper and if you

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.430
were to lie it down
10 times in a row,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.900
you'd get something of the
length of the Golden Gate

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.400
Bridge.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.970
And once again, I'm not
giving you the exact numbers.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.760
It's not always going
to be exactly 10.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.718
But we're now getting to
about something that's

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.375
a little on the
order of a mile long.

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:30.750
So the Golden Gate Bridge is
actually longer than a mile.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.450
But if you go within the twin
spans, it's roughly about

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.950
a mile.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.616
It's actually a little
longer than that.

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:37.630
But that gives you
a sense of a mile.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.110
Now, if you multiply
that by 10, you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.180
get to the size of a large city.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.730
And this right here is
a satellite photograph

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.120
of San Francisco.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.670
This is the actual
Golden Gate Bridge here.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.920
And when I copy and
pasted this picture,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.670
I tried to make it roughly
10 miles by 10 miles

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.299
just so you
appreciate the scale.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.840
And what's interesting here--
and this picture's interesting.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.361
Because this is the first
time we can relate to cities.

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:04.110
But when you look at
a city on this scale,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.580
it's starting to
get larger than what

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.844
we're used to processing
on a daily basis.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.260
A bridge-- we've
been on a bridge.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.635
We know what a
bridge looks like.

00:02:12.635 --> 00:02:14.360
We know that a bridge is huge.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.910
But it doesn't
feel like something

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.000
that we can't comprehend.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.090
Already, a city is
something that we

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.706
can't comprehend all at once.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:21.830
We can drive across a city.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.480
We can look at
satellite imagery.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.010
But if I were to
show a human on this,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.404
it would be unbelievably,
unbelievably small.

00:02:28.404 --> 00:02:30.070
You wouldn't actually
be able to see it.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.320
It would be less than
a pixel on this image.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.380
A house is less than
a pixel on this image.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.820
But let's keep
multiplying by 10.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.820
If you multiply by 10
again, you get to something

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.620
roughly the size of the
San Francisco Bay Area.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.940
This whole square over here
is roughly that square right

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.720
over there.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.080
Let's multiply by 10 again.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.040
So this square is about
100 miles by 100 miles.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.640
So this one would be about
1,000 miles by 1,000 miles.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.830
And now you're including a
big part of the Western United

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.580
States.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.270
You have California here.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.340
You Nevada here.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.330
You have Arizona
and New Mexico--

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.730
so a big chunk of a
big continent we're

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.670
already including.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.530
And frankly, this
is beyond the scale

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.234
that we're used to operating.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.400
We've seen maps, so maybe
we're a little used to it.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.240
But if you ever had to walk
across this type of distance,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.640
it would take you a while.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.560
To some degree, the fact that
planes goes so fast-- almost

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.680
unimaginably fast
for us-- that it's

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.130
made it feel like things like
continents aren't as big.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.450
Because you can fly across
them in five or six hours.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.800
But these are already
huge, huge, huge distances.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.460
But once again, you
take this square

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.470
that's about 1,000
miles by 1,000 miles,

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.190
and you multiply that by 10.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.760
And you get pretty
close-- a little bit

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.149
over-- the diameter of
the Earth-- a little bit

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:47.440
over the diameter of the Earth.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.380
But once again,
we're on the Earth.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.520
We kind of relate to the Earth.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.610
If you look carefully
at the horizon,

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.360
you might see a little
bit of a curvature,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.550
especially if you were
to get into the plane.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.250
So even though this
is, frankly, larger

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.260
than my brain can
really grasp, we

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.360
can kind of relate to the Earth.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.290
Now you multiply the
diameter of Earth times 10.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.930
And you get to the
diameter of Jupiter.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.160
And so if you were to sit
Earth right next to Jupiter--

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.310
obviously, they're
nowhere near that close.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.677
That would destroy
both of the planets.

00:04:21.677 --> 00:04:23.510
Actually, it would
definitely destroy Earth.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.640
It would probably just
be merged into Jupiter.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.080
So if you put Earth
next to Jupiter,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.010
it would look something
like that right over there.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.010
So I would say that Jupiter is
definitely-- on this diagram

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.660
that I'm drawing
here-- is definitely

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.290
the first thing that I
have I can't comprehend.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.820
The Earth, itself,
is so vastly huge.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.580
Jupiter is-- it's 10
times bigger in diameter.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.372
It's much larger in terms
of mass, and volume,

00:04:52.372 --> 00:04:53.080
and all the rest.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.190
But just in terms of diameter,
it is 10 times bigger.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.360
But let's keep going.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.420
10 times Jupiter
gets us to the sun.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.220
This is times 10.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.010
So if this is the Sun-- and
if I were to draw Jupiter,

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.530
it would look
something like-- I'll

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.300
do Jupiter in pink-- Jupiter
would be around that big.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.282
And then the Earth
would be around that big

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:19.240
if you were to put them
all next to each other.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.510
So the Sun, once again, is huge.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.050
Even though we see
it almost every day,

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.140
it is unimaginably huge.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.490
Even the Earth is
unimaginably huge.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.380
And the Sun is 100 times
more unimaginably bigger.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.710
Now we're going to start getting
really, really, really wacky.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.280
You multiply the diameter
of the Sun, which is already

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.050
100 times the diameter
of the Earth-- you

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.740
multiply that times 100.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.940
And that is the distance
from the Earth to the Sun.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.080
So I've drawn the Sun
here as a little pixel.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.940
And I didn't even draw
the Earth as a pixel.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.650
Because a pixel would
be way too large.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.660
It would have to be a
hundredth of a pixel

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.830
in order to draw
the Earth properly.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.270
So this is a
unbelievable distance

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.160
between the Earth and the Sun.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.080
It's 100 times the distance of
the diameter of the Sun itself.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.610
So it's massive, massive.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.080
But once again, these
things are relatively close

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.430
compared to where
we're about to go.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.040
Because if we want to get to
the nearest star-- so remember,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.520
the Sun is 100 times the
diameter of the Earth.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.020
The distance between the Sun
and the Earth is 100 times that.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.610
Or you could say it's
10,000 times the diameter

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.250
of the Earth.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.690
So these are
unimaginable distances.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.500
But to get to the nearest star,
which is 4.2 light years away,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.360
it's 200,000 times-- and
once again, unimaginable.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.680
It's 200,000 times the distance
between the Earth and the Sun.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:59.240
And to give you a rough sense of
how far apart these things are,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.510
if the Sun was roughly
the size of a basketball--

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.920
if the average star was about
the size of a basketball--

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.310
in our part of the galaxy in a
volume the size of the Earth--

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.380
so if you had a big volume
the size of the Earth,

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.390
if the stars were the
sizes of basketballs,

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.770
in our part of the
galaxy, you would only

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.840
have a handful of
basketballs per that volume.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.210
So unbelievably sparse.

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.760
Even though, when you
look at the galaxy--

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.740
and this is just an
artist's depiction of it--

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.325
it looks like something
that has the spray of stars,

00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:35.240
and it looks
reasonably dense, there

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.140
is actually a huge
amount of space

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.890
that the great, great,
great, great, great majority

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:46.096
of the volume in the galaxy
is just empty, empty space.

00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:49.510
There's no stars, no
planets, no nothing.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.970
I mean, this is a huge jump
that I'm talking about.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.130
And then if you
really want to realize

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.820
how large a galaxy,
itself, can be,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.380
you take this distance
between the Sun,

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.860
or between our solar system
and the nearest star--

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.080
so that's 200,000 times the
distance between the Earth

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.452
and the Sun-- and you multiply
that distance by 25,000.

00:08:10.452 --> 00:08:16.660
So if the Sun is right
here, our nearest star

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.030
will be in that same pixel.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.370
They'll actually be
within-- you'd actually

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.780
get a ton of stars
within that one pixel,

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.800
even though they're
so far apart.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.010
And then this whole thing
is 100,000 light years.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:33.059
It's 25,000 times the
distance than the distance

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.830
between the Sun and
the nearest star.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.100
So we're talking about
unimaginable, unfathomable

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.740
distances, just for a galaxy.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.880
And now we're going
to get our-- frankly,

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.040
my brain is already
well beyond anything

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.380
that it can really process.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.940
At this point, it almost just
becomes abstract thinking.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.760
It just becomes playing with
numbers and mathematics.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.817
But to get a sense of
the universe, itself,

00:08:58.817 --> 00:09:00.900
the observable universe--
and we have to be clear.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.274
Because we can
only observe light

00:09:02.274 --> 00:09:06.010
that started leaving from its
source 13.7 billion years ago.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.340
Because that's how
old the universe is.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.190
The observable universe is about
93 billion light years across.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.780
And the reason why it's
larger than 13.7 billion

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.750
is that the points
in space that emitted

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.960
light 13.7 billion
years ago, those

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.330
have been going away from us.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.200
So now they're on the order of
40 billion light years away.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.120
But this isn't about cosmology.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.120
This is just about
scale and appreciating

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.930
how huge the universe is.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.770
Just in the part of the universe
that we can theoretically

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:43.180
observe, you have to get--
and that we can observe,

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.300
just because we're getting
electromagnetic radiation

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.510
from those parts
of the universe--

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:52.260
you would have to
multiply this number.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.343
So let me make this clear.

00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:55.875
100,000 light years-- that's
the diameter of the Milky Way.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.530
You would have to
multiply not by 1,000.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:10.440
1,000 would get you to
100 million light years.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.220
This is 100,000 times
1,000 is 100 million.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:18.120
You have to multiply
by 1,000 again

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.034
to get to 100
billion light years.

00:10:21.034 --> 00:10:22.450
And the universe,
for all we know,

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.450
might be much, much,
much, much, larger.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.620
It might even be infinite.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.850
Who knows?

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:32.440
But to get from just the
diameter of the Milky Way

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.620
to the observable universe, you
have to multiply by a million.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.670
And already, this is an
unfathomable distance.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.360
So in the whole
scheme of things,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.450
not only are we pretty small,
and not only are the things

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:51.180
we build pretty small, and not
only is our planet ultra small,

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.200
and not only is our
Sun ultra small,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.330
and our solar
system ultra small,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.370
but our galaxy is
really nothing compared

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.110
to the vastness of the universe.
