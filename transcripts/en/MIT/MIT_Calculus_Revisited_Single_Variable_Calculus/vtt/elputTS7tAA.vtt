HERBERT GROSS: Hi, our lecture
today is entitled inverse

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.510
functions, and it's almost what
you could call a natural

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.280
follow-up to our lecture of
last time when we talked

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.220
briefly about 1:1 and
onto functions.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.100
Inverse functions have a
tremendous application as we

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.430
progress through calculus, but
of even more exciting impact

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.320
is the fact that inverse
functions are valuable in

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.340
their own right.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.760
They are a pre-calculus topic.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.110
In fact, they appear as early
in the curriculum as

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.560
approximately the first grade.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.580
See roughly speaking, inverse
functions in plain English,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.680
mean that all we've done is
made a switch in emphasis.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.600
Let's take a look at that.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.980
Let's go back roughly to our
first grade curriculum when

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.760
one learns that 2 plus
3 equals 5, or that 5

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.990
minus 3 equals 2.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.820
Both of these statements say
the same thing, but with a

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.340
change in emphasis.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.020
It's as if 2 is being emphasized
here while 5 is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.770
being emphasized here.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.220
This is rather interesting
you see.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.740
For example, in the new
mathematics, one talks about

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.530
subtraction being the
inverse of addition.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.470
And this is the same inverse
that we want to talk about

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.540
today as it applies to
mathematics in general.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.410
What do we that subtraction is
the inverse of addition?

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.790
It may sound fancy, but all it
means is that if you know how

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.650
to add, if you define
subtraction properly, you

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.920
automatically know
how to subtract.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.910
And this, of course, is what's
prevalent in the old

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.940
change-making technique of going
into a store, making a

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.100
purchase, paying for the
purchase, and when you receive

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.420
your change, the clerk rarely,
if ever, performs subtraction.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.280
You may recall that what he
does is he adds onto the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.590
amount of the purchase the
amount necessary to make up

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.450
the denomination of the bill
with which you paid him.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.120
In other words, what we're
saying here is, for example,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.910
that one may think of 5
minus 3 as being what?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.070
That number, which must be
added onto 3 to give 5.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.420
You see, in this sense,
subtraction is

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.130
the inverse of addition.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.770
Once we know how to add, we

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.860
automatically know how to subtract.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.110
Now you see, this idea
goes with us.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.450
We learned that multiplication
and division are inverses of

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.160
one another.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.200
And as we go on through higher
mathematics, even on the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.570
pre-calculus level, we find
additional examples of this.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.340
For example, when one knows
how to use exponents, one

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.230
automatically knows how
to study logarithms.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.380
Namely, if y equals the log of
x to the base b, this is a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.330
synonym for saying that
b to the y equals x.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.360
And what is the basic difference
between these two

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.270
statements?

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.170
They are paraphrases
of one another.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.160
In one case it seems that the
number y is being emphasized

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.630
and in the other case it's
the number x that's being

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.610
emphasized.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.460
And as in the case of most
examples of paraphrasing,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.970
which of the two forms we use
depends on what problem it is

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.570
that we're trying to solve.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.960
In other words, if we know
one of these two, then we

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.260
automatically can study the
other in terms of the one with

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.900
which we feel more familiar.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.420
This, of course, continues when
one gets to trigonometry

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.330
and studies the so-called
inverse

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.830
trigonometric functions.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.280
If y equals the inverse sine of
x that's the same thing as

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.840
saying that x equals sine y.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.930
Again, what is the
basic difference?

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.580
In one case, it seems that
y is being emphasized.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.930
In the other case, it's x
that's being emphasized.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.680
In terms of the usual calculus
jargon of independent variable

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.370
versus dependent variable
it appears that what?

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.839
In one case, x is the
independent variable, y the

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.010
dependent variable.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.890
In the other case, y is the
independent variable, x the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.350
dependent variable.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.850
To generalize this result what
we're saying is simply this.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.740
If y equals f of x, you see
where y is being emphasized,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.170
the dependent variable.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.780
If we wish to switch the
emphasis, then we write x

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.290
equals f inverse of y.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.850
This is read f inverse of y and
it's the function which in

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.750
a sense, inverts the
roles of x and y.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.540
Let's see what this means more
explicitly in terms of a

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.660
particular example.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.220
Let's suppose that we're
given the equation y

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.040
equals 2x minus 7.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.230
Or to represent this somewhat
more abstractly, y equals f of

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.800
x where f of x is 2x minus 7.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.870
Now you see, without mentioning
the word inverse

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.970
function, it turns out that
early in our high school

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.640
career we were finding inverse
functions as soon as, for

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.750
example, someone were to give us
this problem and say solve

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.160
for x in terms of y.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.640
Solve for x in terms of y.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.820
You see, if we solve for x in
terms of y, we now have what?

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.490
x is being emphasized.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.940
These two statements tell
us the same thing.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.640
But now we write what? x
equals f inverse of y.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.920
And f inverse of y is just
y plus 7 over 2.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.490
Notice again the connection
between f inverse and f.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.460
How one undoes the other.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.240
In terms of our function machine
idea, what we're

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.370
saying is we may visualize the f
machine whereby the input is

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.220
x and the output will
be twice x minus 7.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.420
In other words, the output
will always be twice

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.460
the input minus 7.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.990
Now the question that comes up
is, suppose we reverse the

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.600
roles of the output
and the input.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.560
In other words, suppose now we
let the input be y, what will

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.160
the output be?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.440
If we reverse the terminal so
to speak, what we have shown

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.050
is that now the f inverse
machine would be what?

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.400
The input is y, the output
is y plus 7 over 2.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.670
And by the way, a question that
we shall come back to

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.080
very shortly that plays a rather
important role here and

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.740
which I'll emphasize from
another point of view is that

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.440
if you get into the idea of
always wanting to call the

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.110
input x and the output y, which
is how we get geared to

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.130
do things in terms
of calculus.

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.430
x is always the horizontal axis,
y the vertical axis, and

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.120
we always agree to plot
the independent

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.560
variable along the x-axis.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.240
In other words, the input along
the x-axis, the output

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.520
along the y-axis.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.360
Then the question is, could we
have called this x and called

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.810
this x plus 7 over 2?

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.480
And we'll go with this in more
detail in a little while.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.640
But obviously, what we call the
name of the input should

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.380
not affect how the
machine behaves.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.870
By the way, as a little aside,
I thought it might be

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.100
interesting to show why we use
such notation as f inverse.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.600
f to the minus 1.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.170
It's rather interesting here.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:37.320
Let's suppose we let a number
go into the f machine.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.810
Call that number c.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.120
Notice that any number that goes
into the f machine has as

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:46.470
its output twice that
number minus 7.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:51.470
Suppose we now let that number
be the input of the f inverse

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.950
machine, what does the
f inverse machine do?

00:07:54.950 --> 00:08:03.030
It adds 7 onto any input and
then divides that result by 2.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.420
In other words, if we now run
2c minus 7 through the f

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:13.360
inverse machine, we have
2c minus 7 plus 7

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.480
over 2 equals c.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.260
In other words, notice how
the f inverse machine

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.420
undoes the f machine.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.370
If we wanted to use the language
of last time in terms

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.250
of composition of functions,
what we do is what?

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:36.980
What we're saying is that if
you combine f followed by f

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:42.980
inverse, f inverse following f,
that that gives you what we

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.000
can call the identity
function.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.400
The identity function.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.310
Namely, if the input is c, the
output will again be c.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:09:00.610
In other words, f inverse of f
of c is just c back again.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.090
In a similar way, notice that
we can reverse these roles.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.290
We saw last time that
composition of functions

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.620
depends on which order you
combine the functions.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.500
But notice that if you run d
through the f inverse machine,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.470
the output will be
d plus 7 over 2.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.900
If this becomes the input of the
f machine, remember what

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.290
the f machine does.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.740
It doubles the input
and subtracts 7.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.190
In other words, again,
f of f inverse of d

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.250
gives me d back again.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.600
In other words, in terms of
composition of functions, f

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:41.200
followed by f inverse or f
inverse followed by f is what

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.520
we call the identity function.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.220
That one is truly the inverse
of the other from that

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.750
particular point of view.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.120
However, let's correlate what
we're talking about now with

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.960
the circle diagrams that we
used in our last lecture.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.200
You see, first of all, let's
recall that unless our

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.270
function is both 1:1
and onto, we do not

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.130
have an inverse function.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.490
Namely, for example, if our
function had not been onto,

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.800
then when we--

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.900
see, here's the idea again.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.400
Let me make sure
this is clear.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.270
To get an inverse function,
essentially all we do is this.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.680
If f is a function from A to
B, the inverse function is

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.530
defined by reversing the
input and the output.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.330
Which means in terms of this
diagram, we reverse the sense

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.340
of our arrows.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.430
We reverse which end the
arrowhead goes on.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.490
And what we're saying is, if we
had a function from A to B,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.860
which was not onto, then you
see when we reverse the

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.870
arrowheads, f is not defined
on all of b.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.860
In other words, the domain of
f, the domain of the inverse

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.880
function, would not exist
because it would not be

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.490
defined on all of B.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:59.380
Secondly, if two different
elements of A went into the

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.840
same element of B when we
reversed the arrowheads, the

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.570
resulting function would
not be single-valued.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.890
And hence, in terms of modern
mathematics, it would not be a

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:11.680
well defined function.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.290
So in other words, for the
inverse to exist it must be

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.590
that the original function
is both 1:1 and onto.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.790
And as an example of that, this
is what this diagram here

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:23.780
represents.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.140
And to make sure that we can
read this all right, I have

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.440
singled out a typical element
of capital A, a typical

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.740
element of capital B. Remember
what our notation is.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.390
The notation is that
f of a equals b.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.110
That the image of
a under f is b.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.700
And to use that in terms of
the inverse language, if I

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.340
called g the function that
I get when I reversed the

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.140
arrowheads, g of b equals a.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.870
And g is what I'm calling
f inverse.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.200
By way of further review, the
domain of f is equal to the

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.780
image of f inverse.

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.750
And that's A. The image
of f is the same as

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.820
the domain of f inverse.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.180
And that's B.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.300
And now, what the question
is, is this.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:08.850
Notice that as long as you want
to use the same diagram,

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.180
all we have to do to express f
inverse in terms of f is sort

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.350
of to reverse the arrowheads.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.150
The question that comes up is,
suppose you insist that the

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.550
domain be listed first.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.030
In other words, when we're going
to talk about g or f

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.890
inverse in this case, that's a
function from B to A. So why

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.720
don't we list B first

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.640
And you see again,
we can do this.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.050
Here are the elements of B, here
are the elements of A.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:42.250
And all we have to do is see
what happens over here.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.510
For example, if we come back to
here notice that the first

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:50.830
element listed in B comes from
the third element listed in A.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.120
So when I make up the inverse
function, I just capitalize on

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.740
this by writing the
same thing.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.290
The only problem is--

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.430
and this is going to become
a crucial one--

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.880
is the fact that if somehow or
other you couldn't see these

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.640
labels, if you couldn't see
these labels and all you knew

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.170
was that the first set was
called the domain and the

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.090
second set was called
the image.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.760
If you now looked at these two
functions, you see they

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.470
wouldn't look anything
at all alike.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.910
In other words, f and f inverse,
while not independent

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:26.330
of one another, do look
quite different.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.370
For example, notice that f
inverse causes the first two

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.320
elements in here to sort of
crisscross as they have

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.070
images, and the second two
elements of here crisscross.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.870
Notice though in terms of f,
it's the second and third that

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:44.570
crisscross and the first and
fourth that don't intersect at

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:45.060
all this way.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.570
In other words, if you look at
this curve or this diagram and

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.870
compare it with this diagram,
notice that there is a

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.800
difference in what seems
to be going on.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.340
Well again, this is
quite abstract.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.020
Let's try to relate this as
much as possible to the

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.780
language of calculus and our
coordinate geometry graphing

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.790
techniques.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.080
To begin with, let's suppose
that we have a function f

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.690
whose domain is the closed
interval from a to b and whose

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.390
range is the closed interval
from to c to d.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.300
And the question that we'd like
to raise is, under what

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.580
conditions will f possess
an inverse function?

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.930
What does onto mean?

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.860
What does 1:1 mean and
things of this type?

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.720
Well, the first thing I'd like
to point out is that if the

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.780
graph y equals f of x looks
something like this.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.690
See, notice that the domain
is from a to b.

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.410
The image is from c to d.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.600
Notice the fact that we have a
break in the curve over here,

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.470
tells us that our function
is not onto.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:51.730
Namely, given this number p,
which is in our image between

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.000
c and d, there is no element
of the domain

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.720
that maps into p.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.090
So, in other words, if there is
a break in the curve, the

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.950
function is not onto
and hence, it

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.800
will not have an inverse.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.530
Now suppose there is no
break in the curve.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.870
Let's suppose now that the
curve doubles back.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.230
It comes up and doubles back.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.030
Now what my claim is is that the
function will not be 1:1.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.770
Well, how can we see that?

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.100
Pick any part where the curve
doubles back, pick a point

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.100
like this in that range.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.760
Call that point q.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.290
Noticed that q is in the
proper range of f now.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.590
y equals f of x.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:38.190
Now the question is, given the
y value of q, are there any

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.410
x-values that map
into q under y?

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.630
And the answer is
yes, there are.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.560
In fact, there are
more than one.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:51.830
Namely, notice that both f of
x1 and f of x2 equal q.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.950
In other words, in this case,
f of x1 equals f of x2, even

00:15:56.950 --> 00:16:01.080
though x1 is unequal to x2.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.090
That means that this function
is not 1:1.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:07.550
And because it's not 1:1, it
doesn't have a well defined

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.220
inverse function.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.630
Well, putting these two cases
together, what it means for

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.270
the function to be onto, what
it means for the function to

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:20.870
be 1:1, it turns out that if
our curve is unbroken, then

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:25.310
the only way our function can
have an inverse function is

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:29.350
that the curve must either
always be rising or always be

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:32.480
falling, and it can't
have a break in it.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.020
And by the way, as an aside,
let me point out here the

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.750
difference between a continuous
variable--

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.320
meaning one that's defined
on a whole interval--

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.600
and a discrete variable--

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.030
meaning where you get isolated
pieces of data.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.350
Notice, for example, if you plot
y versus x the way we do

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.480
in a lab experiment where for
a particular value of x, you

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.170
measure a value of y.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:17:00.670
Notice that the data can
double back without the

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.850
function being multi-valued.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.550
In other words, notice for
example, that even though the

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.109
curve doubles back here--

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:09.560
I can't call it a curve.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.060
The data doubles back.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.869
Notice, for example, that no two
different pieces of data

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.990
have the same y-coordinate.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.760
In other words, given this point
here as being q, there

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.280
is only one piece of
data that has its

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.319
y-coordinate equal to q.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:29.570
However, of course, keep in
mind it is possible that

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.330
another piece of data will
have the same coordinate.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.440
All I'm saying is that the
idea of whether the curve

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.130
always has to be rising or
following certainly depends on

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.120
whether you have a continuous
curve or not.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:45.820
Well, again, let's continue on
with what inverse functions

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.030
are all about.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.970
You see, this comes up with our
whole idea of why do we

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.670
make fun or why do we minimize
single-valued

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.770
functions in calculus?

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.380
And the answer is that
single-valued--

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:00.850
I'm sorry.

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:04.490
Why do we always stick to
single-valued functions and do

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.500
away with multi-valued
functions?

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.410
And the answer is if you have a
smooth curve, we can always

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.900
break down a multi-valued
function into a union of

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.370
single-valued functions.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:18.240
For example, if we take the
curve c here as being y equals

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.680
f of x, which plots like this.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.640
Notice if I take the points at
which I have vertical tangents

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.970
and break the curve up at
those particular points.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.500
In this case, I'll
get what curves?

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.910
c1, c2, and c3.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:37.070
Notice that c is the union of
c1, c2, and c3, but that each

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:43.320
of the curves c1, c2, and c3
are either always rising or

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.940
always falling.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:50.720
In a similar way, when we have
a function which doubles

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.660
back-- and by the way, notice
what the connection is between

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.870
multi-valued and not 1:1.

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.110
You see, notice that in terms
of a function versus its

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:07.040
inverse function idea, that if a
function is multi-valued the

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.140
inverse function
cannot be 1:1.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.960
In other words, the idea being
that when you interchange the

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.540
domain and the range, sort of
the curve flips over idea, all

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.660
I want you to see here
is that what?

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.720
If you're given a function which
is not single-valued, if

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.960
we take the points at which
horizontal tangents occur and

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:34.980
break down the curve like this,
we can break the curve

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.840
down into a union of
1:1 functions.

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.940
The hardship being of course,
that when you start with a

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.900
point like this, analytically
speaking, it's rather

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.170
difficult unless you invent some
scheme to know which of

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.340
the points here you want
to single out.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.090
In terms of our previous
experience, it's sort of like

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:58.320
saying to a person, I am
thinking of the angle whose

00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.820
sine is 1/2.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.010
There are, you see, infinitely
many functions whose sine is

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:04.760
equal to 1/2.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.210
Of course if we say to the
person, I am thinking of the

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.200
angle whose sine is 1/2 and the
angle is between minus 90

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.690
degrees and plus 90 degrees,
then the only possible answer

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.050
is the angle must
be 30 degrees.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.740
But notice that when you have
a function which is not

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.420
single-valued, the
inverse will be a

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.690
multi-valued function.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.180
And we'll talk more about
that in a little while.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:31.340
Again, I just want to keep this
shotgun approach going on

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.280
just what an inverse function
is in relationship to the

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.560
function itself.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.780
Again, let's look at this
more abstractly.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.710
Here I have drawn
a curve which is

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.950
continuous and always rising.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.890
So I can talk about the
inverse function.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:50.710
If the equation is y
equals f of x, the

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.110
inverse is written what?

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:54.610
x equals f inverse y.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.920
And if this seems a little bit
too abstract for you, think of

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.260
a concrete representation.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.600
Suppose the curve happened
to represent y

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.570
equals 10 to the x.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.180
Then another way of saying
the same thing would be

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:09.300
x equals log y.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.600
The convention of course here
being that you don't usually

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.000
write base 10.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.850
But we won't worry about that.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.080
You see, this is what?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:21.500
Two different ways of expressing
the same curve.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:26.210
Whether I write y equals f of
x or x equals f inverse y, I

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.010
have the same curve this way.

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:32.380
In terms of our arrows, you see
what I'm saying is, if I

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.760
start with x1, by going this
way, my function determines

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.690
the output y1.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:43.440
Inversely, if I start with y1
and reverse the arrows, I wind

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.830
up with x1.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:48.140
Again, the basic difference
being as to which of the two

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.300
variables is being emphasized.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.910
What the real problem is, is
that most people say look it.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.300
I'm not used to studying
curves this way.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.000
I'm not used to looking at the
input being along the vertical

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.820
axis and the output along the
horizontal axis according to

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.860
the way I've been trained
when we're

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.750
studying the inverse function.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.640
In other words, when y is the
input, aren't we used to

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:16.140
having y over here and
then plotting the

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.450
output along this axis?

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.540
In other words, the question
is given this graph, how do

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.240
you arrive at this one?

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.450
You see, somehow or other, let's
observe that if all you

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.990
did was switch your orientation
and say let me

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:34.890
switch this by 90 degrees,
notice that we would be in a

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.080
little bit of trouble.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.230
In other words, if we start with
this kind of a set up and

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:43.790
we say, let's rotate through
a positive 90 degrees.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.930
Notice now what we would
wind up with is what?

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.170
Our x-axis would be the way we
want it, but the y-axis would

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:54.620
now have the opposite sense of
what we usually want our input

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:55.900
axis to look like.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.840
So after we rotate through 90
degrees, it would seem that

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.560
the next step is to do what?

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:10.190
Flip with respect
to the x-axis.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:12.130
That means fold this
thing over.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.660
In other words, a 90 degree
rotation followed by a folding

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:22.840
over gives me the orientation if
I insist that the input has

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:29.420
to be along the horizontal axis
and the output along the

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.380
vertical axis.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:33.180
What I want you to also notice
though, is that if we don't

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.390
insist on this, there is no
reason why we have to use two

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.710
separate diagrams.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.230
Again notice, these are
two different ways of

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.070
giving the same --

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.040
two different equations for
giving the same curve.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.810
It's only when we want to switch
the role and make sure

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:54.930
that the input is along the
horizontal axis that we have

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:58.210
to go through this kind
of a process.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.410
Let's look at this a little
bit more concretely.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.170
What I call a semi-concrete
illustration.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.960
What I'm saying now is let's
suppose this is the curve I've

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.040
drawn in here, y
equals f of x.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.170
Another way of saying that is
x equals f inverse of y.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.450
And the question is, suppose I
now want to plot this same

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.780
curve, same equation, but now
with the y-axis as my

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.220
horizontal axis.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.330
You see again, in terms of
geometry, how I shift my axes

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.710
will not change this equation.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.560
But what the picture of this
equation looks like will

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.770
certainly depend on how
I orient my axes.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.170
So the idea is what?

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.600
I simply fold this, rotate this

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.770
thing, through 90 degrees.

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.450
And if I do that, the resulting

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.110
picture looks like this.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.170
And once the picture looks
like this, the

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.460
next step is what?

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.650
Flip this with respect
to the x-axis.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.510
And now my picture
looks like this.

00:24:56.510 --> 00:25:01.750
In other words, x equals f
inverse of y here and x equals

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:05.340
f inverse of y here are
the same equation.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.410
The reason that the picture
looks different is because I

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.080
didn't allow myself
to use this as the

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.340
axis of inputs here.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:18.490
In other words, again, as soon
as I wanted to make this axis

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.280
orient so it would be the
horizontal axis, this is what

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.300
I had to go through over here.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.060
Now you see, the next refinement
is that a person

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.640
says look it, I'm not used to
calling this the y-axis.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640
What's in a name?

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.790
Why don't we always agree to
call the horizontal axis the

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:37.370
x-axis and the vertical
axis the y-axis?

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.520
And if I agree to do that,
notice what happens just by

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.260
changing the names
of the variables.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:48.180
All that happens is, is that
now this becomes y equals f

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.440
inverse of x.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.770
This is an important thing
to notice then.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.420
In other words, if you insist
that the horizontal axis in

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.220
both cases will be called the
x-axis and the vertical axis

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:04.250
the y-axis, then this would be
the curve y equals f of x and

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:08.130
this would be the curve y
equals f inverse of x.

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.110
But again, the whole thing
comes about only when you

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.750
insist on how you want
your axes oriented.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.830
Let's go back to our problem of
y equals 2x minus 7 and see

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.140
what this thing means
in terms of a graph.

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:26.550
As we saw previously, if y
equals 2x minus 7, x is equal

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.000
to y plus 7 over 2.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.250
And the idea is what?

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.160
Let's see what this thing
really means.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.950
If I plot the straight line y
equals 2x minus 7, this is the

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.880
line that I get.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.650
Notice that as long as I'm
going to use the same

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:45.270
orientation of axes here, it
makes no difference whether I

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.560
call this line y equals 2x minus
7 or whether I call it x

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:51.650
equals y plus 7 over 2.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.450
They are two different names
for the same line.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:59.440
The problem occurs when I insist
that the independent

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.890
variable always be plotted
along the x-axis, the

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.040
horizontal axis, and the
dependent variable along the

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.070
vertical axis.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:11.170
Again, going through what we did
before, I first take this

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:15.790
thing and I rotate it through
a positive 90 degrees.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:20.360
That takes this picture and
transforms it into this one.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.600
I now take this and I flip it
with respect to the x-axis,

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.020
and that gives me this
picture here.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.380
Now what is this line here?

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.440
It's x equals y plus 7 over 2.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.880
Again, this is the same
equation as this one.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.850
The reason that the pictures
look differently is the fact

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:43.190
that we have changed the
orientation of the axis.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:47.810
Again, if we now say OK, let's
rename this the x-axis, let's

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:53.020
rename this the y-axis, then
this becomes what? y equals x

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.940
plus 7 over 2.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.840
It's in this sense that we
call this curve of this

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.760
equation and this equation here,
that these two equations

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.580
are inverses of one another.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.970
Again, in terms of what we said
before, if you pick a

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.780
particular value of x and
compute y this way, then you

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.530
apply this recipe to that.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:21.540
In other words, if you now take
twice y, twice the output

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:26.620
here, and subtract 7, your
original input returns.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.120
In other words, this
works exactly the

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.830
same as we did before.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.230
But again, the whole basic
difference is what?

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.150
How you want to orient
your axis.

00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.680
That the curves look different
because your coordinate system

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.660
is different.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.880
Of course, the interesting
question now is, if we

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.610
compared these two curves, since
the-- see, granted that

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.480
the function and its inverse are
different functions, they

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.740
are somewhat related.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.490
They're not random.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.370
How are these two
graphs related?

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.280
That might be the next natural
question to ask.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.060
If we do that, the idea
is simply this.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.060
Let's suppose we have y equals
f of x as one of our curves.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.370
The curve happens to be
invertible, meaning that f is

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.820
always rising and it's
unbroken, et cetera.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.700
The question is, if we now try
to plot y equals f inverse of

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.320
x in the same diagram.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.570
See notice now what
I'm saying.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.070
In other words, I am not
saying x equals f

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:25.150
inverse of y here.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:29.060
I'm saying suppose I have the
curve y equals f of x and also

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.620
the curve y equals
f inverse of x.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.780
How do these two curves look
with respect to an x- and

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.090
y-coordinate system?

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.450
See, let me do that part
more slowly again.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:42.700
Let me come over here
for a moment.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.580
Notice that y equals 2x minus
7 was my original curve in

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.010
what I dealt with before.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:52.200
If I want to keep the same
orientation of axis, the

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.370
inverse function we saw was
y equals x plus 7 over 2.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:58.410
The question that we're asking
quite in general, not in this

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:02.040
specific case, is how are these
two curves related?

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.370
And the solution goes
something like this.

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:08.240
Let's suppose that the
point x1, y1 belongs

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.050
to the curve c1.

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:15.690
By definition of c1, that
says that y1 is f of x1.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:19.500
By definition of inverse
function, see if y1 is f of

00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.510
x1, that means if you
interchange the input and the

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.620
output, that's another
way of saying what?

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.920
That x1 is f inverse of y1.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:36.810
In other words again, if f maps
x1 into y1, f inverse

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.230
maps y1 into x1,
by definition.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:45.970
Now you see, compare this
with the curve c2.

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.530
See, this says what?

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:54.690
That the input y1 maps
into the output x1.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:59.380
In other words, notice that if
you look at the f inverse

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.740
situation here, when the input
is y1, the output is x1.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:09.330
That's another way of saying
that y1 comma x1 belongs to

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:10.870
the curve c2.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:17.070
In other words, if x1, y1
belongs to y1 equals f of x1,

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:22.430
then y1, x1 belongs to y
equals f inverse of x.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:27.170
Now, what is the relationship
between the point x1 comma y1

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.080
and the point y1 comma x1?

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.110
If we draw this little diagram,
we observe that we

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:36.010
have a couple of congruent
triangles here.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.280
This length equals
this length.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.650
This angle equals this angle.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.180
And this gives me a hint.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:48.020
This makes triangle
OPQ isosceles.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:53.260
I draw the angle bisector of
angle O. The angle bisector of

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:56.200
an isosceles triangle
is the perpendicular

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.080
bisector of the base.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.350
And angle bisector of the
vertex angle is the

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:03.350
perpendicular bisector
of the base.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:06.810
Well, you see that makes this
angle equal to this angle.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.720
That makes this a
45 degree angle.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.860
In other words, the line
that I've drawn is

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.790
indeed, y equals x.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:18.100
And notice that P and Q are
symmetrically located with

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.780
respect to the line
y equals x.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:25.070
In other words, going back to
our original problem here, the

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:31.140
curve c1 and c2 are related by
the fact that they are mirror

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.600
images of one another
with respect to the

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.560
line y equals x.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.120
That's exactly what I've
drawn over here.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.760
In other words, going back to
the problem of how are the

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.540
curves y equal 2x minus 7 and
y equal x plus 7 over 2

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.250
related, the answer is they
are mirror images of one

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.090
another with respect to
the line y equals x.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:55.210
They are symmetric with
respect to that line.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:58.990
Now you see, let's talk about
this from another point of

00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:01.440
view also, and show what
the tough thing is.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.190
You see, so far my whole
discussion seems to have

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:07.810
hinged on the fact that we
have a function, which is

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:08.700
invertible.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.090
What if you have a function
which is non-invertible?

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:16.540
Going back to something more
familiar, why do we, talk

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:18.700
about -- when y equals the
square root of x, why do we

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.930
have this convention that we
take the positive square root?

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:25.520
After all, doesn't the square
root of x and minus the square

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.150
root of x have the property that
when you square them you

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:29.290
get the same result?

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:32.250
Plus or minus squared
is always plus.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.860
And the answer is that if you
square both sides here and

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.210
think of this as being the curve
y squared equals x, what

00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:43.990
happens is you get a
multi-valued function.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:47.730
One value of x yields
two values of y.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.650
And the way we get around that
is we break this curve down

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:56.050
into two pieces, c1 and c2,
where c1 is always rising.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.970
c2 is always falling here.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.560
In other words, we broke this
thing off at the point of

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.850
vertical tangency.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.990
And we can now think of this
curve as being the union of

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:05.850
two curves.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.080
One of which is y equals the
positive square root of x and

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:12.480
the other is y equals the
negative square root of x.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.880
Now the question is, what
happens when you have a

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.820
function which is not
single-valued.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.090
In other words, let's just
invert this one.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:23.800
Let's suppose we started with
the curve y equals x squared.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.050
You see, now for a given value
of y, I'm in trouble.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:32.520
Because if y1 is positive, there
are two different values

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.300
of x which yield this
particular result.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:40.139
In other words, both of these
have the property that when

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.460
you square them you get y1.

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:46.440
And all we're saying is that in
a problem such as this, we

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.250
can study this curve as
two separate pieces.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.440
Call one of these curves k1.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.560
That will be the curve y equals
x squared, where x is

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.659
non-negative.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:58.730
So this will be the curve k1.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.890
And call the other one k2,
where k2 will be what?

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:06.390
The same curve y equals x
squared, but its domain is the

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.900
negative values of x.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:10.680
In other words, k2 will
be this one over here.

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.620
And now the point is, if we deal
with either of these two

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.870
pieces separately, we can talk
about inverse functions.

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.690
Now the point is, which of these
two halves do we use?

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:25.150
And this is where the word
principal values comes in.

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:28.790
And you see what I'd like you
to keep in mind is this, a

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:30.770
little cliche I've written
down here.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:35.220
It's called misinterpretation
versus non-comprehension.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.060
If you don't understand what
something means, there's no

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.390
danger you're going to
misinterpret it.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.500
The danger is when you think
that you know what something

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.240
means and you have the
thing twisted around.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.370
You see, the idea is this.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.450
Let's go back to our old
friend y equals sine x.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:53.290
Let's pick the value of
y equal to 1/2 say.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:55.650
And now we say to the person the
same problem as we asked

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:59.470
before, find the angle
whose sine is 1/2.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.200
Well, the point is to
find that angle.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.350
If I draw this particular line,
I can find all sorts of

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:07.240
candidates.

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.370
The point is that what we tried
to do instead is to say,

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.700
OK, well now restrict
the function.

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.280
We'll break this down to be
a union of several curves.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.900
In other words, it'll be this
curve union this one.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:22.090
Union this one.

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.310
Union this one, et cetera.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.210
What do all of these separate
pieces have in common?

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:29.600
What they have in common
is that what?

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:35.740
They are onto the range from
minus 1 to 1 and on that range

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.610
they are also 1:1.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.490
1:1 and onto.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:44.280
Every value of y between minus 1
and 1 is taken on along each

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.590
of these pieces.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:50.930
And no value occurs more than
once on any of these pieces.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.360
The point is it's not so crucial
whether you take this

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.520
particular one or whether you
take this particular piece.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:01.580
That's something that's
sort of arbitrary.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:05.110
What we must do to avoid
misinterpretation is unless

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:08.280
otherwise specified we say look
it, unless you hear from

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.700
me to the contrary, let's always
agree that this is the

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.310
little piece of the curve that
we're talking about, or this

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.030
is the piece that we're
talking about.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.530
But the idea being what?

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.380
Unless you make such a
restriction, we cannot talk

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.700
about inverse functions.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.260
The idea being that for an
inverse function to exist, we

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.070
must be able to back map.

00:37:28.070 --> 00:37:32.090
We must be able to go from the
value in the image to the

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.540
value in the domain without
any danger of

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.890
misinterpretation.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:42.760
We can conclude our example with
returning to our y equals

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.420
x squared idea again.

00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:48.270
You see the idea is given the
curve y equals x squared, we

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.590
can think of it in terms
of our pieces

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.040
k2 and k1 as before.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.530
The accented piece
being k2, the

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.260
non-accented piece being k1.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.290
And what we're saying is the
inverse of k1 is this curve

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:06.480
here, which I'll call
k1 inverse.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:11.240
The inverse of k2 is this
curve here, which

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.530
I'll call k2 inverse.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:15.980
In other words, the important
thing is I can find the

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:21.240
inverse of either this
curve or this curve.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.800
And in fact, how do I do that?

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.040
Again, with respect to the 45
degree line, the line y equals

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:31.630
x, notice that k1 and k1 inverse
are symmetric with

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.880
respect to this 45
degree line.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:38.870
And similarly, so are
k2 and k2 inverse.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.840
The thing I must be very careful
about and this is

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.320
where problems occur, is
I must not confuse--

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:52.040
for example, what I can't do is
take, for example, k2 and

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.380
k1 inverse.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:56.960
Notice the built-in idea here.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.260
These two curves together are
not symmetric with respect to

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:01.990
the 45 degree line.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.590
You see what we're saying
here is, is what?

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.660
That for this particular
curve, x

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:08.790
and y are both positive.

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:11.950
So obviously, anything that
matches it must have x and y

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:13.070
both positive.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.970
And that doesn't happen
over here.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.860
What we're saying is you
can't do these things

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.200
completely at random.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.150
However, what you can do is
either take k1 and match that

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:26.520
with k1 inverse, k2 and match
that with k2 inverse.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:30.470
It's not important which of the
two ways you do this, as

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:34.010
long as you understand that
there is a danger of getting

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:37.680
mixed up once the curve
itself is not 1:1.

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:40.430
In other words, when we break
the curve down into 1:1

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.930
pieces, we have to make
sure that we match

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.540
these things up properly.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.630
Now, this is all we're going to
say about inverse functions

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.290
for the time being.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:52.690
The rest will be taken care of
in the exercises in this unit.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.540
However, we will return to this
point very, very strongly

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.500
later in our discussion
of calculus.

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:02.250
The important point to remember
is that a function

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:05.820
and its inverse function give
us two different ways of

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.260
expressing the same
information.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.840
And that we can use whichever
one happens
