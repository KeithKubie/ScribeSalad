  (laughter)

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.145 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I do have this
 sort of secret shame,

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.715 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  that I've only just begun
  to share with audiences,

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:18.518 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 but the night after
 this last election,

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:22.355 align:start size:84% position:16%
 I accidentally
 fucked a Trump voter.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:23.589 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:27.226
 Yeah, no, now hear
 me out, I was drunk.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.062 align:start position:0%
  It was last call, he
  walked in, he had genitals

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.430
 and he said let's go,

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.665 align:start position:0%
and halfway back to my
apartment he finally turns to me

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.100 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and he's like "how
 about this election?"

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.035 align:start position:0%
And I was like, oh I can't
believe I didn't ask about this,

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:37.970 size:84% position:42%
  it's crazy what's going
  to happen to our country,

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.340
 I'm terrified, and then just
 the longest pause imaginable

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:43.609 align:start position:0%
 and he was like, "yeah, but
 he has some good ideas."

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.245 size:88% position:44%
 And I was like, NO!

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:48.247 size:88% position:44%
  I feel like I've spent the
  last ten years of my life

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.149
 telling conservatives
 online to suck my dick

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:51.617 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and then one finally
 did, you know,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.852
and I hated it!

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:57.557 align:start position:0%
 (laughter)
 Thank you so much, goodnight!

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
 - [Announcer] Now let's hear
 it for Joel Kim Booster!

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:02.662 size:88% position:44%
  (applause)

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.133 size:88% position:44%
 (text notification)

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.371 size:84% position:42%
  - Oh, no!

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.006 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I caught a centipede
 in the bathroom

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.608 align:start size:75% position:25%
  (gasp)
  holy shit!

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.143
- I know, right?

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:18.611 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh my god, I don't even
  know what to do with that.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
 - I think I'd need more
 than a condom as protection,

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.248 size:88% position:44%
  like, I wanna take
  this dick to court

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:24.283 align:start position:0%
  and get a restraining
  order against this penis.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:25.918 size:84% position:42%
  - That's gonna be
  a no for me, dog.

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:28.588 align:start position:0%
  - Yeah, no ticket to
  Hollywood for this penis.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.090
 Come back next season, maybe.

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.525 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Oh, my car's here.
  - Okay, bye!

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:33.993
(smacking lips)

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:35.294 size:88% position:44%
  Find a reasonably
  sized penis, okay!

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:36.362
 - Oh, I did, it's right there!

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.231
- Oh, thank you!

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.834
 (upbeat music)

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:49.642
 (text notifications)

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:56.282
- Not much, you?

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.484
 Not much, you?

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.387 align:start position:0% line:0%
- [Emcee] Please help me
welcome to the stage right now,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.689 line:0%
Shalewa Sharpe!

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.558 size:88% position:44%
  (applause)

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:09.262
- I'm not used to a New
York City crackhead,

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.933 align:start size:88% position:13%
like I'm from the South,
so, a more genteel,

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:17.570
 like a crack gentleman
 is what I'm used to,

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.039 align:start size:88% position:13%
 you know what I mean?
 (laughter)

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:21.574 size:84% position:42%
  Somebody who really cares

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:24.544 align:start size:88% position:13%
 about the people
 he's stealing from.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:28.614 align:start size:88% position:13%
My crackhead in Atlanta
once came up to me

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:31.417
and he was like,
"Hey, miss lady,

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:34.787
I really hate to tell you this,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.024 size:88% position:44%
  but I caught somebody else
  going through your car."

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.592 size:88% position:44%
 Okay, what is else?

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:40.460
 Who?

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:44.463
 Else, okay, alright.

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:47.567
 (text notifications)

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.739 size:88% position:44%
 (bar music)

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:02.949 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, it's dead, right?

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:03.749
So dead.

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:05.351
- Oh, my god, you came?

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:08.287 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Yeah, I came, I
 said I was gonna come.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.656
Okay, someone's cute in person.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.325
 - Thanks, uh, didn't
 you say you were,

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.026
 like, with a group of people?

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.061
 - That's a figure of speech.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.562 size:88% position:44%
  - Is it?
  (laughter)

00:03:16.595 --> 00:03:18.264
- So, you're a comedian?

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:19.699 size:88% position:44%
  Funny boy.

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:22.034
 I bet you are really
 funny, I can tell.

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:23.970
- I like to think I am.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.106 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:33.813
 - So what is this, is
 this like a stand-up,

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.715 size:88% position:44%
  or is this like improv, or
  do you have like a team?

00:03:35.748 --> 00:03:37.783 size:88% position:44%
  Is it like, happening now,
  is it happening later, or

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
 - The show actually happens
 in that bar, over there.

00:03:40.653 --> 00:03:42.955 size:88% position:44%
  This is more like the back
  bar where comedians come

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:46.259 align:start position:0%
 to be alone and sort of center
 themselves before the set.

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:48.060 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Oh, okay.
- Just be alone,

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:49.595 align:start size:75% position:25%
big part of it.
- Yeah!

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.064
 Okay well, good thing I came,
 because now you have company.

00:03:52.097 --> 00:03:53.165
 Let's just get a drink, right?

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:55.201
Excuse me, hi, I'd like a drink,

00:03:55.234 --> 00:03:56.469
 that's why I'm sitting here.

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:57.903 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'd like to not
 wait longer, please,

00:03:57.936 --> 00:03:58.871 size:88% position:44%
  I'd like a Sprite.

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:00.506
 - I think he's doing his best.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.108 size:84% position:42%
  - Okay, we don't know him
  and we don't know that.

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:03.809
- Well, I do, I mean, I see him,

00:04:03.842 --> 00:04:05.177
 might have to see him a lot.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.546 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Thanks.
- I'm so sorry.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.982
 - Okay, so, a little about me,

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:13.019 size:88% position:44%
  I have never lost
  a Pepsi Challenge.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.223 size:84% position:42%
  - Oh, okay, cool.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.827 size:88% position:44%
 (bar music)

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.837 size:88% position:44%
 - So should we go make out?

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:34.907
 - So I was coming back from
 my father's memorial service,

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.610
 and a coworker came up to me,

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:40.946 align:start position:0%
and she said, "Oh, wow, so
both of your parents are gone?"

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.216 align:start position:0%
And I said, "Yeah,
unfortunately that is the case."

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:46.452 size:88% position:44%
 And then, she said,

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:48.921
 "Wow, don't you wish
 you had had kids,

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:52.024 align:start size:88% position:13%
 so they could've known
 their grandkids?"

00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:53.159
 (boos)

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:56.029 align:start size:75% position:25%
  Biotch!
  (laughter)

00:04:57.396 --> 00:04:58.564
 What?

00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:00.433 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Okay, I'm just
  waiting on a bagel

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.868
 and you've handed me
 an existential crisis.

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:07.073 align:start size:88% position:13%
Thank you, thank you,
good morning, thank you.

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:09.442 size:88% position:44%
 (squeaking)

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.614
- That is not how my live-in
boyfriend of six years does it.

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:16.882
 - Wait, what?

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.184
 - Nah, its..

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:19.785
 - Okay, uhm,

00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:21.754
well, thank you so much

00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:24.323
 for that experience.

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:26.592
 But in the meantime, I think
 the show is actually happening

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.527 align:start size:88% position:13%
 right now so I
 should probably go.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.797 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:34.000
 Is he a ghost?

00:05:36.635 --> 00:05:38.537 size:84% position:42%
  - This is one of our best
  friends, make some noise

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.972
- He's the best,

00:05:40.005 --> 00:05:43.176 align:start position:0%
  - Joel Kim Booster!
  - It's Joel Kim everybody!

00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:48.280 size:88% position:44%
 - I just would like
 to clarify off top

00:05:48.313 --> 00:05:53.319
that I am their best friend,
but they're not my best friend.

00:05:54.653 --> 00:05:55.287 align:start position:0%
 I just want to set the
 record straight really quick.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.155
(electro music)
