00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.992
- [Allen-Sanchez] You need to find out which angle

00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:13.535
shows the largest increase in temperature.

00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:17.296
You need to design an
experiment that shows that.

00:00:17.296 --> 00:00:19.296
It's a design challenge.

00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:21.371
- I mean, it's going up.

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:22.718
The temperature's going up.

00:00:22.718 --> 00:00:24.065
- [Student] Oh, my god, really?

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:27.232
- [Student] What temperature is it at?

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.700
- [Holthuis] At the Stanford Center of
Assessment, Learning, and Equity

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.765
we produce some curriculum
that was aligned

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:40.307
to the new standards
that had just come out

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:41.399
at that point.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.173
The curriculum really engages students,

00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:45.926
and I think that some of that comes from

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:49.479
having interesting projects
that they're working on

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.057
and providing the options, the choice,

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:53.519
the decision making.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.513
And really turning over
some agency to them.

00:00:57.513 --> 00:00:59.777
This really is a whole
different way of thinking

00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:01.777
about science education.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:18.899
- [Ryan] What we were committed to was adopting

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.896
and using a curriculum

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:23.891
that would break the
cycle of predictability

00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:26.306
of who would succeed in science courses

00:01:26.306 --> 00:01:29.473
based upon their gender and ethnicity.

00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:35.907
- [Holthuis] Performance assessment is one

00:01:35.907 --> 00:01:38.903
that engages students, is really rich,

00:01:38.903 --> 00:01:42.212
and measures much more
than just what do you know,

00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:45.021
what facts can you tell me or regurgitate.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:49.805
- You're designing an angle
of incoming light experiment.

00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:51.407
- They're really often projects.

00:01:51.407 --> 00:01:54.356
They ask students to bring in skills,

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:56.074
they ask them to bring in their content,

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.421
to make connections,

00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:01.682
and to pool all that together
into a larger product.

00:02:01.682 --> 00:02:04.549
- [Allen-Sanchez] The assessment itself is
really taking the information

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.604
that they've learned and applying it.

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:09.182
So, as opposed to giving them a page

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:11.144
and saying fill in this blank,

00:02:11.144 --> 00:02:14.418
circle this letter,
give me this definition.

00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:17.761
- It's going up really fast.
- It's at about 79.

00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:18.802
- [Student] It's at 90 degrees.

00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:20.041
- 'Cause really any kid can memorize

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:21.953
any of that information,
but can they apply it

00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:24.953
to an actual real-world application?

00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:34.015
- [Ryan] We recognize that
students walk in the door

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:37.289
of this classroom with
issues of status behind them.

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.796
That they recognize themselves

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:43.105
as being a science person
or a non-science person.

00:02:43.105 --> 00:02:45.910
- So, this would be a 90 angle

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.327
or a right angle,

00:02:48.986 --> 00:02:52.226
and then when it goes out...
- And that it's through

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:54.292
student discourse and group work

00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:56.800
that they will start
to dispel those beliefs

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.039
about not only themselves
but about their peers.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:02.895
- [Holthuis] So that's where we developed,
and why we developed,

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:05.716
an entire unit for teachers to implement

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:09.803
at the start of the year
where they help students think

00:03:09.803 --> 00:03:12.996
about what kind of behaviors
are expected of you

00:03:12.996 --> 00:03:14.679
when you're working in small groups.

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:18.511
- It has to be a direct
angle to the experiment.

00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:21.819
- Direct angle? Or are
their any other angles?

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.956
- Well, you could do
any other angle, but...

00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:26.452
- The group roles really
help kids understand

00:03:26.452 --> 00:03:30.794
that they have a task and
they really can't just be idle

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:32.663
and by themselves and hide in a corner.

00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:35.659
- So, my job is the recorder/reporter.

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.735
So, with that job, I have to write down

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:43.565
all our notes and all our
step-by-step stuff like this.

00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:45.156
- Right, they have to actually participate

00:03:45.156 --> 00:03:46.758
in order to achieve whatever it is

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:49.341
that they're trying to achieve.

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.114
- [Ryan] Ongoing professional development

00:03:57.114 --> 00:04:00.341
is coming from the communities of teachers

00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.420
at science collaborating,

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.357
making decisions about their own practice,

00:04:05.357 --> 00:04:07.772
and then also giving us feedback.

00:04:07.772 --> 00:04:08.793
- The roadblock I find

00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:11.371
with some of the students
who finish really quickly,

00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:13.360
is that they're doing it because
they want to do that piece,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.077
they want to do an extra piece
that they're interested in.

00:04:16.077 --> 00:04:17.749
- [Holthuis] To have somebody who has been involved

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.525
in the development of the curriculum,

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:21.185
that same person takes it back

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:23.403
to their own classroom and tries it out,

00:04:23.403 --> 00:04:25.736
you get really deep insight.

00:04:28.709 --> 00:04:32.215
It makes for much more robust curriculum,

00:04:32.215 --> 00:04:35.036
because you're getting away
from content, content, content

00:04:35.036 --> 00:04:36.998
and saying, okay, do you know the content,

00:04:36.998 --> 00:04:38.716
and can you do something with it?

00:04:38.716 --> 00:04:40.469
- [Allen-Sanchez] I think it's
been really fruitful.

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.488
The students seem to have a
much more focused perspective

00:04:43.488 --> 00:04:44.626
on what we're supposed to do.

00:04:44.626 --> 00:04:46.112
I have a much more focused perspective

00:04:46.112 --> 00:04:47.470
on what we're supposed to do.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.980
- [Holthuis] It has really

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.313
supported student learning tremendously.
