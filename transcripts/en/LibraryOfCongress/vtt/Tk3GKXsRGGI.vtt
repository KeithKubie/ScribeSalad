Congress in Washington, D.C.

&gt;&gt; Amalia Castaneda:
My favorite part

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.090
of being a Junior Fellow I think
is just access to the resource

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.380
of the Library, from lectures, to
the people here at the Library,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.090
having the chance to pick the
brains of curators and specialists.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.450
And also sort of mingling
among other fellows

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.360
that will also be specialists
in their field one day.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900
So I think having access to that
network is my favorite part.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jessica Abbazio: My favorite part

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.210
of being a Junior Fellow is
all the tours and the events

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.510 position:56%
that we've gotten to participate in.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.150
I really enjoyed the presentations
in the National Library Service

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.790 position:56%
for the Blind because of the impact.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.640
Meeting Dr. Carla Hayden
was probably the highlight

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.940
of the entire experience.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.470
&gt;&gt; Justina Moloney: The
opportunity to get to work

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.540
with Veterans' Collections
every day,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.010
that's really honestly the dream,
getting to do it 40 hours a week

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.300
for ten weeks really
is something brand new.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.980
&gt;&gt; Julia Jimenez: One of
the things I got to find

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.710
in the Manuscript Division was
one of the original court document

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230
from the Dred Scott case.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.660
It was in an unprocessed box
in the Montgomery Blair papers.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.960
&gt;&gt; Wister Hitt: The Prints

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.230
and Photographs Division had some
absolutely stunning pictures,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.530
photographs, prints.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.200
And the coolest thing
I got to see was going

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.780
through all the Supreme Court
portraits, group pictures,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.200
and shots, just as the progression

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.890
of time you see the
difference in the Justices.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.350 position:56%
That was really cool to see a visual
representation of change over time.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.650
&gt;&gt; Irene Lule: The coming here

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.650
and seeing the challenges
facing the Library and how I,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.850
as a professional, can go and
help solve those challenges

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.000
and contribute solutions
has been great for me.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.720
And so taking that experience and
going back to my home institution

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.180
and growing professionally has
been really awesome and just

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.630
to challenge myself in a
different area has been great.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.470
&gt;&gt; Justina Jimenez: I think that
this program really allowed me

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.650
to expand what I knew, what
I thought that I could do,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.340
and learn new skills along the way.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.770
&gt;&gt; Zachary Sanders: You know,
I've lived in Washington

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.320
for three years now and I've
known that the Library existed.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.780
Had my reader's card
for a couple of years

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.290
but just never really opened my
eyes to the depth of material

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.870
that the library has and the level
of accessibility that there is.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.760
&gt;&gt; Jessica Abbazio: So I would
just advise future Junior Fellows

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.600
to take advantage of everything
there is available in D.C. This is

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.250
such a rich cultural area
that there's so many things

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.060
that you can learn, and do,
and see while you're here.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.880
So absolutely try to do that.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.180
&gt;&gt; Amalia Castaneda: I'll
be motivating more people

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.270
from my institution to apply.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.110
&gt;&gt; Justina Moloney: Getting to
work at the Library of Congress

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.080 position:56%
and getting to always carry that
with me that I got to do what I love

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.510
with collections that I love here.
