from a recent trip to Japan my home

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370
from a recent trip to Japan my home
 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.430
from a recent trip to Japan my home
country I brought back a little present

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440
country I brought back a little present
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.380
country I brought back a little present
it's a traditional toy a Japanese story

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390
it's a traditional toy a Japanese story
 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.579
it's a traditional toy a Japanese story
called kami who Sam

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589
called kami who Sam
 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.150

which means paper balloon and as you can

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160
which means paper balloon and as you can
 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.499
which means paper balloon and as you can
see it's a balloon made of paper and

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
see it's a balloon made of paper and
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.810
see it's a balloon made of paper and
there's a hole in there yeah

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
there's a hole in there yeah
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.060
there's a hole in there yeah
so the where are you inflate this paper

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070
so the where are you inflate this paper
 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.000
so the where are you inflate this paper
by the moon when you wash it is to blow

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
by the moon when you wash it is to blow
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.370
by the moon when you wash it is to blow
into this hole and make it rounder okay

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
into this hole and make it rounder okay
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.290
into this hole and make it rounder okay
but this another way to make it rounder

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300
but this another way to make it rounder
 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.780
but this another way to make it rounder
you can squash it and then you can start

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
you can squash it and then you can start
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.520
you can squash it and then you can start
tossing it around you hit it from all

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
tossing it around you hit it from all
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.360
tossing it around you hit it from all
sides at random oops now when you hit

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
sides at random oops now when you hit
 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100
sides at random oops now when you hit
something don't you have the impression

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
something don't you have the impression
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930
something don't you have the impression
that you are denting it and therefore

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
that you are denting it and therefore
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.180
that you are denting it and therefore
making it less and less round and you're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
making it less and less round and you're
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.160
making it less and less round and you're
denting it right from both sides but

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170
denting it right from both sides but
 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.689
denting it right from both sides but
look at what's happening as I toss it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
look at what's happening as I toss it
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.119
look at what's happening as I toss it
and hit it from all sides I'm doing

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
and hit it from all sides I'm doing
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.939
and hit it from all sides I'm doing
completely handily you can eat it quite

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
completely handily you can eat it quite
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:10.219
completely handily you can eat it quite
hard what was suitable to a little

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
hard what was suitable to a little
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.820
hard what was suitable to a little
crumpled it's now getting rounder and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
crumpled it's now getting rounder and
 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.770
crumpled it's now getting rounder and
rounder and becoming more and more

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780
rounder and becoming more and more
 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.710
rounder and becoming more and more
spherical and look I ended up with a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720
spherical and look I ended up with a
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.240
spherical and look I ended up with a
round sphere so this is a really strange

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250
round sphere so this is a really strange
 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.359
round sphere so this is a really strange
way of making something round by denting

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
way of making something round by denting
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.710
way of making something round by denting
it repeatedly from all sides how does

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
it repeatedly from all sides how does
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.410
it repeatedly from all sides how does
this trick work I think the key to this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
this trick work I think the key to this
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.840
this trick work I think the key to this
behavior which all Japanese children

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850
behavior which all Japanese children
 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.389
behavior which all Japanese children
know instinctively is really in the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399
know instinctively is really in the
 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.850
know instinctively is really in the
following behavior over the balloon when

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
following behavior over the balloon when
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.929
following behavior over the balloon when
i swivel it to a little crumpled watch

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
i swivel it to a little crumpled watch
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.260
i swivel it to a little crumpled watch
what happens when i release it you see

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
what happens when i release it you see
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.630
what happens when i release it you see
it starts fighting its way back at least

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640
it starts fighting its way back at least
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.670
it starts fighting its way back at least
initially it doesn't inflate all the way

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
initially it doesn't inflate all the way
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.679
initially it doesn't inflate all the way
back of course but it has some memory

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
back of course but it has some memory
 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.260
back of course but it has some memory
and he wants to come back to where it

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
and he wants to come back to where it
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.290
and he wants to come back to where it
started it fights its way back as I said

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300
 
 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.390
 
that's that's an interesting question

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400
that's that's an interesting question
 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.370
that's that's an interesting question
and I have to think about this so let's

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380
and I have to think about this so let's
 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.990
and I have to think about this so let's
imagine the following toy model let's

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
imagine the following toy model let's
 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.880
imagine the following toy model let's
say that you have a state of this

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890
say that you have a state of this
 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.880
say that you have a state of this
balloon which is crumpled on both sides

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890
balloon which is crumpled on both sides
 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.120
balloon which is crumpled on both sides
on the left as well as on the right and

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130
on the left as well as on the right and
 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.000
on the left as well as on the right and
I'm going to strike this balloon at this

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010
I'm going to strike this balloon at this
 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.600
I'm going to strike this balloon at this
moment pass from the left let's say what

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610
moment pass from the left let's say what
 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.180
moment pass from the left let's say what
happens to a good approximation I think

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190
happens to a good approximation I think
 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.790
happens to a good approximation I think
is that decide that you hit gets over

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800
is that decide that you hit gets over
 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.010
is that decide that you hit gets over
crumpled because you I just did you know

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020
crumpled because you I just did you know
 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.590
crumpled because you I just did you know
you introduce a lot of compost I don't

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600
you introduce a lot of compost I don't
 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.230
you introduce a lot of compost I don't
know how but the other side gets puffed

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240
know how but the other side gets puffed
 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.780
know how but the other side gets puffed
out literally because there is this

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790
out literally because there is this
 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.080
out literally because there is this
force which pushes it right word but you

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090
force which pushes it right word but you
 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.060
force which pushes it right word but you
see then something interesting happens

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070
see then something interesting happens
 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.610
see then something interesting happens
is that fighting back effect means that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620
is that fighting back effect means that
 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.530
is that fighting back effect means that
the left side which was over crumpled

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540
the left side which was over crumpled
 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.180
the left side which was over crumpled
starts fighting back

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
starts fighting back
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.150
starts fighting back
so it starts expanding to roughly the

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160
so it starts expanding to roughly the
 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.010
so it starts expanding to roughly the
degree of ring cleanness that they had

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020
degree of ring cleanness that they had
 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.900
degree of ring cleanness that they had
in the beginning whereas the right hand

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910
in the beginning whereas the right hand
 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.710
in the beginning whereas the right hand
side stays puffed out so per this cycle

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720
side stays puffed out so per this cycle
 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.680
side stays puffed out so per this cycle
you see what happened is that I increase

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690
you see what happened is that I increase
 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.930
you see what happened is that I increase
the overall smoothness a little bit the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940
the overall smoothness a little bit the
 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.699
the overall smoothness a little bit the
other side which got puffed out whereas

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709
other side which got puffed out whereas
 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.290
other side which got puffed out whereas
this side that I over wrinkled

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300
this side that I over wrinkled
 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.660
this side that I over wrinkled
fought back by itself so if you keep

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670
fought back by itself so if you keep
 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.850
fought back by itself so if you keep
hitting it from all sides gradually you

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860
hitting it from all sides gradually you
 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:34.940
hitting it from all sides gradually you
are making the thing round and Rhonda

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950
 
 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:49.220
 
[Music]

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230
[Music]
 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.040
[Music]
so let's plot the evolution of the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050
so let's plot the evolution of the
 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.740
so let's plot the evolution of the
volume against time and let's say in

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750
volume against time and let's say in
 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.710
volume against time and let's say in
time I'm hitting the balloon at various

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720
time I'm hitting the balloon at various
 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.150
time I'm hitting the balloon at various
regular intervals it doesn't have the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160
regular intervals it doesn't have the
 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.730
regular intervals it doesn't have the
irregular intervals okay so the volume

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740
irregular intervals okay so the volume
 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.540
irregular intervals okay so the volume
of the balloon starts like this and as

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550
of the balloon starts like this and as
 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:08.480
of the balloon starts like this and as
soon as I hit it of course

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490
soon as I hit it of course
 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.010
soon as I hit it of course
instantaneously I suddenly decrease the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020
instantaneously I suddenly decrease the
 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.650
instantaneously I suddenly decrease the
volume I just shrivel it's a hit

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660
volume I just shrivel it's a hit
 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.470
volume I just shrivel it's a hit
gives you this lip but then the thing

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480
gives you this lip but then the thing
 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.290
gives you this lip but then the thing
fights back yeah this is the fight back

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:19.300
fights back yeah this is the fight back
 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.320
fights back yeah this is the fight back
and then the next hit will decrease the

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330
and then the next hit will decrease the
 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.870
and then the next hit will decrease the
volume and they need to fight back fight

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880
volume and they need to fight back fight
 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.930
volume and they need to fight back fight
back and so and gradually it asymptotes

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940
back and so and gradually it asymptotes
 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.890
back and so and gradually it asymptotes
or it approaches this spherical shape

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900
or it approaches this spherical shape
 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.870
or it approaches this spherical shape
from below like this so it never becomes

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880
from below like this so it never becomes
 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.150
from below like this so it never becomes
completely spherical but it grows like

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160
completely spherical but it grows like
 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.890
completely spherical but it grows like
that so I think there is a process of

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900
that so I think there is a process of
 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.150
that so I think there is a process of
grow shrink grow shrink grow string zig

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160
grow shrink grow shrink grow string zig
 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.770
grow shrink grow shrink grow string zig
zag zig zag and then goes back then

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780
zag zig zag and then goes back then
 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.050
zag zig zag and then goes back then
that's why you can do this strange thing

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060
that's why you can do this strange thing
 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.290
that's why you can do this strange thing
of hitting it or denting it repeatedly

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300
of hitting it or denting it repeatedly
 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.990
of hitting it or denting it repeatedly
and yet the result outcome is that it

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000
and yet the result outcome is that it
 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.970
and yet the result outcome is that it
becomes round and round okay this will

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980
becomes round and round okay this will
 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:08.219
becomes round and round okay this will
probably take a long time

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229
 
 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.390
 
behave exactly the same way

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400
behave exactly the same way
 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.110
behave exactly the same way
whereas 45 degrees off
