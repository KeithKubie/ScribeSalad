00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:05.906
BUT SADLY, OUR OBSESSION
WITH CLOTHING OFTEN MEANS

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.908
THAT PEOPLE WILL GO
AS FAR AS STEALING

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.577
JUST TO GET THEIR HANDS
ON THAT HOT NEW STYLE.

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:13.080
AND NO ONE KNOWS THIS BETTER
THAN GABRIELLE ROMERO,

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.848
MANAGER OF HARDWEAR CLOTHING

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.216
IN LARCHMONT VILLAGE,
CALIFORNIA.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.719
- OFTENTIMES WHEN SHOPLIFTING,
THEY COME IN TEAMS,

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.554
USUALLY MORE THAN ONE PERSON,

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.189
USUALLY ABOUT THREE PEOPLE.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:25.125
- IT'S THE REAL DARK SIDE
OF RUNNING A CLOTHING STORE,

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.727
BUT OFTEN IN BUSINESS,
A NEGATIVE LIKE THIS

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.795
CAN ACTUALLY BE TURNED
INTO A POSITIVE.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.797
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.299
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TRICKS
PEOPLE DO

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.301
TO STEAL STUFF?

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.737
- UM, DEFINITELY, THEY C--
THEY TRAVEL IN PACKS.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.905
- SORRY, YOU WERE LOOKING
AT MY HAT.

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:40.374
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
- OH, OKAY. IS IT--

00:00:40.407 --> 00:00:41.575
IS IT OK--
IS IT WEIRD, OR--

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:42.643
- NO. YOUR HAT?
- I DON'T NORMALLY WEAR...

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:43.644
- NO, IT LOOKS GOOD.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:44.811
- THIS TYPE OF HAT.
- I LIKE IT.

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:45.946
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
I DON'T HAVE TO WEAR IT.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:46.947
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.549
- BETTER?
- SORRY, YEAH.

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:49.816
SO WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT SHOPLIFTING?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.052
- I DON'T REMEMBER.
IT HAPPENS.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.688
- BUT MAYBE SHOPLIFTING
ISN'T SUCH A BAD THING.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.557
YOU SEE, IN FASHION,
GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.758
ARE TRENDSETTERS.

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:00.160
SO RATHER THAN TRYING TO STOP
ALL SHOPLIFTERS,

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.796
HARDWEAR CAN BENEFIT
BY LETTING ATTRACTIVE THIEVES

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.864
GO FREE,

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:05.599
BECAUSE IF ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE
WEAR IT,

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.635
THEIR LESS ATTRACTIVE FRIENDS
WILL COME AND BUY IT.

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.674
- OH.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.909
OKAY.

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.277
- WHAT--WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:18.478
- SO WE JUST WAIT
FOR AN ATTRACTIVE PERSON

00:01:18.512 --> 00:01:19.646
TO COME IN?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.981
DO I HAVE TO THINK
THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE?

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.149
WHO'S THE JUDGE?

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.318
- WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE
HAVE TO DECIDE.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.509
 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.843
 

00:01:28.843 --> 00:01:31.109
 

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.593
EACH COME UP WITH A LIST
OF TRAITS

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:35.095
THAT THEY FIND ATTRACTIVE.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:36.496
THEN LATER,
I COMPILED ALL THE TRAITS

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.465
INTO A MASTER LIST.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.467
NOW I NEEDED SOMEONE
TO ENFORCE IT,

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:41.735
SO I HIRED
A SECURITY GUARD.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:42.870
SIMON?
- HI, GOOD TO MEET YOU.

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:44.438
- THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT.
- OKAY.

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.806
- SO WE'RE DOING
THIS THING HERE

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.275
WHERE WE'RE ALLOWING PEOPLE
TO SHOPLIFT ONE ITEM,

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:49.676
BUT ONLY
IF THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.844
- OKAY.
- SO THE STAFF AND I

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.213
CAME UP WITH A LIST
OF, UH, SOME TRAITS

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:54.848
THAT QUALIFY A PERSON
AS ATTRACTIVE.

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:55.849
- RIGHT.

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:57.150
- SO, BASICALLY,
IF SOMEONE MEETS

00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:58.819
ALL THESE TRAITS,

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:00.654
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SHOPLIFT.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:01.722
OTHERWISE,
YOU HAVE TO STOP THEM.

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:03.056
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.158
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY,
THINGS LIKE "BIG PENIS"

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:06.493
JUST APPLY TO MEN.

00:02:06.527 --> 00:02:07.561
- RIGHT.

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:08.795
- WITH EVERYTHING IN PLACE,

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.230
WE WERE READY TO OPEN OUR DOORS
TO CUSTOMERS.

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:13.367
[upbeat techno music]

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.535
â™ª

00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.503
THE NORMAL TRAFFIC
WAS COMING IN,

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:19.239
BUT I REALIZED THAT PEOPLE
WERE MISSING THE SIGN OUT FRONT.

00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:21.742
SO JUST TO BE SAFE,
I WENT UP TO EACH PERSON

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:23.143
AND TOLD THEM
ABOUT THE PROMOTION.

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:24.978
WE'RE DOING
A SPECIAL PROMOTION TODAY

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.881
WHERE ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE ARE
ALLOWED TO STEAL ONE ITEM.

00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:29.883
TO SHOPLIFT ONE ITEM.

00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:31.084
- YOU WORK HERE?

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.553
- I'M REPRESENTING
THE BUSINESS.

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.221
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL ME
TO STEAL SOMETHING?

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:36.223
- IT'S A SPECIAL PROMOTION.
- OKAY.

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:37.958
- IT WAS WORKING GREAT,
AS SEVERAL WOMEN

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.626
WERE SHOPLIFTING ITEMS.

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.234
- BUT ACCORDING TO SIMON,

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.236
THE FIRST FEW WOMEN
JUST DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.838
- SHE DIDN'T PAY
FOR THE ITEM.

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.107
- IT WAS STRANGE BECAUSE THESE
WOMEN WERE ATTRACTIVE,

00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:56.510
BUT THEN I BEGAN TO SUSPECT
THAT OUR SECURITY GUARD

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:58.011
ONLY CARED
ABOUT ONE THING.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:02.182
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.
- THANK YOU, YOU TOO.

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:03.617
- WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF HER?

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.086
- SHE WAS, UH,
SHE WAS RATHER PRETTY.

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.554
- WHAT DID YOU LIKE
ABOUT HER THE MOST?

00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:08.822
- UH, HER FIGURE.

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:11.158
SHE HAD, YOU KNOW,
A PRETTY--PRETTY GOOD BUILD.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.192
- OH. DO YOU LIKE THAT?

00:03:12.226 --> 00:03:13.961
- YES.

00:03:14.061 --> 00:03:15.562
- WAIT, WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

00:03:15.596 --> 00:03:18.098
- UM, YOU KNOW,
THE WAY HER--

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.600
THE WAY HER B--
HER CHEST WAS.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.568
- IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE LOOKING AT THE MOST?

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:23.637
- UM, YEAH.
AND ALSO SHE WAS--

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.205
HER F--HER FACE
WAS SORT OF PRETTY,

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.575
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOT--
NOT, LIKE, TOTALLY PRETTY.

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.577
- THE PART YOU LIKED WAS--
- YEAH.

00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.578
IT WAS--
- YEAH.

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:32.646
- YEAH.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:34.214
- BIG BOOBS
WASN'T ON THE LIST.

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:35.849
AND CLEARLY, SIMON HAD
AN OBSESSION.

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:38.452
AND AFTER STOPPING
SEVERAL MORE ATTRACTIVE WOMEN

00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:39.753
WITH MODEST CHESTS...

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.989
- YOU HAVE TO--YOU HAVE TO PAY
FOR ALL YOUR ITEMS.

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.891
- OKAY.
- I HAD TO INTERVENE.

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:45.926
LET'S SAY THERE'S NO LIST.
YOU JUST SEE HER ON THE STREET.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.128
WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER?

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.830
- SHE IS SOMEWHAT PRETTY,

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:52.132
BUT SHE COULD BE PRETTIER.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.467
- AND WHAT WOULD MAKE HER
PRETTIER?

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.802
- UH, TO LET HER HAIR DOWN
AND, YOU KNOW...

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:57.337
MAYBE SMI--
- AND WHAT WAS THAT?

00:03:57.371 --> 00:04:00.174
YOU DID THAT AFTER.
TO LET HER HAIR DOWN AND WHAT?

00:04:00.207 --> 00:04:01.241
"AND, YOU KNOW--"

00:04:01.275 --> 00:04:03.076
I HAD TO TAKE SIMON ASIDE.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.811
SO YOU'RE SAYING
DOUBLE "D" BREASTS

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:06.213
ARE ESSENTIAL FOR YOU?

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.682
- IT'S GOTTA BE--
IT'S GOTTA BE SUBSTANTIAL.

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:12.319
- ALL RIGHT.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:14.154
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
STICK TO THE LIST THEN, FOR NOW.

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:15.622
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL STICK TO THE LIST.
