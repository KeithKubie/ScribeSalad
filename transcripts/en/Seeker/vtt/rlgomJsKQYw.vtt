00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.179
Hey!

00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:02.179
Bros!

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:03.179
You wanna get huge!?

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.910
Maybe try bulking up without supplements,
because those little muscle building pills

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.530
could increase your risk of developing testicular
cancer.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.700
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews bringing you
weight lifters out there some news you might

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.930
not want to hear.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.900
From fat burners to muscle-building protein
powder, supplements are extremely common in

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.980
the fitness industry.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.570
But a new study published in the British Journal
of Cancer has found a link between certain

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.300
kinds of muscle supplements and an increase
of testicular cancer.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.960
Incidence of testicular cancer rose to 5.9
cases in 100,000 men in 2011 from 3.7 cases

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.500
in 100,000 men in 1975.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.530
Researchers aren’t entirely sure why.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.910
Testicular cancer is one of the lesser understood
cancers in terms of causes.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.800
Our current understand is that contributing
factors include undescended testicles, a family

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.899
history of the disease, an HIV infection,
race, ethnicity, and body size.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.710
But there’s been some evidence linking muscle
building supplements to the rise in this disease.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.020
For this analytical study, the research team
interviewed 900 men from Massachusetts and

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.020
Connecticut.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.860
More than a third of these subjects had been
diagnosed with testicular germ cell cancer

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.350
while the rest had not.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.720
The researchers asked detailed questions about
the mens’ supplement usage as well as other

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.650
common cancer-related factors like drinking,
exercise habits, family history of the cancer,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.380
and prior injury to their groin area.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.610
The team focused on two common supplements.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.740
The first was creatine, a nitrogenous acid
that our bodies naturally produce that supplies

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.170
our cells, including muscle cells, with energy.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.310
A creatine supplement, then, increases the
body’s ability to work, promoting longer

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.420
and more explosive workouts, which will help
you build more muscle.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.939
That extra set of squats will only help your
glutes.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.490
The second compound the researchers looked
at was androstenedione, a naturally occurring

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.490
hormone.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.920
Alone, its effects are negligible, but it
promotes the production of testoterone and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.700
estrogen in other parts of the body, which
as we know are responsible for our secondary

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.119
sex characteristics like hair growth, fat
deposits, and facial features.

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.010
Taken as a supplement, androstenedione is,
in essence, a steroid hormone that will promote

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.170
higher testosterone and estrogen production
in the body.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.170
It can help build muscle, but in it can also
lead to shrinking testicles.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.570
The researchers found that men who used supplements
with creatine and androstenedione had a 65

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.229
percent higher risk of developing testicular
cancer compared to men who didn’t take supplements.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.090
And you don’t have to use a lot to see your
risk increase.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.400
The team defined "use" as consuming at least
one supplement once a week for a month.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.120
And the risks increase among men who take
multiple supplements; they have a 177 percent

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.590
greater risk of developing testicular cancer.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.829
Men who use supplements for three or more
years had an increased risk of 256 percent.

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.279
And the risk was highest for men who started
using supplements before the age of 25.

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.040
But to be clear, this study was analytic.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.739
To find a hard link between supplements and
testicular cancer scientists will need to

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.999
run more detailed studies and experiments.

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.599
So, you gym rats out there, will you be curbing
your supplement usage or are you going to

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.019
wait for some harder evidence before taking
the all natural approach to bodybuilding?
