SHANNON LOW: My
name is Shannon Low.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.640
Thanks very much, Brendan,
for the introduction.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.320
I head up the Google
Play apps and games

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.710
business development team
for Europe, Middle East,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.040
and Africa.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.850
And I'm very happy
to be here today

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.739
to speak to you about how to
reach more users for your apps.

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:16.280
For this session,
I'll also be joined

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.940
by my colleague, Bruce
Kerr-Peterson, the EMEA

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.470
regional lead for
app developer sales.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.929
So a quick rundown of what
we're going to talk about today.

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.136
First of all, I want to talk
about some of the things

00:00:27.136 --> 00:00:30.090
that we've been doing to bring
more users to the Play Store

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.259
and to you.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.990
I'll touch a bit on search
and discovery and some tips

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.796
to improve discoverability
of your app on Play.

00:00:38.796 --> 00:00:41.170
Then I want to talk also a
little bit about best practice

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.200
to reach users outside of Play.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.560
And finally, Bruce will also
talk about how to leverage

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.290
Google's paid
promotion solutions

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.330
to acquire even more
users for your app.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.930
So let's start with
the marketing campaigns

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.180
that we've been running
to drive awareness

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.170
and bring more users
to Google Play.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.250
Nice picture out here--
we've been investing heavily

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.830
in promoting Google
Play around the world

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.380
and running marketing campaigns
so that users know about all

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.260
the high-quality apps and
content available on the store.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.500
This is an example of an outdoor
campaign in Waterloo station

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.530
here in London where we've been
featuring great apps and games.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.980
We've also done
similar campaigns

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.540
in Piccadilly Circus and
New York in Times Square.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.840
We've also been
running TV commercials

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.540
in several countries,
such as UK and Japan.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.930
On the left, you see what we
call a "Play Your Heart Out"

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.630
television commercial.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.730
And on the right is a television
commercial specific to games.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.790
And again, these heavily
feature Google Play content,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.270
including apps and games.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.930
Here are some examples
of digital campaigns

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.540
that we've been running
in the UK and the US.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.770
As you can see, Google
Play brand and the content

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.210
are featured prominently in
the mastheads of websites--

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.350
bring attention to Play, drive
users to Play in front of you

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.000
guys.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.220
Obviously we are doing
campaigns on mobile as well.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.000
We're running digital
campaigns in Korea,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.710
a couple of other markets.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.680
Here are some examples
of a rich media

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.670
mobile campaign that we have.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.090
And this is what you can
see on tablets and phone

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.950
if you're exposed
to these campaigns.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.400
And being Google,
we're constantly

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.899
pushing the boundaries,
figuring out

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.530
what new things we can do to
promote new apps and games.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.600
Here's an example of an
experiment we did in the US

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.099
with editorial collections
and promotional videos

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.140
in the Google Play Store.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.060
What you see here is a
page on the Google Play

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.430
Store with a video
front and center.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.430
You click on that video.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.942
You see a short
commercial of fun apps

00:02:45.942 --> 00:02:47.650
that you might want
to use in the summer.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.560
And below that is an
editorial collection

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.720
of those same apps that
were featured in the video.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.960
So all that is about bringing
users into the store,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.670
driving awareness, and
driving users to you.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.540
Once the users are
on the Play Store,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.764
how do they discover your app?

00:03:05.764 --> 00:03:08.180
So that's why we need to talk
about search on Google Play.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.810
I'll start with search.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.891
For the average app,
search makes a large share

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:13.390
of installs.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.760
I think we all know that.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.062
As an app developer,
when a user searches

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:19.520
for something that's like your
app, what do you want to do?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.500
You want them to find
your app first, right?

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.530
And optimizing
that process means

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.550
understanding the types of
searches that users are doing

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.270
and making sure that
the data for your app

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.270
supports these searches so that
we can surface these to users.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.007
So what are the types of
searches that users do on Play?

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:38.340
There are two types of searches.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.584
The first is searching by title.

00:03:40.584 --> 00:03:42.500
This is when a user knows
exactly what they're

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.950
looking for.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.150
They know the title of your app.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.150
So all they do is just type
in the title of your app

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.983
into the search bar.

00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:50.614
And they do that
search based on that.

00:03:50.614 --> 00:03:51.530
What's important here?

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.321
The really important
thing to remember here

00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:56.300
is that a high-quality
title is really, really key.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.120
Titles are not just
about branding.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.200
It's important to be as clear
as possible in the title

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.830
to communicate what
the app is about

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.060
and what it does
for the user, right?

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.910
Is your app about
internet radio?

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.460
Is your app about
travel planning?

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.900
Is it about podcasting?

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.580
Make this clear in
the title so that you

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.980
capture the attention
of interested users.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.940
That also makes your app stand
out in a sea of competitors.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.539
And it also helps us surface
you in relevant search queries.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.300
Second type of
search that users do

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.794
is when they don't know exactly
what they're looking for,

00:04:29.794 --> 00:04:31.210
and they're searching
by keywords.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.710
And these keywords
might correspond

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.610
to features in your
app or characteristics

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.750
of your app or game.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.660
So for example, my friend
might tell me, hey,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.540
there's this new cool game out.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.240
It has something to do with
puzzles and goblins, right?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.300
So I might search for
puzzle games with goblins

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.977
and see what comes out of there.

00:04:46.977 --> 00:04:48.560
What supports these
kinds of searches?

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.370
This is where your store
listing is really important.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.570
Your app's description should
clearly tell us and tell users

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.760
what your app does and why
it matches to users, right?

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.430
Make sure that you get all
that information up front.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.000
And once that's
done, then you can

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.795
brag about how
successful your app is,

00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:07.420
all the awards you've
won and so forth.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.040
But make sure front and
center right at the top

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.755
tells what your app
does, why it matters.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.420
So getting users to
your store listing

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.490
to land on there from search is
just one part of the equation.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.120
The other part is getting them
to download, hit that Install

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.750
button, convert
them in that way,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.400
reaching the users that way.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.030
So keep in mind that there
are many users out there who

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.795
judge apps by the quality of
the screenshots and videos.

00:05:31.795 --> 00:05:33.670
Because if you haven't
downloaded an app yet,

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.920
there's no other
way you can tell

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.530
what that app is like when you
actually have it on your phone.

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.480
So make sure you have
high-quality screenshots

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.150
and videos that the
user can scan through.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.440
And the more you can communicate
what the app experience is

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.010
like, the more likely it is that
users will download your app.

00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:53.610
Of course, you don't
have to do all the work

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:54.750
when it comes to search.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.450
Google Play is constantly
collecting statistics

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.490
about installs,
uninstalls, and install

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.020
retention and engagement.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.470
And apps that are successful
in all of these metrics

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.520
are more likely to be highly
ranked in search results.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.560
So what does that mean?

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.840
It means that the most
important thing you can do

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.680
is to create the best
experience for your users

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.030
no matter what your app does.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.900
Because if you've got a
great app that users love,

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.066
they're going to install it.

00:06:17.066 --> 00:06:18.570
They're less likely
to uninstall it.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.140
If they do uninstall
it at some point,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.940
they will keep it for a
long time, finish playing

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.030
through the game, whatever,
before they uninstall it.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.785
And they will be very engaged.

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:26.607
They'll spend a lot
of time on your app.

00:06:26.607 --> 00:06:28.440
And these are the signals
that we pick up on

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.200
to recognize what is
a high-quality app.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.570
So sometimes users
might just want

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.370
to browse through the Play Store
and check on new apps, right?

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.580
That's discovery by browsing.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.163
And there are generally
two categories

00:06:41.163 --> 00:06:42.310
that browsing falls into.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.950
The first is browsing
on the Apps homepage,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.950
and the second is browsing
through top charts.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.450
So when a user opens
the Play Store,

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.610
we all know where
the Apps homepage is.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.110
You tap Apps, and then you get
to this place called the Apps

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.630
homepage.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.440
And here is where
users can discover apps

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.390
from different clusters
and categories.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.700
For example, they might
find new and updated apps,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.960
health and fitness apps,
communication apps.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.880
And this page is
personalized for each user,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.070
so remember that.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.780
So the Apps homepage is
a browsing experience

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.150
that let's Google
Play offer great apps

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:15.950
that the user may
be interested in.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.330
And finally there's top charts.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.870
So these lists, like
top-selling, top apps,

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.440
top grossing, top new,
trending, are common ways

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.360
that we provide for
both new and returning

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.200
users to quickly discover
the most popular apps.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.820
So that's search and discovery
on Play, some quick little tips

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.846
on how to improve
discoverability.

00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:38.220
Now I'd like to talk about a
few more concrete things you

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.250
can do to acquire users for
your app outside of Play.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.460
So you've built your app.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.060
You've published it.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.480
You obviously want
to publicize it

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:51.264
on your website, marketing
material, ad campaigns,

00:07:51.264 --> 00:07:52.680
social media
channels, everything.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.970
Get it out there.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:55.912
Remember to use Google
Play official badging

00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:56.620
when you do that.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:57.430
That's really important.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.960
Why?

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.030
Because users are 47% more
likely to trust and download

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.575
your app when they
see that badge.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.550
If you happen to have a web
service that accompanies

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.902
your mobile app or users
use your service across web

00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:15.360
and mobile, it
makes a lot of sense

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.280
to also consider using Google
sign-in on your website

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.880
so that users who sign
in with a Google account

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.800
have the option to
send your app directly

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.021
to their device over the air.

00:08:25.021 --> 00:08:26.520
It just works like
that, like magic.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.710
You sign in one time
on your website.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.760
The user gets this button
that says Install On Device.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.774
You tap that, bang, it appears
on your device seconds later.

00:08:34.774 --> 00:08:37.190
And what's even better is that
once the user is signing in

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.760
on your device, he's
also automatically signed

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.804
in on the app.

00:08:40.804 --> 00:08:42.470
So there's no friction
at all in getting

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.330
that user into
your app that way.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:49.170
So developers have seen
a 40% install acceptance

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:49.965
rate using this.

00:08:49.965 --> 00:08:52.256
So this is really worth doing,
really worth trying out.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.680
Now we all know
that social media

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.140
is really important
for acquiring users.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.260
And YouTube is a great
marketing channel

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.300
for apps, especially games.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.070
We have a huge audience of
potentially interested users.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.980
And this survey by Blitz
found that about 95% of gamers

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.430
discover new games by watching
gameplay videos or trailers.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.670
That's significantly more
than the percentage of users

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.950
who discover games by reading
reviews, going to game makers'

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.420
websites, and so forth.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.620
So think about creating
a YouTube channel

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.100
to share your game trailers,
to share gameplay videos, game

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.390
tips, even user-generated
content around your games

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.540
if you're a game developer,
to engage and acquire

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.195
potential new users.

00:09:37.195 --> 00:09:38.910
If you're an app
developer, think

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.710
about how this might
apply to you as well.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.909
Maybe you want to create-- if
it's, for example, a utility

00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:45.950
or productivity app, you
want to create a channel

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.620
that shares tips around
how you can use your app

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.090
to drive productivity
in your life.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.080
Finally, one more thing you
can do to acquire more users,

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.645
which is if you have a
portfolio of apps, and your app

00:10:01.645 --> 00:10:04.820
shows ads, you can show
free house ads using AdMob

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.410
and promote your
other apps for free.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.730
This works because users
who downloaded one or more

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.840
of your apps already
know your product

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.570
and should be more receptive
to other apps that you offer.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.080
So this is offered for free.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.580
Try it out.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.520
It's no harm trying, definitely.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.880
So that's some of
the things that you

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.960
can do to acquire
users for free.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.730
Now I'd like to welcome Bruce to
talk about how you can leverage

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.130
Google Play's paid promotion
solutions to acquire

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.000
even more users for your apps.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.244
Bruce.

00:10:39.244 --> 00:10:44.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.100
BRUCE KERR-PETERSON: Hello.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.130
Thank you very much, Shannon.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.755
It's always difficult to follow
something about paid promotions

00:10:49.755 --> 00:10:52.280
when the last sentence is
about doing it for free.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.240
So my name's Bruce
Kerr-Peterson.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.720
I help developers find the right
users for their applications

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.330
through paid promotions.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.160
You as developers
are just developing

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.787
these incredible applications.

00:11:04.787 --> 00:11:06.870
Some of the things that
Ellie talked about earlier

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.980
are just brilliant.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.730
The next step, though,
is to actually find

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:15.070
users to download and engage
with your application.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.250
Today I'm going to show you
how you can drive discovery

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.420
and engagement through
our paid solutions.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.019
There are millions
of apps out there.

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:27.560
Take some time to think about
how you could possibly leverage

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.430
some of these to actually
make your app stand out,

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.500
stand out from the crowd.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.480
When I speak to app
developers, the first thing

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.580
that jumps to mind when
it comes to app promotion

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.820
is in-app promotion.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.870
However, when you
think about your user,

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.340
your user can be found in
multiple different places.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.530
And it's not just
about an app promotion.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.430
Every day, our
advertising solutions

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.240
are becoming smarter
and more effective.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.460
We currently have the
ability to advertise

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.960
on three great platforms.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.290
There are 2 billion
video hours watched

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.170
on YouTube mobile per month.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.880
There are 100 billion searches
on google.com per month.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.980
And through AdMob, we can reach
900 million unique devices

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.210
per month.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:15.720
So the question
really comes then,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.280
how do you choose
the right campaign?

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.970
And that logic comes
down to the users

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:22.212
that you're trying
to engage with.

00:12:22.212 --> 00:12:26.250
Do you just want those
users to download your app

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.937
and actually open it
for once, one time?

00:12:28.937 --> 00:12:30.770
Or do you actually want
them to open that up

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.867
and take a very specific
action and continue

00:12:32.867 --> 00:12:34.825
to open that up and take
very specific actions?

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.709
I was speaking to a
developer the other day.

00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:41.250
She had done a lot
of market research

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.430
about her financial
management app.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.630
And she found an app that could
really meet a consumer need.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.950
She developed the app,
and it was brilliant.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:53.630
The difficulty she was finding
was actually driving discovery

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.230
and getting that app installed
and for users to actually use

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.120
that app.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.880
It's a common
conversation that I have,

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.130
and it's one of the
biggest problems.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.920
You're out there developing
these revolutionary apps

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.640
that consumers and users might
not have even thought about.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:12.000
The possibilities within
these apps are untold.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.380
And that's why using things like
YouTube and TrueView campaigns

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.220
is such a great way to
explain what your app does

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.830
to the users that could
potentially be using it.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.240
These campaigns help reach
people on YouTube who

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.210
are actively watching
or have watched

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.490
videos that are related to
applications like yours,

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:35.060
or have an interest
in similar apps.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.560
Ad rules will only
show these ads

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.655
to people on relevant devices,
and not on desktop or computer.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.740
One of the things that
YouTube is very well known for

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.850
is boosting awareness.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.290
This is a great example of
when a situation has happened

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.865
and awareness has been boosted.

00:13:56.865 --> 00:14:00.360
Game Of War-- Fire Age was
developed by Machine Zone.

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.810
It was the top-grossing
app on iOS and Android.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.280
The goal for them when they
started their YouTube campaigns

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.070
was to drive a high
volume of engaged users

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.027
to install their app
and play it again.

00:14:13.027 --> 00:14:15.110
Once they launched those
campaigns and the results

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.580
were in, they figured out that
the value of the users coming

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.400
from YouTube and those
campaigns were 15% more valuable

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.280
than any other video platform.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.830
YouTube is an incredibly
powerful platform to use.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.970
It can be used for both
branding and performance.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.272
Performance and Google
search-- the two words

00:14:36.272 --> 00:14:37.105
are very synonymous.

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.580
An increasingly more powerful
way to drive user engagement

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.320
is through the mobile
search network.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.550
Mobile app install campaigns
on the search network

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.880
help people who are already
looking for apps or businesses

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.140
like yours find your app.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.990
The key to creating
any successful search

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.440
campaign, as many of you know,
comes down to the keywords.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.970
And Shannon touched
on it a bit earlier.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.250
These keywords, and through
the new user interface,

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.290
can be generated through
pulling in keywords

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:12.270
from Google Play
and Google Search

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.294
to give you a few suggestions
that you could use.

00:15:15.294 --> 00:15:16.710
In addition to
that, you can think

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.084
about what your
app actually does

00:15:18.084 --> 00:15:20.550
and the functionality that
your app has within it

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.370
and use those words
in combination

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.880
with the word "app"-- for
example, hotel app, car app,

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.855
shopping app.

00:15:27.855 --> 00:15:29.230
In addition to
that, you can look

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.096
at brand words, brand keywords
and long-tail keywords.

00:15:32.096 --> 00:15:33.720
These are particularly
useful if you're

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.500
trying to drive towards a
very aggressive target CPI.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.110
In addition to mobile app
install campaigns on the search

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.620
network, you also
have the ability

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.970
to use mobile app install ad
campaigns with extensions.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.370
So it's not always
the case that you only

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.600
want to drive app downloads.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.130
It could be possible that your
web presence is incredibly

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.990
strong, and you have
an equal preference

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.780
to whether you get a website
click or an app download.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.550
So in this particular
case, using app extensions

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.630
like the ones described
by Rhonda Hanson

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.330
can be an excellent way to
give the user the opportunity

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.670
to do one or the other.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.640
So as I mentioned before, one
of the most used advertising

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.600
platforms is through
an app or AdMob.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.305
And these types
of campaigns drive

00:16:32.305 --> 00:16:35.164
a huge volume of impressions.

00:16:35.164 --> 00:16:37.080
Now, that volume of
impressions is a great way

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.470
to get your awareness
out there and to make

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.930
users aware of the type
of app that you have.

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.820
They're very easy to set up.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.140
You literally select
your app and what

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.140
you want to promote
it on, and we'll

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.740
set up the rest of
the campaign for you.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.590
In the long run, you can
use a conversion optimizer

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.230
as well to maintain that
campaign, that sustainability,

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.060
towards the target CPI.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.379
The shift of the
focus in the past

00:17:04.379 --> 00:17:06.589
has largely been on these
large burst campaigns that

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.069
would get you up the rankings.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:09.907
However, what we see
more and more now

00:17:09.907 --> 00:17:11.990
is marketers and developers
working on longer term

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.329
strategies to make sure
that they can profitably

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.730
drive these app downloads
and then follow that up

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.855
with engagement strategies.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.410
As we've discovered,
in-app advertising

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:27.171
is one of the fundamental parts
to an advertising campaign.

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:32.430
App promotions ads are templated
to create text, banner,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:35.700
and interstitial ad
formats, driving users

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.450
to either the iTunes store
or the Google Play Store.

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.170
These ads run on mobile
search, on GDN, and in apps,

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.070
and are the most
effective format

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.060
for driving app downloads.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.890
Once again, reaching
the right user

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.674
is not just about
in-app promotion.

00:17:52.674 --> 00:17:55.090
Developers and marketers are
looking at more holistic ways

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.720
to reach these consumers.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.370
And that's done through Google
Search, the Display Network,

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.720
and YouTube.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.480
And these can all
be done and managed

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.190
through the AdWords interface.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.480
Remember, these ads are smart.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.339
They're purpose built to
help drive app downloads.

00:18:11.339 --> 00:18:12.880
The first step, as
I've just covered,

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.460
is very much about discovery,
driving app downloads.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.950
The second step is
about engagement.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:21.200
And this is really where you
get to push that lifetime

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.960
value of your users
and to increase

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.630
the profitability of
your app over time.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:30.800
Users need to be kept updated
to what's going on in your app.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.292
Otherwise it acts as a silo.

00:18:32.292 --> 00:18:33.750
And they never
really know when you

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:37.440
have new updates or potentially
different games or levels

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.320
that they can play.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.720
So through paid
promotion, I'll show you

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.610
a couple of ways in
which you can reengage

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.660
with those users over time
to sustainably increase

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.170
the profitability of your app.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:55.760
So in order to do that,
there are really two ways.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.070
The first is through
app engagement campaigns

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.230
on the Display Network.

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.030
These are app
engagement ads that

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:05.220
are targeted towards
users who already

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.610
have your app installed.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:10.600
It encourages the user
to open up your app

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.010
and to engage again
with the content.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:17.270
On the Search Network, it
is a similar principle.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.620
App engagement campaigns on
the Search Network target

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:22.870
users who already have
your app installed.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.830
They drive people
back into the app.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.590
And the aim is to make the
action relate to the search

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:34.030
query that they have just
searched on to get them there.

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.310
So the question is, how do you
relate that search query back

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:39.160
to the content within your app?

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.300
And that really comes
down to deep linking.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.660
For ads on the web, just
to give you an analogy,

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.805
you would have your
landing page example.com.

00:19:49.805 --> 00:19:52.380
But driving users to
example.com might not

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.930
be the best user experience.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:55.640
So we make it more specific.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.840
If this user searches
for shoes, you drive them

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.180
to example.com/shoes.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.901
That principle is
the same for apps.

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:03.150
It's just called deep linking.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.280
So to give you a few examples of
how it could potentially work--

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.060
and some of these might
relate to the apps

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.820
that you actually have--
when a user is logged in

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:17.690
and they actually have
the app on their device,

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.110
they could search for
flights to Beijing

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.800
on the Google Search Network.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:28.541
And you could direct them into
your app to flights to China.

00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:31.040
Winter coats would be another
example where the search would

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.790
be winter coats, and
you could direct them

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.530
into your app on the Coats page.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.196
And lastly, if the user was
searching for Boston movie

00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:38.945
times, you could direct
them into your app

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:42.840
to the Boston Showtimes page.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.460
To give you some gaming
examples as well--

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.080
because they are
kind of interesting.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.230
If, for example, a
user was searching

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.980
on the Search Network
for a gaming app,

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.680
you could potentially
show them an ad

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.141
that's related to that
query if they once again had

00:20:57.141 --> 00:20:58.890
your app installed on
their phone already,

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.400
or their tablet, driving
them back into your app

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.500
to a page that said Play Again.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.960
And once again, instead of
them looking for other apps

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.751
to download, other
gaming apps to download,

00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:11.420
you drive them back into
your app to reengage.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.100
Or if you know
that your users get

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:15.560
stuck on a particular
level within your game,

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.760
for example, level 10, and they
would go onto Google Search

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.730
to figure out how
to beat level 10,

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.240
you could have an ad that
triggered for the search query,

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.524
"beating Game Of War--
Fire Age, level 10."

00:21:26.524 --> 00:21:28.190
You could direct them
back into your app

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.879
to a page where they could
potentially purchase something

00:21:30.879 --> 00:21:32.420
that would help them
beat that level,

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.961
or take them to a
special level where

00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:36.870
they could progress from there.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.630
So it's a very, very powerful
way of engaging and tailoring

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.240
your apps to your
specific audience.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.590
So that's very much
on the Search Network.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.447
On the display
side of things, we

00:21:47.447 --> 00:21:49.780
fall back on something that's
slightly more traditional.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.450
And that's remarketing.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.110
So you can remarket in apps.

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:56.960
These remarketing
lists are created

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.675
once your app has
been downloaded

00:21:58.675 --> 00:22:01.100
and you add people
to specific lists.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:05.200
You can then retarget them while
they're engaging in other apps

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.200
with content that
is relevant to them

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.950
and can help them come
back into your app

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.970
and take a specific action.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.620
I'll give you three examples of
lists that are commonly used.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.900
So people who didn't use your
app recently-- so your app's

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.130
been downloaded.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:22.270
You've taken the effort.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:25.000
You pay the money to actually
have your app downloaded.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.230
But your app hasn't been engaged
with in the past 30 days.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.160
You could add that cohort of
users to a particular list

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.900
that you could retarget with
messaging that encourages them

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.690
to come back into your app and
either look at a new feature

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:38.310
or take a particular action.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.680
But in that way you can
drive that reengagement.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.011
If people are using a
specific version of your app

00:22:44.011 --> 00:22:46.510
and haven't taken advantage of
some of the cool features you

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.890
might have developed,
you can once again

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.740
tailor a message to
them where you explain

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.770
some of these new features and
what they could potentially

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:59.730
use by going back into
your app and upgrading.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.380
People who took a specific
action in your app,

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.860
if you know that a
percentage of your app users

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.510
are the ones that
monetize very well,

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.770
you could add them to
a cohort or a group.

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.410
And you could retarget
them with discounts,

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.500
or particular offers,
or new features

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.221
that they could
potentially purchase.

00:23:15.221 --> 00:23:17.220
And in that way you're
really, really increasing

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.696
the lifetime value of that app.

00:23:18.696 --> 00:23:20.070
And that drives
the profitability

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.330
of that app in the long run.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.580
Now, when you think
of these two combined,

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.680
it becomes very, very powerful.

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.650
So you have the deep
link on one hand,

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.000
and you have the remarketing
and reengagement on the other.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.740
But imagine if you combine
that into one ad format

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.540
where you can tailor and group
people into specific lists.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.790
You then show them ads that are
very particular to that group,

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.731
and deep link them
back into your app,

00:23:47.731 --> 00:23:49.230
where they can take
actions that are

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:51.670
very specific to the
particular user group

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:56.460
that they are and related to
the app where they'll find them.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.860
It's an incredibly powerful
way of retargeting people

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.790
and increasing that
engagement over time.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.445
And it's one in
which it's really

00:24:03.445 --> 00:24:05.507
going to drive the lifetime
value and, as I said,

00:24:05.507 --> 00:24:06.715
the profitability of the app.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.830
So in closing, paid
promotion is all

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.520
about reaching the right
user at the right time.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.430
It's always been about that.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.054
The first step is
driving up discovery.

00:24:22.054 --> 00:24:23.470
Shannon talked
about ways in which

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:24.759
that could be done for free.

00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:26.550
And these are some of
the ways in which you

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:28.690
can do it through
paid promotion.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.930
The second step is
consistently engaging

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.980
with that user over time.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:36.000
Thank you very much
for all your time

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.980
and for consistently pushing the
boundaries of what is possible

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.400
so that we can all build better
products for our consumers.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.530
I'm going to hand over to
Matteo, who once again is going

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.620
to talk to you about free ways
to engage with your users.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.470
Thank you very much.
