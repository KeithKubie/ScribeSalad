00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.550
The line 2x plus y equals 1
is tangent to the hyperbola

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.670
x squared over a squared
minus y squared over b squared

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.940
equals 1.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.570
If this line passes through
the point of intersection

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.960
of the nearest directrix
and the x-axis,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.890
then the eccentricity of
the hyperbola is-- so let's

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.140
just set this up so we know
what this is even asking.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.550
Let me draw the
hyperbola itself.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.390
So that is my x-axis.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.140
That is my y-axis.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.330
And this will be a
left/right opening hyperbola

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.780
since the x squared
term here is positive.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.540
So it will open to
the right like this.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.000
It'll open to the
right like that.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.407
And it will open to
the left like-- I

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:44.240
could draw it a little
bit neater than that.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.760
It'll open to the
left like this.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.450
So that's our hyperbola
right over there.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.880
And then this point of
intersection right over here,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.940
if you set y is equal to 0, x
would be equal to positive a.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.390
So this the point a comma 0.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.750
This right here is the
point negative a comma 0.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.532
x could be plus or minus
a when y is equal to 0.

00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:06.990
And just so we have some of a
terminology for the hyperbola

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.480
out of the way,
the hyperbola will

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.040
have two foci, two focus points.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.180
So let's say that this
is one focus point.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.840
Let me do this in another color.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.740
This is one focus
point right over here.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.740
It'll be on this major axis
of symmetry for the hyperbola.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.030
And let's call that point F.
Let's call that point F comma

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.899
0, where F is the x-coordinate.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.440
And then we'll have
another one right

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.540
over here at negative F comma 0.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.450
It'll also have two directrices.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.630
I don't know what the
plural of directrix is.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.140
But these are lines, and we'll
talk about the relationship

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.340
between the hyperbola, the
foci, and the directrices

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.260
in a second.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.410
But these would be lines.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.590
One of them would
sit right about here.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.200
Let me do this in another color.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.265
So you'd have a directrix
right over here.

00:01:56.265 --> 00:02:01.300
And you'd have another
directrix right over here.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.670
Let me draw it a little
straighter than that.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.970
For this type of left/right
opening hyperbola,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.639
the directrices would be
vertical right over there.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.950
And the relationship between
the directrix, the foci,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.800
and the eccentricity
is you take any point.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.280
You take any point
on the hyperbola,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.070
and the distance from that
point to its closest directrix--

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.620
so for this point, it would
be this directrix right here.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.140
Unfortunately, this doesn't
look like a straight line,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.806
but it's supposed to
be a straight line.

00:02:30.806 --> 00:02:35.950
So this distance right over
here to that directrix--

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.420
so this is the distance.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.490
Let me call it the
distance to the directrix.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.350
And let me call
this the distance--

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.300
this is the distance to
the focus on this side,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.490
the distance to the focus.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.050
The eccentricity is the ratio of
this distance to that distance.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.770
So the ratio of the distance
to the focus over the distance

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.170
to the directrix is equal
to the eccentricity.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.345
So at least now that we
have the setup of everything

00:03:04.345 --> 00:03:05.220
we need to deal with.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.860
Now let's actually try
to solve the problem.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.710
So they give us this line.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.180
The line is 2x plus
y is equal to 1.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.270
And they say it's
tangent to the hyperbola.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.400
And they say this line
passes through the point

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.140
of intersection of the nearest
directrix and the x-axis.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.090
So it intersects the x-axis
where one of the directrices

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.295
intersect the x-axis.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.170
And we know where this
intersects the x-axis.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.420
We can set y equal to 0.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.150
If y is equal to 0, we
get 2x is equal to 1,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.330
just the y disappears.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.190
You get x is equal to 1/2.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.230
So it intersects the x-axis
right over there at 1/2 comma

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.780
0.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.850
And so we know from
this information

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.470
right over here
that this directrix

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.472
must be the line
x is equal to 1/2.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:00.930
And actually, we can draw the
rest of this line right here.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.950
Its y-intercept,
when x is equal to 0,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.700
y is going to be equal to 1.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.290
So that is the y-intercept.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.220
And so this line is
going to look something

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.870
like-- let me do
it in a new color.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.320
The line will look
something like this,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.100
and it will be tangent
to the hyperbola.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.540
Now, our goal is to figure
out this eccentricity.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.590
And to do that, I'm just going
to lay out all of the formulas

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.470
I know that we've proven-- and
I think we've proven all of them

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.450
in previous Khan Academy
videos-- related to parabolas--

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.690
I'm sorry, not parabolas--
hyperbolas, eccentricity,

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.694
focal point, and
directrices, and then

00:04:41.694 --> 00:04:44.110
see if we can do a little bit
of fancy algebra to do this.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.568
And as you know, I don't like
to just regurgitate formulas.

00:04:46.568 --> 00:04:48.930
That's why we've taken
some pains to prove them.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.012
But if you're doing this for
especially the IIT exam, where

00:04:52.012 --> 00:04:53.470
you don't have a
lot of time, it is

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.070
good to have them very
quickly at your disposal.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.580
So in the last video, we
came up with the relationship

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.070
between a tangent
line and a hyperbola.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.750
We said if the tangent
line has the equation

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.610
y is equal to mx
plus c-- and I use

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.630
c here not to get confused
with the b in the hyperbola--

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.570
we figured out a relationship
between the m, c,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.505
the a, and the b.

00:05:18.505 --> 00:05:24.190
And the relationship we showed
in the last video was c squared

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.730
plus b squared is equal to
m squared a squared, where,

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.130
once again, the m and
the c come from the line.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.250
It's the slope and the
y-intercept of the line.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.830
And the a and the b
come from the hyperbola.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.950
So this is one tool that
seems like it might be useful.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.950
The other tool--
and I proved this.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.890
I think if you do a search
on Khan Academy for hyperbola

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.250
and proof, or foci,
hyperbola, and proof,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.760
you get this right here in
that the focal length-- this

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.680
coordinate right over here,
the distance from the origin

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.540
to the focus point
along the x-axis,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.760
or the x-coordinate of this
focal point over here--

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.970
and you could actually
do it for either one

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.344
because you're
squaring it, so it

00:06:06.344 --> 00:06:14.690
becomes positive-- it's equal
to a squared plus b squared.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.489
So this seems like it
might be useful in some way

00:06:17.489 --> 00:06:19.530
if we use all this
information to somehow come up

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.990
with the eccentricity.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.440
And then the last
pieces of information

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.950
that should be useful
for this problem are

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.930
the ones that relate the
eccentricity of a hyperbola

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.052
to its focal point, and
a, and its directrix.

00:06:35.052 --> 00:06:37.010
And so these are-- and
I won't prove them here.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.870
I think I might have proven
them in previous videos.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.703
If I haven't, that's
something for my to-do.

00:06:40.703 --> 00:06:42.549
But these are pretty well known.

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:44.090
If you look it up
on Wikipedia, these

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.190
are well-known expressions
for a hyperbola,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:58.310
is that the focal point is equal
to the eccentricity times a,

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.570
and the eccentricity
is greater than 1.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.710
So this is clearly
greater than a.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.850
So you multiply something
larger than 1 times a,

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.440
you get to the focal point
and also the directrix.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.760
And in this situation,
the directrix we already

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.180
know is at 1/2, is
at x is equal to 1/2.

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.180
But I'll just write
the formula here.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.810
The directrix distance,
so the distance

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.780
from here to the directrix,
is equal to a divided

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.380
by the eccentricity.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.240
And we already know, from the
first part of this problem,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.720
that this is at the
point x is equal to 1/2.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.900
So this is equal to 1/2.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.870
That's this distance right here.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.870
This is the line
x is equal to 1/2.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.815
And this is just a known
formula for hyperbolas,

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:42.190
which I won't
prove in this video

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.970
because then it will
just take forever.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.480
Now let's see if we can
use all of this information

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.786
right over here to solve
for the eccentricity,

00:07:50.786 --> 00:07:52.410
to actually solve
for the eccentricity.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.760
And here, it should
hopefully just

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.549
be a bunch of
algebraic manipulation.

00:07:56.549 --> 00:07:58.840
I just want to get rid of as
many variables as possible

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.930
and then solve for E.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.000
So the first thing I can
do is I can substitute

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.550
for F in this equation
right over here,

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:12.680
and then I have an expression
in terms of E, a, and b.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.290
So if I substitute
for F here, F squared

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.030
is going to be
eccentricity squared

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.140
times a squared-- I'm just
squaring this over here--

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:29.340
is going to be equal to
a squared plus b squared.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.510
And actually, let's
see if we can even

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.580
substitute more using this
information over here.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:40.200
We know that a over the
eccentricity is equal to 1/2.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.679
Or we could say that if
we multiply both sides

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:48.260
by the eccentricity, a is equal
to 1/2 times the eccentricity.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.760
So let's substitute that
into this over here.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:56.140
So then we get eccentricity
squared times a squared.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.210
Instead of writing a squared,
let's just square this thing

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.670
because that's also a squared.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.910
So it's going to be times
the eccentricity squared

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.060
over 4-- that's just a
squared; I'm just substituting

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.190
it-- is equal to the
eccentricity squared

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.960
over 4, once again, a
squared, plus b squared.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.940
And so this will simplify
to the eccentricity

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.810
to the fourth power over 4
is equal to the eccentricity

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:29.142
squared over 4 plus b squared.

00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:31.350
And I don't like having
these 4's in the denominator,

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.140
so let's multiply
both sides by 4.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.090
We get the eccentricity
to the fourth power

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:43.550
is equal to the eccentricity
squared plus 4b squared.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.020
So we have an expression
in terms of E and b.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.400
And so far, we used this
information, this information,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.270
and this information.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.640
Oh, actually, right, and this
information right over here.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.406
Now let's see if we can
incorporate this somehow.

00:09:59.406 --> 00:10:01.780
And this, that relates the
tangent line to the hyperbola,

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:03.321
is useful because
it actually gave us

00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:04.720
the equation of
the tangent line.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.220
We actually know
that this equation

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.690
right here, if we write
it in slope-intercept,

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.270
the tangent line is y
is equal to-- subtract

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.070
2x from both sides--
negative 2x plus 1.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.150
So m is negative 2.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.760
And normally, we
would call this b,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.551
but I don't want to
confuse it with this b.

00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:23.040
We call it c in this formula.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.450
Our y-intercept is 1.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.360
So this expression right
over here, let's rewrite it.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.430
So we have c
squared-- I'll do it

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.630
in green-- c squared
is 1 squared.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.920
So we have 1 plus--
we don't know

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:42.110
what b squared is-- so 1 plus b
squared is equal to m squared.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:43.890
We know that m is negative 2.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:48.480
Negative 2 squared is
4, 4 times a squared.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.990
Now, instead of
putting an a there,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.740
we already have an expression
in terms of E and b,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.760
so let's put this in
terms of our eccentricity.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.730
We know that a is the same thing
as 1/2 times the eccentricity,

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.780
or so we can write this 4 times
the eccentricity-- actually,

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.520
this is an epsilon, not an E.
4 times, we just square this.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.760
Eccentricity squared over
eccentricity squared over 4.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.830
I just squared this over here.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.840
And so these will
cancel out, and so we

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.850
have another equation,
that 1 plus b squared

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:26.330
is equal to the
eccentricity squared.

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.121
Or we can subtract
1 from both sides.

00:11:28.121 --> 00:11:29.620
And I want to do
that so that we can

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.610
substitute for b
squared up in this.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.469
We really only have two
formulas now or two equations,

00:11:34.469 --> 00:11:35.510
and we have two unknowns.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:38.051
So in theory, we should be able
to solve for the eccentricity

00:11:38.051 --> 00:11:38.750
now.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.150
So we have this.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.570
Let's just solve for b squared.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.760
So we get b squared is equal
to the eccentricity squared

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.360
minus 1.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.330
And then we can substitute
this back in for b squared

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.350
and see if we can actually
solve for the eccentricity.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.150
So then this
expression up here is--

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.660
we have the eccentricity
to the fourth

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.670
is equal to the
eccentricity squared

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.460
plus 4 times b squared,
which is this, which

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.800
is the eccentricity
squared minus 1.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.720
And now we have a fourth-degree
polynomial in eccentricity,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.620
but let's see if we
can still solve it.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.080
Hopefully, they're not going to
give us something too painful.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.370
So we have the
eccentricity to the fourth

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.450
is equal to eccentricity
squared plus 4 times

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:30.440
the eccentricity
squared minus 4.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.740
Now let's bring all of that
on to the left-hand side.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.070
So we're going to subtract
all of this from both sides.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.430
And we get-- all right,
this is a new color.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.970
The eccentricity to
the fourth power,

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.506
these two over here--
actually, let me merge them.

00:12:42.506 --> 00:12:45.020
This is 1 times
eccentricity squared

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.580
plus 4 times
eccentricity squared.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.030
So this is 5 epsilon
squared or 5 times

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.410
the eccentricity squared.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.530
We're going to subtract
it from the other side.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.330
So this becomes minus 5 times
the eccentricity squared.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.730
And then we're going
to add 4 to both sides.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.110
So plus 4 is equal to 0.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.029
And now we just have to
solve for eccentricity.

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:09.820
Now, at first, this
might seem complicated,

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.290
but this is actually a
very factorable polynomial.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.320
Think of two numbers,
two factors of 4

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.940
that add up to negative 5.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.089
And hopefully, negative 4
and negative 1 pop to mind.

00:13:23.089 --> 00:13:24.380
So we can actually factor this.

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.770
No quadratic formula necessary.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.270
This is factorable
into epsilon squared

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:37.040
minus 4 times epsilon
squared minus 1.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.860
Negative 4 times
negative 1 is positive 4.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.024
If you add the two,
you get negative 5.

00:13:41.024 --> 00:13:42.940
And if this confuses you
with the fourth power

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.460
and the squared, you
could do a substitution.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.668
So you could say-- I don't
know-- some random letter.

00:13:46.668 --> 00:13:48.510
Call it some letter
we haven't used yet.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.770
Call it the letter-- we already
used F. Call it the letter g.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.680
You could say that g is
equal to epsilon squared,

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.190
and then this would become
g squared minus 5g plus 4.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.980
And then this just becomes kind
of a traditional factorable

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.030
quadratic.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:05.540
But this is equal to 0.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.980
And so there's going to be two
solutions over here, actually

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.700
more than two solutions.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.390
So you have epsilon squared
minus 4 is equal to 0

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.770
and epsilon squared
minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.110
This one is epsilon squared
is equal to positive 4.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:24.529
This one is epsilon
squared is equal to 1.

00:14:24.529 --> 00:14:26.070
If we were to just
solve this and not

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.550
think about what eccentricity
is trying to tell us,

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:31.650
we would get plus or minus
2 here, eccentricity.

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.400
And we would get eccentricity is
equal to plus or minus 1 here.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.840
And now the key realization
is the eccentricity

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.140
for a hyperbola is
always greater than 1.

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.670
So the only eccentricity
here that is greater than 1

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.440
is positive 2.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.080
The other ones are either
1, or they're negative.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.920
So the only thing greater
than 1 is positive 2.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:57.800
So the eccentricity of our
hyperbola is positive 2.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.272
And we're done.
