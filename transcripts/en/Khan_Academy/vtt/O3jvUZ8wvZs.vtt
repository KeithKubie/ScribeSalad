00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.184
- [Instructor] We're asked
to convert 150 degrees

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:07.101
and negative 45 degrees to radians.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.139
Let's think about the relationship

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.545
between degrees and
radians, and to do that,

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:15.361
let me just draw a little circle here.

00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:16.907
So that's the center of the circle,

00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:19.939
and then do my best shot, best attempt

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.206
to freehand draw a
reasonable-looking circle.

00:00:24.206 --> 00:00:27.373
That's not, I've done worse than that.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:32.155
Alright, now, if we were to go in degrees,

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:34.688
if we were to go one
time around the circle

00:00:34.688 --> 00:00:37.688
like that, how many degrees is that?

00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:42.072
We know that that would be 360 degrees.

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:47.388
If we did the same thing,
how many radians is that,

00:00:47.388 --> 00:00:51.488
if we were to go all the
way around the circle?

00:00:51.488 --> 00:00:53.465
We just have to remember,
when we're measuring

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:55.221
in terms of radians, we're really talking

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.739
about the arc that subtends that angle.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.538
So if you go all the way around,

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:01.655
you're really talking about the arc length

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:03.704
of the entire circle, or essentially

00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:05.137
the circumference of the circle.

00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:07.238
And you're essentially
saying, how many radius's

00:01:07.238 --> 00:01:09.738
this is, or radii, or how many

00:01:11.712 --> 00:01:13.522
radii is the circumference of the circle.

00:01:13.522 --> 00:01:18.021
You know a circumference
of a circle is two pi

00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:19.963
times the radius, or you could say

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:22.171
that the length of the circumference

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:24.671
of the circle is two pi radii.

00:01:28.562 --> 00:01:30.597
If you wanna know the
exact length, you just have

00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:33.590
to get the length of the radius
and multiply it by two pi.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.787
That just comes from the, really, actually

00:01:36.787 --> 00:01:39.421
the definition of pi, but
it comes from what we know

00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:43.554
as the formula for the
circumference of a circle.

00:01:43.554 --> 00:01:45.025
If we were to go all the way around this,

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:47.358
this is also two pi radians.

00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:57.836
That tells us that two pi radians,

00:02:00.205 --> 00:02:03.069
as an angle measure, is
the exact same thing,

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:05.902
and I'm gonna write it out, as 360

00:02:07.352 --> 00:02:08.352
360 degrees.

00:02:10.503 --> 00:02:12.752
And then we can take
all of this relationship

00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:14.236
and manipulate it in different ways.

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:15.535
If we wanna simplify a little bit,

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.869
we can divide both sides
of this equation by two,

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.135
in which case, you are left with,

00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:22.585
if you divide both sides by two,

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:24.918
you are left with pi radians

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.569
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:42.437
How can we use this relationship now

00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:45.270
to figure out what 150 degrees is?

00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:50.197
Well, this relationship, we could write it

00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:51.101
in different ways.

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:53.551
We could divide both sides by 180 degrees,

00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:55.801
and we could get pi radians

00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:00.084
over 180 degrees

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.901
is equal to one, which is just another way

00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:07.834
of saying that there are pi radians

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:10.366
for every 180 degrees, or you could say,

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:12.949
pi over 180 radians per degree.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.266
The other option, you could divide

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:17.789
both sides of this by pi radians.

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.882
You could say, you would
get on the left hand side

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:23.400
you'd get one, and you would also get,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.717
on the right hand side,
you would get 180 degrees

00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:27.467
for every pi radians.

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:37.005
Or you could interpret this as 180

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:39.255
over pi degrees per radian.

00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:44.692
How would we figure out, how
would we do what they asked us?

00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:47.005
Let's convert 150 degrees to radians.

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:48.338
Let me write the word out.

00:03:48.338 --> 00:03:49.671
So, 150 degrees.

00:03:54.238 --> 00:03:56.056
Well, we wanna convert this to radians,

00:03:56.056 --> 00:04:00.223
so we really care about
how many radians there are

00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:03.578
per degree, actually, let
me do that in that color.

00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:04.528
(typing)

00:04:04.528 --> 00:04:07.028
We care about how many radians

00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:12.038
there are per degree.

00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:16.355
We'll do that same green color.

00:04:17.397 --> 00:04:18.314
Per degree.

00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:20.755
How many radians are there per degree?

00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:23.071
Well, we already know, there's pi radians

00:04:23.071 --> 00:04:26.772
for every 180 degrees, or there are pi...

00:04:26.772 --> 00:04:28.688
Let me do that yellow color.

00:04:28.688 --> 00:04:30.438
There are pi over 180

00:04:34.188 --> 00:04:36.320
radians per degree.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.971
And so, if we multiply,
and this all works out

00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:39.704
because you have degrees in the numerator,

00:04:39.704 --> 00:04:43.437
degrees in the denominator,
these cancel out,

00:04:43.437 --> 00:04:45.986
and so you are left with 150 times pi

00:04:45.986 --> 00:04:48.470
divided by 180 radians.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.970
So what do we get?

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:53.869
This becomes, let me just rewrite it.

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:54.952
150 times pi.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.319
All of that over 180,

00:05:01.994 --> 00:05:05.827
so this is equal to, and
we get it in radians.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.469
And so, if we simplify it, let's see,

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:11.120
we can divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.120
both by, looks like, 30.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.785
So if you divide the
numerator by 30, you get five.

00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:21.735
You divide the denominator
by 30, you get six.

00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:24.752
So you get five pi over six radians,

00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:29.368
or 5/6 pi radians, depending
how you wanna do it.

00:05:29.368 --> 00:05:32.569
Now let's do the same thing
for negative 45 degrees.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.785
What do you get for negative 45 degrees

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:38.704
if you were to convert that to radians?

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:41.104
Same exact process.

00:05:41.104 --> 00:05:44.136
You have negative, and I'll
do this one a little quicker.

00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:46.419
Negative 45 degrees.

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.154
I'll write down the word.

00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:50.154
Times, times pi radians,

00:05:52.838 --> 00:05:55.588
pi radians for every 180 degrees.

00:06:00.154 --> 00:06:02.918
The degrees cancel out, and you're left

00:06:02.918 --> 00:06:06.001
with negative 45 pi over 180 radians.

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:10.501
So this is equal to negative 45 pi

00:06:14.384 --> 00:06:15.217
over 180,

00:06:17.384 --> 00:06:18.801
over 180 radians.

00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:25.539
How can we simplify this?

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:27.169
Well it looks like
they're both, at minimum,

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.586
divisible by nine, nine times five is 45,

00:06:31.968 --> 00:06:34.134
this is nine times 20,
so actually it's gonna be

00:06:34.134 --> 00:06:37.551
divisible by more than just, let's see...

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:41.088
Actually, they're both divisible by 45.

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:42.388
What am I doing?

00:06:42.388 --> 00:06:46.221
If you divide the numerator
by 45, you get one.

00:06:46.221 --> 00:06:48.590
You divide the denominator by 45,

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.323
45 goes into 180 four times.

00:06:51.323 --> 00:06:54.505
You're left with negative
pi over four radians.

00:06:54.505 --> 00:06:56.038
This is equal to negative pi

00:06:56.038 --> 00:06:57.538
over four radians.

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:00.102
And we are done.
