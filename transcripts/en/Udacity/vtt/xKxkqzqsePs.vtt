00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.960
I'm sitting here with Andy Brown, who's
one of the people who heads up a lot of

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.220
our education initiatives
here at Udacity.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.420
And in fact, not long ago, Andy was kind
of lead on transitioning a lot of what

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.710
we do at Udacity to a more project-based
approach, to have students completing

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.720
projects as part of their experience and
learning different skills.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.790
So, thank you so much for
talking to me today,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.150
Andy, about project-based learning.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for doing this.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.785
&gt;&gt; So the first thing I want to ask, and
I think this comes up a lot when we're

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.324
dealing with teachers who want to
do a project-based approach, but

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:26.662
are very stretched for resources.

00:00:26.662 --> 00:00:29.597
Is that project-based learning,
at least in my opinion,

00:00:29.597 --> 00:00:33.180
is much more difficult to implement
in a classroom than some traditional

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.490
instruction of just lecturing or
giving material straight away.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.110
Is it worth the extra effort,
and if so why?

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.311
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's absolutely worth
doing project-based learning.

00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:50.040
And now that there's all sorts of free
resources online there's a lot of free

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.440
time, potentially, for instructors to be
spending their time coming up with and

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.110
helping their students as they go
through these project activities.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.210
There's lots of great explanations, lots
of great sort of static resources out

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.940
there that, they're going to solve a lot
of the sort of, what am I going to say?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.630
How am I going to explain this topic?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.120
And, in fact to me that's not
the interesting part of the teaching.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.630
The interesting part of the teaching
is how am I going to shepherd

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.320
this person along as their
brain transforms, and

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.400
that's best done through
an authentic project.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.010
So, yes it's totally worth it.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.040
It is hard.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.340
&gt;&gt; But it's getting easier.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.695
&gt;&gt; But it's getting easier.

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:25.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.470
&gt;&gt; This is your job if
you've signed up to it.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.990
&gt;&gt; Exactly, I think I've always had
the idea that you just referred to of

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.930
basically building a course around
all these awesome free materials that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.770
are available online.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.350
Because there's so much out there
that wasn't out there before, and

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.090
that led to this class which is
an entire class based largely around

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.800
the materials that
are already free online.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.050
Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel
and represent things that have

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.930
already been presented very well,
let's just see if we can leverage it and

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.650
spend our time on kind of the more
student-focused, mentoring and feedback.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.090
Speaking of feedback, so

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.640
one thing that's very difficult I think
in project-based learning is assessment.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.770
When, you know, I have a bunch
of students who all do the same

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.360
math problem.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.730
I know what the correct answer is.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.480
I know what the steps are.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.120
And, it's very easy for me to go through
and say, you screwed up step two,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.360
you screwed up step four.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:08.960
&gt;&gt; But so what.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.560
What do you know when you've done that?

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.000
But yeah assessment in projects
is more difficult, isn't it?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.490
It's a little more open ended.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.200
&gt;&gt; It is but it's getting more towards
what you actually want to be measuring.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.560
So yes it's very easy to measure my,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.110
some students ability to factor
ten polynomials correctly.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.490
It's just not a very
interesting measurement.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.230
Every now and then you'll find things
that can be assessed that way.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.260
Or really it's very important to know
these facts before you can move on.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.240
But I'm guessing that if you
as an educator ask yourself,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.680
what do I really want?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.760
How do I want to change my students with
this learning experience I'm crafting?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.500
You'll find it's really hard to
phrase that in terms of some

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.580
multiple choice questions or
anything like that.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.400
And this is especially

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.570
a danger when you're doing
online project based learning.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.360
Because multiple choice questions are by
far the easiest things to do online.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.090
Right, wrong, tally up a score.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.350
You have a little green progress bar and
it works.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.340
But that experience just is never
going to be even close to what you can

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.060
get if you try to do
the project based learning.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.650
And I think that we have, many of
our courses, not our courses, but

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.160
courses that are currently
available online, or

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.100
built around these
multiple choice tests.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.420
But you have exactly that,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.960
where often times they have
repeatability built into them.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.810
Which is great,
because you learn from your failures.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.370
You get problems wrong,
you move forward and learn.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.210
But when you have only a small
set of possible answers,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.160
what you're really learning is that
c isn't the answer to that question.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.570
You're not learning the deeper
understanding of what's going on there.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.570
But for a teacher who has dealing with,
for example in our class,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.780
possibly a 100 different projects,
all of which need feedback.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.500
Are there any strategies
to how to give feedback in

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.540
such a way that students can
actually improve on it while doing

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.930
the project as opposed to just finding
out at the end that they already failed.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you can bake feedback into
the nature of the project itself.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.820
So an example for building an HTML,
a webpage let's say.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.170
If you don't know anything
about programming, sorry!

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.680
If you're building a webpage and I say
build a webpage that looks like this and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.710
I give you a little image
that looks like a webpage.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.850
The feedback is pretty natural,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.920
the feedback is like well it
doesn't look like that anymore,

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.279
you don't need the instructor to come
tell you that, the student knows it.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:21.100
And then if you can set up systems
of feedback within students,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.990
you'd be amazed the things
that can happen when you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.670
do the terrifying thing of
stepping back as an instructor and

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.480
just letting your students screw up and
sort of screw up together.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.740
That can be a really amazing
learning experience.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.300
There has to be some constraints placed
on that, but you can do it really well.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.060
So, yeah, if you find yourself staying
up until 4 AM, frantically grading

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.395
100 projects, it's probably not ideal,
and you're probably killing yourself.

00:04:48.395 --> 00:04:51.220
[LAUGH] So, you're probably not giving
the best feedback to your students that

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.310
you could,
because nobody could do that And

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.790
there's probably a more creative
solution that will be just as good.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like there are a lot
of ways that we can go about that,

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.530
like giving exemplars that
a student can, on their own,

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.230
compare their assignment
to some exemplar.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.910
And see where it's different and
where it's similar, maybe

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.140
building in some automated assessment
through some artificial intelligence.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.100
Not just that question was wrong, but

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.900
something a little bit deeper
about the real nature of learning.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.330
And then let the peers
give them feedback on it.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.620
I think we often learn best from people
who are going through the same struggles

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.030
that we're going through.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.090
But you mentioned doing this
in the context of web design.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.030
I think you're exactly right that we
often talk about project based learning,

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.890
the context of computer science
because professionally,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.140
what we do in computer
science is mostly projects.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.390
What about some other
fields like accounting or

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.410
nursing or,
can't think of another field.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.870
But other fields where,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.070
it's not necessarily a project
based on what you actually do.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.280
Can project based
learning be used there?

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.320
Or is there something that can be done
that kind of perpetuates the same

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.360
philosophical underpinnings
of project based learning.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.300
&gt;&gt; I think those fields are still
project based, actually.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.680
I think.
I think we've overloaded this word,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.630
project.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.120
In computer programming, project can be
what you call the thing you're working

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.980
on on the side,
this cool webpage you're building.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.970
In project-based learning, the word
project means something very specific.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.930
It means an authentic task,
an extended task, so

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.430
it won't be completed in a single day.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.650
It's sort of loosely defined,
so there's room for creativity.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:26.880
And the nurse who is monitoring my
blood glucose levels, that's a project.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.540
The accountant who's doing my taxes,
if anyone who wants to do project-based

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.515
learning and do my taxes,
that'd be good.

00:06:33.515 --> 00:06:35.250
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But that's a project, right?

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.130
That's an authentic thing.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.520
Like balancing the books on this
company, that's an authentic thing.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.780
So I think projects are there,
if you can find them.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And if they're not,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.170
a computer's probably
doing that job already.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.360
&gt;&gt; That's true.
That makes a lot of sense that we,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.150
you know, in pure sense we talk about
projects because it's something where

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.420
I create the idea, I implement it,
I execute it and I deliver it.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.110
But you're exactly right,
a project can be anything on going.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.500
It's got some investment in it,
but doesn't necessarily have to be

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.790
completely open to whatever
the student want's to specify.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.860
So, this is an educational technology
class and so we're really looking for

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.910
the ways that we can use
technology to enhance education.

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.460
Maybe the learning process or
maybe education as a broader community.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.570
So specifically on the technology front,
are there things that technology let's

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:20.830
us do in project based learning
that are difficult to do in person?

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.090
&gt;&gt; Let me start by saying the things

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.070
that technology tempts us to do
that we would never do in person.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.180
And that's the things like
the radio button quizzes.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.190
The sort of like, oh, I know how to do a
project, and I'm going to have 10 check

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.550
box quizzes that I'll ask
about how much would you

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.220
put in this box of my tax return if
you're doing the account in the example.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.300
That's not authentic.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.450
Nobody thinks it's authentic.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:45.190
It's not fun.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.260
It's not a good product base learning.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.170
It's a very, like,
superficial substitute.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:55.240
And, it's really tempting to do because
it's so much easier than anything else.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.980
The things that the Internet give you.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.380
The Internet gives you scale and
it gives you access, so.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.080
I mean it gives you the chance to
have people from across the country,

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.180
across the world,
working together on a task at any hour.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.920
That's pretty cool.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But, it's a lot of work to set up,

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:12.328
and there's a lot of
ways it can go wrong.

00:08:12.328 --> 00:08:13.660
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH] I mean,

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.600
there's tradeoffs for sure, but still,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.590
it's a better way of learning,
if you can find a way to make it work.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Makes sense, and

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.420
I think that technology
gives us a lot of ways to,

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.090
exactly what you're saying,
make it a little bit more open.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.620
That it's not necessarily something that
has to happen within the confines of

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.419
the one hour lecture that we have set
aside for this class three days a week.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.960
It's something that can happen
at three o'clock in the morning

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.140
when I just happen to be online and
a student asks a question.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.169
Or you know there's
a project to review and

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:43.600
I can watch their progress live which I
really have difficulty doing in person.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.390
At Georgia Tech we actually have some
classes that have tried to implement

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.010
that approach.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.190
Where students will come to a lab and
there's no lectures or anything

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.970
like that, but there is set-aside class
time that they're expected to be there.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.040
And the idea is sit there,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.530
work on your project, and someone will
be in the room to give you feedback.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.470
But that's a pretty big pragmatic
constraint of they have nine hours

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.190
a week where they're required to be
in the studio working on a project.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.630
During that time.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.140
And now we also have a person who
has to be there during that time,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.420
whereas the Internet allows us to do
that a little bit more asynchronously.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.722
Because it makes
the classroom unlocked 24/7.

00:09:13.722 --> 00:09:15.410
So do you have any final thoughts for

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.690
our students who are both engaging in
project-based learning in this class,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.110
and may also be trying to develop tools
that facilitate project-based learning?

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah well, if you're going through
this class, which is itself an example

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.250
of project-based learning, reflect
on what's going well and what's not.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:33.420
There's learning to
be done just in that.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.370
When you go on to try
to do project-based

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.510
learning in your own classroom.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.260
It's hard.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.780
You're not going to get
it right to begin with.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:49.230
The bad version will still probably
be better than if you hadn't tried,

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:50.660
but it's going to feel chaotic and

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:55.330
sort of out of control really,
out of your control.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.800
And that's sort of the nature of
project-based learning, is the student's

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.800
gain more autonomy, which is
a lot of the reason why we do it.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.180
So stay reflective.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.020
Next year will be better.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.190
And the next year will
be better than that.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.820
And this is how we improve at our craft.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.990
&gt;&gt; This is how I justify what I said
at the beginning of this course.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.080
Which is that there are some things
that we'll do in this course that will

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.710
fail miserably.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.840
See now I have an expert
saying that's okay.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.910
So.
Thank you so much for

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.660
talking with us today, Andy,
and for your perspective.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.320
And thank you all.
