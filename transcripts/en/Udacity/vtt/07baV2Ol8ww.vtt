00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now I'm going to talk about strategies for a minute.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Remember a strategy is a function, which takes a state as input,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and it's output is one of the action names, roll or hold.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I want you to write a strategy function, which we're calling clueless.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So its a function that takes a state as input,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and it's going to return one of the possible moves, roll or hold.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It does that by ignoring the state

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and just choosing one of the possible moves at random.

00:00:27.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So go ahead and write that.
