00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.829
might actually have more to say about
this one because I think this is one the

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:13.839
this one because I think this is one the
 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.509
this one because I think this is one the
few remake that's better than the

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519
few remake that's better than the
 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.490
few remake that's better than the
original the set up is still the same

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500
original the set up is still the same
 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.140
original the set up is still the same

and truth be told I just think their

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300
and truth be told I just think their
 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.570
and truth be told I just think their
performances are better and on top of

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580
performances are better and on top of
 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.340
performances are better and on top of
that I think they take more of the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350
that I think they take more of the
 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.080
that I think they take more of the
opportunities that's offered to them

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090
opportunities that's offered to them
 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.299
opportunities that's offered to them
with this scenario not only do they make

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309
with this scenario not only do they make
 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.860
with this scenario not only do they make
fun of their celebrity like when Jamie

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960
looks like the Crypt Keeper but there's
 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.630
looks like the Crypt Keeper but there's
also more opportunity in the fact that

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640
also more opportunity in the fact that
 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.849

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019
version and to me that's part of what
 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.139
version and to me that's part of what
can make it really funny a child going

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149
can make it really funny a child going
 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.090
can make it really funny a child going
into the work world and not knowing what

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100
into the work world and not knowing what
 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.279
into the work world and not knowing what

home and I'm not gonna act like that's
 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.180
home and I'm not gonna act like that's
always easy peasy either but there's

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190
always easy peasy either but there's
 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.979
always easy peasy either but there's
just more comedic possibilities with

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989
just more comedic possibilities with
 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.229
just more comedic possibilities with
going into the office and on top of that

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239
going into the office and on top of that
 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.969

our youth at that time got a little bit
more cutting-edge with technology and

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960
more cutting-edge with technology and
 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.989

I think the original Freaky Friday

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579
I think the original Freaky Friday
 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.740
I think the original Freaky Friday

actually might have been a little
funnier it feels a little bit more dated

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460
funnier it feels a little bit more dated
 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.219
funnier it feels a little bit more dated

the wars or something I don't know just
something to make it a little funnier

something to make it a little funnier
 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.800
something to make it a little funnier

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810
but in this one they take every
 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.510

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
them and yeah you got hit a few and they
 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.880
them and yeah you got hit a few and they
do but at the same time they tried to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890
do but at the same time they tried to
 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.440
do but at the same time they tried to
keep it a little bit more fresh which I

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450
keep it a little bit more fresh which I
 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.749

things with the current generation which
 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.109
things with the current generation which
i think is a big difference between

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119
i think is a big difference between
 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.179
i think is a big difference between
something like The Parent Trap remake

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189
something like The Parent Trap remake
 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.040

wasn't that much of an update here

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849
wasn't that much of an update here
 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.180
wasn't that much of an update here
there's a huge update technology has

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190
there's a huge update technology has
 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.339
there's a huge update technology has
changed and schools have changed and

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349
changed and schools have changed and
 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.800
changed and schools have changed and
the idea is an adult trying to go into a

the idea is an adult trying to go into a
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.440
the idea is an adult trying to go into a
kid's body and trying to adapt it's much

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450
kid's body and trying to adapt it's much
 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.360
kid's body and trying to adapt it's much
funnier because you know how much adults

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370
funnier because you know how much adults
 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.459
funnier because you know how much adults
are behind on all that stuff

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469

necessarily blaming the original movie
 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.770

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780
for not being good enough it's just that
 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.839
for not being good enough it's just that
I think with the changing times with the

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849
I think with the changing times with the
 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.089
I think with the changing times with the
upgrade and technology and more women

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099
upgrade and technology and more women
 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.500
upgrade and technology and more women

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.920
I said before getting rid of a lot of
past cliches but still keeping the ones

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930
past cliches but still keeping the ones
 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.330
past cliches but still keeping the ones
that are probably needed to make the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340
that are probably needed to make the
 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.250
that are probably needed to make the
story work and I know there's a lot of

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260
story work and I know there's a lot of
 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.869
story work and I know there's a lot of

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.740
that's fine go ahead and like it there's
nothing really wrong with it it's just

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750
nothing really wrong with it it's just
 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.750
nothing really wrong with it it's just
in my opinion there's a lot more that's

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760
in my opinion there's a lot more that's
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.640

movies to compare and contrast so when
 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.819
movies to compare and contrast so when
you get a chance maybe watch them

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829
you get a chance maybe watch them
 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.199
you get a chance maybe watch them
back-to-back and decide which one you

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209
back-to-back and decide which one you
 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.420
back-to-back and decide which one you
like best for me though it's definitely

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430
like best for me though it's definitely
 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.849
like best for me though it's definitely
the remake
