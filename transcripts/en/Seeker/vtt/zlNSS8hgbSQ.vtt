00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:06.140
Space is basically the coolest, coldest, biggest,
all-around awesomest… so many superlatives.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.440
But what’re the brightest and darkest things
out there?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.679
Hey, Spacefans!

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.020
Amy getting nerdiest with you today on DNews.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.500
When we’re talking about the brightest and
darkest things in space, there are a few things

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.120
to consider, but let’s start off with what
we experience here on Earth.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.349
We know that the brightest thing in our sky
is the Sun.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.939
It’s a star, but it’s so close to the
Earth that it dominates the daytime sky, outshining

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:31.939
other stars.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.750
After the Sun sets and we can see the other
stars, it’s easy to see that they vary in

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.830
brightness.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.410
Astronomers have observed this for millennia
and used it as a way to catalogue stars.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.350
More than 2,000 years ago, the Greek astronomer
Hipparchus catalogued the brightness of stars

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.680
saying that the brightest was a magnitude
1 star and the dimmest was a magnitude 6 star.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.300
He classified stars based on their apparent
or visual magnitude.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.770
But this isn’t a perfect method.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.210
Not only is it measuring stars with the imperfect
human eye, it’s making measurements relative

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.940
to our Earthly perspective.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.940
Two stars that look to be equally bright might
only appear to be so.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.930
In reality, one could be much brighter but
further way, so it appears dimmer.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.330
If we want to know what the brightest is,
we need to talk about absolute magnitude,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.400
which is measuring bright things against each
other irrespective of our Earthly vantage

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.400
point.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.860
The solution astronomers came up with was
to implement an absolute magnitude scale similar

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.390
to but more complete than Hipparchus’ scale.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.320
A star’s absolute magnitude is determined
by calculating its brightness as it would

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.750
appear if it was 32.6 light-years (which is
a nice round 10 parsecs) from the Earth.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.530
Astronomers can also use luminosity as a measure,
looking at the amount of light energy that

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.530
a star puts out.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.750
So let’s look at the Sun again as an example.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.600
Its visual magnitude, its brightness from
here on Earth, is -26.74, but its absolute

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.030
magnitude, what it would be from 32.6 light
years away, is 4.83 The brightest known star

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.610
is called R136a1.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.180
It lies about 165,000 light years from Earth
and has a visual magnitude of 12.77.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.950
But looking at it away from our Earthly vantage
point, 136a1 is about 10 million more luminous

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.080
than our Sun.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.400
But even the brightest star isn’t the brightest
thing.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.340
When stars die, they explode brilliantly in
what is called a supernova, expelling huge

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.370
amounts of energy as x-rays and gamma rays.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.239
So how bright are supernovas?

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.370
They can shine as bright as 10 billion suns,
one was even recorded as being 600 billion

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.371
times brighter than the Sun, releasing more
energy in an instant than our Sun will over

00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:29.890
its whole lifetime.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.849
So they’re bright, but they don’t last
and they’re still not the brightest.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.849
To understand the brightest sustained thing
in the Universe, we have to look at the darkest

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:37.849
thing in the Universe.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.329
To consider something dark, we have to consider
how it interacts with light, because properly

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.909
speaking darkness is the absence of light.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.680
This means we can’t really look at dark
matter as something dark because it doesn’t

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.930
interact with light at all.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.349
But black holes do, and true to their name,
they are the darkest things in the universe.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.959
A black holes is a highly concentrated, densely
packed gravitational point in space from which

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.430
nothing can escape.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.980
Any material that strays too close to a black
hole will be devoured, and that generally

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.230
means stars, gases, and dust.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.830
This cosmic material swirls around the black
hole, which is what astronomers see when they

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.230
detect a black hole, but ultimately the pull
of gravity is so strong that even light can’t

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.230
escape.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.159
So this is what makes black holes the darkest
thing in the universe.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.279
But the process of a black hole devouring
all that material is the opposite of dark.

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:26.139
Black holes rotating at the centre of galaxies
devouring material is a hugely energetic process.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.870
Some material is sucked into the hole, but
some is sent streaming away from it in giant

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.719
jets above and below it, essentially “turning
on” what’s called a quasar.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.590
Quasars are part of a class of objects known
as active galactic nuclei, and they release

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.389
far more energy than normal stellar production
does alone.

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.199
And that energy is bright.

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:49.069
Quasars can shine between 10 to 100,000 times
brighter than our own Milky Way galaxy.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.290
So black holes are the darkest and quasars
are the brightest, but what about other superlatives

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.290
in space?

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.889
Like, who has traveled the furthest from the
Earth?

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.549
It was the crew of Apollo 13 in 1970.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.150
And speaking of Apollo 13, how exactly did
NASA make sure there wasn’t a repeat performance

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.029
of the explosion that crippled the mission?

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.499
I talk about that this video right here.

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:12.329
And if you want more, I dig into loads of
of olde timey space content on my channel,
