00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.801
Narrator:
JAMIE'S DECIDED TO GET GNARLY.

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.567
Jamie:
THE SURFBOARD CAME TOGETHER

00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:10.434
PRETTY MUCH THE WAY
THAT I HAD PLANNED.

00:00:10.434 --> 00:00:12.701
IT'S FOUR PONTOONS
THAT ARE ALL TAPED TOGETHER

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:14.100
INTO ONE BIG THING

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.701
THAT IS THE SIZE AND SHAPE
OF A SURFBOARD, MORE OR LESS,

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:18.667
AND I IMAGINE
IT'LL WORK LIKE ONE.

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:21.601
TIME TO GO SURFING.

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:26.567
Narrator: DESPITE THE OPTIMISM,
THERE IS A MAJOR DRAWBACK.

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:28.100
Jamie: OH, LOOK AT THAT!

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.400
Narrator: JAMIE'S NEVER SURFED
IN HIS LIFE.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.601
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:39.734
Narrator:
AND LEARNING ON A SLIGHTLY LEAKY
DUCT-TAPE SURFBOARD

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.801
WAS NEVER GOING TO BE
PLAIN SAILING.

00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:44.367
Jamie: HEY!

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:46.334
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:47.434
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:50.734
HERE WE GO!

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:53.634
WELL, THAT WAS EXHAUSTING.

00:00:53.634 --> 00:00:58.634
BUT I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF HAPPY
WITH IT BECAUSE I LEARNED

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:02.434
THAT WHILE DUCT TAPE IS OKAY
AT SEALING THINGS UP,

00:01:02.434 --> 00:01:05.167
IT'S NOT PERFECT, AND
EVENTUALLY, STUFF'S GONNA LEAK.

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:06.968
OHHH!

00:01:06.968 --> 00:01:09.200
[ LAUGHING ]

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.300
SO, IF YOU BUILT SOMETHING

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.300
THAT'S RELYING
ON A SEALED PONTOON,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.434
THEN YOU'RE SCREWED BECAUSE
YOU'VE GOT NO ABILITY TO BAIL IT

00:01:17.434 --> 00:01:20.000
OR EMPTY IT OUT IN ANY WAY,
AND IT'S GONNA SINK.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.968
SO, FAILURE AS A SURFBOARD, YES,
BUT SUCCESS AS AN EXPERIMENT.
