00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.955
- [Voiceover] Let's see if
we can now give ourselves

00:00:01.955 --> 00:00:04.334
a more tangible understanding of what's on

00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:06.389
the new SAT and how it might be different

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:09.117
than SATs of the past.

00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:10.986
So right over here I
have a bullet point list

00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:12.773
of kind of the major features,

00:00:12.773 --> 00:00:15.561
the defining features of the new SAT,

00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.999
and starting up here are relevant words

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.438
in context.

00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:20.319
And there's two important parts

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:22.863
to that, relevant, and context.

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:24.024
And when we're talking
about relevant words,

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.148
these are words that you will actually see

00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:28.050
when you go to college,
or that you will use

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.559
in your working life.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:32.211
People sometimes say something like,

00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:33.778
"Hey, that's an SAT word."

00:00:33.778 --> 00:00:35.333
Sometimes referring to a word that, maybe,

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.235
it's just a hard word
that is not so practical.

00:00:38.235 --> 00:00:40.315
What's different about the new SAT,

00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:42.868
is that they're going
to be relevant words,

00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:44.586
and not just relevant words in a vacuum,

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:45.828
they're going to be in a context,

00:00:45.828 --> 00:00:47.557
in a situation where you might be

00:00:47.557 --> 00:00:50.100
editing a passage or reading something,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.119
so it's going to matter to understand

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.898
what those words are,

00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:53.699
and once again, they're not going to be

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.822
some kind of crazy words
that you only memorize

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.633
for a standardized test.

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:00.772
And this is an example of that,

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:02.731
I have a passage

00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:04.202
of relevant words in context,

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:07.302
and this is going to be from
the new SAT writing section.

00:01:07.302 --> 00:01:08.710
And the new SAT writing section,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.591
as you see, we're in context here,

00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.622
and this little four with
the circle around it,

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:14.932
this shows that, hey,
this part of the passage

00:01:14.932 --> 00:01:17.011
is referring to question four.

00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:18.206
And I'll look at this real fast.

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:19.425
As Kingman developed as a painter,

00:01:19.425 --> 00:01:21.028
his works were often compared to paintings

00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:23.398
by Chinese landscape artists dating back

00:01:23.398 --> 00:01:26.600
to CE 960, a time when a strong tradition

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.933
of landscape paining
emerged in Chinese art.

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:31.405
Kingman however, and then
the default right here

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:33.913
is vacated from that tradition

00:01:33.913 --> 00:01:35.190
in a number of ways.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.246
Well, vacated once again,

00:01:36.246 --> 00:01:38.349
isn't a crazy word, it's
a word that you will hear

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:39.950
in everyday language, in college

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.934
and in work, but it
sounds a little bit off.

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:44.258
And you look at the choices here,

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:46.359
evacuated, departed, retired,

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.157
once again, all words that you will see

00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:49.992
in college, and you will see in life,

00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:50.851
at least for this one,

00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:53.126
and my job here isn't to
answer the SAT questions,

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:55.181
but hey, this feels like he departed

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.179
from the traditions.

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.225
So I would have gone with that.

00:01:57.225 --> 00:01:59.221
But anyway, this isn't
about doing the questions,

00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:00.765
but more seeing how these questions --

00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:02.065
what they actually look like.

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:04.131
These aren't crazy words that you would

00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:05.750
only just memorize for a test,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.711
these are useful words to know in life,

00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.336
and once again we have a context

00:02:09.336 --> 00:02:10.218
of when we would use it.

00:02:10.218 --> 00:02:13.318
We would use it maybe to
edit a passage like this.

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:17.393
So the other major themes of the new SAT,

00:02:17.393 --> 00:02:19.838
command of evidence.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.673
So we're going to see
in the writing, reading,

00:02:23.673 --> 00:02:26.192
and math sections to be able to

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:28.328
look at either, it could be data,

00:02:28.328 --> 00:02:30.186
and this could even be
in the reading section,

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:31.835
hey, what kind of data can help us

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:33.657
make different types of conclusions,

00:02:33.657 --> 00:02:35.898
or even thinking about

00:02:35.898 --> 00:02:37.501
how we might rewrite something based

00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:40.100
on the data that's relevant,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.842
and this is an example
of it right over here.

00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:44.322
And once again, I'm not
gonna go into this question,

00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:48.237
there's other videos we have
where we do example problems,

00:02:48.237 --> 00:02:49.688
but this is interesting,
you're seeing kind

00:02:49.688 --> 00:02:52.903
of data evidence, and this
isn't even the math section.

00:02:52.903 --> 00:02:55.643
So this is another example
of something you might see

00:02:55.643 --> 00:02:57.537
or you will see on the new SAT.

00:02:57.537 --> 00:02:58.499
And the reason why that's important,

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:00.241
is because you will see
this throughout life.

00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:02.562
It's not like reading
or writing is somehow

00:03:02.562 --> 00:03:03.561
separated from data.

00:03:03.561 --> 00:03:05.558
All of these things happen together

00:03:05.558 --> 00:03:06.602
in the real world,

00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:08.158
and it might not just be data evidence,

00:03:08.158 --> 00:03:09.539
it could be looking at evidence,

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.198
an author's argument, so it could be

00:03:12.198 --> 00:03:14.740
written evidence of some sort as well.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.458
The essay, the optional essay

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:18.792
on the new SAT is going to be about

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:20.638
analyzing a source.

00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:22.936
So looking at what's happening,

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:26.373
and analyzing where
kind of the conclusions

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.253
are coming from and we
can go into more depth

00:03:28.253 --> 00:03:30.134
in future videos on that.

00:03:30.134 --> 00:03:31.736
Now the math portion,

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:34.441
this is a big deal that the new SAT --

00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:36.636
classically the SAT had
been associated with,

00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:38.516
hey, maybe it's a little bit trickier

00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:39.897
or things like that, but the new SAT

00:03:39.897 --> 00:03:43.450
really is focused on the
things that you actually learn

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.552
in school.

00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:48.755
So learn in school,

00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:50.090
and it's even a subset of that.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.214
It's kind of the most important subset

00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:54.792
especially for being
college and life ready.

00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:56.556
So the sections or the
types of problems you'll see

00:03:56.556 --> 00:03:57.834
are the heart of algebra.

00:03:57.834 --> 00:04:01.211
This is really the core of
algebra that really matters.

00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.835
Then you're gonna see the
passport to advanced math,

00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:05.008
and these are the skills that allow you

00:04:05.008 --> 00:04:08.735
to have the knowledge
to get higher level math

00:04:08.735 --> 00:04:11.329
that you will take in college.

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.396
So you're ready to take
those pre-calculus,

00:04:14.396 --> 00:04:16.799
calculus, statistics
courses that you might see

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.282
in college, and then
there's problem solving

00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:20.363
and data analysis.

00:04:20.363 --> 00:04:22.801
Once again, these are real world types

00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:24.913
of data analysis things,
things that you will see

00:04:24.913 --> 00:04:27.550
throughout college and
in your entire life,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.721
so it's focused on things
you learn in school,

00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:30.799
and things that are going to matter

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:32.622
in college and life.

00:04:32.622 --> 00:04:34.481
Now another big theme,

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:35.907
and this is across all the sections,

00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:37.685
is real world contexts.

00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:38.961
These aren't just tricky problems

00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:41.330
in some type of vacuum,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.583
these are going to be
things that you're going

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:43.244
to be seeing.

00:04:43.244 --> 00:04:44.621
I know I keep repeating that,

00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:46.142
but you see that theme

00:04:46.142 --> 00:04:49.357
that they're not just kind of brain teaser

00:04:49.357 --> 00:04:50.786
type things, these are things

00:04:50.786 --> 00:04:52.725
that you will see as you go through

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.523
your college career.

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:56.775
Analysis in science and social studies.

00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.863
So even though the sections
are formerly reading

00:04:59.863 --> 00:05:01.419
and math and writing,

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.080
they're going to use those sections

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.600
in order to touch on important topics

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.376
in science and social studies,

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:07.804
so you're definitely going to see

00:05:07.804 --> 00:05:12.355
a broader coverage of different types

00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:14.805
of domains in the new SAT.

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:17.196
And this is one that I
found really interesting,

00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:18.844
this notion of founding documents

00:05:18.844 --> 00:05:20.702
and great global conversation

00:05:20.702 --> 00:05:22.664
as being part of the SAT.

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:25.519
So it's a really, I
would say, good incentive

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:27.598
to get familiar with things

00:05:27.598 --> 00:05:31.552
like to get familiar with things like the

00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:34.052
Gandhi's Quit India speech,

00:05:34.052 --> 00:05:36.908
or the Declaration of Independence,

00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:38.429
or the Federalist Papers.

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:40.522
You're going to see this type of thing

00:05:40.522 --> 00:05:43.194
in the new SAT in a reading passage

00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:47.141
or to kind of make some
judgement about some things.

00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:48.707
And then, the last bullet point here,

00:05:48.707 --> 00:05:51.145
this is just kind of a high level point,

00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:53.931
and this emphasizes that this new SAT

00:05:53.931 --> 00:05:56.032
really is about what do you know,

00:05:56.032 --> 00:05:57.344
not having to think about,

00:05:57.344 --> 00:05:59.411
hey do I guess, do I not guess?

00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:01.374
There's no penalty for wrong answers.

00:06:01.374 --> 00:06:03.497
In the past, there was a
penalty for wrong answers,

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:04.670
but now there's no penalty.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.875
So if you feel like you
have a sense of something,

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:08.512
or really even if you don't,

00:06:08.512 --> 00:06:10.754
you should at least try
to answer every question

00:06:10.754 --> 00:06:11.333
that you get to.

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:12.832
You shouldn't get into all the whole

00:06:12.832 --> 00:06:14.360
gamesmanship of, okay, should I do it,

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.521
or should I not.

00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:16.660
So hopefully this gives you a sense

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.714
of things, I have some
other questions here

00:06:18.714 --> 00:06:21.419
that maybe make things a little bit more

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.445
tangible, this one right over here,

00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:27.069
this is would be the passport

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.926
to advanced math right over here.

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:30.389
You have a non-linear system,

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:31.410
but this is really useful.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.128
This is something that you will see

00:06:33.128 --> 00:06:35.184
in school, especially
when you get to college,

00:06:35.184 --> 00:06:38.202
and then they have data
analysis questions like this

00:06:38.202 --> 00:06:40.860
which is very valuable as you, once again,

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.626
go into college, and
really almost any field

00:06:42.626 --> 00:06:44.123
you go into, you're gonna have to do

00:06:44.123 --> 00:06:46.641
data analysis or things like this.

00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:47.663
So hopefully this gives you

00:06:47.663 --> 00:06:52.331
an overview, and
encourages you to dive in,

00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:54.431
and the best way, always,
to prepare for this,

00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:56.289
is use the Khan Academy tools.

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.390
Take the practice test,

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.433
review the questions
that you get really wrong

00:07:00.433 --> 00:07:01.849
or that you're not sure about,

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:03.998
and then do as much deliberate practice

00:07:03.998 --> 00:07:06.029
as you need and the
system will personalize

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.358
to your needs so that you get

00:07:08.358 --> 00:07:10.945
hopefully, the best use of your time.

00:07:10.945 --> 00:07:12.714
Have fun.
