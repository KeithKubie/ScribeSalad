to decide which point to go towards and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
to decide which point to go towards and
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.090
to decide which point to go towards and
we're getting whatever point we choose

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
we're getting whatever point we choose
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.650
we're getting whatever point we choose
we're going to go half way so let's call

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
we're going to go half way so let's call
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.150
we're going to go half way so let's call
a 1 4 2 if we get one or two we'll go to

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160
a 1 4 2 if we get one or two we'll go to
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.490
a 1 4 2 if we get one or two we'll go to
half way towards a and this is going to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500
half way towards a and this is going to
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.330
half way towards a and this is going to
be 3 or 4 and C can be 5 4 6 so it's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
be 3 or 4 and C can be 5 4 6 so it's
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.740
be 3 or 4 and C can be 5 4 6 so it's
just roll - so I need to go half way to

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
just roll - so I need to go half way to
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.479
just roll - so I need to go half way to
the point there's been chosen at random

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
the point there's been chosen at random
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.450
the point there's been chosen at random
which is a in this case so um we could

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
which is a in this case so um we could
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.069
which is a in this case so um we could
measure this for the sake of speed I'm

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
measure this for the sake of speed I'm
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.330
measure this for the sake of speed I'm
just going to go roughly halfway I think

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
just going to go roughly halfway I think
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.470
just going to go roughly halfway I think
you can believe that if we run aligned

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
you can believe that if we run aligned
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.760
you can believe that if we run aligned
there we're going to get further up

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
there we're going to get further up
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590
there we're going to get further up
there and we're going to keep doing this

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
there and we're going to keep doing this
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.630
there and we're going to keep doing this
for a while we're iterating so we're

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
for a while we're iterating so we're
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.100
for a while we're iterating so we're
repeating we get the last result and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
repeating we get the last result and
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.450
repeating we get the last result and
work from that but the start point could

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
work from that but the start point could
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.500
work from that but the start point could
be anywhere I could have put a start

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
be anywhere I could have put a start
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.540
be anywhere I could have put a start
point outside the triangle I can still

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
point outside the triangle I can still
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.279
point outside the triangle I can still
head towards one of these dots let's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
head towards one of these dots let's
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.180
head towards one of these dots let's
just see what happens when I keep

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190
just see what happens when I keep
 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.810
just see what happens when I keep
rolling guys

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
rolling guys
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.810
rolling guys
I just wanted to again so from that was

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
I just wanted to again so from that was
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.310
I just wanted to again so from that was
the dot I had before and I've gone half

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320
the dot I had before and I've gone half
 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.710
the dot I had before and I've gone half
way from the previous dot and that's my

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
way from the previous dot and that's my
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.210
way from the previous dot and that's my
halfway point so if I roll this one

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
halfway point so if I roll this one
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.450
halfway point so if I roll this one
again one doctor wish I'd rigged this

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
again one doctor wish I'd rigged this
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.090
again one doctor wish I'd rigged this
now from this dot the last I had halfway

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
now from this dot the last I had halfway
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.440
now from this dot the last I had halfway
towards the 1 so it's going to we're

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
towards the 1 so it's going to we're
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.580
towards the 1 so it's going to we're
just a mning towards one this is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
just a mning towards one this is
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.920
just a mning towards one this is
unlikely to keep going but I then place

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
unlikely to keep going but I then place
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.399
unlikely to keep going but I then place
your bets now for for is the the B dot

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
your bets now for for is the the B dot
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.660
your bets now for for is the the B dot
so I've got a good kind of from the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
so I've got a good kind of from the
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850
so I've got a good kind of from the
previous dot halfway on this line is

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
previous dot halfway on this line is
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.039
previous dot halfway on this line is
about there and I've jumped a long way

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
about there and I've jumped a long way
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:31.640
about there and I've jumped a long way
this time

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
this time
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.359
this time
one back towards a so getting there and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
one back towards a so getting there and
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.530
one back towards a so getting there and
I'm going to keep doing this so you've

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
I'm going to keep doing this so you've
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.210
I'm going to keep doing this so you've
got the idea thing from the previous dot

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220
got the idea thing from the previous dot
 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.319
got the idea thing from the previous dot
we go towards one of these two your diet

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329
we go towards one of these two your diet
 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.679
we go towards one of these two your diet
is rig ready fix excellent we've gone

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689
is rig ready fix excellent we've gone
 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.160
is rig ready fix excellent we've gone
all the way

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
all the way
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.230
all the way
this was the dot kind of halfway is

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
this was the dot kind of halfway is
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:58.250
this was the dot kind of halfway is
there six one back up here too

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260
 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.890
sighs or we don't here I'm going to do

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900
sighs or we don't here I'm going to do
 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.110
sighs or we don't here I'm going to do
this a lot now really but maybe this we

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120
this a lot now really but maybe this we
 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:14.930
this a lot now really but maybe this we
were speeding up I'm bored math but it's

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
were speeding up I'm bored math but it's
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.220
were speeding up I'm bored math but it's
not that exciting the interesting things

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230
not that exciting the interesting things
 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.270
not that exciting the interesting things
are happening we've created kind of some

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
are happening we've created kind of some
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.040
are happening we've created kind of some
lines but beta glimpse made a bunch of

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050
lines but beta glimpse made a bunch of
 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.290
lines but beta glimpse made a bunch of
dots on the paper it's possible that

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300
dots on the paper it's possible that
 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.400
dots on the paper it's possible that
something interesting would happen if I

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410
something interesting would happen if I
 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.660
something interesting would happen if I
could do this quick enough that I

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670
could do this quick enough that I
 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.420
could do this quick enough that I
wouldn't get so bored I have to stop but

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430
wouldn't get so bored I have to stop but
 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.580
wouldn't get so bored I have to stop but
maybe we want computer to do this we

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590
maybe we want computer to do this we
 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.600
maybe we want computer to do this we
have a problem with a computer though

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
have a problem with a computer though
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.430
have a problem with a computer though
and random numbers like you generating

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
and random numbers like you generating
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.860
and random numbers like you generating
random numbers is difficult when a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
random numbers is difficult when a
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.150

let's go Parker issue for another video

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
let's go Parker issue for another video
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.170
let's go Parker issue for another video
for EPS if I can get recruited to roll

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
for EPS if I can get recruited to roll
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.820
for EPS if I can get recruited to roll
the dice for me and put the dot on then

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830
the dice for me and put the dot on then
 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.380
the dice for me and put the dot on then
we could see what happens quickly and

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
we could see what happens quickly and
 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.770
we could see what happens quickly and
let's do that the screen has just as we

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
let's do that the screen has just as we
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.730
let's do that the screen has just as we
had we've got three dots they're not

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740
had we've got three dots they're not
 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.440
had we've got three dots they're not
even in a nice equilateral triangle they

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450
even in a nice equilateral triangle they
 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.910
even in a nice equilateral triangle they
can be anywhere this thing says trace

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
can be anywhere this thing says trace
 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.170
can be anywhere this thing says trace
point it's just going to trace where

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180
point it's just going to trace where
 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.540
point it's just going to trace where
that goes and the computer is with its

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
that goes and the computer is with its
 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.480
that goes and the computer is with its
magic going to choose a B or C and move

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490
magic going to choose a B or C and move
 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.280

that point halfway accurately this time

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290
that point halfway accurately this time
 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.290
that point halfway accurately this time
so you see that it's leaving a mark

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300
so you see that it's leaving a mark
 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.560
so you see that it's leaving a mark
anywhere it goes so it's going to a

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570
anywhere it goes so it's going to a
 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.390
anywhere it goes so it's going to a
several times and roads jump to B and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400
several times and roads jump to B and
 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.270
several times and roads jump to B and
then back to a and then to C but I mean

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280
then back to a and then to C but I mean
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.980
then back to a and then to C but I mean
doing a running commentary on this for

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990
doing a running commentary on this for
 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.240
doing a running commentary on this for
any longer than I have done is probably

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250
any longer than I have done is probably
 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.580
any longer than I have done is probably
not going to make anyone's day so let's

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590
not going to make anyone's day so let's
 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.400
not going to make anyone's day so let's
speed it up a little bit faster and you

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410
speed it up a little bit faster and you

right so I could start with my point

right so I could start with my point
right in the middle and then we

right in the middle and then we
