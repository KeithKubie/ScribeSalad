00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.780
Since we just discussed application

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.770
domain, machine domain, and the specificiation,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.760
let's make sure that these concepts are well understood. To do that,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.740
I'm going to use a quiz, and I would like for you

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.590
to refer to the figure that we just discussed that I'm also

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.050
reproducing here on a small scale on the right. And then

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.080
referring to the figure, you should indicate for each of the items

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.140
that I'm going to show you here shortly. Whether they belong to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.360
the machine domain. In this case, we're going to put a one next

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.150
to the icon. The application domain, in this case you should

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.410
put two. Or their intersection, and in this case you should

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.100
put three. So this is the lists of items. So let

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.750
me read it. An algorithm sorts a list of books in alphabetical

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.070
order by the first author's name. A notification of the arrival

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.380
of a message appears on a smart watch. An employee wants to

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.150
organize a meeting with a set of colleagues. And finally, a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.690
user clicks a link on a web page. So again, put 1,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.740
2, or 3 here in these lots, depending on whether you think that these items

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.840
belong to the machine domain, the application

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.910
domain, or their intersection. So, their specification, here.
