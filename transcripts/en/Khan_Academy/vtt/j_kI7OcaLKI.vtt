00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:03.652
- [Voiceover] The figure above
shows the graph of f prime,

00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:06.612
the derivative of a
twice-differentiable function f,

00:00:06.612 --> 00:00:08.047
on the interval, that's a closed interval,

00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:09.580
from negative three to four.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.262
The graph of f prime
has horizontal tangents

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.526
at x equals negative one, x equals one,

00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:15.860
and x equals three.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.192
So you have a horizontal
tangent right over,

00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:21.921
a horizontal tangent right over there.

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:24.524
And let me draw that a little bit neater,

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.458
right over there,

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.320
a horizontal tangent right over there,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.362
and a horizontal tangent right over there.

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:31.557
Alright.

00:00:31.557 --> 00:00:33.345
The areas of the regions bounded

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.475
by the x-axis and the graph of f prime

00:00:36.475 --> 00:00:38.731
on the intervals negative two to one,

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:40.346
closed intervals from negative two to one,

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:42.694
so this region right over here,

00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:45.142
and the region from one to four,

00:00:45.142 --> 00:00:46.591
so this region right over there,

00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:48.494
they tell us have,

00:00:48.494 --> 00:00:50.911
have the areas are 9 and 12, respectively.

00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:54.203
So that area's 9 and that area is 12.

00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:55.729
So Part A,

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.955
Find all x coordinates at
which f has a relative maximum.

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:03.473
Give a reason for your answer.

00:01:03.473 --> 00:01:05.527
All x-coordinates at which f

00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:06.955
has a relative maximum.

00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:07.629
So you might say,

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:09.196
"Oh wait, wait this looks
like a relative maximum

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:10.509
over here, but this isn't f.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.413
This is the graph of f prime."

00:01:12.413 --> 00:01:13.793
So let's think about when we used to

00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:15.490
we don't have a graph of f in front of us.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.427
So let's think about
what it needs to be true

00:01:17.427 --> 00:01:20.943
for f to have a relative
maximum at a point.

00:01:20.943 --> 00:01:23.210
We are probably familiar with

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.415
what relative maximum will look like.

00:01:25.415 --> 00:01:28.214
It'd look like a little lump, like that.

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:30.072
It could also actually look like that

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:32.173
but since this is differentiable function

00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:33.671
over the interval, we're
probably not dealing

00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:36.213
with a relative maximum
that looks like that.

00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:41.803
And so what do we know about
a relative maximum point?

00:01:41.803 --> 00:01:44.754
So let's say that's our relative maximum.

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:46.883
As we approach our relative maximum

00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:50.202
from values, as we have x
values that are approaching

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:54.043
the x value of our relative maximum point,

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:56.659
as we approach it from
values below that x value,

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.699
we see that we have a positive slope.

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:02.839
Our function needs to be increasing.

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:04.751
So over here.

00:02:05.784 --> 00:02:08.686
Over here we see f is increasing,

00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:11.827
going into the relative maximum point,

00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:12.726
f is increasing,

00:02:12.726 --> 00:02:15.227
which means that the derivative of f

00:02:15.227 --> 00:02:17.312
the derivative of f must
be greater than zero.

00:02:18.342 --> 00:02:20.874
And then after we past that maximum point,

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.491
after we past that maximum point,

00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:26.247
we see that our function
needs to be decreasing.

00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:27.569
Do this in another color.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.711
We see that our funciton is decreasing

00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:33.090
right over here, so f decreasing,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.764
decreasing, which means

00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:39.684
that f prime of x needs
to be less than zero.

00:02:40.524 --> 00:02:43.745
So our relative maximum point

00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:46.247
should happen at an x value.

00:02:46.247 --> 00:02:47.312
It should happen at an x value

00:02:47.312 --> 00:02:50.284
where our first derivative transitions

00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:52.478
from being greater than zero

00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:55.244
to being less than zero.

00:02:55.244 --> 00:02:56.437
So what x value,

00:02:56.437 --> 00:02:57.262
so let me say this,

00:02:57.262 --> 00:03:00.737
so we have

00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:05.407
f has relative, let me
just write it shorthand,

00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:10.351
relative maximum at x values

00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:13.526
where

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:16.561
f prime transitions,

00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:17.631
transitions,

00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:21.703
transitions from

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:26.272
from positive, positive,

00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:32.713
to negative, to, let me write
this a little bit neater,

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:34.493
to negative.

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:37.713
to negative.

00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:39.923
And where do we see f prime transitioning

00:03:39.923 --> 00:03:41.902
from positive to negative?

00:03:41.902 --> 00:03:43.933
Well over here we only
see that happening once.

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:47.138
We see right here f prime is
positive, positive, positive,

00:03:47.138 --> 00:03:49.077
and then it goes negative,
negative, negative.

00:03:49.077 --> 00:03:50.797
So we see,

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:54.143
we see f prime is positive over here,

00:03:55.273 --> 00:03:58.020
And then, right when we
hit x equals negative two,

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.702
f prime becomes negative.

00:04:00.702 --> 00:04:03.849
F prime becomes negative.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.706
So we know that the function itself,

00:04:05.706 --> 00:04:06.426
not f prime,

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:07.877
f must be increasing here

00:04:07.877 --> 00:04:10.768
because f prime is positive,

00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:13.369
and then our function at f

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:14.518
is decreasing here

00:04:14.518 --> 00:04:17.084
because f prime is negative.

00:04:18.054 --> 00:04:20.969
And so this happens at x equals two.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.773
So let me write that down.

00:04:22.773 --> 00:04:24.870
This happens at x equals two.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.550
This happens,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.969
happens at x equals two.

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:33.301
And we're done.
