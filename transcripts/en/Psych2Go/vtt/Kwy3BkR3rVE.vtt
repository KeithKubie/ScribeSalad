00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:14.555
Do you ever look down at your sleeping pet

00:00:14.555 --> 00:00:16.685
and think how similar you guys are?

00:00:16.685 --> 00:00:19.320
Your dog might me as hyped as you are about an upcoming event

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.620
and your cat may be rolling your eyes with you at something annoying.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.725
There is a reason why the terms ''cat people''

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.765
and ''dog people'' exist.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:29.445
Your preference for felines or canines reflects inherent

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:32.345
personality traits corresponding to your favorite animal.

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:35.075
A study in the University of Texas assessed a large group

00:00:35.075 --> 00:00:38.125
of people on 5 main personality traits commonly known

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:41.115
as the ''Big Five'' - the parameters often used

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:42.265
by psychologists.

00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:46.055
1: Contientiousness

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:47.945
Your level of contientiousness indicates your  inclination

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:49.675
towards diligence and

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.885
organization when carrying out a task.

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.945
Dog people were rated to be 11% more

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:56.705
contientious than cat people because their sense of duty

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:59.755
and obedience makes them more likely to follow rules.

00:00:59.755 --> 00:01:02.415
This is not to say that cat people aren't willful;

00:01:02.415 --> 00:01:05.205
but they tend to question situations, motives and orders

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:07.505
as an act of self preservation.

00:01:08.725 --> 00:01:11.385
2: Agreeableness

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:14.425
Your level of agreeableness shows how quickly and to what degree

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:17.275
you trust others. Dog people are high in this attribute

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:20.385
and are generous to everyone they meet, genuinely sympathetic

00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:23.455
to others needs and sometimes even gullible to a fault.

00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:25.195
Cat people, on the other hand,

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:27.735
have a reputation for being standoffish because of their

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:29.945
low level of agreeableness. They're often

00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:32.085
weary with strangers, taking time to gauge

00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:34.375
an individual and slowly warming up to them.

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.615
3: Neuroticism

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:39.935
Your level of neuroticism refers to how

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:42.815
well you can manage your emotions. Cat people are

00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:45.175
calculated to be 12% more neurotic

00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:48.205
than dog people because they possess a sensitivity that makes them

00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:50.215
more prone to worrying and overthinking.

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:51.455
Since their spectrum of thought

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:53.745
is much wider than that of dog people

00:01:53.745 --> 00:01:56.585
they also spot more problems to stress over, real

00:01:56.585 --> 00:01:59.305
or imagined. Dog people are more easy going

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:01.725
and tend to be less anxious overall.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:05.305
4: Openness

00:02:05.305 --> 00:02:07.815
Your level of openness indicates your reception to new things,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.680
readiness to explore, imaginitive vividness

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.355
and intellectual curiosity. Cat people

00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:15.905
are said to me more open as they have a natural

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.655
curiosity to discover and experiment more, and hold

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:20.385
unconventional beliefs. They have

00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:22.155
an independence that reflects that of their

00:02:22.155 --> 00:02:25.355
pet allowing them to be sensitive and open minded to creative

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.525
and intellectual pursues.

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:29.875
Some interesting research shows that cat people

00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:33.005
are actually more likely to be atheists than dog people.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:36.005
Dog owners tend to stick to safer, calculated choices

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:38.245
in unfamiliar situations and are

00:02:38.245 --> 00:02:41.305
more likely to believe authority figures without question.

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:44.045
Their values are also more traditional and conservative.

00:02:45.355 --> 00:02:48.365
5: Extraversion

00:02:48.365 --> 00:02:51.445
Similar to agreeableness, extraversion is a measure of sociablity

00:02:51.445 --> 00:02:54.245
Your level of extraversion indicates where you derive your

00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:56.275
energy from. Dog people are

00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:58.485
rated to be 15% more extroverted,

00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:00.875
taking the initiative in social situations

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:03.615
while cat people tend to shy away from crowds.

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:06.045
Thus, cat people are more likely to live alone,

00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:08.965
particulary in apartments as they're more introverted.

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:12.425
The experimenter conducting this study, Sam Gosling,

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:15.315
said: ''There's a widely held cultural belief that

00:03:15.315 --> 00:03:16.735
the pet species - dog or cat -

00:03:16.735 --> 00:03:19.315
with which a person has the strongest affinity

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:21.675
says something about the individual's personality.''

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:24.575
And this research suggests that there are significant differences

00:03:24.575 --> 00:03:26.395
on major personality traits between

00:03:26.395 --> 00:03:28.035
dog people and cat people.

00:03:28.035 --> 00:03:30.735
The next time you settle down for a movie with your cat

00:03:30.735 --> 00:03:32.585
or go for a drive with your dog, you'll know

00:03:32.585 --> 00:03:35.575
the reason you get along so famously isn't coincidence

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:37.665
but a real likeliness in character.

00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:41.045
Do you have any pets? If so,

00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:44.105
do you believe your personality reflects that of your pet's?
