00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, let's think it through together, and then write out the details.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
At a high level, this is going to be:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
an element , an element, and then Empty.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So we're going to end up making a list

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that has element 1 in it and element 2 in it,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then nothing else--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
based on this rule up here, where we just make a bigger and bigger list,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
out of the list containing the first element

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and everything else we've gathered up.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So this will be the final value of our parse tree,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
corresponding to this more graphical parse tree--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
really more of a list, but a lot of things in computer science are.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Rama's Journey is more commonly known as the Ramayana.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's a Sanskrit epic that's a very important part of the Hindu canon

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it explores human values and Dharma.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
If you haven't already had a chance to read it,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I strongly encourage you to make a rendezvous with Rama.

00:00:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It's time well spent.
