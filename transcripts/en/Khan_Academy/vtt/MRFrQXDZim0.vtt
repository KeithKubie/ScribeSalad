00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.000
- [Instructor] We're told that Justin runs

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
at a constant rate, traveling
17 kilometers in two hours.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.180
Write an equation that
shows the relationship

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.670
between the distance he
runs, d, in kilometers

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.210
and the time he spends
running, h, in hours.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.920
So, pause this video and see
if you can work through that

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.600
on your own before we do it together.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.770
All right, now there's several ways

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.970
to approach this question.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.840
One way is to say, look, he's
running at a constant rate,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.240
so his distance is going to
be equal to some constant,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.370
let's just call that lowercase k,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.320
times the amount of
time he spends running,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.390
and the way that we can
figure out what k is

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.140
is by using the information
that they gave us.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.530
They tell us right over here

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.963
that when our distance is 17 kilometers,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.840
so when our distance is 17 kilometers,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.120
that's a situation where he
has been running for two hours.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.120
So, that is going to be
equal to k times two hours.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.840
So, what is k going to be?

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.480
Pause the video again and
see if you can figure it out,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.790
if you didn't figure it out the first time

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.340
I asked you to pause the video.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.320
All right, well there's a
bunch of ways to solve for k,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.340
but one way is to say,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.970
let's just divide both sides by two hours.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.010
So, if you divide both sides by two hours,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.920
you are going to get that k

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.890
is going to be equal 17 over
two kilometers per hour,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.833
which is, 17 over two is 8.5,

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.480
8.5 kilometers per hour.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.790
And so, if we go back to
the original question,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.410
which asks us to write an equation

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.200
that shows the relationship
between d and h,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.850
we can say that d is equal to,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.160
we now know our proportionality constant,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.020
it is 8.5 times h.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.210
8.5 times h, and we're done.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.440
If we wanted to write their units,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.730
we could write d is equal to

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.950
8.5 kilometers per hour times h,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.123
which is given in hours.
