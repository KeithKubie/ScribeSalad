00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:07.628
"Order, order.

00:00:07.628 --> 00:00:09.388
So who do we have here?"

00:00:09.388 --> 00:00:11.438
"Your Honor, this is Cleopatra,

00:00:11.438 --> 00:00:16.888
the Egyptian queen whose lurid affairs
destroyed two of Rome's finest generals

00:00:16.888 --> 00:00:19.349
and brought the end of the Republic."

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.128
"Your Honor, this is Cleopatra,

00:00:22.128 --> 00:00:24.609
one of the most powerful women in history

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:30.619
whose reign brought Egypt nearly
22 years of stability and prosperity."

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.936
"Uh, why don't we even know
what she looked like?"

00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:37.516
"Most of the art and descriptions
came long after her lifetime

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:39.880
in the first century BCE,

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.680
just like most of 
the things written about her."

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.771
"So what do we actually know?

00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:48.688
Cleopatra VII was the last
of the Ptolemaic dynasty,

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:51.570
a Macedonian Greek family 
that governed Egypt

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.760
after its conquest by Alexander the Great.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.270
She ruled jointly in Alexandria 
with her brother-

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.721
to whom she was also married-

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.660
until he had her exiled."

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.899
"But what does all this 
have to do with Rome?"

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.361
"Egypt had long been a Roman client state,

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:12.089
and Cleopatra's father incurred 
large debts to the Republic.

00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:15.690
After being defeated by Julius Caesar
in Rome's civil war,

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.550
the General Pompey sought refuge in Egypt

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.400
but was executed 
by Cleopatra's brother instead."

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.214
"Caesar must have liked that."

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:29.781
"Actually, he found the murder unseemly
and demanded repayment of Egypt's debt.

00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:31.371
He could have annexed Egypt,

00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:35.931
but Cleopatra convinced him to restore
her to the throne instead."

00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:38.181
"We hear she was quite convincing."

00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:41.716
"And why not? Cleopatra 
was a fascinating woman.

00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.611
She commanded armies at 21,

00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:45.221
spoke several languages,

00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:48.932
and was educated in a city 
with the world's finest library

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:51.492
and some of the greatest 
scholars of the time."

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:52.630
"Hmm."

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.922
"She kept Caesar lounging 
in Egypt for months when Rome needed him."

00:01:56.922 --> 00:01:59.102
"Caesar did more than lounge.

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:01.901
He was fascinated by Egypt's culture
and knowledge,

00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:04.181
and he learned much during his time there.

00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:06.665
When he returned to Rome, 
he reformed the calendar,

00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:07.992
commissioned a census,

00:02:07.992 --> 00:02:10.262
made plans for a public library,

00:02:10.262 --> 00:02:13.123
and proposed many 
new infrastructure projects."

00:02:13.123 --> 00:02:17.651
"Yes, all very ambitious, 
exactly what got him assassinated."

00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:20.743
"Don't blame the Queen for Rome's
strange politics.

00:02:20.743 --> 00:02:23.921
Her job was ruling Egypt,
and she did it well.

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:25.542
She stabilized the economy,

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:27.212
managed the vast bureaucracy,

00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:30.403
and curbed corruption by priests
and officials.

00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:33.472
When drought hit, she opened
the granaries to the public

00:02:33.472 --> 00:02:35.802
and passed a tax amnesty,

00:02:35.802 --> 00:02:39.452
all while preserving her kingdom's
stability and independence

00:02:39.452 --> 00:02:42.473
with no revolts during 
the rest of her reign."

00:02:42.473 --> 00:02:43.983
"So what went wrong?"

00:02:43.983 --> 00:02:48.603
"After Caesar's death, this foreign Queen
couldn't stop meddling in Roman matters."

00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:52.993
"Actually, it was the Roman factions who
came demanding her aid.

00:02:52.993 --> 00:02:57.043
And of course she had no choice
but to support Octavian and Marc Antony

00:02:57.043 --> 00:03:00.883
in avenging Caesar,
if only for the sake of their son."

00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:06.053
"And again, she provided her particular
kind of support to Marc Antony."

00:03:06.053 --> 00:03:07.144
"Why does that matter?

00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:08.943
Why doesn't anyone seem to care about

00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:12.013
Caesar or Antony's 
countless other affairs?

00:03:12.013 --> 00:03:14.748
Why do we assume she instigated
the relationships?

00:03:14.748 --> 00:03:19.393
And why are only powerful women
defined by their sexuality?"

00:03:19.393 --> 00:03:20.183
"Order."

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:22.493
"Cleopatra and Antony were a disaster.

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:25.484
They offended the Republic
with their ridiculous celebrations

00:03:25.484 --> 00:03:27.133
sitting on golden thrones

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:28.924
and dressing up as gods

00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:33.254
until Octavian had all of Rome convinced
of their megalomania."

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:36.413
"And yet Octavian was the one 
who attacked Antony,

00:03:36.413 --> 00:03:37.555
annexed Egypt,

00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:40.435
and declared himself Emperor.

00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:45.155
It was the Roman's fear of a woman
in power that ended their Republic,

00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:46.884
not the woman herself."

00:03:46.884 --> 00:03:48.484
"How ironic."

00:03:48.484 --> 00:03:53.344
Cleopatra's story survived mainly
in the accounts of her enemies in Rome,

00:03:53.344 --> 00:03:57.184
and later writers filled the gaps 
with rumors and stereotypes.

00:03:57.184 --> 00:04:00.954
We may never know the full truth
of her life and her reign,

00:04:00.954 --> 00:04:06.706
but we can separate fact from rumor
by putting history on trial.
