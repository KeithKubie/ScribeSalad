00:00:00.022 --> 00:00:01.042
Hey it's me Destin

00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:02.699
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:03.763
I want to be an astronaut

00:00:03.763 --> 00:00:07.211
so I love taking tours of the International Space Station online.

00:00:07.211 --> 00:00:08.476
But there's a problem.

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:11.147
Every time I do this I can't get my bearings.

00:00:11.147 --> 00:00:15.115
It's like without gravity my main reference frame has been stolen from me

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.379
and I can't tell up from down and I get turned around

00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:19.113
and I'm just confused.

00:00:19.113 --> 00:00:21.557
Scott Kelly just took command of the International Space Station

00:00:21.557 --> 00:00:22.988
as part of his one year tour.

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:26.134
But before he left he took just a couple of minutes to walk me around

00:00:26.134 --> 00:00:28.765
one on one inside the mock up at Houston.

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:30.966
Immediately after taking this tour with Scott Kelly

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.266
I now know the International Space Station to a whole new level.

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:37.297
I know where I am in relation to where they sleep

00:00:37.297 --> 00:00:38.767
or where they draw blood

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:40.544
or get ready for space walks

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:41.713
or where they poop

00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:43.708
or where they store the experiments.

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:45.210
I know all that stuff now,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.541
just from seeing a video on the space station

00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:49.190
and I really enjoy it.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.920
I'm going to take you on the exact same tour that I took with Scott

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.888
only I've made it better.

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:55.682
In the bottom left part of the screen

00:00:55.682 --> 00:00:58.055
I'm going to include a video game style radar

00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:00.162
so that you know exactly what module you're in

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:01.730
what your position is

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.407
and what your orientation is.

00:01:03.407 --> 00:01:04.476
You're gonna be the white dot

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:06.265
and Scott Kelly is the red dot.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.886
In the bottom right hand part of the screen

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:10.037
I'm gonna add annotation links here

00:01:10.037 --> 00:01:12.002
so that if at any point you want to go up on orbit

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.880
and see what it's like in orbit,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.981
you can do that.

00:01:14.981 --> 00:01:16.180
Just click the annotation.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.839
I'll also leave links in the video description.

00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:18.758
OK you ready?

00:01:18.758 --> 00:01:20.575
The International Space Station is big

00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:21.912
so try not to fast forward.

00:01:21.912 --> 00:01:23.948
If you can watch this whole thing at one go

00:01:23.948 --> 00:01:25.158
you won't get disoriented.

00:01:25.158 --> 00:01:26.890
We're gonna start exactly where Scott Kelly's

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.519
space craft docked to the ISS

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:30.496
and we're gonna let him walk us all the way through

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:31.854
to the Japanese module.

00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:33.265
Let's get Smarter Every Day.

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:34.732
OK we're in the ISS.

00:01:34.732 --> 00:01:35.707
This is where you dock?

00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:40.977
- Yeah so this is the Russian segment and a much higher fidelity mock up

00:01:40.977 --> 00:01:44.706
in Russia, but there's a module that comes out of the top of the space station

00:01:44.706 --> 00:01:48.306
here called MRM2. My Soyuz will dock to that.

00:01:48.306 --> 00:01:51.639
The other Soyuz's are docked in other parts of the Russian segment.

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:53.242
That's the service module down here.

00:01:53.242 --> 00:01:54.586
This is the FGB.

00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:57.887
It's a Russian built module but the United States owns it.

00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:00.901
It's mostly for cargo stowage.

00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.414
- That's a lot of carpet. Is it a fire hazard?

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:06.661
- It is linked for velcro and stuff but ah..

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:07.165
- Gotcha.

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:09.067
Alright.

00:02:09.937 --> 00:02:10.731
- But ah..

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:14.213
Yeah we're walking from the aft part of the space station forward.

00:02:14.213 --> 00:02:19.375
And here is the front part of the Russian segment

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:21.477
where we'll be going into the US segment,

00:02:21.477 --> 00:02:22.475
we'll go outside first.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:24.612
- So we're going into.. is it Unity is the first module?

00:02:24.612 --> 00:02:26.008
- Yeah Node 1.

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:26.787
- OK

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:28.439
- Although it's interesting the crew members don't

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.150
really refer to them by those names like Unity and Destiny,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.355
we'll say Node 1..

00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:34.055
- Got it.

00:02:34.055 --> 00:02:35.994
- And ah.. Laboratory module.

00:02:35.994 --> 00:02:36.954
But this is node 1.

00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:37.892
This is kind of a,

00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:42.088
as the name describes it's an adjoining module for other things but,

00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:45.099
this is kind of where the crew members on the US segment eat

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.763
and the Russians will eat here sometimes

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:50.375
we'll have a galley rack here to fill your drink bags,

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.866
little refrigerator things, food warmers.

00:02:52.866 --> 00:02:53.776
- Got it.

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:56.342
- Over there is node 3.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.317
Very important..

00:02:57.317 --> 00:02:58.610
- That's where the cupola is right?

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.711
- Yeah the cupola's in there,

00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:00.946
we can run in there real quick.

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:01.561
- Yeah.

00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:03.311
This is where you're gonna take all the photos

00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.522
that you're gonna send back to us right?

00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:06.989
- Yeah a lot of them we take them from here.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.626
There's also a window in the US lab module

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:12.854
that's pretty good and the Russians have some good

00:03:12.854 --> 00:03:14.589
windows for Earth observations

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.368
but the cupola's down here

00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:17.894
so there'll be the Earth.

00:03:17.894 --> 00:03:20.763
This is our exercise device

00:03:20.763 --> 00:03:23.445
or low fidelity mock up of it,

00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:25.104
for resistive exercise.

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.074
- I just realized,

00:03:26.074 --> 00:03:28.306
the bathroom is right beside the cupola.

00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:32.051
- Yeah so the cupola, this exercise device,

00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:34.418
the toilet on the US segment

00:03:34.418 --> 00:03:37.650
and our treadmill are all within a few feet of one another

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.318
and they're all at different orientations so someone

00:03:40.318 --> 00:03:41.384
running on the wall,

00:03:41.384 --> 00:03:43.326
someone using the bathroom in this orientation,

00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:49.260
and sideways on the ARED makes for a pretty interesting picture.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.407
- Yeah. So one thing I didn't realize is that when we're taking these

00:03:53.407 --> 00:03:56.181
beautiful images of Earth that people on Earth can relate to so well,

00:03:56.181 --> 00:03:59.300
you're probably smelling what just went down over here.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.666
- It's not that smelly.

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:02.286
- That's good. That's good.

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:03.515
That's pretty awesome.

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:05.986
So this is, this sounds like the most fun segment.

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:08.479
- Yes this module is very important

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:12.888
and it's also important because it's got a lot of the life support systems in here.

00:04:12.888 --> 00:04:19.854
Oxygen generating system that converts water into Oxygen on the US segment.

00:04:19.854 --> 00:04:27.466
Um, it has the processor that converts our urine into water.

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:37.543
It also has one of our carbon dioxide removal assemblies which kind of

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.118
filters the carbon dioxide out of the air.

00:04:39.118 --> 00:04:40.505
- Do you guys still use lithium hydroxide?

00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:42.553
- We do that as a backup

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:44.657
so if these two things,

00:04:44.657 --> 00:04:47.120
the one here and the one in the lab,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.587
a similar piece of hardware,

00:04:48.587 --> 00:04:50.287
if they didn't work eventually we'd have to

00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:52.221
use lithium hydroxide.

00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:55.893
The Russian segment has a Vozdukh but that can't support six people

00:04:55.893 --> 00:04:59.232
so at some point you'd be using the lithium hydroxide cannisters.

00:04:59.232 --> 00:04:59.865
- Sweet.

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:01.066
- Hopefully we'd just get them fixed.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.098
- Good deal.

00:05:04.508 --> 00:05:06.670
- Through this little hole here

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.812
the hatch is closed but..

00:05:08.812 --> 00:05:10.415
Someone probably had training here..

00:05:10.415 --> 00:05:13.510
That would be the airlock where you would do

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.019
US space walks from.

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:15.617
- Got it.

00:05:15.617 --> 00:05:17.655
- And then go into the US laboratory module.

00:05:17.655 --> 00:05:19.798
- I notice that node right there has,

00:05:19.798 --> 00:05:21.558
it seems like the most space,

00:05:21.558 --> 00:05:23.702
it's the most spacious you can move around.

00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:27.386
- Yeah you know in space though we have a lot more hardware in here.

00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:27.884
- Got it.

00:05:27.884 --> 00:05:31.297
- Than we do in these mock ups.

00:05:31.297 --> 00:05:33.394
But this is the US laboratory module.

00:05:33.394 --> 00:05:36.246
Also has some life support equipment inside.

00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:40.779
It's kind of like the main module of the space station,

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:45.653
kind of like the bridge of the ship if you could have that kind of analogy.

00:05:45.653 --> 00:05:47.819
We can fly the robot arm from here.

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.542
And also fly it in the cupola.

00:05:49.542 --> 00:05:51.618
Then we have a lot of science racks

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:54.288
so we do a lot of the US science in here.

00:05:54.288 --> 00:05:55.819
The glove box,

00:05:55.819 --> 00:06:02.496
we have a minus eighty degree laboratory freezer,

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:03.630
we have three of these on board

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.141
but these are for some of our science..

00:06:05.141 --> 00:06:08.463
- That's where you like snip off pieces of yourself and stick them in there kind of thing right?

00:06:08.463 --> 00:06:10.631
- Yeah there's human samples go in there,

00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:13.404
other science samples.

00:06:13.404 --> 00:06:17.553
The other two of these are in the Japanese module.

00:06:17.553 --> 00:06:19.243
This is where robonaut lives.

00:06:19.243 --> 00:06:21.879
And then as you go into..

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.825
still going further forward,

00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:29.349
we have node two.

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.656
This is where a lot of our visiting vehicles dock.

00:06:31.656 --> 00:06:33.164
The shuttle docked forward.

00:06:33.164 --> 00:06:40.064
The HTV or Cygnus or Space X dragon vehicle

00:06:40.064 --> 00:06:41.397
dock to the bottom or the top.

00:06:41.397 --> 00:06:42.830
It's also where our,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.509
forward and top will be where the US crewed vehicles will be

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:48.384
at some point.

00:06:48.384 --> 00:06:49.542
We live in here,

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:50.272
we sleep in here.

00:06:50.272 --> 00:06:53.836
So three of the crew members sleep in the US,

00:06:53.836 --> 00:06:57.747
or four of the crew members sleep in the US segment.

00:06:57.747 --> 00:06:58.377
The three..

00:06:58.377 --> 00:06:59.610
- You'll have one here as well right?

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.088
- Yeah the coffin is on the floor,

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:01.733
we call it.

00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:03.828
When you float by it looks like someone sleeping in a coffin.

00:07:03.828 --> 00:07:04.925
If you want to get in there,

00:07:04.925 --> 00:07:05.824
I'll film you in there.

00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:06.485
- Oh sure.

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:07.491
So this is..

00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:08.459
Is this gonna be your bunk?

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:09.860
- Actually it is.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.534
So I'll be in the port side.

00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:12.665
It's pretty spacious.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:13.609
- It is, it's pretty good.

00:07:13.609 --> 00:07:15.969
I notice there's some sound dampening in here as well.

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:17.639
Can I see this real quick?

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:18.309
- Absolutely.

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:22.506
- So is this, I assume this one ethernet jack is your connection to the ground?

00:07:22.506 --> 00:07:24.747
You have two.. You'll have two computers in here.

00:07:24.747 --> 00:07:29.382
It provides power and data,

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:30.613
so you'll have a..

00:07:30.613 --> 00:07:33.617
One what's called a CSL laptop

00:07:33.617 --> 00:07:37.544
that gives you some kind of intermittent internet connectivity

00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:42.564
and also another computer where you have your email

00:07:42.564 --> 00:07:45.056
and other applications that you use.

00:07:45.056 --> 00:07:47.073
But you'll have a lot of personal items in here,

00:07:47.073 --> 00:07:49.499
your sleeping bag will be on the wall.

00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:51.103
So you kinda sleep in here floating.

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:52.628
It's actually not bad, you know.

00:07:52.628 --> 00:07:55.382
In micro gravity it's not a bad bedroom.

00:07:55.382 --> 00:07:58.213
- Yeah it actually sounds kind of cosy.

00:07:58.213 --> 00:08:00.216
I like the sound dampening.

00:08:00.216 --> 00:08:02.379
- So going further forward

00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:05.810
the Columbus module which is the ESA science module,

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.390
so we do a lot of science in here.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.400
Also have some stowage in this module.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.488
This module's unique on the space station.

00:08:12.488 --> 00:08:13.420
- Am I allowed to walk in here?

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:13.952
- Absolutely.

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:19.135
- I notice you've got.. You'll have racks on the ground and the ceiling so..

00:08:19.135 --> 00:08:20.793
- Yeah we utilize all the space

00:08:20.793 --> 00:08:23.542
so a lot of science racks.

00:08:23.542 --> 00:08:25.909
A lot of our human research is done in here.

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:30.144
We draw a lot of the blood samples in here,

00:08:30.144 --> 00:08:32.682
ultrasounds are done in here.

00:08:32.682 --> 00:08:36.547
Here's a mock up, actually a picture, it's not really a mock up,

00:08:36.547 --> 00:08:40.056
of where our ultrasound hardware is hooked into.

00:08:40.056 --> 00:08:42.391
We have a centrifuge for

00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:46.752
centrifuging our blood

00:08:46.752 --> 00:08:49.358
before we put it in the freezer.

00:08:49.358 --> 00:08:52.848
We have some other gas analyzers and systems

00:08:52.848 --> 00:08:57.535
that provide certain gas compositions for some of the experiments.

00:08:57.535 --> 00:08:58.570
- Real quick dumb question.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.849
When you're looking back,

00:08:59.849 --> 00:09:02.113
that's the JAXA Kibo node in front of us right?

00:09:02.113 --> 00:09:05.973
So when you're looking down here after you've been spinning around

00:09:05.973 --> 00:09:08.585
in here doing science, how do you orient yourself,

00:09:08.585 --> 00:09:11.952
there is no down so do you think along the axis of the space station?

00:09:11.952 --> 00:09:12.896
Does that become your datum?

00:09:12.896 --> 00:09:16.352
- Most of the modules are kind of oriented in the same way.

00:09:16.352 --> 00:09:20.896
- I notice the words always point a certain way.

00:09:20.896 --> 00:09:24.035
- Yeah so usually the lights are on top and the labels

00:09:24.035 --> 00:09:26.163
are in kind of this orientation

00:09:26.163 --> 00:09:28.372
so you generally live in this kind of,

00:09:28.372 --> 00:09:30.571
"this is the floor and this is the ceiling"

00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:34.738
based on the lighting and how the labels are written.

00:09:34.738 --> 00:09:37.168
However in some modules like the PMM

00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:39.714
it's clocked differently so you go in there you've got to spin around.

00:09:39.714 --> 00:09:43.756
It takes a little while for your gyro to engage

00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:48.145
but.. you know people are used to lighting from above

00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:51.808
so it's really generally the lighting that describes

00:09:51.808 --> 00:09:53.991
or sets the orientation.

00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:55.657
- Yeah so some little haptic clues.

00:09:55.657 --> 00:09:57.528
I don't even know if that's the word but I know what you're saying.

00:09:57.528 --> 00:09:59.328
- So this is JAXA we're going into?

00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:00.824
- Yeah so this is the JPM.

00:10:00.824 --> 00:10:02.570
The Japanese Pressurized Module.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:08.612
One of the other science modules we have.

00:10:08.612 --> 00:10:11.040
We do a lot of science in here as well.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.442
Different science racks.

00:10:14.442 --> 00:10:19.317
This isn't really a good mock up of how this looks on the inside.

00:10:19.317 --> 00:10:21.585
We don't.. when we have our science training

00:10:21.585 --> 00:10:22.893
we generally don't do it in here.

00:10:22.893 --> 00:10:27.106
We have a facility that'll have a almost fully functional

00:10:27.106 --> 00:10:31.296
mock up of the science rack we have so..

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:31.829
- Got it.

00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:33.331
- this is just more for like emergency..

00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:35.137
- So these racks are modular right?

00:10:35.137 --> 00:10:36.139
You can just pop them out?

00:10:36.139 --> 00:10:37.574
- Yeah we can move them in and out,

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:41.381
bring them up on HTV or some of the other cargo vehicles.

00:10:41.381 --> 00:10:42.643
- Got it.

00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:45.148
- And as we go further forward

00:10:45.148 --> 00:10:49.682
the Japanese part of the space station

00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:52.512
has a robot arm with an exposed facility outside

00:10:52.512 --> 00:10:56.255
that allows us to move science payloads..

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:57.248
- That's the back porch, isn't it.

00:10:57.248 --> 00:10:59.507
- The porch.. the side porch.

00:10:59.507 --> 00:11:00.259
- Oh is it. Gotcha.

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:02.426
- And then they have an airlock.

00:11:02.426 --> 00:11:04.269
We can also move stuff in and out.

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:06.621
You can't put people in here but you can put hardware in here

00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:08.860
to get it in and out of the space station.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.642
- That's nice.

00:11:09.642 --> 00:11:13.379
- And then a big closet up overhead.

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:14.943
- That's just where you throw all the junk.

00:11:14.943 --> 00:11:15.706
- Yeah.

00:11:15.706 --> 00:11:16.973
- Yeah, well thank you for your time.

00:11:16.973 --> 00:11:18.837
I know you've gotta go, go to Russia.

00:11:18.837 --> 00:11:20.418
- My pleasure.

00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:21.984
- Be safe, and..

00:11:21.984 --> 00:11:24.052
- Let's walk out this way and we can walk around.

00:11:24.052 --> 00:11:24.815
- Sure.

00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:25.990
Alright. So I'm Destin.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:27.284
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:11:27.284 --> 00:11:29.117
Thank you very much for Scott Kelly's time.

00:11:29.117 --> 00:11:31.014
You're like a national asset at this point

00:11:31.014 --> 00:11:32.559
so it's a big deal that we got this tour.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.270
So have a good one. Bye.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.030
So there you go.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.091
Anytime from now on you see a video from

00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:38.235
the International Space Station

00:11:38.235 --> 00:11:40.136
I hope you know where you are in relation

00:11:40.136 --> 00:11:42.135
to where everything else on the station is.

00:11:42.135 --> 00:11:43.371
It's really cool, I enjoy it,

00:11:43.371 --> 00:11:44.591
I really hope you do too.

00:11:44.591 --> 00:11:46.539
I want to say thank you to the patrons who support

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.043
Smarter Every Day on Patreon.

00:11:48.043 --> 00:11:49.152
In this particular video

00:11:49.152 --> 00:11:50.872
not only did you pay for my flight out there,

00:11:50.872 --> 00:11:53.109
but that little radar thing in the bottom corner,

00:11:53.109 --> 00:11:54.254
you made that happen.

00:11:54.254 --> 00:11:55.243
It's really complicated.

00:11:55.243 --> 00:11:58.783
We had to motion track my camera position relative to a wire frame

00:11:58.783 --> 00:12:01.891
of the space station for every single second of the video.

00:12:01.891 --> 00:12:03.554
There's no way I could have done that on my own

00:12:03.554 --> 00:12:05.455
and you patrons made that happen.

00:12:05.455 --> 00:12:07.992
So if youre interested in supporting cool stuff like that in the future,

00:12:07.992 --> 00:12:10.931
patreon.com/smartereveryday

00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.396
I'll leave a link in the video description.

00:12:12.396 --> 00:12:13.878
I hope this added value to your life.

00:12:13.878 --> 00:12:15.562
If so, please consider subscribing.

00:12:15.562 --> 00:12:16.964
If that ain't your thing, no big deal.

00:12:16.964 --> 00:12:18.076
I'm Destin,

00:12:18.076 --> 00:12:19.575
you're getting Smarter Every Day,

00:12:19.575 --> 00:12:21.306
have a good one.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.051
Are there reaction wheels on station?

00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:25.009
- Yes.. no, well not reaction weels..

00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.911
- Control moment gyros.

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:27.358
- Control moment gyros and only..

00:12:27.358 --> 00:12:28.613
- Did we just become best friends?

00:12:28.613 --> 00:12:30.022
- And only an engineer would know the difference.

00:12:30.022 --> 00:12:30.950
- Did we just become best friends?

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.893
- We just became best friends.

00:12:32.893 --> 00:12:33.965
- [laughs] Yes.

00:12:33.965 --> 00:12:40.267
- And the neat thing is, once you become this level of best friends,

00:12:40.267 --> 00:12:43.432
now you can sit and talk about the advantages and disadvantages

00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:46.501
of reaction wheels versus control moment gyros.

00:12:46.501 --> 00:12:48.559
- After karate in the garage of course, right?

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:49.099
- Yes.

00:12:49.099 --> 00:12:54.910
- [laughs] I just had that conversation with Don Pettit.
