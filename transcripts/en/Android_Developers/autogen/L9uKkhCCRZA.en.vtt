00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:09.519
all right great came to the right talk
we did machine learning overall the

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:09.529
we did machine learning overall the
 

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:11.679
we did machine learning overall the
Google Play reviews and what we found is

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:11.689
Google Play reviews and what we found is
 

00:11:11.689 --> 00:11:15.819
Google Play reviews and what we found is
that 50% of all the one star reviews are

00:11:15.819 --> 00:11:15.829
that 50% of all the one star reviews are
 

00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:17.889
that 50% of all the one star reviews are
talking about stability issues so if you

00:11:17.889 --> 00:11:17.899
talking about stability issues so if you
 

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:19.990
talking about stability issues so if you
want to increase your star rating and

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000
want to increase your star rating and
 

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.210
want to increase your star rating and
reduce the number one star ratings for

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:22.220
reduce the number one star ratings for
 

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.860
reduce the number one star ratings for
your app the number one thing you can do

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:23.870
your app the number one thing you can do
 

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.139
your app the number one thing you can do
is focus on stability of your

00:11:26.139 --> 00:11:26.149
is focus on stability of your
 

00:11:26.149 --> 00:11:28.449
is focus on stability of your
application okay then once you fix those

00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:28.459
application okay then once you fix those
 

00:11:28.459 --> 00:11:30.220
application okay then once you fix those
stability issues what you do is to be

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:30.230
stability issues what you do is to be
 

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.650
stability issues what you do is to be
able to increase your star rating to

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:31.660
able to increase your star rating to
 

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.639
able to increase your star rating to
golden 5 stars

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:33.649
