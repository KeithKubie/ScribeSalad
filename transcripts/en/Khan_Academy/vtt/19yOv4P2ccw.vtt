00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.890
We're asked to round 152, 137,
245, and 354 to the nearest

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.840
100, which is another
way of saying round each

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.880
of these numbers to the
nearest multiple of 100.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.370
So let's think about
them one by one.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.890
So let's draw a
number line here.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.400
And here I'm counting
up by hundreds.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.290
What I've marked here,
100, 200, 300, 400, these

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.619
are all multiples of 100.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.535
I could keep going up.

00:00:27.535 --> 00:00:30.990
I could go to 500, 600,
so on and so forth.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.690
Now, let's start with 152.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.420
Well, where does 152 sit?

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.255
So halfway in between is 150.

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:39.360
152 is going to be right
to the right of that.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.190
So that's 152 right over here.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.730
So what are our two options?

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.060
We might round up.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.030
The multiple of 100
above 152 is 200.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.760
The multiple of 100
below 152 is 100.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.320
So which direction do we go in?

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.150
Do we round up to 200, or
do we round down to 100?

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.530
Well, if we're rounding
to the nearest 100,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.696
we want to look at one
place to the right of that.

00:01:07.696 --> 00:01:09.070
We want to look
at the tens place

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.170
to decide which multiple
of 100 it is closer to.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.820
And the rules are
very similar to when

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.600
we're rounding to the nearest
tens place or really any place.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.510
We look one place
to the right of it.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.780
So in this case, we
look at the tens place.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.500
And we say, if this is 5
or larger, we round up.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.450
And this is 5 or larger, so
we're going to round up to 200.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.910
So this we're going to round.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.900
152, we're going to round to
200, which also makes sense.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.030
152 is a little
bit closer to 200.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.090
It's 48 away from to
200 than it to 100.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090
It's 52 away from 100.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.040
So it makes sense to go up to
the nearest multiple of 100.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.200
Now, let's think about 137.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.970
And I encourage you
to now pause the video

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.550
and try to round each of
these other three numbers

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.351
to the nearest 100.

00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:05.710
Well, 137 is going to sit
someplace right over here.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.220
137 is going to be
right over there.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.450
So two options-- we
can round down to 100.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.470
That's the multiple
of 100 below 137.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.570
Or we could round up to 200.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.060
Well, 137, just looking at
it, is clearly closer to 100.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.900
Or we could apply our rule.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.235
If we're rounding
to the nearest 100,

00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:30.820
we want to look at one
place to the right of that.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.780
We want to look
at the tens place.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.290
If this is 5 or
larger, we round up.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.920
If it's less than
5, we round down.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.420
So in this case, we
would round down to 100.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.992
Let's do the same
thing with 245.

00:02:45.992 --> 00:02:47.950
If you haven't paused it
and tried it yourself,

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.283
once again, I want to emphasize.

00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:52.300
That'll make it really valuable
for you to try it on your own.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.450
So let's plot where 245 is.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.050
So 245 is right
around-- this is 250,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.435
so 245 might be
right around here.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.910
Now, let's apply that rule.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.810
If we're trying to round
to the nearest 100,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.830
we would look to one
place to the right.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.560
We'll look at the tens place.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.370
We could ignore the ones place.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.400
We look at the tens place here.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.180
If it is greater than or
equal to 5, we round up.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.180
If it is less than
5, we round down.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.542
So here, we're clearly
going to round down.

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:25.000
And when we round
down, we're going

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.780
to round down to the multiple of
100 that's directly below 245.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.720
Well, we're going to
round down to 200.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.850
We had two options.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.400
If we rounded up, we
would have gone to 300.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.490
If we rounded down,
we would go to 200.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.350
We're clearly closer to 200.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.990
And we can verify
that with the rule.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.350
The tens place, we're
in the 40's here.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.640
The tens place is a 4.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.090
We're going to round down.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.680
Now let's think about 354.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.760
If we were to plot
that, this is 350.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.620
354 might be right over here.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.630
So if we rounded down,
we would go to 300.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.214
If we rounded up,
we would go to 400.

00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:06.880
Now let's apply our
rule, and let's also

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.080
think about it on
the number line.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.955
This is all about finding
the multiple of 100

00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:11.230
that it's closest to.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.470
If you're trying to
round to the nearest 100,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.980
you want to look at
the tens place, a place

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.019
to the right of the
place you're rounding to.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.810
If the tens place
is a 5 or larger,

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.630
you're going to round up.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:36.100
This is a 5 or larger so we're
going to round up to 400.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.580
And that also makes sense.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:38.810
The rule is really valuable.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.519
If you're right at
350, right in between,

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.101
then you would need the rule to
say, hey, let's look at this 5

00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:43.790
and round up.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.090
But 354 is also closer
to 400 than it is to 300.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.790
It's 54 away from 300.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.490
It's 46 away from 400.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.601
So it makes sense that
we would round up to 400.
