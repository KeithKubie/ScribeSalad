00:00:06.911 --> 00:00:09.906
Our story is about a girl named Iris.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.132
Iris is very sensitive.

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:13.336
(Bird cawing)

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.621
So much that she is always in tears.

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:18.546
She cries when she's sad,

00:00:20.002 --> 00:00:21.512
when she's happy,

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:22.924
(Godzilla roars)

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.681
and even tears up
when things just get to her.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.339
She has special lacrimal glands
to make new tears

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:33.762
and special tubes, called lacrimal puncta,

00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:35.244
to drain old ones away.

00:00:36.687 --> 00:00:38.959
And she cries so much
that she goes through

00:00:38.983 --> 00:00:41.233
ten ounces of tears per day,

00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:42.516
thirty gallons a year!

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.344
In fact, if you look closely,

00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:48.622
you'll see that she's crying
a little bit all the time.

00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:52.568
The basal tears that Iris
constantly produces

00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:54.975
form a thin coating of three layers

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.706
that cover her and keep
dirt and debris away.

00:00:58.383 --> 00:01:00.891
Right next to Iris is the mucus layer,

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:03.721
which keeps the whole
thing fastened to her.

00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:06.031
On top of it is the aqueous layer,

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:09.425
which keeps Iris hydrated,
repels invasive bacteria,

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:12.404
and protects her skin,
or cornea, from damage.

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:15.561
And, finally, there is the lipid layer,

00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:18.735
an oily outer film that keeps
the surface smooth

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.054
for Iris to see through,

00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:22.276
and prevents the other
layers from evaporating.

00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:24.905
Normally, Iris goes about her day

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:28.185
without really noticing
the basal tears doing their thing.

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.017
That's kind of their whole point.

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.895
But one day, she meets a girl named Onion.

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:34.887
Iris is immediately smitten.

00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:37.211
Onion looks gorgeous in her
bright purple jacket,

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:39.104
and she smells terrific.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.244
So, Iris invites Onion
to her house for dinner.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.462
But when she comes in
and takes off her jacket,

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:47.073
something terrible happens.

00:01:47.097 --> 00:01:49.640
You see, when Onion's jacket is removed,

00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:51.475
a chemical reaction happens,

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.758
converting the sulfoxides
that make her smell so great

00:01:54.782 --> 00:01:56.592
into sulfenic acid,

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.575
which then becomes a nasty
substance with a long name:

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.281
syn-Propanethial S-oxide.

00:02:04.468 --> 00:02:07.727
The gas stings Iris,
and suddenly, she can't help it,

00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:09.449
she starts weeping uncontrollably.

00:02:10.327 --> 00:02:13.140
These reflex tears are different
from the basal tears

00:02:13.164 --> 00:02:14.338
that Iris is used to.

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:16.266
Because they're designed

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.481
to wash away harmful
substances, or particles,

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.194
they're released in much larger amounts,

00:02:21.218 --> 00:02:23.886
and their aqueous layer
contains more antibodies

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.338
to stop any microorganisms
that may be trying to get in, as well.

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.324
Both Iris and Onion are devastated.

00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:33.198
They know they can't continue
their relationship

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:37.589
if Iris is going to hurt and cry
every time Onion takes off her jacket.

00:02:37.613 --> 00:02:39.044
So, they decide to break up.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:42.310
As Onion walks out the door,
Iris stops crying.

00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:44.353
And immediately starts again.

00:02:44.688 --> 00:02:48.682
Only now, she's not crying
reflex tears but emotional tears.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.567
When someone is either
too sad or too happy,

00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.345
it feels like a loss of control,

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:55.611
which can be dangerous.

00:02:55.635 --> 00:02:58.817
So, emotional tears are sent in
to stabilize the mood

00:02:58.841 --> 00:03:00.808
as quickly as possible,

00:03:00.832 --> 00:03:02.733
along with other physical reactions,

00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:05.576
such as an increased heart rate
and slower breathing.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.825
But scientists still aren't sure

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:11.092
exactly how or why the tears
themselves are helpful.

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:15.298
They may be a social mechanism
to elicit sympathy or show submission.

00:03:15.873 --> 00:03:17.794
But some studies have also found

00:03:17.818 --> 00:03:21.376
that emotional tears contain
higher levels of stress hormones,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.295
such as ACTH and enkephalin,

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.642
an endorphin and natural pain killer.

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:30.399
In this case, emotional tears
are also directly calming Iris down,

00:03:30.423 --> 00:03:32.979
as well as signaling
her emotional state to others.

00:03:33.653 --> 00:03:35.963
Sorry things didn't work out
with Onion, Iris,

00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:37.061
but don't worry.

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:39.181
As long as you have
all three kinds of tears

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:42.143
working to keep you balanced
and healthy, it will get better.

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:43.267
You'll see.
