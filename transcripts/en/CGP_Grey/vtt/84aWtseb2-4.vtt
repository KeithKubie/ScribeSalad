00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.970
Every year some countries move their clocks
forward in the spring only to move them back

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.970
in the autumn.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.650
To the vast majority of the world who doesn’t
participate in this odd clock fiddling – it

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.500
seems a baffling thing to do.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.839
So what’s the reason behind it?

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.230
The original idea, proposed by George Hudson,
was to give people more sunlight in the summer.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.220
Of course, it’s important to note that changing
a clock doesn’t actually make more sunlight

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.980
– that’s not how physics works.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.890
But, by moving the clocks forward an hour,
compared to all other human activity, the

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.439
sun will seem to both rise and set later.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.430
The time when the clocks are moved forward
is called Daylight Saving Time and the rest

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.739
of the year is called Standard Time.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.190
This switch effectively gives people more
time to enjoy the sunshine and nice summer

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.579
weather after work.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.399
Hudson, in particular, wanted more sunlight
so he could spend more time adding to his

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:44.950
insect collection.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.110
When winter is coming the clocks move back,
presumably because people won’t want to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.239
go outside anymore.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.899
But, winter doesn’t have this affect on
everyone.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.220
If you live in a tropical place like Hawaii,
you don’t really have to worry about seasons

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.289
because they pretty much don’t happen.

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.269
Every day, all year is sunny and beautiful
so christmas is just as good of a day to hit

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:02.570
the beach as any other.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.690
As so, Hawaii is one of two states in the
Union that ignore daylight saving time.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.470
But, the further you travel from the equator
in either direction the more the seasons assert

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.670
themselves and you get colder and darker winters,
making summer time much more valuable to the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.670
locals.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.910
So it’s no surprise that the further a country
is from the equator the more likely it uses

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.520
daylight saving time.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.300
Hudson proposed his idea in Wellington in
1895 – but it wasn’t well received and

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.280
it took until 1916 for Germany to be the first
country to put it into practice.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.910
Though, the uber-industrious Germans were
less concerned with catching butterflies on

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.860
a fine summer evening than they were with
saving coal to feed the war machine.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.400
The Germans thought daylight saving time would
conserve energy.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.830
The reasoning goes that it encourages people
to say out later in the summer and thus use

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.450
less artificial lighting.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.930
This sounds logical, and it may have worked
back in the more regimented society of a hundred

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.860
years ago, but does it still work in the modern
world?

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.430
That turns out to be a surprisingly difficult
question to answer.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.260
For example, take mankind’s greatest invention:
AIR CONDITIONING.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.970
The magic box of cool that makes otherwise
uninhabitable sections of the world quite

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.350
tolerable places to live.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.250
But, pumping heat out of your house isn’t
cheap and turning on one air conditioner is

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.480
the same as running dozens of tungsten light
bulbs.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.640
If people get more sunshine, but don’t use
it to go outside then Daylight Saving Time

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.980
might actually cost electricity, not save
it.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.120
This is particularly true in a place like
Phoenix: where the average summer high is

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.540
107 degrees and the record is 122.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.350
If you suggest to an Arizonian to change their
clocks in the summer to get more sunshine,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.470
they laugh in your face.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.110
More sun and higher electricity bills are
not what they want which is why Arizona is

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.880
the second state that never changes their
clocks.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.200
Another problem when trying to study daylight
saving time is rapid changes in technology

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.380
and electrical use.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.410
And as technology gets better and better and
better more electricity is dedicated to things

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.410
that aren’t light bulbs.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.800
And the lure of a hot, sweaty, mosquito-filled
day outside is less appealing than technological

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.900
entertainments and climate-controlled comfort
inside.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.510
Also the horrifically energy in-efficient
tungsten light bulbs that have remained unchanged

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.790
for a century are giving way to CFLs and LEDs
– greatly reducing the amount of energy

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.280
required to light a room.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.402
So, even assuming that DST is effective, it’s
probably less effective with every with every

00:03:02.402 --> 00:03:03.480
passing year.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.400
The bottom line is while some studies say
DST costs more electricity and others say

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.791
it saves electricity, the one thing they agree
on is the effect size: not 20% or 10% but

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:17.250
1% or less, which, in the United States, works
out to be about $4 per household.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.370
$4 saved or spent on electricity over an entire
year is not really a huge deal either way.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.830
So the question now becomes is the hassle
of switching the clocks twice a year worth

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.830
it?

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.110
The most obvious trouble comes from sleep
depravation – an already common problem

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.480
in the western world that DST makes measurably
worse.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.640
With time-tracking software we can actually
see that people are less productive the week

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.130
after the clock changes.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.830
This comes with huge associated costs.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.530
To make things worse, most countries take
away that hour of sleep on a Monday morning.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.780
Sleep depravation can lead to heart attacks
and suicides and the Daylight Saving Time

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.690
Monday has a higher than normal spike in both.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.000
Other troubles come from scheduling meetings
across time zones.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.489
Let’s say that your trying to plan a three-way
conference between New York, London and Sydney

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.950
– not an easy thing to do under the best
of circumstances but made extra difficult

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.170
when they don’t agree on when daylight saving
time should start and end.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.130
In the spring, Sydney is 11 hours ahead of
London and New York is five hours behind.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.580
But then New York is the first to enter Daylight
Saving Time and moves its clock forward an

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.580
hour.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.460
Two weeks later London does the same.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.000
In one more week, Sydney, being on the opposite
side of the world, leaves daylight saving

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.269
time and moves its clock back an hour.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.790
So in the space of three weeks New York is
five hours behind London, then four hours

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.940
and then five hours again.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.950
And Sydney is either 11, 10 or 9 nine hours
from London and 16, 15 or 14 hours from New

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.950
York.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.050
And this whole crazy thing happens again in
reverse six months later.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.180
Back in the dark ages, this might not have
mattered so much but in the modern, interconnected

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.270
world planning international meetings happens
1,000s and 1,000s of times daily – shifting

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.020
and inconsistent time zones isn’t doing
netizens any favors.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.990
And, to make matters worse, countries aren’t
even consistent about daylight saving time

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.100
within their own borders.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.169
Brazil has daylight saving time, but only
if you live in the south.

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.430
Canada has it too, but not Saskatchewan.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.690
Most of Oz does DST, but not Western Australia,
The Northern Territory or Queensland.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.260
And, of course, the United States does have
DST, unless you live in Puerto Rico, the Virgin

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.830
Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern
Marianas Islands or, as mentioned before Hawaii

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.830
and Arizona.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.690
But Arizona isn’t even consistent within
itself.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.530
While Arizona ignores DST, the Navaho Nation
inside of Arizona follows it.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.900
Inside of the Navaho Nation is the Hopi Reservation
which, like Arizona, ignores daylight saving

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.900
time.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.710
Going deeper, inside of the Hopi Reservation
is another part of the Navaho Nation which

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.980
does follow daylight saving time.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.980
And finally there is also part of the Hopi
Reservation elsewhere in the Navaho Nation

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.230
which doesn’t.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.230
So driving across this hundred-mile stretch
would technically necessitate seven clock

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.330
changes which is insane.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.949
While this is an unusual local oddity here
is a map showing the different daylight saving

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.919
and time zone rules in all their complicated
glory – it’s a huge mess and constantly

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.300
needs updating as countries change their laws.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.200
Which is why it shouldn’t be surprising
that even our digital gadgets can’t keep

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.680
the time straight occasionally.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.240
So to review: daylight saving time gives more
sunlight in the summer after work, which,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.199
depending on where you live might be an advantage
– or not.

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.120
And it may (or may not) save electricity but
one thing is for sure, it’s guaranteed to

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.840
make something that should be simple, keeping
track of time, quite complicated – which

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.680
is why when it comes time to change the clocks
is always a debate about whether or not we

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.699
should.�
