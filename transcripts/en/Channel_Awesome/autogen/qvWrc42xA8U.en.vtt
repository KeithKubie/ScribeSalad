like another thing with kind of identity
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.920

you know similar ideas not like a direct
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.960

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
for the most part not it it kind of does
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.080

stuff a little differently and a big
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.120
stuff a little differently and a big
part of that honestly is probably the

worked best when it came from just the
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.260
worked best when it came from just the
situation itself not really the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
situation itself not really the
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.149
situation itself not really the

one-liners that they try to put in there
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.020

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
hear that a lot more the comedy comes
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.429

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
from the situation there is an
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.370
from the situation there is an
occasional one-liner that for me didn't

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380

get out of a little more and I was
 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.199

asking myself why and I think what it
came down to is that the acting in this

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420
came down to is that the acting in this
 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.720
came down to is that the acting in this
movie is very good all the actors are

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730

more but I'd rather watch get out is
that get out kind of took place over a

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:23.350
that get out kind of took place over a
 

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.860
that get out kind of took place over a
long period of time and and like I said

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:25.870
long period of time and and like I said
 

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.350
long period of time and and like I said
the characters are very easy to relate

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:28.650
the characters are very easy to relate
to

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:28.660
to
 

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.680

this one it's it's mostly over like 24
hours at the majority of the film and

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:41.340
hours at the majority of the film and
 

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.920
hours at the majority of the film and
again that kind of falls into like the

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:43.930
again that kind of falls into like the
 

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:46.770
again that kind of falls into like the
slasher category that I just I just

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:46.780
slasher category that I just I just
 

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.440

can be great sometimes it can just be
 

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.520
can be great sometimes it can just be
dull and I feel like this is such a

00:09:59.520 --> 00:09:59.530
dull and I feel like this is such a
 

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.790
dull and I feel like this is such a
weird idea that you can kind of have fun

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:14.470
levels it can work on in a sense when
 

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:15.680
levels it can work on in a sense when
they're discussed when they're talking

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:15.690

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.050
I feel like that's a little bit more
 

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.110
I feel like that's a little bit more
like the slasher film stuff where you

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120

like the slasher film stuff where you
want like all the rules and stuff and

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:03.310
want like all the rules and stuff and
 

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.310
want like all the rules and stuff and
that's not how this works

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:05.320
that's not how this works
 

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.880
that's not how this works
this is not a movie that makes rules and

which again that does make it a little

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:18.550
which again that does make it a little
 

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.160
which again that does make it a little
tricky and scenes where they're just

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.170
tricky and scenes where they're just
 

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.750

stuff like that you know so it's it's
 

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.180
stuff like that you know so it's it's
one of those things where when you

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:36.190
one of those things where when you
 

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.800
one of those things where when you
really want to be afraid of these things

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:37.810
really want to be afraid of these things
 

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.100
really want to be afraid of these things
if that does kind of get in the way too

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.110
if that does kind of get in the way too
 

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.250
if that does kind of get in the way too
so so that is that is a problem but it's

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:44.260
so so that is that is a problem but it's
 

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.150
so so that is that is a problem but it's
not a major problem in my opinion I I

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:48.160
not a major problem in my opinion I I
 

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.970
not a major problem in my opinion I I
was happy when I got to the end because

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:50.980
was happy when I got to the end because
 

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.530
was happy when I got to the end because
I was really afraid that this was just

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:55.540
I was really afraid that this was just
 

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.230
I was really afraid that this was just
gonna be a sneaking around movie and

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240
gonna be a sneaking around movie and
 

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.240
gonna be a sneaking around movie and

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.070
they got something going here you could
actually stop right here and you could

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:14.080
actually stop right here and you could
 

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.340
actually stop right here and you could
read stuff into this so I was happy with

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:17.350
read stuff into this so I was happy with
 

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.500
read stuff into this so I was happy with
that but then it mostly just goes into

that but then it mostly just goes into
 

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.720
that but then it mostly just goes into
the chase it's mainly

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:20.730

the ideas disappeared
 

00:13:29.699 --> 00:13:31.790
the ideas disappeared
