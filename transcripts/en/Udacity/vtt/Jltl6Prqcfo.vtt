00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is a Â½ or 0.5

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
To see, let us multiply these two gaussians over here--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.950
which the exponent becomes an addition--

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.950
we can now rewrite this as follows--

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.950
when we bring the factor 2, for these two terms in to the numerator

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.000
as our 2 sigma square,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and from that we see that the new variance is 0.5

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.750
as large as the old one when applied to the squares.

00:00:28.750 --> 09:59:59.000
So, as a result, you would have this equation over here.
