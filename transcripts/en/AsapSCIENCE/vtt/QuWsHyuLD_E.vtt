00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.920
Our planet may be more connected than ever,
but loneliness has doubled in America since

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.820
the 80’s with more than 40% of adults saying
they are lonely.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.880
So should you be worried if you feel the same?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.150
Can loneliness...kill you?

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.720
Loneliness is a psychological mechanism designed
to motivate you to seek out social interactions,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.070
but it’s highly subjective.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.320
If you feel lonely, then you are lonely.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.189
And it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re
a loner or have no friends, it just means

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.169
that the social interactions that are necessary
to you are not being met.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.110
We often think of loneliness as something
that affects the elderly, but a recent study

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.800
found that young people aged 16-24 felt lonely
more than any other group of adults.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.490
In one painful study, scientists found that
being lonely made cold symptoms worse.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.090
Hundreds of healthy people completed a loneliness
scale test and then were given nasal drops

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.130
containing the common cold virus - blegh!

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.200
At this point, these poor sick induced participants
were quarantined in hotel room for 5 days

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.659
and those who reported being more lonely prior
to the test also reported more significant

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:05.880
cold symptoms.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.360
Have you ever noticed that food tastes better
when you’re hungry?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.280
Scientists have actually seen the same phenomenon
with loneliness.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.259
When hooked up to fMRI machines and shown
either an image of a loved one or a stranger,

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.109
those who tested higher on the UCLA Loneliness
Scale showed a bigger response in the reward

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.249
system of the brain when shown a picture of
a loved one, while those who were not very

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.030
lonely had a similar response between the
loved one and stranger.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.229
This helps us see that it’s not that lonely
individuals lack close relationships, but

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.619
rather, that they long for greater social
interaction.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.069
Chronic loneliness can also change your body
on a cellular level.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.350
Research has found that lonely people have
209 different gene expressions in some of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.030
their white blood cells, including increased
activity of pro-inflammatory transcription

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.030
factor.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.259
Now, inflammation is an important response
to injury, but chronic inflammation wreaks

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.009
havoc on your body.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.170
As a result, we see that poor social relationships
show a 29% increase in coronary heart disease

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.880
and 32% increase of a stroke.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.980
Overall, people with strong social relationships
have a 50% increased likelihood of survival

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.410
overall - that means they are much less likely
to die over the same period of time, making

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.019
loneliness as deadly of a risk factor as smoking
15 cigarettes a day, lack of exercise, or

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.019
obesity!

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.890
So yes, loneliness can increase your chance
of death.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.200
And the increased number of lonely people
may be related to shifts in our culture; global

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.069
capitalism and its focus on the individual
has changed our ability to access social connection.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.450
If you’re feeling lonely, know that you’re
- well - not alone.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.970
It isn’t usually a reflection of your likability.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.819
One small step you can make today to feel
more connected?

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.430
Try to make more intentional eye contact,
whether with those you know, or even a passerby

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.750
on the street.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.220
Studies have found that eye contact is a gesture
that makes both parties involved feel more

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:25.569
in touch with humankind.
