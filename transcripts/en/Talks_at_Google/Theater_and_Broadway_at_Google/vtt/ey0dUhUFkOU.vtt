00:00:06.727 --> 00:00:07.560
BEN: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.070
Hi, I'm Ben, the site lead.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.940
And on behalf of Google
Arts and Culture,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.390
I'm very excited to have Jamie
Bernstein and Clive Gillinson

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.410
here at Google New York
highlighting the West Side

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.540
Story Project, which was
created in partnership

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.982
with Carnegie Hall, the
New York Public Library,

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:27.440
the Museum of the
City of New York,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.580
and the National Museum of
American Jewish history.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.520
So 2017 is the 60th anniversary
of "West Side Story's" Broadway

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.680
premiere and is the centenary
of Leonard Bernstein's birth.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.710
So Google Arts and Culture has
initiated this one-of-a-kind

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.540
project to allow audiences from
all over the world to explore

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.660
a truly great and timeless
work of art through thousands

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.450
of pieces of exclusive,
never-before-published archival

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.640
content, 25 rich, educational,
interactive stories,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.340
and a groundbreaking
360-degree video

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.800
of the Carnegie-Hall-produce
performance of Riff's "Get

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.150
Cool, Boy" number.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.370
So I imagine you all have
seen "West Side Story." yes?

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.540
You're all familiar with--

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.340
no, I got a no.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.520
So well, you're in
for a treat then.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.080
I found out about
it in 11th grade,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.550
when my music
appreciation teacher

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.650
made the entire
class sing "America."

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.620
But more importantly,
more interestingly,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.100
I learned in preparation for
this event that at one point,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.240
the name considered
was "East Side Story."

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.840
And what a different production
that might have been.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.630
Maybe Jamie and Clive will
tell us more about that.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.100
So Google's inviting
audiences to dive

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.260
into the history and legacy
of the musical theater

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.150
masterpiece online.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.370
Jamie and Clive today
are here to discuss

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.920
the evolution of "West
Side Story" over the years

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.800
and why its themes
remain so relevant today,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.610
and the legacy of Bernstein
in his 100th anniversary year.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.970
So let me tell you a little
bit more about our guests.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.950
Jamie Bernstein is a narrator,
writer, and broadcaster

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.639
who has transformed a
lifelong love of music

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.680
into a career of
sharing her knowledge

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.510
and excitement with others.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.240
She grew up in an atmosphere
bursting with music, theater,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.900
and literature.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.200
Her father, composer-conductor
Leonard Bernstein,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.080
together with her mother, the
pianist and actress Felicia

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.610
Montealegre, created a
spontaneous, ebullient

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.330
household that turned Jamie into
a lifelong cultural enthusiast.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.490
Inspired by her father's
lifelong impulse

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.230
to share and teach,
Jamie has devised

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.930
several ways of communicating
her own excitement

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.760
about classical music.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.410
In addition to the
Bernstein Beat,

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.230
a family concert about her
father modeled after his own

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.200
groundbreaking Young
People's Concerts,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.020
Jamie has also written and
narrated concerts about Mozart

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.380
and Aaron Copland, among
others, produced radio programs

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.380
and documentaries on a
range of musical topics.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.170
And she's currently
at work on a memoir.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.620
Clive Gillinson became the
executive and artistic director

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.950
of Carnegie Hall
in July of 2005.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.710
He manages all aspects of
the world-renowned venue,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.840
overseeing the teams
responsible for developing

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.400
the artistic concepts for
Carnegie Hall presentations

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.520
in its three halls, from
orchestral concerts to chamber

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.570
music, solo recitals to
jazz and popular music,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.570
and wide-ranging music education
and social impact programs that

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.690
reach more than half a million
people annually in New York

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.270
City and around the world.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.010
Clive considers
Leonard Bernstein

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.980
to be one of the greatest
influences on his musical life.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.260
They worked together when
Clive was managing director

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.090
of the London
Symphony Orchestra,

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.286
collaborating on a number
of projects, including

00:03:45.286 --> 00:03:46.660
the founding of
the Pacific Music

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.270
Festival in Sapporo, Japan.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.597
Now, please join me in
welcoming Jamie and Clive.

00:03:52.597 --> 00:03:54.982
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:59.275 --> 00:04:01.535
CLIVE GILLINSON: Thanks.

00:04:01.535 --> 00:04:02.493
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Hello.

00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:03.730
CLIVE GILLINSON: Hi.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.200
Thank you-- oh, that was loud.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.375
Thank you, Ben.

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:09.550
And wonderful to
be here and really

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.300
to be able to talk a little
bit about this extraordinary

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.910
project that we've put
together around "West Side

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.820
Story" in partnership with
Google Arts and Culture, who

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.300
have been truly extraordinary
partners in doing this.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.280
I'd like to thank them very
much for what they've done.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.829
And as Ben said, I mean,
this really relates--

00:04:30.829 --> 00:04:33.370
the reason we got involved in
"West Side Story" at this time,

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.370
it relates absolutely
to the 100th anniversary

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.270
of Lenny Bernstein's birth, as
well as the 60th anniversary

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.230
of the first performance
of "West Side Story," which

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.110
is something that has
actually been part of life

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.400
around the world literally
since the first day.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.340
I mean, I know even today,
there are performances going on

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.650
in several places around
the world every single day

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.920
of the year.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.095
Now, as Ben
mentioned, I've always

00:05:01.095 --> 00:05:03.220
felt that Leonard Bernstein
was one of the greatest

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.770
influences on my life.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.170
I mean, he was certainly
the greatest conductor

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.010
I ever worked with.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.634
And that was both as a player in
the London Symphony Orchestra,

00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:13.870
but then subsequently,
as manager.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.540
But just to give a sense
of the impact he had--

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.120
I mean, obviously, his career
here in New York was colossal,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.710
but around the world as well.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.170
And I remember talking
to a member of the Vienna

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.260
Philharmonic Orchestra when he
went there for the first time.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.670
And for him, that was a
big deal because somebody

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.160
of Jewish origin going
there after everything

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.920
that happened in the war.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.790
And it was a huge thing for him.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.490
And apparently, you know, at
the beginning, he sat there.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.890
And there was huge anticipation.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.930
And he was sitting there,
and he couldn't start.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.010
He was so nervous and uptight.

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.660
And he was sitting there, and he
just couldn't start the music.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.130
And apparently,
the players said,

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.171
they were all looking at
each other and thinking,

00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:56.020
oh, my god, this is going
to be a total disaster.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.750
And then he started.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.985
And within 10 seconds,
every one of them

00:06:01.985 --> 00:06:03.360
was looking around
at each other.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.580
And they knew this was going
to be a love affair for life.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.700
So I mean, the impact
he had everywhere he

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.990
went was quite extraordinary.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.160
That was just as a conductor.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.720
He was also the greatest
music educator I've ever seen.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.630
Obviously, a great composer,
a wonderful and versatile

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.160
pianist.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.481
So his life, really, frankly,
was many, many people's lives

00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:23.980
in one.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.050
I mean, anybody would
have been thrilled just

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.620
to have lived one
section of his life.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.422
I certainly learned many
life lessons from him.

00:06:32.422 --> 00:06:33.880
And before we talk
about "West Side

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.720
Story" and this
fantastic resource,

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.950
I just wanted to explore a
few things I learned from him,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.100
but particularly to hear
Jamie's view on them,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.610
as a child growing up
with him as her father.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.170
I mean, one of
the first things--

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.202
I mean, Einstein
always said curiosity

00:06:52.202 --> 00:06:53.410
was the most important thing.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.260
Curiosity is far more
important than knowledge.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.830
And Lenny had an
insatiable curiosity.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.760
He always wanted to be
better at everything he did.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.470
Tomorrow had to be better.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.860
And his view was that if you
couldn't do it better tomorrow,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.950
you had failed.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.300
And even at the age,
I think, of about 60,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.570
he threw away all his scores for
all the Tchaikovsky symphonies

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.590
because he wanted to
study them all over again

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.920
without any preconceptions.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.630
So Jamie, as a child growing
up in a household with somebody

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.180
with this unbelievable
curiosity,

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.500
seeking forever for perfection,
how was that for you

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.360
as a child?

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.920
And how did that impact on you?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.530
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Well,
it wasn't boring.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.010
It was kind of an amazing
environment to grow up in.

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.990
And the thing
about my father was

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.560
that the curiosity
that you talk about,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.010
it was a symptom,
really, of the fact

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:57.180
that he combined being
a perennial teacher

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.030
with being a perennial student.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:04.680
For him, teaching and learning
were connected activities.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.320
And he was a compulsive teacher.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.170
Anything that he knew
and was excited about,

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.430
he felt compelled to share.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.360
So as his kids, my brother
and sister and myself

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.620
were constantly learning things
from our father, whatever

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.790
it was, whether
he was remembering

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.220
a vaudeville routine
from his childhood,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:33.360
or telling a Jewish joke, or
singing an ad from the radio,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.360
or telling us about
Mahler's Fourth Symphony.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.669
Whatever it was, it
was this compulsion

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.309
to share and
communicate the thing

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.809
that he was excited about.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:48.030
And that's why he was such a
good teacher on television.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.530
He did those Young
People's Concerts

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:51.570
with the New York
Philharmonic starting

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.980
when I was five years old.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.270
And he went on for
over 15 years, I think.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.860
There are more than 50 of them.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.310
And he was an
amazing communicator

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.300
because he just had this
thing that reached out

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.010
to share his own excitement.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.370
And that meant that he wanted
to learn as much as he could

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.220
about everything.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.886
And then the minute
he learned anything,

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:17.940
he had to turn around and share
it with the person next to him.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.354
So that's what made him
such a good teacher.

00:09:20.354 --> 00:09:22.020
CLIVE GILLINSON: And
I always remember--

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.103
because we did a big project
with him, a Bernstein

00:09:24.103 --> 00:09:26.280
festival in London in 1986.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.900
And we had dinners every night,
of course, as he always did.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.265
And the most extraordinary
people there.

00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:34.260
And every single
person he sat next to,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.390
whether it was a
nuclear physicist,

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.230
or a painter, or whatever, he
wanted to understand everything

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.510
about their life and
how their mind worked.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.310
And I think what was
extraordinary for me

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.440
about him was he assimilated
everything as well.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.832
It all became part of what
he understood about life.

00:09:49.832 --> 00:09:50.790
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Right.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.460
And in fact, that
was his whole thing

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.690
was to break down the
barriers between genres,

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:04.350
or even to connect seemingly
unconnected topics.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.920
And that was his whole way
of absorbing the universe

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.400
and then sharing it back
with everybody else.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.930
So when it came to
being a composer,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.790
he was mixing what we call
classical music together

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:23.800
with jazz and Latin
American music and blues.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.140
And any kind of music
that entered his brain he

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.590
would absorb like a lint
collector in a clothes dryer.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.320
And then and then
out from him would

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.290
come this music that
contained the lint from all

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.680
these other threads
and fabrics that he

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.817
had absorbed in his brain

00:10:42.817 --> 00:10:45.150
CLIVE GILLINSON: I mean, tell
me a little bit about risk

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.650
as well.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.700
Because I think one of
the lovely things somebody

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.840
once said to me about Lenny
was that he took huge risks.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.150
And I mean, that meant sometimes
things went wrong as well.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.510
But the fact is, he would
never take a small risk.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.730
And the way they
personified it was to say,

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.100
if Lenny Bernstein was
going to fall off a ladder,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.820
he would only ever fall off
the top rung of the ladder.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.317
He'd never fall off the bottom.

00:11:09.317 --> 00:11:11.400
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: I think
Steve Sondheim said that.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.090
CLIVE GILLINSON: Was
that Steve Sondheim?

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.390
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Yeah.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.590
CLIVE GILLINSON: OK.

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.940
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: At
least when Lenny falls,

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.590
he always falls from
the highest rung.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.760
CLIVE GILLINSON: Yeah.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.800
So I mean, how was that
in your life as a family?

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.610
How was that personified?

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.510
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Oh.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:30.360
Well, as a dad, he was he was
pretty reliably affectionate

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.280
and always enjoyed our company.

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.260
I never felt unwelcome
in my dad's presence.

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.180
So that part stayed the same.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.920
But as a family, we had to
go through his own career ups

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.870
and downs.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.640
And that put a lot
of stresses on us.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.640
"West Side Story" was a
giant success, of course.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.260
But not every piece
of his was a success.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.780
And in fact, his
biggest successes

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:00.720
were either before
we were born or when

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.270
we were really young as kids.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.240
And then as we got
older, his pieces

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:12.300
became more complex
and more demanding,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.860
challenging of the audiences.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.680
And so they were often
met with ambivalence.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.640
And so we, as his
family, experienced that

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.620
and had to live through that.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.799
And it was
complicated sometimes.

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:27.090
CLIVE GILLINSON: I mean, Ben
mentioned at the beginning

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.714
that with the London
Symphony Orchestra

00:12:28.714 --> 00:12:32.280
we created the Pacific Music
Festival with Lenny Bernstein

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.632
in 1990, which was actually
shortly before his death.

00:12:35.632 --> 00:12:36.840
And he was already very sick.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.940
And this was a project
to bring together

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.280
the most talented young
musicians around the world.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.240
And obviously, it was
all about his teaching.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.190
And we created an orchestra,
and he worked with them.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.550
And when he arrived there, he
was already very, very sick.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.710
And everybody was saying to
him, you've got to go home.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.840
But he simply would
not, because he

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.260
wouldn't under any circumstances
let the students down.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.480
And I mean, what
was astonishing was,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.950
I mean, he'd struggle to
get up and even to get on

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.260
to the platform to conduct.

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:06.760
But the performances,
you would have

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.250
no idea there was
anything wrong with him.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.110
Because the minute
he was in the music,

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.050
everything else disappeared,
and he was completely engrossed.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:18.520
But he was asked there, a great
conductor, a great composer,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.080
educator, pianist--

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.960
if you could only choose
one thing, what would it be?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.090
And he said, that's easy,
to be a teacher, education.

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.320
Yes, I mean, that's--

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.800
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Well,
because it was like breathing.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.990
So if you have to stay
alive by breathing,

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.930
then you would be a teacher.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:37.660
Yeah.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.400
And also by being a
teacher, that still

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.990
includes everything else.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.660
CLIVE GILLINSON:
So what about his--

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:47.020
I mean, the conflict with
writing "West Side Story."

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.750
I think it was Koussevitzky,
his mentor, who

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.120
said to him, if you're
going to be taken seriously

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.960
as an artist, you can't write
any more musicals like this.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.476
You've got to write
serious music.

00:13:57.476 --> 00:13:59.350
For him, that must have
been a huge conflict.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.820
Was it?

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.486
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: It
was a huge conflict.

00:14:01.486 --> 00:14:06.550
Well, back then, there was
really no one in the time

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:10.180
that he was coming up
who was crossing over

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.200
this way between
so-called serious music,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.880
orchestras and symphonies and
that whole world, and Broadway.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.970
And he was going back and forth
between writing symphonies

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.930
and conducting orchestras and
then writing Broadway shows.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.930
So his conducting
mentor, who was

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:33.145
from the old country,
Russia and Europe,

00:14:33.145 --> 00:14:35.670
and had the old-fashioned
way of looking at things--

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:41.080
and so he was worried that
his protege would lose respect

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.830
by continuing to write
for Broadway, that that

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:50.080
would somehow
disempower his protege,

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.750
or make him not be
taken seriously.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.830
And he strongly
advised his pupil

00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:01.210
to quit that Broadway nonsense
and stick to classical music.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.540
Well, luckily, my father
was really not good

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.590
at following the advice
of authority figures.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.500
He was always
finding his own path.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.590
And there were many ways
in which that got him

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.910
in trouble at the time.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.490
And even as a
symphonic composer,

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.930
he got in trouble, because
he liked writing tunes.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.390
That's why he liked
musical theater,

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.290
because he liked writing tunes.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:32.890
And in the middle 20th century,
12-tone music was the thing.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:35.920
12-tone music meant
that you were not

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.960
allowed to write
melodies and you were not

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.480
allowed to write in a key.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.510
So the music was
very intellectual

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:46.780
and thorny and challenging.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.950
And you wouldn't
go home humming it.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.890
So my father was perfectly
capable of writing

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:54.800
12-tone music.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.870
And sometimes he did.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.380
But he didn't want to feel
compelled to always have

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.700
to write that way.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.150
But by writing tunes
in his symphonies

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.280
as well as writing
12-tone music,

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.160
he automatically
disqualified himself

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:14.710
from being accepted into
the pantheon of what

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:21.070
the academics in the music world
considered a serious composer.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.150
He disqualified himself just
by insisting on writing a tune.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.180
But of course, now,
who's got the last laugh?

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:32.380
Because his symphonies
and other symphonic

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.500
orchestral works are so great.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.210
And they're so interesting.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.180
And they're so
broadband, because they

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.030
have all these different
musical influences in them.

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:46.240
And they have real longevity.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.730
Because now that
we are no longer

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.430
in this 12-tone
straight-jacket, his music

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.950
sounds great to our
contemporary ears.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.060
CLIVE GILLINSON: Yeah.

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.200
I mean, it's interesting
that he knew that.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.170
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: I'm
not sure if he knew it.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:03.490
He wasn't sure.

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.089
But he was just going to write
what he was going to write.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:06.849
CLIVE GILLINSON: Yeah, see,
just had to be himself.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:08.200
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: That
was the decision he made.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:08.800
CLIVE GILLINSON: Right.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.450
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
That was a big risk.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.420
And he knew he was risking
his entire reputation

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.339
as a so-called serious composer.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:20.050
But he was just going to
write the way he felt.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.040
And now we're glad.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.810
But there was no
guarantee for him--

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:23.976
CLIVE GILLINSON: Absolutely.

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:27.339
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: --that he would
ultimately get that last laugh.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.484
And he did not get it
in his lifetime quite.

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:32.650
CLIVE GILLINSON: No, I mean,
certainly the reviewers

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.826
looked down on music that
was tuneful, accessible.

00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:38.200
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
They mostly did.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.840
They had bought into that
whole 12-tone thing too.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.500
It was like a sort of
fascist musical state

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.230
that everyone lived in
the mid-20th century.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.660
It's amazing to think back to
it now, because we're so not

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.140
that way anymore.

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.970
But in those years,
it was tough.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:56.500
And as the musical director
of the New York Philharmonic,

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.860
my father was also
responsible for presenting

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.270
the young composers and
their new compositions.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.110
And he was very serious
about really backing them

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:10.330
up and presenting
them and making

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:14.890
their music as accessible as
possible to his subscription

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:15.600
audiences.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.990
And it was a challenge.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:20.900
But he was devoted to
really supporting them.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.232
It was a weird time.

00:18:23.232 --> 00:18:25.690
CLIVE GILLINSON: So I mean, to
come on to "West Side Story"

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.880
now, which, in a
way, we've led up to,

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.960
I mean, certainly for me,
it's the greatest musical

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.490
ever written.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.860
And what I love as well
is that for my kids,

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:37.760
it's exactly the same.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.330
There's nothing
generational about it.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:42.340
And as I said, it's
something that's

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.260
being performed around
the world every day

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.720
of every week, all the time.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.630
And what brought it together,
really, and led to this Google

00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.510
project, the Google
cultural project,

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.910
was the fact that
we were celebrating

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:02.540
our 125th anniversary at
Carnegie Hall in the 2015-16

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.040
season.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.230
And we were trying to
think, what should we

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.570
do as our creative
learning project, which

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.130
is when we work with kids?

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.230
These are projects
where we work together

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:12.670
with a huge number of kids.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.670
And they basically learn
a piece and to perform

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.940
in a piece that is
something that is normally

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:19.970
done by professionals.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.300
And there are a few
professionals who

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.190
sort of help to build it out.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:28.090
But we thought, what is
our dream of the one piece?

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:29.920
If we could just
choose one piece

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.950
to celebrate our anniversary,
what should it be?

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.980
And every single one of us
just said, "West Side Story."

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.720
I mean, it was automatic.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.540
That is what it had to be.

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:42.190
And now, as Ben mentioned at
the beginning, it started out--

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.856
I mean, firstly, it was about 10
years in the making, wasn't it.

00:19:44.856 --> 00:19:48.070
I mean, the team sort of
moved away from it in the late

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:52.330
'40s and only came back to it
again in the mid-'50s and was

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.730
going to be "East Side
Story" and about the Irish

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.960
and the Jews, rather than the
Puerto Ricans and white kids.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.850
And it was all
about gang warfare.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:03.280
And it was because gang warfare
was very much in the news,

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.060
I think, in the mid-'50s
that they came back to it.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.725
But tell us a little
bit about the genesis

00:20:11.725 --> 00:20:13.992
and why this arose again.

00:20:13.992 --> 00:20:14.950
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Right.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.230
Well, yes.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.050
The first idea of
"East Side Story"

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.680
was that it would take place
on the Lower East Side, which

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.870
was where there was
a big Irish community

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:27.760
and a big Jewish community.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.530
And it was going to be all about
Jews and Catholics and tempers

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:36.880
rising over the Easter and
Passover holidays, you see.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.930
This was the original idea.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.930
But even back then,
the idea was that it

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:46.120
would be based on Shakespeare's
"Romeo and Juliet" and the idea

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.340
that the Romeo and Juliet
characters would come

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.120
from these two
different worlds who

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.330
were at war with each other.

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.480
So the first idea was the
Jews and the Catholics.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:58.995
And somehow, they were
just not getting traction

00:20:58.995 --> 00:20:59.620
with that idea.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.120
So they shelved it.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.990
And when I say "they," I mean
my father and Jerome Robbins,

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.220
who was the choreographer and
dancer himself, and Arthur

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.810
Laurents, the playwright.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.280
So then Jerry Robbins,
or possibly Arthur,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.080
read an article in LA
about how the Chicanos

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.490
were having street gang fights
with white street gangs.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:27.460
And then suddenly, the
light bulb went on.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.830
And he thought, well,
what if we still

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.920
made it happen in New York
City, but where there was

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.940
a big Puerto Rican population?

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.060
And so the street gang
could be Puerto Rican.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:41.470
And the minute they
injected that new idea

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.100
of the Latin American
element, everything else

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.840
fell into place.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.760
For my father, it meant
that all of a sudden,

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.980
he had this delicious menu
of Latin American music

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.510
to represent the Puerto
Ricans in the story.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.970
The street gang was
called the Sharks.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.750
So suddenly, all the
Sharks and the women

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:08.350
and the characters
on that side had

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.770
had all these wonderful
Latin American rhythms.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.460
And then for the
Jets, the white gang,

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:17.800
my father used bebop jazz.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.730
And so the music was
telling the story just as

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.970
articulately and energetically
as the words were.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.220
And everything else
fell into place too.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:30.640
The dancing, Jerry Robbins
could use Latin American dancing

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.970
for the Sharks and then use all
these different angular motions

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.170
for the Jets.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.050
And the set design and the
costumes and the colors,

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:42.040
and everything just fell into
place with the Latin American

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.677
element.

00:22:42.677 --> 00:22:44.260
CLIVE GILLINSON: So
just for a second,

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.601
tell us about the relationship
between Lenny and Jerome

00:22:47.601 --> 00:22:48.100
Robbins.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.760
Because I read once somewhere
that somebody said of Lenny,

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.240
there were only two people
that Lenny was scared of,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.080
Lenny Bernstein was scared of.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.600
And that was Jerry
Robbins and God.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.197
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:59.197 --> 00:23:00.405
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: That's true.

00:23:00.405 --> 00:23:04.020
Well, Jerry Robbins
was famously scary.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.590
He was very intimidating.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.650
He really bullied his artists,
his actors, and his dancers.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:12.990
And he was famous
for being very mean.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.120
And during the rehearsals
of "West Side Story,"

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.090
he actually segregated the cast.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:21.420
And he said, all of
you playing the Sharks

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.370
and all of you playing
the Jets are not

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.530
allowed to speak to each other.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.790
You are enemies.

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.940
And he created
this actual discord

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.120
in the rehearsal
process to encourage

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.860
them to find their
inner hostilities

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.690
for their performance.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.870
And I mean, I don't know
if that worked or not.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.110
But all we can say is
the show came out great.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.610
So OK.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.670
But yes, my father
was intimidated

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.490
by Jerry and by his temper.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:54.940
And my father was the opposite.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.840
They were like good cop,
bad cop in the rehearsals.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.597
Because Jerry would
reduce everyone to tears.

00:24:00.597 --> 00:24:02.430
And then they would all
go running to Lenny,

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:03.960
and he would make
them feel better,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.640
and say, let's just
go around the piano

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.040
and rehearse this
number, and you're great,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.490
and it's all going to be OK.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.460
And he was made of love.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:15.540
That's the way he always was
with everyone he worked with.

00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.530
So somehow, in the
end, this combination

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:25.114
of bullying and love
seemed to work in the end.

00:24:25.114 --> 00:24:27.030
CLIVE GILLINSON: And
when did Stephen Sondheim

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.946
come into the picture?

00:24:27.946 --> 00:24:30.510
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Oh,
yes, so Steve Sondheim

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.956
wound up being the lyricist.

00:24:31.956 --> 00:24:33.330
Because originally,
my father was

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.100
going to write the
music and the lyrics.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.650
But it was just too
much to take on.

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.900
And they were
running out of time.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.070
And so they brought in this
kid, this 25-year-old kid, Steve

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.920
Sondheim, who was a protege
of Oscar Hammerstein,

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:52.440
as in Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein,
who wrote "Oklahoma" and "South

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.800
Pacific" and "Sound of Music"
and all those really big

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.910
Broadway shows.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:02.940
So Oscar Hammerstein's young
protege, very untested,

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.410
was recommended.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.690
And they brought him
in as the lyricist.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.942
And that all went
very, very well.

00:25:08.942 --> 00:25:11.400
And frankly, I think it's a
good thing they brought him in,

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.010
because he's a much better
lyricist than my father.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.333
He really was.

00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:16.656
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:16.656 --> 00:25:19.680
CLIVE GILLINSON: And the
issue of addressing openly

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.030
big social issues like
racism, gang warfare, all

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:26.820
of these things, plus a
musical that actually ended

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:29.109
sad rather than happy,
which was very rare.

00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:31.400
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Well, "Romeo
and Juliet" is a tragedy.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.316
CLIVE GILLINSON: Yeah.

00:25:32.316 --> 00:25:34.380
But I just wondered,
I mean, for him,

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.110
social issues was a central
part of who he, wasn't it,

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.930
addressing that.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.790
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Yeah, this
is such an essential element

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.750
of my father.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.850
It's really the other big piece.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:45.830
He was a conductor.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:47.500
He was a composer.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.760
He was an educator.

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.540
And he was somebody
who was always

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.970
trying to make the
world a better place.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.070
And what worked best
for him was when

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:59.560
he could find ways to do
that through his own music.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.870
And he did that
over and over again.

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:07.380
And "West Side Story" is his
most famous and successful

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:12.180
attempt, successful
attempt, to use his music

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:17.340
to explore the difficulties that
we all live with in our world,

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.500
and to use music as almost
a kind of healing process.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:28.140
So in "West Side Story," which
is about hatred and intolerance

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.810
and fear of strangers arriving
in your neighborhood--

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:36.360
and these are all, of course,
issues that are as urgent

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.840
for us today as they
were back then--

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.630
my father's music
really gives us

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.720
a language with which
to explore these issues

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:51.630
and find our ways
to resolve them.

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.460
I think there was
a part of my father

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:55.560
that really believed
that if he could just

00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.570
write a beautiful enough
tune and urgent enough piece

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.850
of music that maybe he
could heal the world.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:04.260
I mean, he wasn't crazy.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.450
He knew that was impossible.

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.200
But I think that impulse is
what really drove him forward

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.497
as a composer.

00:27:11.497 --> 00:27:12.960
CLIVE GILLINSON: Right.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.271
I mean, of course, he
never saw the project

00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:17.520
we did a few years back that
is a centerpiece of this.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.720
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
Oh, I wish he had.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.730
CLIVE GILLINSON: I mean, I was
just interested in your take

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:20.940
on that.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.898
Because all of this-- as
I said before, I mean,

00:27:22.898 --> 00:27:24.660
this was done with
kids, most of whom

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.022
had never done dancing before.

00:27:26.022 --> 00:27:27.480
They'd never done
any of the things

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.860
that we expected of them.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.840
They ended up doing
a performance that--

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.280
I mean, I know I'm biased.

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.185
But even though it's
biased, I thought

00:27:34.185 --> 00:27:36.060
it was the greatest
performance of "West Side

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.740
Story" I've ever seen.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:42.150
And I'd love your take
on the whole project

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.442
and what lay behind it as well.

00:27:43.442 --> 00:27:45.650
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Well, that
performance was up there.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.880
I'm really sorry my father
couldn't have seen it.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:53.610
In his era, he was pushing
the technological barriers.

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.050
Back in the '50s, and for him
back then, that was television.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:59.790
And television was
in its infancy.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:04.530
And it was his amazing idea to
put his Young People's Concerts

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.740
with the New York Philharmonic
on television, which

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:11.580
allowed him to reach this
incredibly enormous audience

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.490
of people who otherwise
had never been exposed

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.930
to this kind of music.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.560
So similarly, this "West Side
Story" at the Knockdowns Center

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.780
in Queens brought this
music to an enormous segment

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.020
of the population here in New
York City that otherwise would

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.760
never have been exposed to it.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:34.920
So it was like taking
my father's opening

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.790
up of music to new
audiences through technology

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.860
to the next level
in the 21st century.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:43.620
So he would have
been way into that.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.010
CLIVE GILLINSON: Right.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:46.440
So Jamie, I mean,
I've spent a lot

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.590
of time looking at
the "West Side Story,"

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:53.020
the digital presentation the
Google Culture put together.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:57.130
I'm just interested in your
take, just on that exploration.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.790
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
Well, it's magical.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:01.290
I love it.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.530
I haven't spent nearly
enough time yet exploring it.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.540
You could really go back
to it again and again.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.420
That's part of the
fun of it is that it

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:12.060
invites you to go back
repeatedly to explore

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.150
different parts of it.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:16.380
It's like a big mansion
with different rooms

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.630
that you can wander around
in to your heart's content.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:23.510
So I have to go back and visit
the mansion a few more times.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.180
But I think that's what's
really cool about it.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.620
CLIVE GILLINSON: Well, and
I think they have created,

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.299
or you have created,
they have created--

00:29:31.299 --> 00:29:33.090
I mean, it's probably
the greatest resource

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.720
that's ever been created around
"West Side Story' isn't it?

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.230
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Oh, for sure.

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.980
CLIVE GILLINSON: And it makes
it available to the world.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.160
And I think when we put on
the project with all the kids,

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.210
I mean, one of our
incentives or motivations

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.070
was we wanted to put
a project together

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.750
that could be done by kids
anywhere in the world,

00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:53.160
so to create a template that
meant everybody could do this.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.150
And I feel this complements that
by really opening up "West Side

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.210
Story" for everybody.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.050
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Yes, well,
by putting it on Google,

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.750
that really does make it
available to absolutely

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.160
everyone around the world.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.342
So what could be
better than that?

00:30:07.342 --> 00:30:08.800
CLIVE GILLINSON:
So I just wondered

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.710
if anybody would like to ask
questions to Jamie or to me

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:17.670
either about "West Side Story"
or other things about her dad

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.620
as well, who is--

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.390
I can only reiterate.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.150
I mean, I think he's probably--
"genius" is an oft-used word.

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:26.160
And it's used much too often.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.220
I think he's the only person
I've met in my entire life who

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.210
I know is a genius.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.230
There's lots of other people
people use the word for where

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.330
they're astonishing talents.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:37.860
But that's not genius.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.420
I mean, he was.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.850
And so I think his impact
on the world of music

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:44.775
and so many other
things was colossal.

00:30:44.775 --> 00:30:47.520
So I think there may well
be questions about him

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.920
people want to ask as well.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.541
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Any questions?

00:30:51.541 --> 00:30:52.040
Go.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.355
AUDIENCE: Should
we go to the mics?

00:30:53.355 --> 00:30:55.146
CLIVE GILLINSON: There's
two standing mics.

00:31:01.771 --> 00:31:03.520
AUDIENCE: So thank you
so much for coming.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.530
And it was such a
fascinating talk

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:07.459
to hear about your father
and his inspiration.

00:31:07.459 --> 00:31:09.250
I've actually never
seen "West Side Story."

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.000
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: What?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.370
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:11.120
I just moved here.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.050
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Well, at least
watch the video of the film.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:14.970
AUDIENCE: I will.

00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:16.280
But I'm a huge fan of the
Philharmonic and everything.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.274
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: I'm
sure it's on Netflix.

00:31:18.274 --> 00:31:20.607
Great.

00:31:20.607 --> 00:31:22.190
AUDIENCE: So what
was his inspiration?

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.710
What was your
father's inspiration

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.826
for being, like, a
constantly curious person?

00:31:27.826 --> 00:31:29.450
That's pretty rare
to find, especially,

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.570
I think, in someone older.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:32.620
CLIVE GILLINSON: [LAUGHS]

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.943
AUDIENCE: I mean, no offense.

00:31:33.943 --> 00:31:34.443
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:34.443 --> 00:31:37.010
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
Well, no, it's true.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.850
A lot of people shut
down when they get older.

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:40.480
It's true.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.850
AUDIENCE: And especially
when he was 60 years old,

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:45.940
he threw away
everything, which--

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.065
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Right,
the Tchaikovsky symphonies,

00:31:48.065 --> 00:31:49.270
the scores.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.080
AUDIENCE: So what motivated
him to be like that?

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.852
How was he constantly curious?

00:31:56.852 --> 00:31:57.394
I don't know.

00:31:57.394 --> 00:31:58.643
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: I don't know.

00:31:58.643 --> 00:32:01.000
I mean, to some degree, it's
just an accident of birth,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:01.750
I think.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.087
It's just the way
his engine ran.

00:32:05.087 --> 00:32:06.920
CLIVE GILLINSON: Were
his parents like that?

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.544
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
Well, the other part--

00:32:08.544 --> 00:32:12.070
this is what I was going to
also suggest as a possibility is

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:16.810
that his own father, Samuel
Bernstein, who escaped

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:22.090
Russia when the Jewish
people in Russia

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.990
were being butchered
in the pogroms.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:31.510
He escaped at age 17 and
came to the United States.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:35.030
And you know, the real
immigrant success story.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.630
He managed to start his
own hair and beauty supply

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.250
business in Boston.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.400
And got his whole family
through the Depression,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.120
and was a successful
businessman.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:49.600
But his passion in
life was the Talmud,

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:55.660
which is this gigantic
Jewish religious literature.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:58.150
And he was a Talmudic scholar.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:03.160
And his own intellectual
passion about the Talmud

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.570
was so profound that
maybe that somehow

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:12.460
was something he passed on to
his son, that kind of thirst

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.130
for knowledge, that
passionate curiosity.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.840
So maybe my father observed
it in his own father

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.250
and emulated it.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:22.766
That could have been part of it.

00:33:22.766 --> 00:33:23.391
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:33:23.391 --> 00:33:23.891
Thank you.

00:33:23.891 --> 00:33:25.640
CLIVE GILLINSON: I
think one of the things

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.420
I find fascinating-- when I look
at all the work we do in music

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.440
education, everything is about
trying to stimulate curiosity.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.270
Because one of the things--

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:35.590
you both touched on it--

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.520
that forever is depressing to me
is the fact that you virtually

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.380
never meet a child who
doesn't have curiosity.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.380
And you meet so many
adults who don't.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.480
And I mean, the
terrifying thought

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.150
is that maybe our education
system is actually knocking it

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.779
out of them.

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.695
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: That
is a terrifying thought.

00:33:52.695 --> 00:33:53.180
CLIVE GILLINSON: Yeah.

00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:54.150
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.129
CLIVE GILLINSON: Thank you.

00:33:56.129 --> 00:33:57.670
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
Any other questions?

00:33:57.670 --> 00:33:58.170
Oh.

00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:06.500
AUDIENCE: So obviously,
"West Side Story," you're

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.989
saying it's being
performed daily

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:11.000
by different people in
different countries.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.699
What do you see next for it?

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.196
Or is there any type of
performance it hasn't had?

00:34:16.196 --> 00:34:18.154
I mean, obviously now,
it's in virtual reality.

00:34:18.154 --> 00:34:19.022
It's been on TV.

00:34:19.022 --> 00:34:20.230
It's kind of been everywhere.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.679
But is there anything
that you would want for it

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.810
you that think your father would
like to see with this musical?

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.360
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Oh, there
are actually many things

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.190
in the works, many things.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:35.894
Well, the film from
1961, I think it is--

00:34:35.894 --> 00:34:37.310
CLIVE GILLINSON:
I can't remember.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:38.810
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
--is much beloved.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.230
It won 10 Academy Awards,
including Best Picture.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:48.380
It's one of the most beloved
films that exist, especially

00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.870
among filmed musicals.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.770
But maybe it's about
time for a remake.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:58.760
Well, guess who's interested
in remaking "West Side Story"?

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.170
Just take a wild guess.

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.152
What film director?

00:35:01.152 --> 00:35:02.360
AUDIENCE: Lin-Manuel Miranda.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.985
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: No,
that's a good one.

00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:05.590
But he's not a film director.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.506
CLIVE GILLINSON: Right

00:35:06.506 --> 00:35:08.690
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
Spielberg, correct.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.200
Steven Spielberg has
said that he wants

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.500
to remake "West Side Story."

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.220
So we're really hoping that's
going to happen very soon.

00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:21.890
And that will
reintroduce the musical

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.270
to people who haven't
seen it in a long time

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:27.200
and will freshly introduce
it to a whole new generation

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.140
of people who don't
necessarily know it, like you.

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:30.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.260
So that's going to
be really exciting.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.020
And there are also
all kinds of new ideas

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.480
for ways of presenting
"West Side Story" live.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.720
So there are going
to be all kinds

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.830
of new theatrical
presentations being developed.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.710
And then there's this
other fantastic way

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:51.710
to see the already
existing film.

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:54.530
And that is with live orchestra.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.210
I highly recommend
it if you ever

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.710
see that it's being performed
that way in your community.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:03.530
It happens a lot.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.690
And it's quite a
technological feat.

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:08.990
Because apparently, the
dialogue and the music

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.570
were all on the same
track on the film.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:17.930
But they managed, in their
infinite wisdom and magic,

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:22.520
to scrub away the orchestra
and leave behind the dialogue

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:25.820
so that a live orchestra
can actually accompany

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.550
the voices on the film.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.190
And it's a really cool
way to see "West Side

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:34.442
Story," because the music sounds
amazing when you hear it live.

00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:35.900
But then you hear
it with the film.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.571
So that's also out there.

00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:40.820
CLIVE GILLINSON: Well, and
the other thing I genuinely

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.060
hope is that partly because
of this extraordinary resource

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.700
that Google have
created and the way

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.390
it's opened up the possibility
of doing really broad education

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.520
projects with kids around
this-- because, I mean,

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:57.350
it is the most powerful
life-changing experience

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:00.200
that any kids we've
worked with have ever had,

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.270
working on that project.

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:03.770
And the thought that that could
be something that people can

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.200
experience, kids can experience
all around the world--

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.210
and there's no reason
they shouldn't.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:09.920
I mean, I hope that
together, we've

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.770
all created a template that
enables it to be shared

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.750
in very different ways,
where people actually

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.941
participate, not just as
audience, but as participants

00:37:17.941 --> 00:37:18.440
too.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
interactivity is big,

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.180
especially with the
kids and all that too.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.346
CLIVE GILLINSON: Absolutely.

00:37:24.346 --> 00:37:25.372
There's another.

00:37:25.372 --> 00:37:26.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.410
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Hi.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:27.790
AUDIENCE: Thanks so
much for being here.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:29.880
"West Side Story" is one
of my absolute favorites.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.902
I never tire of the music.

00:37:30.902 --> 00:37:32.110
I've seen it countless times.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:35.000
I have a two-part
question for you actually.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.091
What you think drove your
father and the creative team

00:37:38.091 --> 00:37:39.840
to tell the "West Side
Story" specifically

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:43.720
the way that they told it, with
such a strong social commentary

00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.240
behind it.

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.040
They could have just
as easily written

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.340
a very beautiful musical that
was just the plain old classic

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:50.745
"Romeo and Juliet" story.

00:37:50.745 --> 00:37:52.370
And then the second
part of my question

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:56.070
is, if they were to start from
scratch and make it today,

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:57.444
what two groups
do you think they

00:37:57.444 --> 00:37:58.955
would have highlighted
as opposed to Puerto

00:37:58.955 --> 00:37:59.480
Ricans and white people?

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.770
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Oh, that's
a really cool question.

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:03.020
CLIVE GILLINSON:
That was very good.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.520
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
Let's go backwards.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.110
Let's do the second
question first.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:06.680
I don't know.

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.990
If you were writing "West
Side Story," what would

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:11.330
your two gangs represent?

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:12.330
AUDIENCE: The alt-right.

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:12.800
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Hmm?

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.740
AUDIENCE: The alt-right.

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.810
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: The alt-right.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:15.310
Ooo.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.130
That's a great idea.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:23.000
And you know, there are lots and
lots of parodies of "West Side

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.430
Story" where they
do exactly this

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.480
and recreate "West Side
Story" with new groups,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.700
new opposing gangs.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:35.720
So I think the alt-right,
that would very interesting,

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:41.180
especially since, to go
back to your first question,

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:47.730
all three of the original older
creators of "West Side Story,"

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.300
Bernstein, Robbins,
and Laurents--

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.840
Sondheim was young, so he was in
a slightly different category.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.670
But the three older
ones all came up

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:03.290
in the 1930s and early
'40s in this atmosphere

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:08.840
of left-wing,
liberal values being

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.940
very central to everybody's
experience in the United

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.660
States.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.930
During the Depression
and Franklin Roosevelt,

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:22.370
there was this movement called
the Popular Front, where

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.660
all these left-wing
organizations were considered

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:29.550
to be very mainstream,
and everybody

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.730
was very plugged
into how this was

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.560
going to make the world better.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.822
And socialism was a big thing.

00:39:34.822 --> 00:39:36.530
And they were all very
interested in what

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.900
was going on in Russia.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.700
And it wasn't until
a little later

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:44.360
that they discovered how
despotic and tyrannical

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.920
the Soviet Union actually was.

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.700
But for a while there, they
were very idealistic about it.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:55.370
And so I think that their
whole leftism really

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:58.820
informed their desire to make
the world a better place.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.180
They were really invested
in doing everything

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:08.690
they could to lift up audiences
and get them to think about how

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:10.970
to make their world
better and how

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:16.550
to overcome any kind of
prejudice or injustice

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:19.040
or hatred, all of
which was very much

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.170
in the fabric of
the United States

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.260
back then, as it still is today.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:29.600
And that's why "Romeo and
Juliet" was the perfect vehicle

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.640
to use for "West Side Story."

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:36.170
And it's why this musical
never loses its urgency.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:41.870
Because all those issues that
were so in the fabric of life

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.910
all the way back in
Shakespeare's day

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:46.790
are still with us today.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:49.520
It's a little depressing that
we never seem to get past it.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.310
But here we are all
these centuries later,

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:57.510
and these issues of hatred and
intolerance are still with us.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:03.890
And so "Romeo and Juliet" still
speaks to us today, and so does

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.150
"West Side Story."

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:07.560
It's just as urgent as ever.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.100
CLIVE GILLINSON: I'd be
interested in some of your take

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.800
on the issue particularly
about tribalism.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.860
Because one of the things
that genuinely baffles me is,

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.100
I'd assumed that as
people get more educated,

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.500
tribalism would be
something that wane.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.170
If anything, when you
look around the world now,

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:28.760
tribalism is actually more
powerful than it's ever been,

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.340
which is really disturbing.

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.350
And I have no idea
why that's happening.

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.010
I mean, whether it's about
people struggling for identity

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.060
or what it is.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.667
But I'm just curious
as to whether you

00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:43.250
feel some of these things-- you
know, what you feel about some

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.010
of the themes that are
really at the center of this,

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.820
how you feel they play today.

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.939
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Anybody
have a thought about that?

00:41:52.939 --> 00:41:54.480
AUDIENCE: I couldn't
say I would have

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.139
a succinct answer to that one.

00:41:56.139 --> 00:41:57.680
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
It's a big question.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.250
CLIVE GILLINSON: Right.

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.166
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: I sure
don't have the answer.

00:42:00.166 --> 00:42:04.820
I mean, it seems as if we're
making progress and devolving

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:05.960
at the same time.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.510
I mean, even if
you're all involved

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.270
in an organization
like Google, which

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:15.560
does so much to unite
peoples all over the world,

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.700
it feels as if that is an
enormous piece of progress.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.860
And yet at the same
time, everybody

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.800
seems to be splintering off
into their own little groups

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.320
and becoming more tribal.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.040
So it's as if we're going in
two directions at the same time.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.660
And I don't quite know how
that's all going to shake out.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.084
CLIVE GILLINSON:
Any other questions?

00:42:38.084 --> 00:42:39.080
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:39.913
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Hi.

00:42:39.913 --> 00:42:42.590
AUDIENCE: So the first
question is about Shakespeare.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:46.285
So before watching "West
Side Story," the movie,

00:42:46.285 --> 00:42:49.410
I also saw many versions
of "Romeo and Juliet,"

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.960
like in modern adaptions.

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.050
And none of them
really, like, got me.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:43:02.160
They all seemed out of context
until I saw "West Side Story."

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.650
And it really struck me as
the best modern adoption

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.430
of "Romeo and Juliet."

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:14.570
So I am wondering how the
creative team got inspiration

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:18.382
from the original
scripts of Shakespeare.

00:43:18.382 --> 00:43:20.840
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Well, I think
they just read the play over

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.350
and over again.

00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:23.790
And there is actually--

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.220
I think at the
Library of Congress

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:29.630
in my father's archives, there
is a copy of "Romeo and Juliet"

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:34.520
where he's written in the
margins all these ideas

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:35.630
that he's having.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.500
So I think that they
just immersed themselves

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.310
in the play.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:44.940
And the more they read it, the
more they thought about it,

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.830
the more they found
contemporary resonances.

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.400
But of course, it didn't
really come together for them,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.360
it didn't crystallize
until they had

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.380
the idea of the Puerto Rican
gangs versus the white gangs.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:05.690
That was the inflection
point when it all

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:07.610
came together for them.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:09.970
AUDIENCE: The second
question is about the names

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.280
of the main characters.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.985
How did they come up with
the name of Maria and Tony?

00:44:13.985 --> 00:44:15.860
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.010
I don't really know the
answer to that question.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.430
But my brother has
a friend who always

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:27.040
used to tease us by saying,
you know, I don't know why

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.290
in "West Side Story," when
Tony starts singing Maria

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.930
at the top of his lungs why
every window didn't open,

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:37.689
and every single woman
in the neighborhood

00:44:37.689 --> 00:44:39.230
didn't stick her
head out the window.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.990
Because of course, Maria
is such a common name

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:46.904
that you would think like 80%
of the women in the Puerto Rican

00:44:46.904 --> 00:44:49.070
neighborhood would stick
their heads out the window.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:50.540
So that was his joke.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.430
But I don't know how they
chose those two names.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, and
the third question--

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.190
I'm just curious.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:01.340
What's your favorite
score in "West Side

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:03.311
Story" if you have to pick one?

00:45:03.311 --> 00:45:05.685
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Oh, my favorite
song, you mean, in the--

00:45:05.685 --> 00:45:06.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.780
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Oh,
that is a tough one.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:11.140
You know, it changes
all the time.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:17.770
But I really love "Cool."

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.770
The music is amazing.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.520
And I was talking before about
how my father would break down

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.330
barriers between genres.

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:37.560
So "Cool" uses bebop jazz, but
also uses an absolutely correct

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:42.270
fugue form, the way
Johann Sebastian Bach

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:48.030
did it all the way back
in the 1600s and 1700s.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.860
So you're mixing a Bach
fugue with bebop jazz

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.230
and all these blues elements.

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:59.400
And it's amazingly
sophisticated.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.780
And the dancing that Jerry
Robbins invented to go with it

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.090
is just so extraordinary.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.810
I just think it's one of the
best things my father ever

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:10.790
created.

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:12.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:12.450
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Thank you.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:14.158
CLIVE GILLINSON: I'll
add a different one

00:46:14.158 --> 00:46:18.780
for me, which is "Somewhere,
There's a Place for Us."

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:24.810
And I think it's one of the most
beautiful, simple, pure pieces

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:25.520
of music.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.920
And I must have heard it a
hundreds of times in my life.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.669
And I don't think
there's ever a time I've

00:46:29.669 --> 00:46:31.830
heard it when I haven't cried.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:36.070
And it absolutely gets
one both musically--

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:37.937
and it speaks--

00:46:37.937 --> 00:46:39.270
I mean, again to quote Einstein.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.840
But Einstein said, anybody can
make things more complicated.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.840
The real skill is
making things simple.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.280
And it's a piece
of music which is

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.407
so utterly simple and
so perfect that it

00:46:52.407 --> 00:46:53.490
makes you weep every time.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:55.260
But it also speaks--

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.210
"Somewhere, There's
a Place for Us,"

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.060
I mean, it speaks really
to, again, this whole thing

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.430
around identity and people
finding a place for themselves.

00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:05.220
And it's the reason
why we chose it--

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:08.450
I mean, we actually called this
"West Side Story" production--

00:47:08.450 --> 00:47:11.760
we built around it something we
called the Somewhere Project,

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.660
where we worked with school
kids in huge numbers,

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.600
where they developed
songs around that

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.480
and what it meant to them.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.730
So I mean, that, certainly
for me, is the number.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.768
But I mean, you said
it's your favorite piece.

00:47:25.768 --> 00:47:26.476
Which is the one?

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:28.420
You know, "West Side Story" is.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.527
So which number?

00:47:29.527 --> 00:47:31.860
AUDIENCE: Probably I would
say "Somewhere" or "One Hand,

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.550
One Heart."

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:32.900
CLIVE GILLINSON: Right.

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:34.500
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Yeah,
the "One Hand, One Heart"

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.259
is beautiful too.

00:47:35.259 --> 00:47:36.175
CLIVE GILLINSON: Yeah.

00:47:36.175 --> 00:47:37.633
AUDIENCE: Actually,
my favorite one

00:47:37.633 --> 00:47:43.020
is "America," because the music,
the choreography and the lyrics

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:44.840
were just so perfect.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.260
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
Yeah, so perfect.

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:48.720
So I just saw a concert
version of "West Side

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.830
Story" with the Philadelphia
Orchestra in Philadelphia.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:54.477
And when they sang
the song "America,"

00:47:54.477 --> 00:47:55.560
there was no choreography.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.810
Everybody was just
standing there doing

00:47:57.810 --> 00:47:59.970
the music and the singing.

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.550
And when they got
to the line, "Nobody

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:07.930
knows in America Puerto
Rico is in America,"

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:12.870
Yannick Nezet-Seguin, the
conductor, stopped the music.

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:16.500
And there was this
gigantic deafening pause.

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.870
He stopped the music
so that that line

00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:20.280
would resonate in the air.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.480
It was right after
the hurricane.

00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.260
And there was this incredible
silence in the hall.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.980
And then everybody
went [GASPS],, yay!

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.740
[CLAPS]

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.470
It was very, very moving.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.300
Whoops, excuse me.

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.070
It's so true about
the song, "Somewhere."

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:37.170
and Steve Sondheim's
lyrics really

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:43.440
speak to us now because there
are so many displaced people

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:49.170
in the world right now between
refugees and hurricanes

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:50.590
and fires.

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:54.330
And there's just so much
upheaval in the world

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:58.200
and so many people who are
looking for a place somewhere

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:03.509
to feel safe and peace
and quiet and open air.

00:49:03.509 --> 00:49:05.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, when
I heard it, I thought,

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:08.520
this is still so relevant today.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.151
JAMIE BERNSTEIN:
Yes, more than ever.

00:49:10.151 --> 00:49:11.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:11.940
CLIVE GILLINSON:
Well, I think it

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:13.860
speaks to the power
of "West Side Story"

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.867
that between us, just
at the beginning,

00:49:15.867 --> 00:49:17.700
we've got four different
numbers that we all

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:18.754
think are the greatest.

00:49:18.754 --> 00:49:20.670
And actually, we could
all choose any of them.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.310
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Yeah.

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:24.045
CLIVE GILLINSON:
Any other questions?

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.190
In that case, I think
from both of us,

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:32.070
it's a huge thank you to
Google Arts and Culture

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:33.215
for creating this resource.

00:49:33.215 --> 00:49:34.340
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: Thank you.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:36.210
CLIVE GILLINSON: And
particularly to Amit Sood,

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.959
who was there right
at the very beginning.

00:49:37.959 --> 00:49:40.200
I mean, he was the
one who loved the idea

00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:43.310
and made sure it happened.

00:49:43.310 --> 00:49:45.660
But I think it's a
project about something

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.500
we all love and all care about.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.210
And to see that it's going to
be made available to the world

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:54.420
in a way that could never
have happened before I think

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.214
is very moving for all
of us involved, I mean,

00:49:57.214 --> 00:49:59.130
particularly, obviously,
Jamie and her family,

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.570
but I think all of us.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:04.200
Because music, really, is
part of a shared heritage.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:06.600
So I mean, thank you to
Google Arts and Culture.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.940
Thank you to all of
you for sharing with us

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.419
and for being here today.

00:50:10.419 --> 00:50:11.710
It's been great to talk to you.

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:12.630
JAMIE BERNSTEIN: And
thank you, Clive.

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:14.250
CLIVE GILLINSON:
Well, and you, Jamie.

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:14.770
Thank you.

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:17.820
[APPLAUSE]
