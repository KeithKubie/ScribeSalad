00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.579
when I was looking at the difference

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589
when I was looking at the difference
 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.560
when I was looking at the difference
between the communist system and the

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570
between the communist system and the
 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.450
between the communist system and the
Western capitalist system I started to

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460
Western capitalist system I started to
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.550
Western capitalist system I started to
get underneath the belief systems to

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
get underneath the belief systems to
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.320
get underneath the belief systems to
find out what was there it UN was

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
find out what was there it UN was
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.839
find out what was there it UN was
extremely helpful and other thinkers

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849
extremely helpful and other thinkers
 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.520
extremely helpful and other thinkers
that I'm sure you've heard me mention if

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
that I'm sure you've heard me mention if
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.079
that I'm sure you've heard me mention if
you've listened to my lectures Nietzsche

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089
you've listened to my lectures Nietzsche
 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.330
you've listened to my lectures Nietzsche

seem to be the people who had dug

deepest down into those subterranean

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
deepest down into those subterranean
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900
deepest down into those subterranean
levels and what I found I think was that

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
levels and what I found I think was that
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.870
levels and what I found I think was that
the communist system was very was very

shallow it was predicated on a set of

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
shallow it was predicated on a set of
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.189
shallow it was predicated on a set of
rational assumptions that were generated

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
rational assumptions that were generated
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.139
rational assumptions that were generated
by a handful of people with no real

by a handful of people with no real

biological or historical routing and I

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
biological or historical routing and I
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.560
biological or historical routing and I
think that the fact that that was the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
think that the fact that that was the
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.080
think that the fact that that was the
case was part of the reason why when

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
case was part of the reason why when
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.020
case was part of the reason why when
those ideas unfolded in real time they

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
those ideas unfolded in real time they
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.900
those ideas unfolded in real time they
were so murderous they just weren't

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910
were so murderous they just weren't
 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.910
were so murderous they just weren't
imagine that you know Karl Marx was

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
imagine that you know Karl Marx was
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.500
imagine that you know Karl Marx was
thinking well here's the game that we're

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
thinking well here's the game that we're
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.180
thinking well here's the game that we're
playing and here are the rules and so

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
playing and here are the rules and so
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.250
playing and here are the rules and so
that he laid out the rules explicitly

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
that he laid out the rules explicitly
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.500
that he laid out the rules explicitly
and then people made societies that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
and then people made societies that
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.270
and then people made societies that
follow those rules and it turned out

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
follow those rules and it turned out
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.069
follow those rules and it turned out
that that game didn't work at all

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
that that game didn't work at all
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.529
that that game didn't work at all
he just got it wrong and like seriously

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
he just got it wrong and like seriously
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.080
he just got it wrong and like seriously
wrong whereas in the West the ideas

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090
wrong whereas in the West the ideas
 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.289
wrong whereas in the West the ideas
emerged from a an unbroken historical

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
emerged from a an unbroken historical
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.810
emerged from a an unbroken historical
process that stretches back probably to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820
process that stretches back probably to
 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.690
process that stretches back probably to
the beginning of civilization say maybe

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
the beginning of civilization say maybe
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.399
the beginning of civilization say maybe
maybe all the way back to Africa who

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
maybe all the way back to Africa who
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.920
maybe all the way back to Africa who
knows how how ancient these ideas are

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
knows how how ancient these ideas are
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.270
knows how how ancient these ideas are
and there's there's an unbroken

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280
and there's there's an unbroken
 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.210
and there's there's an unbroken
continuity of ideas that emerged up and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
continuity of ideas that emerged up and
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.520
continuity of ideas that emerged up and
that and they're expressed in symbolic

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
that and they're expressed in symbolic
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.039
that and they're expressed in symbolic
form and it's on that symbolic platform

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
form and it's on that symbolic platform
 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.170
form and it's on that symbolic platform
which actually matches our biology and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
which actually matches our biology and
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270
which actually matches our biology and
our behavior that our more articulated

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
our behavior that our more articulated
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.330
our behavior that our more articulated
ideas rest upon and so I found that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
ideas rest upon and so I found that
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.600
ideas rest upon and so I found that
extremely useful and surprising I mean

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
extremely useful and surprising I mean
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.219
extremely useful and surprising I mean
it wasn't what I expected and and at the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
it wasn't what I expected and and at the
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.899
it wasn't what I expected and and at the
same time I was I was I had another

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909
same time I was I was I had another
 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.190
same time I was I was I had another
problem that he emerged while I was

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
problem that he emerged while I was
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.810
problem that he emerged while I was
dealing with this and one was that I

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820
dealing with this and one was that I
 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.810
dealing with this and one was that I
come to understand what group identity

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
come to understand what group identity
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.340
come to understand what group identity
meant to people like you have to have a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
meant to people like you have to have a
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.109
meant to people like you have to have a
group identity because you live with

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
group identity because you live with
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.700
group identity because you live with
other people and unless you have a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
other people and unless you have a
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.039
other people and unless you have a
shared identity Jonathan talked about

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
shared identity Jonathan talked about
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.020
shared identity Jonathan talked about
this a bit unless you have a central

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
this a bit unless you have a central
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.090
this a bit unless you have a central
pole around which you're all oriented

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
pole around which you're all oriented
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.029
pole around which you're all oriented
it's all chaotic and confused and and

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
it's all chaotic and confused and and
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.650
it's all chaotic and confused and and
you're in constant conflict and warfare

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
you're in constant conflict and warfare
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.930
you're in constant conflict and warfare
it's like that's a bad thing you don't

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
it's like that's a bad thing you don't
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.380
it's like that's a bad thing you don't
you do not want that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390
you do not want that
 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.090
you do not want that
and you're all confused individually and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100
and you're all confused individually and
 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.280
and you're all confused individually and
all of that that's a state of chaos it's

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
all of that that's a state of chaos it's
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.610
all of that that's a state of chaos it's
unbearable but if you tighten up the

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620
unbearable but if you tighten up the
 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.980
unbearable but if you tighten up the
group identity to too great a degree say

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990
group identity to too great a degree say
 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.990
group identity to too great a degree say
like the Nazis tried to do then the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000
like the Nazis tried to do then the
 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.790
like the Nazis tried to do then the
probability that you'll come to blows

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800
probability that you'll come to blows
 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.309
probability that you'll come to blows
with other groups reaches a almost a

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319
with other groups reaches a almost a
 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.860
with other groups reaches a almost a
point of certainty right and so it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870
point of certainty right and so it
 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.180
point of certainty right and so it
seemed to me that human beings were

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190
seemed to me that human beings were
 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.830
seemed to me that human beings were
damned if they did and damned if they

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840
damned if they did and damned if they
 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.900
damned if they did and damned if they
didn't on the on the one hand if you

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910
didn't on the on the one hand if you
 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.699
didn't on the on the one hand if you
dropped your group identity then you

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709
dropped your group identity then you
 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.440
dropped your group identity then you
fragmented and degenerated into the

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450
fragmented and degenerated into the
 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.170
fragmented and degenerated into the
chaos and if you gripped hard to your

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180
chaos and if you gripped hard to your
 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.540
chaos and if you gripped hard to your
group identity then you you tilted

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550
group identity then you you tilted
 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.640
group identity then you you tilted
towards totalitarianism and group

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650
towards totalitarianism and group
 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.410
towards totalitarianism and group
conflict and then I thought well that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420
conflict and then I thought well that
 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.630
conflict and then I thought well that
was okay in the past to tilt towards

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640
was okay in the past to tilt towards
 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.790
was okay in the past to tilt towards
group conflict because you know when we

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800
group conflict because you know when we
 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.610
group conflict because you know when we
had sticks and swords we'd have a war

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620
had sticks and swords we'd have a war
 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.080
had sticks and swords we'd have a war
and lots of people would get killed and

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090
and lots of people would get killed and
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.430
and lots of people would get killed and
lots of people would get hurt but the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440
lots of people would get hurt but the
 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.710
lots of people would get hurt but the
entire planet wouldn't burst into flames

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720
entire planet wouldn't burst into flames
 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.650
entire planet wouldn't burst into flames
right so you know this this this inborn

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
right so you know this this this inborn
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.300
right so you know this this this inborn
dichotomy of catastrophe that

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310
dichotomy of catastrophe that
 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.729
dichotomy of catastrophe that
characterized human existence wasn't

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739
characterized human existence wasn't
 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.110
characterized human existence wasn't
something that could spiral into

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120
something that could spiral into
 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.360
something that could spiral into
complete destruction and so we could get

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370
complete destruction and so we could get
 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.460
complete destruction and so we could get
away with it but now in a thermonuclear

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
away with it but now in a thermonuclear
 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.289
away with it but now in a thermonuclear
age it's like we didn't we can't get

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299
age it's like we didn't we can't get
 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.759
age it's like we didn't we can't get
away with it but that's still what we're

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769
away with it but that's still what we're
 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.920
away with it but that's still what we're
like we're still like that

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930
like we're still like that
 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.380
like we're still like that
and so for months I thought oh my god I

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390
and so for months I thought oh my god I
 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.120
and so for months I thought oh my god I
always believed that if you could get to

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130

the bottom of a problem you could solve
 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.270
the bottom of a problem you could solve
it because that was sort of the

and I understood as well that it had
something to do and that this was what

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530
something to do and that this was what
 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.220
something to do and that this was what
it was dramatized in the in the in the

it was dramatized in the in the in the
 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.230

in the passion story in the New

cotillion who takes the world's sins
upon himself and what that means in some

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970
upon himself and what that means in some
 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.820
upon himself and what that means in some
sense is that if you read about history

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830
sense is that if you read about history
 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.680
sense is that if you read about history
you read about Nazi Germany you read

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690
you read about Nazi Germany you read
 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.960
you read about Nazi Germany you read
about the Soviet gulags you don't read

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970
about the Soviet gulags you don't read
 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.780
about the Soviet gulags you don't read
as a observer looking at what other

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790
as a observer looking at what other
 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.410
as a observer looking at what other
people have done you read as the subject

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:07.420
people have done you read as the subject
 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.240
people have done you read as the subject
and the object of the history you're

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250
and the object of the history you're
 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.340
and the object of the history you're
both the person who was persecuted and

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350
both the person who was persecuted and
 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.800
both the person who was persecuted and
the victimizer at the same time and you

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810
the victimizer at the same time and you
 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.840
the victimizer at the same time and you
have to see both of those inside you as

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850
have to see both of those inside you as
 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.120
have to see both of those inside you as
actual forces in order to understand

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130
actual forces in order to understand
 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.160
actual forces in order to understand
history properly and of course that's a

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170
history properly and of course that's a
 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.130
history properly and of course that's a
very very terrifying thing to do it's

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140
very very terrifying thing to do it's
 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.720
very very terrifying thing to do it's
easier to take the part of victim in

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730
easier to take the part of victim in
 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.550
easier to take the part of victim in
some sense even though that's terrible

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560
some sense even though that's terrible
 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.200
some sense even though that's terrible
right because who wants to be the victim

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210
right because who wants to be the victim
 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.600
right because who wants to be the victim
of a concentration camp obviously but

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610
of a concentration camp obviously but
 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.760
of a concentration camp obviously but
maybe that's preferable ethically to

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770
maybe that's preferable ethically to
 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.860
maybe that's preferable ethically to
being the perpetrator but when you're

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870
being the perpetrator but when you're
 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.150
being the perpetrator but when you're
reading about Auschwitz you're not

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160
reading about Auschwitz you're not
 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.830
reading about Auschwitz you're not
reading about past history you're

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840
reading about past history you're
 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.720
reading about past history you're
reading about exactly what people are

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730
reading about exactly what people are
 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.240
reading about exactly what people are
like and that's a very terrifying thing

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250
like and that's a very terrifying thing
 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.220
like and that's a very terrifying thing
and so one of the things you have to do

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230
and so one of the things you have to do
 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.930
and so one of the things you have to do
if you're going to take responsibility

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940
if you're going to take responsibility
 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.930
if you're going to take responsibility
for the nature of your being is to take

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940
for the nature of your being is to take
 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.820
for the nature of your being is to take
responsibility for the malevolence

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830
responsibility for the malevolence
 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.890
responsibility for the malevolence
that's truly part of human nature and

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900
that's truly part of human nature and
 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.080
that's truly part of human nature and
that's that's part of the encounter with

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090
that's that's part of the encounter with
 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.000
that's that's part of the encounter with
the shadow from the Union perspective

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010
the shadow from the Union perspective
 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.920
the shadow from the Union perspective
and you know one of Ewing's proposition

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930
and you know one of Ewing's proposition
 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.600
and you know one of Ewing's proposition
was that the human shadow reaches all

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610
was that the human shadow reaches all
 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.450
was that the human shadow reaches all
the way down to hell and you know we're

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460
the way down to hell and you know we're
 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.360
the way down to hell and you know we're
used to thinking of religious language

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370
used to thinking of religious language
 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.330
used to thinking of religious language
maybe even as outdated superstition but

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:09.340
maybe even as outdated superstition but
 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.130
maybe even as outdated superstition but
if you take that sort of statement

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140
if you take that sort of statement
 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.780
if you take that sort of statement
seriously from a psychological

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790
seriously from a psychological
 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.520
seriously from a psychological
perspective what it means in some sense

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530
perspective what it means in some sense
 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.740
perspective what it means in some sense
is that the malevolence that resides

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750
is that the malevolence that resides
 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.560
is that the malevolence that resides
inside you at least in potential is of

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570
inside you at least in potential is of
 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.750
inside you at least in potential is of
the same sort as the malevolence that

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760
the same sort as the malevolence that
 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.430
the same sort as the malevolence that
produces the worst things that human

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440
produces the worst things that human
 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.670
produces the worst things that human
beings is that have ever done
