00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.029
[MUSIC]

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:10.160
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING EVERYONE!

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.820
AND WELCOME TO
RADCLIFFE DAY 2015!

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.480
AND WE DO HAVE A
SPECTACULAR DAY.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.350
SO I'M SO HAPPY
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.200
I'M LIZ COHEN.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.770
I'M DEAN OF THE RADCLIFFE
INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.140
I KNOW THAT WAS
FOR THE INSTITUTE.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.210
TODAY WE CELEBRATE RADCLIFFE
PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.720
AND WE HONOR JUSTICE
RUTH BADER GINSBURG

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.770
WHO WILL RECEIVE THE RADCLIFFE
MEDAL THIS AFTERNOON.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.510
IT IS A TRADITION TO BEGIN
RADCLIFFE DAY WITH A PANEL

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.080
DISCUSSION THAT
CONNECTS DIRECTLY

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.480
WITH THE LIFE'S
WORK OF OUR HONOREE.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.110
THE PANEL IS NOT
DEDICATED PURELY

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.660
TO OUR MEDALIST'S
SUCCESS, THOUGH THAT

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.410
WOULD BE RICHLY
DESERVED AND EASY TO DO.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.560
INSTEAD, WE EXPLORE
THE COMPLEXITIES

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.760
AND THE CHALLENGES
FACED BY ANYONE WORKING

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.470
TO CHANGE THE WORLD.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.060
THE RADCLIFFE MEDAL
CELEBRATES THOSE

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.960
WHO DO THE HARD WORK AND
FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.710
THEY WIN MANY, BUT NOT ALL.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.430
LAST YEAR OUR RADCLIFFE MEDALIST
WAS HARVARD PRESIDENT DREW

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.108
GILPIN FAUST WHO IS
HERE WITH US TODAY.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.730
THE MORNING PANEL
THAT RADCLIFFE DAY

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.920
WAS TITLED FROM CIVIL
WAR TO CIVIL RIGHTS,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.400
THE UNENDING BATTLE TO VOTE.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.060
AND IT FOCUSED ON THE HISTORY
OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND ACCESS TO

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.820
VOTING, IN HONOR OF DREW'S
COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL JUSTICE.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.960
OUR EXPERT PANELISTS
DISCUSSED MORE

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.820
THAN A CENTURY OF
CONTROVERSIAL VOTER ID LAWS,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.150
REDISTRICTING PLANS,
AND COURT DECISIONS,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.140
ALONGSIDE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS
TO ENFRANCHISE MORE AMERICAN

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.470
CITIZENS.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.270
THE YEAR BEFORE THAT WE HONORED
JANE ALEXANDER, ACTOR, ARTS

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.990
ADVOCATE, AND FORMER
DIRECTOR OF THE NEA.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.000
ON THAT PANEL TITLED FROM ARTIST
TO AUDIENCE, A POET, A PAINTER,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.040
A COMPOSER, A CURATOR, AND
A THEATER DIRECTOR SPOKE.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.180
THEY SHARED THE CHALLENGES
FACED BY BOTH EMERGING

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.840
AND ESTABLISHED
ARTIST TO PRODUCE

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.930
NEW AND IMAGINATIVE WORK AMIDST
ALL THE FUNDING OBSTACLES.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.620
AND THEY REMINDED US OF THE
ENDURDING POWER OF CREATIVITY.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.580
CHIEF JUSTICE MARGARET
MARSHALL, TODAYS MODERATOR,

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.250
WAS AWARDED THE RADCLIFFE
MEDAL THE PRIOR YEAR.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.760
THAT PANEL EXPLORED
DYNAMIC BETWEEN

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.260
THE LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.820
TITLED FROM FRONT
LINES TO HIGH COURTS.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.080
ITS TOPICS RANGED FROM LABOR
REFORM TO EDUCATIONAL ACCESS,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.160
TO MARRIAGE EQUALITY
AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.950
IN THE COURSE OF
DISCUSSING STIGMAS,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.100
SETBACKS, AND SUCCESSES, THE
PANELISTS CONSIDERED THIS

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.080
QUOTATION FROM MARTIN
LUTHER KING, JR.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.170
THE ARC OF THE MORAL
UNIVERSE IS LONG,

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.310
BUT IT BENDS TOWARD JUSTICE.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.550
BUT HOW DO WE MEASURE THAT ARC?

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.070
ONE WAY IS BY UNDERSTANDING
THE POINTS THAT GIVE ITS SHAPE

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.090
AND DIRECTION.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.350
FOR THIS MORNING'S
DISCUSSION WE ARE

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.040
LOOKING AT DECISIONS
AND DISSENTS

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.800
IN THE FIRST DECADE OF THE
ROBERTS COURT THAT MARK

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.720
THE PATH OF THAT ARC AS
IT MOVES THROUGH HISTORY.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.970
JOHN G. ROBERTS WAS NOMINATED
TO THE POSITION OF CHIEF JUSTICE

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.630
BY THEN PRESIDENT
GEORGE W. BUSH IN 2005.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.920
AT THE TIME OF HIS CONFIRMATION,
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.940
SAID JUDGES ARE LIKE UMPIRES.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.120
UMPIRES DON'T MAKE THE RULES.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.070
THEY APPLY THEM.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.450
HE WENT ON TO SAY
I WILL REMEMBER

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.480
IT IS MY JOB TO CALL BALLS AND
STRIKES, AND NOT TO PITCH OR

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.010
BAT.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.620
IN THE TEN YEARS SINCE,
THE ROBERTS COURT

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.170
HAS MADE A LOT OF CALLS.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.130
THEY HAVE CALLED SAFE AND THEN
CALLED OUT ON DOCTOR ASSISTED

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.750
SUICIDE, VOTING RIGHTS,
CAMPAIGN FINANCE REGULATIONS,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.080
AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
TO NAME ONLY A FEW.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.710
THIS MORNING OUR PANELISTS WILL
HELP US DECIPHER THESE CALLS.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.960
AND I CANNOT THINK OF A BETTER
UMPIRE THAN CHIEF JUSTICE

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.900
MARGARET HILLARY MARSHALL.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:11.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.400
MARGIE HAS HELD MANY
IMPRESSIVE TITLES,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.690
INCLUDING PARTNER AT CSAPLAR
AND BOK, PARTNER AT CHOATE, HALL

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.630
AND STEWART,

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.470
PRESIDENT OF THE
BOSTON BAR ASSOCIATION.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.810
GENERAL COUNCIL OF
HARVARD UNIVERSITY.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.410
AND OF COURSE CHIEF JUSTICE
OF THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.160
OF MASSACHUSETTS.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.160
WE LIKE TO THINK THAT
RADCLIFFE MEDALIST

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.590
IS ALSO ONE OF
HER PRIZED TITLES.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.610
AND WE ARE HONORED THAT SHE
WILL BE GIVING HER PAPERS

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.440
TO OUR SCHLESINGER LIBRARY.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.220
AS AN ASIDE, LET ME PROUDLY
MENTION THAT THE SCHLESINGER

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.410
LIBRARY HAS A NEW
FACULTY DIRECTOR.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.290
AND SHE IS WITH US TODAY.

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.630
HISTORIAN AND
AUTHOR JANE KAMENSKY

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.270
WILL BE JOINING THE RADCLIFFE
INSTITUTE AND THE HISTORY

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.160
DEPARTMENT AT
HARVARD IN THE FALL.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:11.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.750
THE SCHLESINGER
LIBRARY'S MARSHALL PAPERS

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.340
WILL BE A REMARKABLE
RESOURCE FOR ALL

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.700
WHO ARE INTERESTED IN CHIEF
JUSTICE MARSHALL'S VALUES AND

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.940
VIEWS.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.910
DURING HER 14 YEAR
TENURE AS CHIEF JUSTICE,

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.330
SHE AUTHORED MORE
THAN 300 OPINIONS.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.020
THE BEST KNOWN IS LIKELY
GOODRIDGE V. DEPARTMENT

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.360
OF PUBLIC HEALTH,
WHICH IN 2003 MADE

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.630
MASSACHUSETTS THE FIRST STATE TO
LEGALIZE MARRIAGE FOR SAME SEX

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.080
COUPLES.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:49.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.380
THIS IS A DECISION THAT
REVERBERATES MORE THAN A DECADE

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.210
LATER, AS YOU CAN SEE.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.420
INCLUDING VERY RECENTLY IN THE
CHAMBERS OF THE ROBERTS COURT,

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.990
AS WELL AS GLOBALLY WITH
LAST WEEK'S VOTE IN IRELAND.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:07.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.080
MARGIE RETIRED FROM HER POSITION
AS CHIEF JUSTICE IN 2011.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.580
BUT HER WORK IS FAR FROM DONE.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.580
SHE TEACHES AT HARVARD LAW
SCHOOL, SHE SERVES AS SENIOR

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.050
COUNSEL AT CHOATE, HALL,
AND STEWART, AND SHE

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.100
CONTINUES TO SHAPE
OUR APPRECIATION FOR

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.250
AND UNDERSTANDING
OF THE JUDICIARY.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.570
SO IT IS WITH GREAT
PLEASURE AND GRATITUDE

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.480
THAT I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME
IN WELCOMING THIS MORNING'S

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.000
MODERATOR MARGARET MARSHALL.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.445
AND OF COURSE WELCOME OUR
GUEST OF HONOR, OUR HONOREE.

00:07:46.445 --> 00:07:47.320
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:07:47.320 --> 00:08:16.126
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING EVERYONE.

00:08:16.126 --> 00:08:17.500
AND FOR THOSE OF
YOU AT THE BACK,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.230
YOU MAY NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD
THAT JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.200
JUST ARRIVED AND I FRANKLY DON'T
THINK THAT WAS A SUFFICIENTLY

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.970
WARM WELCOME, SO COULD YOU
PLEASE WELCOME AGAIN JUSTICE.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.310
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:57.830
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: THANK YOU.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.810
JUSTICE GINSBURG, IT IS
WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU HERE.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.870
WE ARE GOING TO PROCEED THIS
MORNING BY TALKING ABOUT THE

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:09.450
PAST TEN YEARS OF YOUR
COURT, AND DISCUSS

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.950
SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT
HAVE COME DOWN IN THAT TIME.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.750
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS
I THINK ALWAYS

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.050
IS DOES A CHIEF JUSTICE
MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.630
I DON'T REALLY KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:26.360
BUT I DO KNOW WE DO TALK ABOUT
THE WARREN COURT AND THE BURGER

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.130
COURT, AND THE REHNQUIST COURT.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.720
AND WE THOUGHT AFTER TEN YEARS
OF CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS,

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.070
WE COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE ROBERTS COURT.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.860
THIS MORNING WE HAVE
FOUR EXTRAORDINARY

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.210
PEOPLE WHO REALLY
KNOW A LOT ABOUT

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:44.640
WHAT GOES ON IN THE UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.880
THREE OF THEM
BECAUSE THEY WORKED

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.510
FOR JUSTICES ON THE UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.710
THREE DIFFERENT JUSTICES.

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.150
AND ONE OF THEM,
BECAUSE FOR 30 YEARS

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.040
SHE FOLLOWED EVERY
MOVEMENT, EVERY SYLLABLE,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.290
EVERY SENTENCE OF
THE ROBERTS COURT.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:01.790
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
LINDA GREENHOUSE,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.290
THAT YOU KNOW MORE INSIDE
STUFF THAN ANYBODY I KNOW.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.230
BUT SHE WILL TELL YOU
THAT SHE NEVER GOT

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.410
ANY OF IT FROM THE LAW CLERKS.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.220
AND I THINK THAT'S
PROBABLY CORRECT.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.680
WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO IS
HAVE A VERY SIMPLE FORMAT,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.710
WE'VE HAD SOME WONDERFUL
DISCUSSIONS LEADING UP TO THIS.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.940
EACH OF THE THREE, JOHN
MANNING, AND LINDA GREENHOUSE,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.130
AND LAUREN SUDEALL
LUCAS ARE GOING

00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:30.870
TO PRESENT THREE CASES,
AND THEN THE FOUR OF THEM

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.420
ARE GOING TO DISCUSS
DURING AND AFTER.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.420
AND THEN PROFESSOR KLARMAN WHO
CLERKED FOR JUSICE GINSBURG

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.990
IS GOING TO MAKE A FEW REMARKS
BEFORE WE ADJOURN TO LUNCH.

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.030
SO, PROFESSOR MANNING.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.500
&gt;&gt; JOHN MANNING: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.140
I WANT TO THANK DEAN
COHEN AND THE RADCLIFFE

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.235
INSTITUTE FOR PUTTING ON THIS
WONDERFUL EVNET, AND TO THANK

00:10:54.235 --> 00:10:56.610
CHIEF JUSTICE GINSBURG FOR
BEING HERE AND TO CONGRATULATE

00:10:56.610 --> 00:11:00.210
HER ON THE LATEST IN A LONG
SERIES OF MANY WELL DESERVED

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.080
HONORS.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.960
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE
SUPREME COURTS FAMOUS DECISION

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.120
IN NATIONAL FEDERATION OF
INDEPENDENT BUSINESS V.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.630
SEBELIUS.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.070
THE CASE GOT A LOT OF HEADLINES
FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:19.270
FIRST AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL
IT UPHELD THE CONSTITUTIONALITY

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.690
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT, OR AS THE PRESS

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.220
LIKES TO CALL IT OBAMACARE.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.650
THAT WAS A BIG DEAL
IN AND OF ITSELF.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.230
THE COURT SAYS THAT CONGRESS HAS
THE CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY TO

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.870
ORDER YOU OR ME TO
BUY HEALTH INSURANCE,

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:36.530
OR PAY A FEE OR
FINE IF WE DON'T.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.980
CONGRESS HAD NEVER QUITE DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.690
SO THE DECISION
ITSELF WAS A BIG DEAL.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:50.650
SECOND, THE COURT DIVIDED IN A
KIND OF GOOFY, INTERESTING, AND

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:52.340
REVEALING WAY.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:52.864
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:52.864 --> 00:11:55.280
YOU KNOW, ONE THAT MADE PEOPLE
KIND OF SCRATCH THEIR HEADS

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.780
AND SAY WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.980
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS WAS AT
THE CENTER OF ALL OF THIS.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.640
IN ONE PART OF HIS
OPINION THE COURT

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.840
SAID THAT THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE COULD BE JUSTIFIED

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.720
UNDER CONGRESS' POWER TO TAX.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.840
UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL
TAXING POWER

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.280
EVEN THOUGH CONGRESS HAD
NOT CALLED THE THING A TAX.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.260
THERE CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS
WAS JOINED BY THE COURT'S FOUR

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.980
DEMOCRATIC APPOINTEES.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:28.480
IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CHIEF
JUSTICE'S OPINION HE WROTE THAT

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.950
THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE COULD
NOT JUSTIFIED AS AN EXERCISE

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.720
OF CONGRESS' POWER TO
QUOTE REGULATE COMMERCE

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.420
AMONG THE SEVERAL STATES.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:41.210
IN OTHER WORDS OBAMACARE PASSED
MUSTER UNDER THE TAXING CLAUSE

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.340
BUT FLUNKED THE COMMERCE CLAUSE.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.120
THOUGH NO OTHER JUSTICE
JOINED THE CHIEF'S OPINION

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.020
ON THE COMMERCE
CLAUSE, THE COURT'S

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.180
FOUR OTHER REPUBLICAN APPOINTEES
WROTE A JOINT DISSENT THAT

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.680
ESSENTIALLY SAID THE SAME
THING AS THE CHIEF JUSTICE DID.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.180
THIS IS AN ODD TURN OF EVENTS.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.020
USUALLY IF THE COURT FINDS THAT
CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO DO

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.960
SOMETHING UNDER ONE CLAUSE
OF THE CONSTITUTION,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.200
IT DOESN'T BOTHER TO OPINE ON
WHETHER IT HAS THE POWER TO DO

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.705
THE SAME THING UNDER ANOTHER
CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.230
WE CALL THIS A DICTUM.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.950
AND THE COURT ISN'T SUPPOSED
TO WRITE ON ABSTRACT QUESTIONS

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.630
THAT DON'T AFFECT THE
OUTCOME OF THE DECISION.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.470
BUT TODAY I'M ACTUALLY GOING
TO TALK ABOUT THE DICTA IN THE

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.120
CHIEF JUSTICE'S OPINION
ABOUT THE COMMERCE CLAUSE,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.280
BECAUSE I THINK THAT PART OF
THE CHIEF'S OPINION CRYSTALLIZES

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.270
THE ROBERTS COURT'S APPROACH TO
FEDERAL CASES MORE GENERALLY.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.310
I THINK THIS COURT
LIKE ITS PREDECESSOR,

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:54.450
THE REHNQUIST COURT
FEELS VERY COMFORTABLE

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.190
SECOND GUESSING CONGRESS'
LEGISLATIVE JUDGMENTS ABOUT HOW

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:03.100
TO CARRY ITS POWERS INTO
EFFECT BASED ON THE COURT'S OWN

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.870
ABSTRACT ASSESSMENTS OF THE VERY
BROAD CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.581
OF FEDERALISM OR
RESERVED STATE POWERS.

00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:13.080
NOW IT'S IMPORTANT
TO ACKNOWLEDGE UP

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.880
FRONT THAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE
AND THE JOINT DISSENT AT LEAST

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.580
PROPORTED TO REST ON THE
TEXT OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.704
AS YOU MIGHT THINK.

00:14:21.704 --> 00:14:24.120
THEY WANTED TO POINT TO SOME
PART OF THE CONSTITUTION THAT

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.290
WAS AN ISSUE.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.520
THEY ARGUED BECAUSE THE
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE TOLD PEOPLE

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.120
SITTING AT HOME MINDING THEIR
OWN BUSINESS TO GO OUT AND BUY

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.190
SOMETHING, THAT THERE WAS
SIMPLY NO COMMERCE HERE

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.050
FOR CONGRESS TO REGULATE.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.910
IN OTHER WORDS,
WHAT THEY SAID WAS

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.630
IN THE STATUTE THAT
CONGRESS CREATED RATHER

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.600
THAN REGULATED COMMERCE, AND
THAT THAT WAS NOT PERMISSIBLE.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.190
LOOK, THIS IS AN
INGENIOUS ARGUMENT.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.980
INGENIOUS.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.140
BUT IT DOESN'T HOLD WATER.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.670
AND HERE'S WHY.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:04.430
THE OBAMACARE STATUTE IS ALL
ABOUT INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:07.410
EVEN IF I'M SITTING AT HOME
MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS NOT

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.710
BUYING ANYTHING
MUCH LESS INSURANCE,

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:14.300
THERE IS A MASSIVE INTERSTATE
HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.000
OPERATING ALL AROUND ME.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.100
AND THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE UNQUESTIONABLY

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.430
AND QUITE DIRECTLY REGULATES
THAT INTERSTATE MARKET.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.110
AND HERE'S HOW.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:30.260
A DIFFERENT AND UNCONTESTED
SECTION OF THE ACA SAYS THAT

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.670
YOU AND I HAVE THE RIGHT TO GO
OUT AND BUY INSURANCE, EVEN IF

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.040
WE HAVE PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.880
SO IF I'M A HEALTHY
YOUNG PERSON,

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.870
WHY ON EARTH WOULD I BUY
INSURANCE UNTIL I NEEDED IT?

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.740
THAT IS TO SAY UNTIL
I ACTUALLY GOT SICK.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.590
THIS INCENTIVE THREATENED TO
DRAIN THE HEALTHIEST PEOPLE

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:52.990
OUT OF THE RISK POO IN THE
INTERSTATE HEALTH INSURANCE

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.940
MARKET.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.990
AND THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE
REGULATES THE INTERSTATE

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.090
COMMERCE AND INTERSTATE HEALTH
INSURANCE MARKET BY PUSHING

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:08.190
THOSE POTENTIAL FREE RIDERS
BACK INTO THE RISK POOL, PLAIN

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.930
AND SIMPLE.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:14.480
SO IF IT'S NOT THE TEXT
OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:19.700
THAT'S REALLY DOING THE
WORK HERE, WHAT IS IT?

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:23.850
CERTAINLY NO CLAUSE OF THE
CONSTITUTION TELLS CONGRESS

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:27.010
THAT IT CAN'T MANDATE
INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.330
NOR IS THERE ANY UNSTATED
CONSTITUTIONAL TRADITION OR

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.150
PRACTICE OR LINE OF PRECEDENT
THAT PROHIBITS CONGRESS FROM

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:38.080
ORDERING PEOPLE TO BUY THINGS
IF DOING SO WOULD HELP CONGRESS

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.210
REGULATE INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:44.510
SO WHAT EXPLAINS THE CHIEF
JUSTICE'S AND THE JOINT

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:47.710
DISSENT'S POSITION?

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.680
A COUPLE OF THINGS.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.820
FIRST, AS I MENTIONED, CONGRESS
HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING QUITE

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.430
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:17:00.590
FOR THE JUSTICES WHO WERE
SKEPTICAL OF THE COMMERCE POWER

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:07.319
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STATUTE,
THE ABSENCE OF A PREEXISTING

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.030
PRACTICE OF, LIKE THE
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE,

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.900
WAS QUOTE THE MOST
TELLING INDICATION

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.260
OF A CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE OR
A CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITY.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:23.880
SECOND, THE STATUTE
REFLECTED A LARGE EXPANSION

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.859
OF FEDERAL POWER.

00:17:25.859 --> 00:17:29.680
AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S WORDS
QUOTE ALLOWING CONGRESS TO

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.760
JUSTIFY FEDERAL REGULATION
BY POINTING TO THE EFFECT OF

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:38.990
INACTION ON COMMERCE WOULD
BRING COUNTLESS DECISIONS AN

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.440
INDIVIDUAL COULD
POTENTIALLY MAKE WITHIN THE

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.880
SCOPE OF FEDERAL
REGULATION AND EMPOWER

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.000
CONGRESS TO MAKE THOSE
DECISIONS FOR HIM.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.020
TO PUT IT COLLOQUIALLY,
IF CONGRESS CAN

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:59.050
MAKE US BUY INSURANCE, IT CAN
ALSO MAKE US EAT OUR SPINACH.

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.370
ACTUALLY THE COURT
SAID BROCCOLI.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.990
BUT YOU GET THE IDEA.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:09.730
THAT THE CHIEF JUSTICE WROTE IS
NOT THE COUNTRY THE FRAMERS' OF

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:13.170
OUR CONSTITUTION ENVISIONED.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.640
AT ONE LEVEL THE CHIEF JUSTICE
IS QUITE RIGHT ABOUT THAT.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.750
THIS IS NOT THE COUNTRY
THE FRAMERS ENVISIONED.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.350
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE
LEGALLY RELEVANT POINT.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:32.040
EVEN FOR ORIGINALISTS.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.860
THE FRAMERS OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T
ANTICIPATE A COUNTRY OF 320

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.820
MILLION PEOPLE, A GLOBAL
ECONOMY, UBER CARS,

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:46.730
APPLE WATCHES, OR EVEN AN
INTERSTATE HEALTH INSURANCE

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.360
MARKET.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.920
WHAT THEY DID
ANTICIPATE WAS THIS.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.600
THAT THEY COULDN'T
FORESEE THE FUTURE.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.780
AND THEY EXPLICITLY
PROVIDED FOR THAT REALITY

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.600
IN THE DESIGN OF
THE CONSTITUTION.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.840
AND HERE'S WHAT THEY DID.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:08.120
THEY DID SO BY GIVING CONGRESS
PRIMARY AND BROAD AUTHORITY

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.660
TO ADAPT FEDERAL POWER
TO UNFORESEEABLE CHANGE.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.620
AS THAT OTHER CHIEF
JUSTICE MARSHALL

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.880
SAID IN A FAMOUS OPINION CALLED
McCULLOCK VS. MARYLAND WHICH

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.220
UPHELD CONGRESS' POWER
TO CREATE A CENTRAL BANK,

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.720
THE FRAMERS KNEW
THEY COULD NOT DEVISE

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.470
A COMPLEX SET OF RULES FOR
A CONSTITUTION INTENDED

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.080
TO ENDURE FOR THE AGES.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.750
THEY DID SET OUT SOME RULES.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.720
THE PRESIDENT HAS TO BE 35.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.970
LEGISLATION HAS
TO PASS 2 HOUSES.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.280
EACH STATE GETS TWO
SENATORS AND SO FORTH.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.120
AND THOSE RULES CONGRESS CAN'T
MESS WITH NO MATTER HOW THE

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.850
WORLD CHANGES.

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:51.940
BUT FOR MOST ASPECTS
OF OUR GOVERNMENT,

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.340
THE FRAMERS SAID VERY LITTLE.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.740
THEY MOSTLY LEFT
THE DETAILS BLANK,

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.590
AND THEY ADOPTED SOMETHING
CALLED THE NECESSARY AND PROPER

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.690
CLAUSE THAT GIVES
CONGRESS PRIMARY AUTHORITY

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:04.990
TO FILL IN THOSE BLANKS.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.430
AND CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL'S
WORDS, QUOTE TO AVAIL ITSELF

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.050
OF EXPERIENCE, TO EXERCISE
ITS REASON, AND TO ACCOMMODATE

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.820
LEGISLATION TO
NEW CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.880
IT WAS TO BE THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE SPEAKING THROUGH CONGRESS

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.500
AND NOT THE JUSTICES WHO WERE TO
FIGURE OUT HOW, WHAT GOVERNMENT

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:31.370
MEASURES WERE APPROPRIATE AS
AMERICA PASSES INTO NEW AGES

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.990
AND NEW WORLDS.

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:36.230
SOMETHING LIKE THE INDIVIDUAL
MANDATE OR WHATEVER

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.430
THE NEXT INNOVATION MIGHT
BE OFFENDS SOME PARTICULAR

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.900
CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT OR
LONG STANDING PRACTICE.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.496
IF CONGRESS WERE TO PASS A
LAW AUTHORIZING MATURE 34 YEAR

00:20:45.496 --> 00:20:51.120
OLDS TO BECOME PRESIDENT, THEN
THE COURT CAN AND MUST SAY NO.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:56.270
BUT IF THE COURT HAS LITTLE
MORE TO GO ON THAN ITS OWN SENSE

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.950
THAT THIS OR THAT ARRANGEMENT
IS TOO NOVEL, THAT IT GIVES

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.340
CONGRESS TOO MUCH POWER, OR IT
IS SOMETHING THAT THE FRAMERS

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.130
WOULD NOT HAVE COUNTENANCED
IN THE WORLD THAT THEY KNEW,

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.560
THEN THE COURT IS MAKING
A JUDGMENT CALL THAT THE

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:16.310
CONSTITUTION EXPLICITLY
RESERVES TO CONGRESS.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:20.510
IN CASES LIKE SEBELIUS IT
IS PRECISELY THIS ALLOCATION

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.120
OF DECISION MAKING POWER
THAT SHOULD BE FOREMOST

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.870
IN THE COURT'S DELIBERATIONS.

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:27.862
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.780
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL:
THANK YOU JOHN.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:44.047
AND I DO HAVE TO SAY I DID SEE
YOU REACHING FOR THE SPINACH

00:21:44.047 --> 00:21:44.880
QUICHE THIS MORNING.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.840
AS YOU KNOW, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
DO IS GO BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.650
BETWEEN QUESTIONS
FROM AMONG OURSELVES,

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.290
AND ALSO QUESTIONS FROM YOU.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.280
THERE ARE NOTE CARDS IF YOU
HAVE ANY PLEASE PASS THEM

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.080
ALONG AND SOMEBODY WILL
COME AND PICK THEM.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.260
RAISE YOUR HAND.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.500
AND THE PEOPLE AT THE
BACK, IF YOU CAN'T HEAR,

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.570
PLEASE WAVE LIKE CRAZY
AND WE'LL TRY TO FIX THAT.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.790
I HAVE ONE QUESTION, AND ANY OF
THE THREE OF YOU CAN ANSWER IT.

00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:16.480
ONE OF THE POINTS THAT JOHN
MADE IS THAT THIS COURT,

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.590
THE ROBERTS COURT HAS BEEN
SECOND GUESSING CONGRESS' POWER

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.610
TO A REMARKABLE EXTENT.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:24.720
IS THIS NEW?

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.950
I MEAN FOR THOSE OF US WHO
THINK ABOUT THE PRE NEW DEAL,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.800
IS THIS A DIFFERENT
WAY THAT THE COURT

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.300
IS VIEWING ITS RELATIONSHIP
WITH ANOTHER BRANCH?

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.730
MICHAEL?

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.750
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK, LAUREN.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.820
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL KLARMAN: IT'S
NEW, BUT IT'S NOT BRAND NEW.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.990
THE SUPREME COURT
RARELY CHALLENGE

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.910
CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION
IN THE 19TH CENTURY.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.330
THEY STRUCK DOWN A STATUTE
IN MARBURY VS. MADISON,

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.030
THE FIRST CASE TO DECLARE
THE POWER OF JUDICIAL REVIEW.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.450
THEY DIDN'T STRIKE DOWN ANOTHER
FEDERAL STATUTE UNTIL DRED

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.950
SCOTT.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.450
THE INFAMOUS CASE OF
CONGRESS TRYING TO

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.200
KEEP SLAVERY OUT OF THE
MISSOURI COMPROMISE TERRITORY.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:05.480
THE TERRITORY ACQUIRED IN
THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.150
BUT CONGRESS, THE COURT RARELY
STRUCK DOWN CONGRESSIONAL

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.334
LEGISLATION UNTIL
THE 20TH CENTURY.

00:23:10.334 --> 00:23:13.000
IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS HAPPENED
FAIRLY REGULARLY IN THE LAST 40

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.560
YEARS.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.726
I DON'T THINK IT'S DISTINCTIVE
TO THE ROBERTS COURT.

00:23:15.726 --> 00:23:17.510
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL:
OTHER COMMENTS?

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:24.500
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S ALWAYS INTRIGUED ME
ABOUT THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S ROLE

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:31.350
IN SEBELIUS IN WHAT MOTIVATED
HIM TO BOTH GRATUITOUSLY

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.080
EXPRESS HIS VIEWS ON
THE COMMERCE CLAUSE,

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.030
AND JUSTICE GINSBURG WROTE A
FABULOUS DISSENTING OPINION ON

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:36.530
THAT CASE.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:42.810
POINTING OUT THAT ENITRE
COMMERCE CLAUSE DISPOSITION

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.470
WAS GRATUITOUS.

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:50.030
WHAT MOTIVATED HIM TO DO THAT
AND THEN TO PULL BACK AND FIND

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.090
A DEUS EX MACHINA IN THE
FORM OF THE TAX POWER

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.067
TO SAVE THE STATUTE AND
MAYBE SAVE THE COURT.

00:23:56.067 --> 00:23:57.400
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.670
&gt;&gt; I FIND IT A PUZZLE.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:01.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:06.660
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: ALSO KNOWN
AS TAKING THE 5TH AMENDMENT.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:12.300
&gt;&gt; THERE'S ONE PERSON IN THIS
TENT WHO KNOWS THE ANSWER AND

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.210
SHE'S NOT TELLING US.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:13.709
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:13.709 --> 00:24:20.540
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: ON
THAT NOTE, MS. GREENHOUSE,

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.820
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
PROCEED WITH YOUR CASE?

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.010
PARENTS INVOLVED.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:31.020
&gt;&gt; OKAY, I HAVE LESS OF A FORMAL
ACADEMIC PRESENTATION THAN JOHN

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.790
DID.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:36.870
BUT WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY
IS NOT DISCONNECTED FROM HIS

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.084
PRESENTATION.

00:24:39.084 --> 00:24:41.250
I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH
THE DETAILS OF THE CASE.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.400
I URGE YOU TO READ MY
CAREFULLY WRITTEN LITTLE

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:47.250
SUMMARY IN THIS BLUE BOOKLET.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.920
EXAMPLE OF JUDICIAL
ACTIVISM IN ANOTHER FRAME.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.170
THIS WASN'T THE COURT
AGAINST CONGRESS.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:58.080
THIS WAS THE COURT AGAINST LOCAL
CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:02.660
THE ROBERTS COURT HAS
HAD MAYBE 700 DECISIONS

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.710
ON THE MERITS IN THE 10 YEARS.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.380
ADN THE WAY THIS
PANEL WAS ORGANIZED

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.640
WAS THAT CHIEF JUSTICE
MARSHALL INVITED EACH OF US

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.180
TO SELECT ONE CASE
TO TALK ABOUT.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:13.400
SO WHY DID I CHOOSE
PARENTS INVOLVED?

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:19.040
I CHOSE IT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S
VERY EMBLEMATIC OF A DISTURBING

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.370
ASPECT OF THE ROBERTS COURT.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:25.760
I HATE TO USE THE
CLICHED WORD ACTIVISM.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:34.230
IT WAS ASSERTION OF JURISDICTION
BY THE COURT TO EVEN DECIDE

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.820
THIS CASE.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:41.150
SO YOU KNOW THE BASIC METRIC
THAT THE COURT APPLIES IN

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:45.550
DECIDING WHETHER IT SHOULD
EXERCISE ITS ALMOST COMPLETE

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:49.480
DISCRETION ON WHAT TO DECIDE
IS WHETHER THERE'S A CASE THAT

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.330
PRESENTS A CONFLICT
AMONG THE LOWER

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.290
COURTS ON AN IMPORTANT
MATTER OF FEDERAL LAW.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.640
THERE ACTUALLY WAS NO CONFLICT
ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER A

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.230
SCHOOL BOARD SEEKING TO PRESERVE
INTEGRATION, NOT TO PRESERVE

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:07.300
SEGREGATION, TO PRESERVE THE
HARD WON GAINS OF INTEGRATION

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:13.360
ACHIEVED THROUGH STRUGGLE
AND FEDERAL COURT SUPERVISION

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.440
AND IN THESE CASES
BUSING ORDERS AND SO ON.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.840
THEY FINALLY GET A MEASURE
OF INTEGRATION AND THEY

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:19.930
WANT TO KEEP IT.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.680
AND THERE ARE RESIDENTIAL
HOUSING PATTERNS THAT MAKE IT

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.012
VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP IT.

00:26:25.012 --> 00:26:26.720
THERE ARE SOCIAL TRENDS
THAT MAKE IT VERY

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.020
DIFFICULT TO KEEP IT.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:31.620
SO IN THIS CASE, BOTH THE
CITY, AND THE SCHOOL BOARD

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:32.750
OF LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:37.190
OF COURSE ONCE A
SEGREGATED CITY.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.620
AND THE SCHOOL BOARD
OF SEATTLE, WASHINGTON.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:41.100
NEVER SEGREGATED.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.380
BUT HIGHLY RACIALLY
ISOLATED SCHOOLS BECAUSE

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.630
OF HOUSING PATTERNS HAD
BEEN UNDER COURT ORDERS

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.080
FOR MANY YEARS.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.590
DECIDED THAT IN MODEST WAYS IN
TERMS OF STUDENTS DECIDING THAT

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:58.160
THEY WANTED TO TRANSFER FROM ONE
SCHOOL TO ANOTHER, OR CHOOSING

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:02.450
ONE HIGH SCHOOL OR ANOTHER
HIGH SCHOOL, THE SCHOOL BOARD

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.860
WAS ENTITLED TO TAKE RACE
INTO ACCOUNT TO PRESERVE,

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.660
TO PREVENT A RETURN TO
RACIALLY ISOLATED SCHOOLS

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.220
AND CLASSROOMS.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.240
THIS ISSUE HAS COME
UP AROUND THE COUNTRY,

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:19.950
AND THE LOWER COURTS ALL
AGREED THIS WAS SOMETHING

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:27.060
THAT SCHOOL BOARDS COULD CHOOSE
TO DO FOR THIS BENIGN PURPOSE.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:31.000
BEFORE JUSTICE O'CONNOR
LEFT THE COURT IN LATE 2005,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.080
SUCH A CASE CAME UP TO
THE COURT FROM THIS REGION

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.860
TO THE FIRST CIRCUIT, AND THE
COURT DECIDED NOT TO HEAR IT.

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.440
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MEET THE
USUAL TESTS OF CONFLICT IN THE

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:40.940
CIRCUIT.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:46.220
AS SOON AS O'CONNOR LEFT
THE COURT, IN EARLY 2006,

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:53.190
THESE TWO CASES MADE THEIR
WAY ONTO THE COURT'S DOCKET.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:56.340
AND THE COURT DECIDED EVEN
THOUGH IT DIDN'T MEET THE USUAL

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.990
CHARACTERISTICS
FOR A WORTHY CASE,

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.670
THE COURT DECIDED TO TAKE IT.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:04.900
WHAT DID THEY DECIDE?

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.030
IN AN OPINION FOR FOUR JUSTICES
BY CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:10.916
THE COURT SAID THIS IS
BASICALLY JUST BROWN VS.

00:28:10.916 --> 00:28:12.540
BOARD OF EDUCATION
FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.240
THIS IS GOVERNMENT
COUNTING BY RACE.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.390
WE CAN'T DO THAT.

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:21.050
THE CITIES OF
LOUISVILLE AND SEATTLE

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:22.560
HAD NO COMPELLING INTEREST.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.070
AND COMPELLING
INTEREST IS THE TEST

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:29.270
FOR UNDER THE 14TH AMENDMENT'S
EQUAL PROTECTION GUARANTEE

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:33.200
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT CAN JUSTIFY
CLASSIFYING PEOPLE BY RACE.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.720
THERE'S NO COMPELLING INTEREST
IN PRESERVING INTEGRATION.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.510
HE WROTE FOR ONLY 4
BECAUSE JUSTICE KENNEDY

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:44.500
WHO AGREED WITH THE OUTCOME,
AND IN FACT HAS NEVER VOTED TO

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.600
UPHOLD ANY RACIAL CATEGORIZATION
ON THE PART OF THE SUPREME

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.020
COURT SAID ACTUALLY IT'S
A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:52.910
THAN THAT.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.470
YOU MAY REMEMBER THE LINE WITH
WHICH CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.730
ENDED HIS OPINION.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:01.100
HE SAID THE WAY TO GET
BEYOND RACIAL DISCRIMINATING

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.220
ON THE BASIS OF RACE IS
TO STOP DISCRIMINATING ON

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.570
THE BASIS OF RACE.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:08.240
THAT'S VERY DEEP AND PROFOUND.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.120
AND JUSTICE KENNEDY SAID IT'S
A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:12.900
THAN THAT.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.370
HE SAID OF COURSE THE CITIES OF
LOUISVILLE AND SEATTLE HAVE A

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.440
COMPELLING INTEREST IN
PRESERVING INTEGRATION.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.660
OBVIOUSLY THEY DO.

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.510
THE PROBLEM THAT JUSTICE KENNEDY
FOUND WITH THESE PLANS IS HE

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.240
SAID THEY WEREN'T SUFFICIENTLY
NARROWLY TAILORED.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.010
NARROW TAILORING IS
THE OTHER MAIN ASPECT

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.080
OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT ANALYSIS.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.430
THEY WEREN'T SUFFICIENTLY
NARROWLY TAILORED TO MEET THE

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.850
EQUAL PROTECTION DEMANDS
OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.230
BY THAT HE MEANT THERE
WERE OTHER THINGS

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.260
THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS
MIGHT HAVE DONE OTHER

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:47.720
THAN CATEGORIZING STUDENTS
ON THE BASIS OF RACE.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:52.120
A QUESTION OF WHERE SCHOOL
DISTRICT LINES WERE DRAWN OR

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.890
SCHOOLS WITH SPECIAL PROGRAMS
THAT COULD ATTRACT PEOPLE

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:55.880
AND SO ON AND SO ON.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.550
WHETHER THAT'S AT ALL REALISTIC
ON THE GROUND I'M NOT IN A

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:01.280
POSITION TO SAY.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.120
BUT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.620
SO THE OTHER THING
THAT INTERESTS ME

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.600
ABOUT THE CASE OTHER
THAN THE SHEER ACTIVISM

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:16.380
OF TAKING IT IS THAT THE CHIEF
JUSTICE WAS SO DETERMINED TO

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.100
SAY WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.410
TO USE THE CASE FOR
THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:23.720
HE WANTED TO USE IT AND
SAY NO COMPELLING INTEREST.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.300
AND THIS IS JUST BACKWARD
BROWN VS. BOARD OF EDUCATION,

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.560
HE WASN'T WILLING TO MEET
JUSTICE KENNEDY WHERE JUSTICE

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.680
KENNEDY WAS.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:38.211
ALL HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO SAY WAS
WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE IF THIS

00:30:38.211 --> 00:30:40.710
IS WHAT HE WANTED TO SAY IS WE
DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE IF THERE

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:41.950
IS A COMPELLING INTEREST.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.210
ALL WE HAVE TO FIND
IS THAT THIS REMEDY

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.090
IS NOT NARROWLY TAILORED
TO SERVE THAT INTEREST.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.560
THAT WOULD HAVE LET HIM
SPEAK FOR A MAJORITY.

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.300
IT WOULD HAVE NOT DECIDED
THE MOST PROFOUND ISSUE

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.110
IN THE CASE.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.360
AND SO THIS WAS EARLY
IN THE ROBERTS COURT.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.480
IT WAS A 2007 DECISION.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:06.740
AND I THINK IT WAS A
RATHER DISTURBING EARLY

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:11.330
INDICATION OF HOW HE SAW HIS
ROLE IN BOTH CARRYING OUT

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:16.320
WHAT I CALL A ROBERTS PROJECT ON
RACE, ON GETTING THE GOVERNMENT

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.780
OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF COUNTING
BY RACE FOR ANY REASON.

00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.440
AND SHELBY COUNTY, THE
VOTING RIGHTS ACT CASE

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.460
IS NOT ONE OF OUR CASES.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.930
BUT THAT WAS A MAJOR ONE.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:29.460
IT DISABLED APPLICATION OF THE
HEART OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.970
BUT ALSO HIS
UNWILLINGNESS TO BEND

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.950
A LITTLE BIT TO MEET JUSTICE
KENNEDY WHERE JUSTICE

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:38.790
KENNEDY WAS.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:44.040
I'LL CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT IN
THE INTERVENING YEARS, IN 2015,

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.100
BECAUSE THIS WAS ALL
THE WAY BACK IN 2007,

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.060
I'M NOT SURE WE WOULD SEE THE
SAME BEHAVIOR FROM JOHN ROBERTS

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.680
TODAY.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.720
THIS SOUNDS CONDESCENDING, AND
I DON'T MEAN FOR IT TO SOUND

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.500
CONDESCENDING, I
RESPECT THE MAN.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:02.410
HE HAS MATURED IN HIS ROLE
AS CHIEF JUSTICE AND I THINK

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:08.800
SEES THE VIRTUE OF NOT HAVING TO
WIN EVERY CASE THAT HE CAN WIN.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.410
OR IN THIS CASE HE DIDN'T WIN ON
THE COMPELLING INTEREST POINT.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.680
BUT RATHER TRY TO WORK
A BIT OF A COMPROMISE.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.950
I THINK WE HAVE SEEN
THAT IN RECENT YEARS

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.280
IN VERY FASCINATING WAYS.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.140
INCLUDING JUST LAST
TERM, THE CASE THAT

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.980
STRUCK DOWN THE BUBBLE
ZONE AROUND THE ABORTION

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.260
CLINICS IN MASSACHUSETTS LAW.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.340
HE WROTE A QUITE TEMPERED
OPINION THAT ALLOWED JUSTICE

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.190
GINSBURG AND OTHERS
TO JOIN HIS OPINION.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:38.530
I DON'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE
SEEN THAT FROM THE EARLIER CHIEF

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:41.360
JUSTICE ROBERTS.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.860
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE
PARENTS INVOLVED.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.750
THAT'S WHY IT'S A CASE
WORTH THINKING ABOUT

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:50.450
AND KEEPING IN MIND AS THE
ROBERTS COURT GOES FORWARD.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:51.710
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU LINDA.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:33:00.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.150
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: SO
LINDA, JUST TO REASSURE YOU,

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:06.650
I HOPE THAT ALL CHIEF JUSTICES
MATURE AS THEY GO ALONG.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.370
I WANT TO TELL YOU SOME
OF MY EARLY OPINIONS,

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.740
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO
TELL YOU WHICH ONES.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.150
ONE OF THE THINGS THE UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT DOES

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:20.810
IS IT TELLS OTHER
FEDERAL COURTS.

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:23.840
I HATE TO USE THE TERM LOWER
FEDERAL COURTS, BUT WE OFTEN

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.670
CALL THEM LOWER FEDERAL
COURTS, WHAT TO DO.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.800
HAVE THERE BEEN
CASES WHERE YOU CAN

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.830
SEE THE FEDERAL COURTS
BECOMING MORE ACTIVE

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.880
BASED ON PARENTS INVOLVED?

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:40.780
&gt;&gt; LINDA GREENHOUSE:
NO, I WONDERED.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.490
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: YOU
MENTIONED THE VOTING CASE.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.130
BUT JUST WHAT'S HAPPENING
IN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS?

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:49.290
&gt;&gt; LINDA GREENHOUSE: YEAH.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:51.780
NO, I DON'T HAVE A
GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:56.400
I HAVEN'T SEEN OTHER PARENTS
INVOLVED TYPE CASES MAKING

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.270
THERE WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:01.370
MY IMPRESSION IS THAT THINGS ARE
GETTING WORKED OUT AT THE LOCAL

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:04.180
LEVEL WITHOUT NECCESARILY
GOING TO COURT.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:09.610
BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE FINAL
WORD ON AT ALL IS THE GENERAL

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:11.110
QUESTION OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:15.170
IN HIGHER EDUCATION THERE'S
A CASE PENDING ON THE

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.239
COURT'S DOCKET THAT
WE'LL HEAR ABOUT ANY DAY.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.330
WHETHER THE COURT IS GOING
TO GET INTO FISHER VS.

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:22.400
UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.949
THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CASE,

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:28.139
WHICH THEY COULDN'T QUITE
DECIDE TWO YEARS AGO,

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:29.480
SENT BACK TO THE LOWER COURT.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.469
THE LOWER COURT SAID YEAH WE
KIND OF STANDBY WHAT WE SAID

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:34.280
BEFORE.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.362
SO THAT'S A BIG OPEN
QUESTION WHETHER

00:34:37.362 --> 00:34:39.070
THE COURT IS GOING TO
GET BACK INTO THAT.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.489
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: SURE.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.960
YOU TALKED, YOU SELECTED THIS
COURT AS A WAY OF INDICATING

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.630
THAT AT LEAST THE CHIEF
JUSTICE, IF NOT THE COURT,

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.510
WILL SORT OF REACH OUT AND
BEND SOME OF THE JURISDICTIONAL

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:54.159
RULES PERHAPS OR NOT LOOK AT
THE WAY THEY USUALLY TAKE CASES

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.949
AS AN EXAMPLE OF
AN ACTIVIST CASE.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:35:00.140
AND YOU MENTIONED THE CHIEF
JUSTICE'S PROJECT ON RACE.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.320
ARE THERE OTHER CASES LAUREN OR
MIKE WHERE YOU THINK SHOW ONE

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.150
WAY OR THE OTHER WHAT
HIS VIEW ON RACE IS?

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:12.420
&gt;&gt; LAUREN SUDEALL LUCAS:
NOT TO HIJACK YOUR QUESTION,

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.369
BUT TO RESPOND TO THAT
QUESTION ALSO ABOUT THE IMPACT,

00:35:15.369 --> 00:35:17.910
THERE'S THE PRESIDENTIAL IMPACT,
BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO THE

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.501
QUESTION OF SYMBOLIC IMPACT.

00:35:19.501 --> 00:35:21.500
BROWN VS. THE BOARD OF
EDUCATION IS ARGUABLY ONE

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.680
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE THAT
THE SPREME COURT HAS DECIDED

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.960
FROM A SYMBOLIC PERSPECTIVE.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.650
IN PARENTS INVOLVED, TO TAKE
A CASE THAT IMPORTANT AND SORT

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:34.350
OF REDEPLOY IT IN A WAY THAT'S
VERY DIFFERENT FROM I THINK

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:38.321
MANY WILL SEE THE INTENTION
OF BROWN IS REALLY QUITE

00:35:38.321 --> 00:35:38.820
SOMETHING.

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.380
AND THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE
OTHER OPINIONS IN THAT CASE

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.620
IS REALLY STARTLING, AS WELL.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.030
YOU HAVE JUSTICE
THOMAS COMPARING

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.154
WHAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS
IN LOUISVILLE AND SEATTLE

00:35:46.154 --> 00:35:49.450
ARE DOING TO WHAT THE
SEGREGATIONISTS DID IN 1954.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:52.890
TO MAKE THOSE COMPARISONS, ITS
SORT OF DIVORCED FROM INTENTION

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:55.040
AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT,
IT'S REALLY HARD

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.790
TO GET ONE'S MIND AROUND.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:59.555
AND THE LINE THAT
LINDA MENTIONED,

00:35:59.555 --> 00:36:01.680
THE WAY TO STOP DISCRIMINATION
ON THE BASIS OF RACE

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:03.638
IS TO STOP DISCRIMINATING
ON THE BASIS OF RACE.

00:36:03.638 --> 00:36:06.730
I THOUGHT JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR
HAS SUCH AN ELOQUENT RESPONSE 7

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:12.702
YEARS LATER WHEN SHE
SAID THE WAY TO STOP

00:36:12.702 --> 00:36:14.160
DISCRIMINATING ON
THE BASIS OF RACE

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.760
IS TO SPEAK OPENLY AND CANDIDLY
ABOUT RACE AND TO APPLY

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.020
THE CONSTITUTION WITH EYES
OPEN TO THE UNFORTUNATE

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.000
EFFECTS OF CENTURIES OF
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:29.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:32.160
SO I THINK PARENTS INVOLVED
HAD A VERY IMPORTANT SYMBOLIC

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:32.660
IMPORTANCE.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:37.570
IT HASN'T BEEN CITED, IT STILL
HAD AN INDIRECT INFLUENCE BOTH

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:39.850
ON THE COURTS AND ALSO THE
PUBLIC AND THE WAY WE THINK

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:41.170
ABOUT RACE MORE BROADLY.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:44.420
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL KLARMAN:
I AGREE WITH THAT.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.540
I WANT TO ADD SOMETHING.

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.040
LINDA'S POINT IS IT
PROCEDURALLY ACTIVIST

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.910
FOR THE COURT TO RESOLVE
THIS QUESTION WHEN

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.500
THERE WAS NO PRESSING NEED.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.890
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO
UNDERSTAND ITS SUBSTANTIVELY

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.560
ACTIVIST.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.336
THE CONSERVATIVE
JUSTICES WHO ARE

00:36:57.336 --> 00:36:59.710
THE ONES WHO WOULD INSIST THAT
THE CONSTITUTION SHOULD BE

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:05.960
COLOR BLIND ARE THE ONES WHO
WOULD CRITICIZE THE COURT IF IT

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:12.330
STRUCK DOWN AN ABORTION
RESTRICTION OR PERHAPS

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.520
IF THE COURT RULES IN
FAVOR OF GAY MARRIAGE,

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.360
THEY WOULD ACCUSE THE COURT
OF BEING ACTIVISTS FOR READING

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.700
THE CONSTITUTION IN A WAY
THAT INTENDED BY THE PEOPLE

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.760
WHO WROTE IT.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.230
BUT IT TURNS OUT THAT
THE 14TH AMENDMENT

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:28.040
WAS NOT CLEARLY INTENDED
TO EMBRACE COLOR BLINDNESS.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.300
THERE IS NO GOOD HISTORICAL
ARGUMENT THAT THAT'S WHAT THE

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.814
PEOPLE WHO WROTE THE
14TH AMENDMENT INTENDED.

00:37:33.814 --> 00:37:36.230
AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE
TEXT OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT THAT

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.610
TALKS ABOUT RACE SOME HOW
BEING OFF LIMITS TO GOVERNMENT

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.210
CLASSIFICATION.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.430
THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE
IT IRONICALLY WERE TOO

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:48.400
RACIST TO ACTUALLY SUPPORT A
BAN ON RACE CLASSIFICATIONS.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.060
THEY SAID REPEATEDLY WHEN THEY
WERE ADOPTING THE AMENDMENT

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.200
THAT THIS DOESN'T MANDATE
THAT YOU ENFRANCHISE BLACKS OR

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.900
MANDATE THAT YOU END
SCHOOL SEGREGATION.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.070
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF
THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES,

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:03.390
IF THE TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION
DOESN'T RULE OUT ANY PARTICULAR

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:06.670
POLICY, AND THE ORIGINAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT TEXT

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.620
DOESN'T CLEARLY RULE OUT
A PARTICULAR POLICY THEN

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.680
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DEFER TO
DEMOCRACY AND DEFER TO LOCAL

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.620
GOVERNMENT.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:16.250
AND AS LINDA WAS SAYING,
THIS IS AS LOCAL AS IT GETS.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.780
THIS IS A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD
ADOPTING AN INTEGRATIONIST

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.900
POLICY.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.640
THIS IS ACTIVISM NOT
JUST PROCEDURALLY BUT ITS

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.690
SUBSTANTIVE ACTIVISM
FROM THE RIGHT.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.340
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: GOOD.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.600
OKAY.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.960
LINDA, LAST WORD, OR
YOU'VE HAD YOUR SAY?

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.460
OKAY.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:42.080
LAUREN, SO AGAIN LINDA
SAID WE ASKED EACH OF THEM

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:48.100
TO SELECT ONE OPINION OF THE TEN
YEARS THAT INDICATED SOMETHING

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:48.670
IMPORTANT.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.170
LAUREN?

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:50.774
&gt;&gt; LAUREN SUDEALL
LUCAS: THANK YOU.

00:38:50.774 --> 00:38:53.190
AND THANK YOU AGAIN DEAN COHEN
AND THE RADCLIFFE INSTITUTE

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:54.790
FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:56.440
THE CASE THAT I
CHOOSE TO DISCUSS

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.864
FOR MY PORTION OF THE DISCUSSION
IS ASHCROFT VS. IQBAL.

00:38:59.864 --> 00:39:02.280
TO MANY OF YOU THIS CASE MAY
NOT BE AS FAMILIAR BECAUSE IT

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.775
WASN'T ONE THAT RECEIVED A LOT
OF ATTENTION FROM THE MEDIA.

00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:06.900
OR AT LEAST NOT AS MUCH AS
SOME OF THE OTHER CASES.

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.950
BUT IT IS REALY
IMPORTANT IN PART BECAUSE

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.880
IT REPRESENTS AN EMERGING THEME
OF THE ROBERTS COURT WHICH

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.400
IS DEFINING THE ROLE THE COURT
PLAYS IN MUCH NARROWER TERMS

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.040
AND RESTRICTING
PLAINTIFFS ACCESS

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:17.550
TO THE COURTS AND
ACCESS TO JUSTICE,

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.625
PARTICULARLY FOR INDIVIDUAL
AND PRO SLAVE PLAINTIFFS.

00:39:20.625 --> 00:39:23.000
THE CASES THAT MY CO-PANELISTS
TODAY HAVE DISCUSSED TODAY

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.166
HIGHLIGHT FOR GOOD REASONS
SOME OF THE LARGER SOCIAL

00:39:25.166 --> 00:39:28.160
AND POLITICAL ISSUES THAT THE
COURT HAS CONFRONTED OVER THE

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.459
LAST DECADE.

00:39:29.459 --> 00:39:31.750
A LOT OF THE CASES THAT THE
COURT HEARS HOWEVER INVOLVE

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:33.460
PROCEDURAL AND
JURISDICTIONAL QUESTIONS THAT

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:35.751
AREN'T PARTICULARLY EXCITING
AND DON'T ATTRACT A LOT OF

00:39:35.751 --> 00:39:37.507
ATTENTION OUTSIDE LEGAL CIRCLES.

00:39:37.507 --> 00:39:39.340
BUT THEY GO TO THE
DEEPER IMPORTANT QUESTION

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.740
OF WHETHER A COURT CAN ENTERTAIN
A CLAIM AND WHO CAN ASSERT SUCH

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.720
A CLAIM.

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.400
THESE QUESTIONS ARE PRECURSORS
THAT WE HAVE TO ANSWER BEFORE

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.130
WE CAN GET TO CASES LIKE
SEBELIUS OR PARENTS INVOLVED.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.630
IN ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS,
ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SOME

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.730
ANOMALIES, THE ROBERTS COURT HAS
OFTEN ACTED TO RESTRICT ACCESS

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:55.930
TO THE COURTS.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.600
TO PROVIDE A FEW EXAMPLES IN
WHICH THE ROBERTS COURT HAS

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.550
ALREADY HAD AN IMPACT.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.220
FIRST THE ROBERTS COURT HAS
BROADLY INTERPRETED ARBITRATION

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.860
AGREEMENTS TO PREVENT INJURED
INDIVIDUALS FROM GOING TO

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.330
COURT, INSTEAD CHANNELING
THEM INTO ARBITRATION

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.080
AND RESTRICTING THEIR
ABILITY TO VINDICATE

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.750
THEIR RIGHTS IN THAT CONTEXT.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:13.900
AND THE COURT HAS PREVENTED
HABEUS PETITIONERS

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.570
WHO PRESENTING NEW EVIDENCE
IN FEDERAL COURT EVEN EVIDENCE

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:19.170
REGARDING ACTUAL INNOCENCE
OR PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:19.720
HAS OCCURED.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.136
INSTEAD THEY'RE LIMITED TO THE
RECORD AS IT EXISTED IN THE

00:40:22.136 --> 00:40:22.872
STATE COURT.

00:40:22.872 --> 00:40:24.330
THE COURT HAS
LIMITED THE INSTANCES

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.750
IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS CAN
SUE STATES IN FEDERAL COURT

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:29.360
TO CHALLENGE UNCONSTITUTIONAL
STATE ACTION.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:31.900
THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES AND
THE LAST THAT I'LL MENTION AND

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:34.555
WE'RE FOCUSED ON TODAY IS THAT
THE COURT HAS RAISED THE BAR

00:40:34.555 --> 00:40:36.680
FOR WHAT A PLAINTIFF HAS
TO ALLEGE AT THE OUTSET OF

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.380
LITIGATION IN ORDER TO AVOID
BEING THROWN OUT OF COURT

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.970
ALTOGETHER.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:43.640
IQBAL AS THE DESCRIPTION
IN YOUR PROGRAM SAYS

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:47.730
AROSE IN THE WAKE OF 911, IQBAL
WAS CHALLENGING HIS TREATMENT

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.230
BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
WHILE HE WAS BEING DETAINED.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.730
THE COURT NEVER
REACHED THE QUESTION

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:54.040
OF WHETHER HIS TREATMENT WAS
ACTUALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.930
INSTEAD THE PRECURSOR QUESTION
AND THE ONLY QUESTION THE COURT

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:59.830
DID ANSWER WAS WHETHER
HE HAD ALLEGED SUFFICIENT

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:03.190
FACTS IN HIS COMPLAINT TO
SURVIVE A MOTION TO DISMISS.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.750
FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T LAWYERS,
WHEN A PLAINTIFF WISHES TO

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:07.360
INITIATE A LAWSUIT
IN FEDERAL COURT,

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.394
INITIALLY SHE FILES A COMPLAINT.

00:41:09.394 --> 00:41:11.060
AND THEN YOU WOULD
PROGRESS TO DISCOVERY

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.018
WHERE THE TWO SIDES WOULD
EXCHANGE INFORMATION,

00:41:13.018 --> 00:41:15.920
AND THEN, AT LEAST IN THEORY,
LEAD POTENTIALLY TO TRIAL.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.500
THESE CASES ARE ABOUT
THE TRANSITION FROM THAT

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.780
FIRST TO THAT SECOND STEP.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.010
HAD THE PLAINTIFF DONE
ENOUGH OF PRESENTED ENOUGH

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.740
IN HER COMPLAINT TO JUSTIFY
MOVING ONTO DISCOVERY.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.740
SO THE FEDERAL RULES OF
OFFICIAL PROCEDURE STATE

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.820
THAT A COMPLAINANT MUST
PROVIDE A SHORT AND PLAIN

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:31.870
STATEMENT OF THE CLAIM.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:34.381
SHOWING THAT THE PLEADER
IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF.

00:41:34.381 --> 00:41:36.630
FOR DECADES THIS WAS UNDERSTOOD
TO BE A FAIRLY LENIENT

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:39.010
STANDARD, JUST PUTTING THE OTHER
SIDE ON NOTICE OF THE CLAIM,

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.870
WAS OFTEN REFERRED TO
AS NOTICE PLEADING.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:42.740
JUST GIVING THEM A
HEADS UP OF WHAT WOULD

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.970
BE INVOLVED IN THE LITIGATION.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:48.090
TWO YEARS BEFORE IQBAL IN A
CASE OF BELL ATLANTIC CORP. VS.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:49.820
TWOMBLY, THE COURT
RAISED THAT STANDARD

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.350
IN AN ANTITRUST CONTEXT
BUT IT WASNT CLEAR

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.325
IF IT WOULD BE APPLIED
BEYOND THAT CONTEXT.

00:41:54.325 --> 00:41:56.950
IN TWOMBLY, THE COURT SAID THAT
HAD THE JUDGE DETERMINED AT THE

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.408
OUTSET OF THE CASE,
WHETHER THERE'S

00:41:58.408 --> 00:42:00.106
A PLAUSIBLE CLAIM FOR RELEIF.

00:42:00.106 --> 00:42:02.480
SO INTERJECTING SOME JUDGMENT
THERE, NOT JUST PUTTIN GHTE

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.510
OTHER SIDE ON NOTICE,
BUT ALLOWING THE JUDGE

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:08.070
TO EXERCISE DISCRETION AS TO
WHY THIS IS REALLY PLAUSIBLE.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:10.700
IQBAL TOOK A FURTHER STEP
MAKING SURE THAT STANDARD WOULD

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.820
APPLY TO ALL CIVIL
CASES IN FEDERAL COURT.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:16.440
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE, BEFORE
A PLAINTIFF'S ALLEGATIONS WERE

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:18.510
PRESUMED TO BE TRUE AND A
COMPLAINT WOULD BE DISMISSED

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.385
ONLY IF THERE WERE NO
SET OF FACTS THAT WOULD

00:42:20.385 --> 00:42:22.180
ENTITLE THE PLAINTIFF TO RELIEF.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.230
BUT IN IQBAL, THE STANDARD
PROVIDES LOWER COURTS

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.521
WITH MUCH GREATER JUDICIAL
DISCRETION AND IT'S REALLY A

00:42:26.521 --> 00:42:28.230
VERY SUBJECTIVE DETERMINATION.

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:31.540
THE COURT SUGGESTED THAT A
REVIEWING COURT SHOULD DRAW ON

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.260
THEIR JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE AND
COMMON SENSE WHEN MAKING SUCH A

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.510
DETERMINATION, AND I'LL TOUCH
ON THAT LATER IN THE WAY

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:40.310
IT'S ALLOWED BIAS TO FILTER
INTO MAKING THE DETERMINATIONS

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.360
WHETHER A COMPLAINT, WHETHER
A CLAIM AND COMPLAINT IS

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:43.900
PLAUSIBLE.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.861
THIS ALL MAY SEEM TECHNICAL.

00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:48.110
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PLEADING
STANDARDS AND COMPLAINTS.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:49.910
WHY DOES IT MATTER?

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.730
IQBAL WAS CITED MORE THAN
500 TIMES IN THE 2 MONTHS

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:53.700
FOLLOWING THE DECISION.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:58.384
JUST 8 MONTHS LATER, IN
8,000 LOWER COURT CASES.

00:42:58.384 --> 00:42:59.800
AT ONLY TWO YEARS
OLD, TWOMBLY WAS

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.990
ONE OF THE 5 MOST CITED COURT
CASES IN LOWER FEDERAL COURTS

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:05.349
IN ALL OF AMERICAN HISTORY.

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.390
THEY REALLY GRASPED ON
THIS AS IMPORTANT AND THEN

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.223
IT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING
THAT THEY SHOULD BE

00:43:09.223 --> 00:43:11.460
FOLLOWING AND ACCESSING
COMPLAINTS BEFORE THEM.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.250
ONE PROMINENT SUPREME
COURT LITIGATOR

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:15.410
SAID IQBAL WAS THE MOST
SIGNIFICANT SUPREME COURT

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.410
DECISION IN A DECADE FOR
DAY TO DAY LITIGATION

00:43:17.410 --> 00:43:18.981
IN THE FEDERAL COURTS.

00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:21.480
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STUDIES
ACCESSING THE IMPACT THAT IT'S

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.170
HAD IN TERMS OF CLAIMS
BEING DISMISSED.

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:25.040
JUST TO GIVE YOU A FEW NUMBERS.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.820
THE OVERALL RATE OF
DISMISSAL WENT FROM 61%

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.440
PRE TWOMBLY TO 72% IQBAL.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.290
AND AN IMPACT HAS BEEN
FELT MORE STRONGLY

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.240
AND DEEPLY IN CASES INVOLVED
CIVIL RIGHTS DISCRIMINATION,

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.230
EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION,
AND IN PRISON,

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:41.660
AND IN CASES INVOLVING PRO SE
PLAINTIFFS OR PLAINTIFFS THAT

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.880
ARE SERVING AS THEIR OWN LAYWER.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.930
SO IN CIVIL RIGHTS
CASES THAT ARE PRO SE,

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:50.180
THE DISMISSAL RATE
WENT FROM 85% TO 92%.

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:55.756
IN PRISON CASES 67% TO 85% AND
IN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION

00:43:55.756 --> 00:43:58.130
CASES WHERE THE PLAINTIFF WAS
REPRESENTED BY COUNCIL FROM

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.590
47% TO 65%.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.780
ONE OF THE REASONS FOR
THIS UP TICK IN DISMISSALS

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.690
IS THAT OFTEN TO PROVE A CLAIM,
THE PLAINTIFF NEEDS INFORMATION

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:06.524
FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

00:44:06.524 --> 00:44:09.189
SO FOR EXAMPLE IN DISCRIMINATION
CASES WHERE YOU HAVE TO PROVE A

00:44:09.189 --> 00:44:11.380
DISCRIMINATORY INTENT,
IT'S VERY HARD TO DO THAT,

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.280
PARTICULARLY FOR POOR OR PRO SE
LITIGANTS WHO AREN'T RESOURCED

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.700
AND DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO KNOW
WHAT WAS IN THE MIND OF THE

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.430
DISCRIMINATOR.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:21.260
SO BY PREVENTING THEM FROM
GETTING TO THAT NEXT LEVEL OF

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.820
DISCOVERY, YOU'RE REALLY
DISABLING THEM FROM MAKING

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.160
THEIR CLAIM AND THE CLAIM
MAY NOT BE PLAUSIBLE BASED ON

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.080
WHAT'S IN THE COMPLAINT.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.830
UNDER THE IQBAL STANDARDS
INDIVIDUALS HAVE

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.234
FARED WORSE THAN CORPORATIONS
OR THE GOVERNMENT AND THAT

00:44:32.234 --> 00:44:34.150
ARGUABLY IS IN LINE WITH
WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:37.040
IS A TREND OF THE ROBERTS COURT
TO BE PRO CORPORATE OR PRO

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.227
BUSINESS.

00:44:38.227 --> 00:44:40.310
AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER
THIS IDEA OF RELYING ON

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:43.640
JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE AND
COMMON SENSE, THAT PROVIDES AN

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.290
AVENUE FOR BIAS WHETHER
CONSCIENCE OR SUBCONSCIENCE TO

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:50.040
COLOR JUDGE'S CLAIMS
OF WHETHER JUDGES

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.090
ANALYSIS OF WHETHER PLAINTIFF'S
CLAIMS ARE PLAUSIBLE.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.270
FOR BLACK PLAINTIFFS
CLAIMING RACE DISCRIMINATION,

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.280
THE DISMISSAL RATE
INCREASED FROM 20%

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:02.820
PRE TWOMBLY TO 54.6% AFTER IQBAL
AND WHITE JUDGES WERE TWO TIMES

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.730
AS LIKELY TO DISMISS THESE
CLAIMS AS BLACK JUDGES.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.870
SO BY HAVING THIS MORE
SUBJECTIVE STANDARD,

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:10.480
YOU'RE REALLY ALLOWING THE
JUDGES TO HAVE MUCH GREATER

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.680
DISCRETION ABOUT WHETHER
SOMEONE CAN EVEN PROCEED,

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.737
NOT TO WHETHER THEY'LL WIN, BUT
JUST TO PROCEED TO DISCOVERY.

00:45:15.737 --> 00:45:18.070
SOME OF ARGUES THAT THE TWOMBLY
STANDARD WAS NEVER MEANT

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.450
TO BE INTERPRETED IN THIS WAY.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.320
ONE INTERESTING POINT
IS THAT JUSTICE SOUTER

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.930
WHO WROTE THE OPINION ON TWOMBLY
ACTUALLY DISSENTED IN IQBAL.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:27.430
OTHERS LIKE JUSTICE STEVENS AND
JUSTICE GINSBURG HAVE PUSHED

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.763
BACK ON THE IMPOSITION OF A
HEIGHTENED PLEADING STANDARD

00:45:29.763 --> 00:45:32.590
SAYING THAT THE IDEA BEHIND THE
FEDERAL RULES WAS NEVER TO KEEP

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:35.629
LITIGANTS OUT OF COURT,
BUT RATHER TO KEEP THEM IN.

00:45:35.629 --> 00:45:37.920
I'LL JUST END BY SAYING THAT
ULTIMATELY AND PART OF THE

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.050
REASON WHY I CHOSE TO HIGHLIGHT
THIS CASE EVEN THOUGH IT

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.190
HASN'T RECEIVED AS MUCH
ATTENTION IS THAT DECISIONS

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:45.480
LIKE IQBAL ARE EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT AND IMPACTFUL BECAUSE

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.100
THE RIGHTS IN THE CONSTITUTION
HAVE LITTLE MEANING IF THE

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:51.190
LITIGANTS LACK ACCESS IN THE
COURTS TO VINDICATE THEM.

00:45:51.190 --> 00:46:05.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:07.500
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL:
SO THANK YOU LAUREN.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.820
I WONDER HOW MANY OF US REMEMBER
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.440
MADE US A DIFFERENT NATION
FROM ENGLAND IS WE HAVE A

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.420
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
TO GO TO COURT.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.550
NOT SO IN ENGLAND.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:20.310
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT FOR
PEOPLE TO GET ACCESS TO COURT.

00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.940
IT'S WRITTEN IN OUR CONSTITUTION
THAT YOU HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.050
RIGHT TO GO TO COURT.

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:27.760
WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT IN
THE CONTEXT OF THIS DECISION,

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.390
IT'S PRETTY STUNNING.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.330
I HAVE TO SAY LAUREN, I
DIDN'T KNOW THOSE STATS.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.760
IT TELLS YOU WHAT HAPPENS, IF
YOU THINK OF THE QUESTION I

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.930
ASKED TO LINDA, HOW MANY CASES
FOLLOWED PARENTS UNITED AND YOU

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.450
CAN SEE IMMEDIATELY THE
IMPACT THTA IT'S HAD.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.510
IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE JUDGES
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE FEWER CASES.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:51.880
ACTUALLY, WE WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE FEWER CASES.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:58.290
I CAN'T BUT HELP TO TAKE A
MOMENT NOW TO SAY SOMETHING

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:01.360
THAT I SAY ALMOST EVERY
GATHERING THAT I HAVE,

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.550
WHICH IS WHY WE FOCUS
APPROPRIATELY ON THE FEDERAL

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.420
COURTS AND OF COURSE ON THE
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:12.220
SO MANY CASES ARE
DECIDED IN OUR STATE

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.020
COURTS, WHICH ARE JUST
OVERWHELMED BY THE

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:15.080
NUMBER OF CASES.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:18.570
AND ALTHOUGH WE DON'T
NECESSARILY HAVE TO FOLLOW THE

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:21.180
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
ON A DECISION LIKE THIS,

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:24.940
IT HAS ENORMOUS INFLUENCE
ON HOW WE DECIDE OUR CASES,

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:29.520
WHETHER WE DECIDE TO ADMIT
OR TO DISMISS A CASE.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:35.280
AND SO THAT EXTRAORDINARY
ORTHOLOGY RIPPLED VERY QUICKLY

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.650
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:38.710
MICHAEL OR LINDA?

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:39.220
COMMENTS?

00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:39.870
YEAH, LINDA.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:43.360
&gt;&gt; LINDA GREENHOUSE: JUST
ONE COMMENT, THE IQBAL CASE,

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.410
UNLIKE PARENTS INVOLVED, IT'S
NOT A CONSTITUTIONAL DECISION.

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:49.420
IT'S AN INTERPRETATION
OF THE FEDERAL RULES,

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.590
AND IT'S WITHIN THE POWER
OF CONGRESS TO CHANGE THAT.

00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:56.700
AND THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS
TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:03.176
REVERSE IQBAL AND RETURN TO THE
MORE LIBERAL PLEADING STANDARD.

00:48:03.176 --> 00:48:05.550
HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM
HAVE EVER HEARD OF THIS CASE

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:05.590
BEFORE YOU CAME HERE?

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:05.690
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: THIS IS
A VERY EDUCATED AUDIENCE LINDA.

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:07.690
I WOULD HAVE PUT UP MY
HAND WHETHER OR NOT I HAD

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:11.440
HEARD OF THE CASE.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:24.260
&gt;&gt; LINDA GREENHOUSE: YOU
KNOW, IF PEOPLE REALLY DID GET

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.660
ENERGIZED AND MADE IT
SOME KIND OF ISSUE,

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:30.160
WE DON'T HAVE TO LIVE WITH THIS.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:33.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.770
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL KLARMAN: I
WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:37.660
IT IS INTERESTING.

00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.380
WE SORT OF ASSUME
THAT THE COURT IS

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.290
GOING TO DIVIDE FIVE TO FOUR ON
THESE BIG CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:45.880
THAT CAPTURE THE HEADLINES
IN THE NEWSPAPER.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.470
SO WE'RE NOT SURPRISED WHEN THE
COURT DIVIDES FIVE TO FOUR ON

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.790
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
CASES, ABORTION CASES,

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:52.959
DEATH PENALTY CASES.

00:48:52.959 --> 00:48:54.500
BUT THERE ARE ACTUALLY
A WHOLE SERIES

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:57.410
OF CASES INVOLVING
ACCESS TO JUSTICE, WHICH

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:00.770
INVOLVE STATUTORY INTERPRETATION
ISSUES, INTERPRETING

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:02.930
THE FEDERAL RULES,
AND THE COURT TENDS

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:05.010
TO DIVIDE FIVE TO FOUR
ON THOSE, AS WELL.

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:07.810
AND THEY TEND TO BE CONSISTENT
FIVE TO FOUR DIVISIONS.

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:09.930
IT'S NOT A RANDON FIVE TO FOUR.

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:12.260
THERE TEND TO BE FOUR
CONSERVATIVES AND FOUR

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.140
LIBERALS, AND EVERYTHING DEPENDS
ON WHERE JUSTICE KENNEDY COMES

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:19.200
OUT, WITH UNUSUAL EXCEPTIONS
LIKE THE HEALTHCARE CASE.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.830
I THINK WHAT THIS TELLS YOU
IS THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:25.470
IN LAW FOR THE VALUE OF THE
JUDGES TO INFLUENCE THEIR

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:26.420
INTERPRETATIONS.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:29.370
IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT LEGAL
INTERPRETATION IS NOTHING

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:31.110
BUT POLITICS, BUT
IT IS TO SAY IT

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:34.860
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH HOW
THESE THINGS ARE INTERPRETED.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:37.440
AND THERE ARE STUDIES SHOWING,
AND THIS IS FOLLOWING UP

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.100
ON WHAT LAUREN SAID THAT ONE OF
THE CONSISTENT TAKEAWAY LINES

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.270
FROM THE ROBERTS COURT.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.330
YOU CAN'T CHARACTERIZE IT
CONSTITUTIONALLY BECAUSE

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:47.100
JUSTICE KENNEDY
GOES BACK AND FORTH.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.800
HE'S A LIBERAL ON
GAY RIGHTS ISSUES.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.520
HE SOMETIMES A LIBERAL ON
ISSUES INVOLVING THE DEATH

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.640
PENALTY, SCHOOL PRAYER.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:55.070
BUT HE'S CONSERVATIVE ON
CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND RACE

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:55.810
ISSUES.

00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:59.220
BUT ON ISSUES INVOLVING ACCESS
TO JUSTICE AND SPECIFICALLY

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:01.470
ON THE ISSUES WHERE
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.340
HAS EXPRESSED AN INTEREST.

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.100
THIS IS THE MOST PRO CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE COURT IN HISTORY.

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.470
AND THERE'S A STUDY
BY JUDGE POSNER AND A

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:12.580
COUPLE OF ACADEMICS SHOWING
THAT THE FIVE CONSERVATIVE

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.730
JUSTICES ARE FIVE OUT
OF THE TOP TEN MOST PRO

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:18.390
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
JUSTICES IN HISTORY.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.420
AND ROBERTS AND ALITO
ARE ONE AND TWO.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.750
THESE DON'T GET A LOT OF
ATTENTION BUT THESE ARE REALLY

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:23.790
IMPORTANT ISSUES.

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:26.620
THE COURTS DECIMATING
ACCESS TO CLASS ACTION.

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:30.660
IT'S CUTBACK ON ACCESS TO
CONVENTIONAL CIVIL LITIGATION.

00:50:30.660 --> 00:50:32.981
IT'S CONTRACTED
ANTITRUST LIABILITY.

00:50:32.981 --> 00:50:35.480
THESE ARE A REALLY BIG DEAL AND
THEY JUST DON'T GET THE SAME

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:39.300
HEADLINES, AND THE OUTCOMES TEND
TO BE ALONG THE SAME POLITICAL

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:43.960
LINES THAT YOU WOULD FIND
IN CONSTITUTIONAL CASES.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:50.180
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: SO ONE
REASON WHY THEY MAY NOT BE

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.040
GETTING THE SAME
ATTENTION, MICHAEL,

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.510
IS BECAUSE LINDA GREENHOUSE
ISN'T WRITING REGULARLY FOR THE

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:57.170
"NEW YORK TIMES."

00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:59.520
IF THEY GET ANOTHER RADCLIFFE
GRADUATE DOING THAT,

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:00.490
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.060
ALTHOUGH I LOVE HER SUCCESSORS.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.490
LAUREN, I'VE HAD WONDERFUL
QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE BUT

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:09.064
THIS ONE HAS COME UP
SUFFICIENTLY EARLY FOR ME TO BE

00:51:09.064 --> 00:51:10.480
ABLE TO ASK YOU
WHILE YOU'RE HERE.

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:16.130
GIVEN THE SORT OF
TOUGHER STANDARDS

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:21.290
FOR BRINGING THE CASE, WILL THAT
HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:24.190
WHO ARE OPPOSED TO THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND HAVE

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:25.979
BROUGHT CASES CHALLENGING IT?

00:51:25.979 --> 00:51:27.520
IS IT GOING TO MEAN
THAT THEY TOO ARE

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:30.720
GOING TO BE CUT OUT OF BEING
ABLE TO BRING THEIR CASES?

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.230
&gt;&gt; LAUREN SUDEALL LUCAS: I
SUPPOSE THAT IS ASKING ABOUT

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.380
THE STANDING QUESTION IN
THE CASE BEFORE THE COURT.

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:40.575
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T LIST
STANDING ON MY LIST OF AREAS,

00:51:40.575 --> 00:51:42.950
BECAUSE I THINK THE ROBERTS
COURT HAS HAD MORE OF A MIXED

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:44.380
RECORD ON STANDING.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.649
IN SOME CASES THEY HAVE
RESTRICTED STANDING,

00:51:47.649 --> 00:51:49.440
IN THE CONTEXT OF
TAXPAYER STANDING AND THE

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.540
ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:54.000
IN OTHER CONTEXTS THE
COURT HAS FOUND STANDING.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.800
THE MORE CYNICAL MIGHT SAY THE
COURT FINDS STANDING WHEN IT

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.387
WANTS TO GET THE
MERITS OF THE CASE,

00:51:58.387 --> 00:52:00.470
AND DOESN'T FIND STANDING
WHEN IT DOESN'T WANT TO,

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:04.290
OR AT LEAST WHEN FIVE MEMBERS
OF THE COURT DON'T WANT TO.

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:07.144
I'M NOT ONE TO
PREDICT OR FORECAST.

00:52:07.144 --> 00:52:08.810
SO I DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:12.010
BUT I SUSPECT THAT THAT
CYNICAL VIEW MIGHT HAVE ONE

00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.654
RESPONSE TO WHAT
HAPPENS IN THE CASE.

00:52:13.654 --> 00:52:14.820
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: GREAT.

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:15.320
LINDA.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:18.650
&gt;&gt; LINDA GREENHOUSE:
JUST TO PICK UP ON THAT.

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:21.980
A COUPLE OF THE
HOT BUTTON ISSUES

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:27.300
BEFORE THE COURT RECENTLY HAVE
PLAINTIFFS WHOSE STANDING BY

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:31.320
CONVENTIONAL
CONSERVATIVE METRICS IS

00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:33.170
VERY SKETCHY TO SAY THE LEAST.

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.430
FOR INSTANCE, IN THE
FISHER AGAINST UNIVERSITY

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:39.030
OF TEXAS CASE,
MISS FISHER HAD BY

00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:42.420
THE TIME CASE CAME UP ALREADY
GRADUATED FROM ANOTHER

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.150
UNIVERSITY.

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:48.190
SO THERE WAS NO REMEDY THAT
A COURT COULD AWARD HER.

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:51.500
THE CASE FAILED WHAT IS
CALLED THE REDRESS ABILITY

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.930
PRONG OF STANDING.

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.710
THAT WAS AN ISSUE, BUT THE
COURT JUST PROCEEDED, BECAUSE

00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:00.620
AS LAUREN SAID THEY WANTED TO AT
LEAST TRY TO REACH THE MERITS.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:05.700
THERE'S BEEN CHALLENGES TO THE
STANDARDS OF THE CURRENT REALLY

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.190
SKETCHY PLAINTIFFS IN THE
CURRENT AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:09.730
CASE.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:12.370
THE CASE BEING TOTALLY
PHONY FROM THE GET GO,

00:53:12.370 --> 00:53:16.470
BUT ALSO PHONY IN RECRUITING
THESE PLAINTIFFS WHO REALLY

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:19.440
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
ABOUT THE CASE IT TURNS OUT.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:23.810
AND ACTUALLY FAILED THE BASIC
PRONG OF THE STANDING DOCTRINE,

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:24.860
WHICH IS INJURY.

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:27.780
INJURY IN FACT BECAUSE THE
FACT OF THE MATTER IS NOBODY

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.451
IS INJURED BY THE EXISTENCE
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:32.950
THEY HAVE AN IDEOLOGICAL INJURY,
BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THE

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:33.790
LAW.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:36.900
BUT THEY CANNOT ACTUALLY
PROVE A FINANCIAL INJURY.

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:41.190
BUT YET THE COURT,
LET'S ASSUME IS

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:43.440
GOING TO PRECEDE TO THE
MERITS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:46.960
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: SO THAT
LEADS TO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.870
THAT I'VE HAD AND I'M GOING TO
TRY AND COMBINE THEM WHICH HAVE

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:52.080
TO DO WITH JUDICIAL ACTIVISM.

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.720
SORT REACHING AT WHATEVER IT IS.

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.030
ONE WAY OF SAYING
THIS IS THERE A WAY

00:53:57.030 --> 00:54:01.990
TO DIFFERENTIATE THE ROBERTS
COURT QUOTE JUDICIAL ACTIVISM

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:05.360
FROM THE EARLIER CRITICISM
OF LIBERAL JUDGES,

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.590
ESPECIALLY IN THE
WARREN COURT, OR

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.770
IS THIS ONLY A
QUESTION OF OX GORING?

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:12.200
OR IS THERE SOMETHING
ELSE AT WORK?

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.430
AND ANOTHER QUESTION IS SAYING
THE WARREN COURT WAS WIDELY

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:20.030
SEEN AS ACTIVIST FROM
A POSITION ON THE LEFT,

00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:24.650
ON THE BASIS OF THE PRINCIPLES
OF EQUALITY AND LIBERTY.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:29.090
THIS PANEL HAS CRITICIZED THE
ACTIVISM OF THE ROBERTS COURT.

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:33.310
WHAT PRINCIPLE DEFENSE
OF ITS ACTIVISM WOULD

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:35.490
BE MADE BY
CONSERVATIVE SUPPORTERS

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:37.990
OF THE ROBERTS COURT?

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:41.640
UNFORTUNATELY I SHOULD TELL
YOU THAT PROFESSOR MANNING,

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:45.360
A SITUATION AROSE
EARLIER THIS WEEK

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.670
THAT HE HAD TO LEAVE
FOR PERSONAL REASONS.

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:52.230
SO LINDA, LAUREN, MICHAEL,
PUT ON YOUR CONSERVATIVE HATS,

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:55.750
WHICH YOU DO WHEN YOU
TEACH YOUR LAW STUDENTS.

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:59.030
AND WHAT IS THE
BEST ARTICULATION

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:02.220
FOR WHAT THE ROBERTS
COURT IS DOING?

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:05.440
&gt;&gt; LINDA GREENHOUSE: NOT
TO CHANNEL JOHN MANNING.

00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:10.300
BUT FROM THE CONSERVATIVE
PERSPECTIVE, THE WORD THAT THEY

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:14.250
USE NOW IS JUDICIAL ENGAGEMENT.

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:18.480
THAT JUDGES SHOULD BE
ENGAGED, SHOULD NOT STEP BACK

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.310
FROM THE FRAY.

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:23.610
SHOULD NOT USE BARRIERS
TOO, STANDING AND SO ON.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:26.060
TO BRING THE COURT BACK.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:29.090
BRING CONSTITUTIONAL
DOCTRINE AND DOCTRINES

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:33.530
OF STATUTORY INTERPRETATION
BACK TO WHERE THEY SHOULD ALWAYS

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:34.630
HAVE BEEN.

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:38.710
SO FOR INSTANCE IN THE
TYPE OF CASES THAT LAUREN

00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.230
WAS TALKING ABOUT,
THERE HAS BEEN

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:44.960
A GREAT CONCERN ON THE
SIDE OF BUSINESS THAT A

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.591
LOT OF QUOTE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS
ARE MAKING THEIR WAY INTO

00:55:48.591 --> 00:55:49.090
COURT.

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:53.700
AND EVEN THOUGH MANY OF
THEM HAVE GOTTEN DISMISSED

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:58.400
ULTIMATELY, THAT'S ONLY AFTER
THE DEFENDANT CORPORATION

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.640
HAS HAD TO SPEND TONS OF TIME
AND MONEY IN DISCOVERY AND ALL

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.090
THE PRE TRIAL STUFF.

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:08.920
SO IF THE BARRIERS TO
ENTRY ARE HIGHER AND THESE

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:13.640
CASES ARE GOTTEN RID
OF AT THE ENTRY POINT,

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.100
IT JUST SAVES EVERYBODY A
LOT OF TIME AND TROUBLE.

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.510
THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE ARGUMENT.

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:21.350
ON THE CONSTITUTIONAL SIDE.

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:26.420
SO JUSTICE KENNEDY WOULD SAY
I THINK AND JUST AS PEOPLE

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:30.560
KNOW, JUSTICE KENNEDY'S
BYWORD IS DIGNITY.

00:56:30.560 --> 00:56:34.350
HE VIEWS IT AS AN
AFFRONT TO HUMAN

00:56:34.350 --> 00:56:40.340
DIGNITY TO BE CLASSIFIED BY ONES
GOVERNMENT ON THE BASIS OF ONES

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:40.930
RACE.

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:45.760
THOSE OF US WHO HAVE
DOUBTS ABOUT THAT KIND

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:50.106
OF JURISPRUDENCE WOULD SAY
THAT'S TRUE AS FAR AS IT GOES.

00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:52.480
BUT IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T PUT IT IN

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.920
THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S THE
PURPOSE FOR THE CLASSIFICATION.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.690
WHAT'S THE REMEDIAL
PURPOSE, OR WHAT'S

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:00.420
THE EVEN LARGER
DIGNITARY PURPOSE.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:04.436
I THINK HE FEELS THAT VERY
STRONGLY, AND LIKEMINDED PEOPLE

00:57:04.436 --> 00:57:05.810
FEEL THAT VERY
STRONGLY THAT IT'S

00:57:05.810 --> 00:57:11.260
SIMPLY INAPPROPRIATE,
AND EVEN DANGEROUS

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:14.114
FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO
BE IN THAT BUSINESS.

00:57:14.114 --> 00:57:16.780
I MAYBE HAVEN'T DONE A VERY GOOD
JOB OF CHANNELING CONSERVATIVES

00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.300
BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT
HE WAS GOING TO SAY.

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:22.650
&gt;&gt; LAUREN SUDEALL LUCAS: IT'S
INTERESTING THAT THE COURT

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:25.810
SEEMS SO WORRIED ABOUT LOWER
COURTS BEING FLOODED WITH

00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:28.880
FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS AND THAT
SORT OF PRACTICAL ASPECT OF

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.470
LITIGATION.

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:31.950
AND AS AN ASIDE ONE FACT
THAT I DIDN'T MENTION IS THAT

00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:33.680
THERE'S A STUDY THAT SAYS
THAT THE HEIGHTENED PLEADING

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.190
STANDARD THAT COMES OUT OF
IQBAL HASN'TACTUALLY RESULTED IN

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:38.300
HIGHER QUALITY CLAIMS
BASED ON ULTIMATE OUTCOME.

00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:43.680
YOU SEE THIS INTERPLAY A
LOT BETWEEN THE MAJORITY

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.300
AND THE DISSENT,
NOT VERY CONCERNED

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.230
WITH THE PRACTICAL EFFECTS OF
RESTRICTING RIHGTS SO WHETHER

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:52.180
ITS CASES INVOLVING VOTER
IDENTIFICATION LAWS, ABORTION,

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.780
YOU OFTEN SEE THE DISSENTERS
SAYING, HEY, BUT LOOK AT HOW

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.689
THIS ACTUALLY AFFECTS
PEOPLE IN THEIR DAY

00:57:56.689 --> 00:57:58.480
TO DAY LIVES, LOOK AT
HOW THIS AFFECTS POOR

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.240
PEOPLE, LOOK AT HOW THIS
AFFECTS MARGINALIZED PEOPLE.

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.620
AND THE COURT SEEMS GENERALLY
UNCONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:08.330
IF YOU'RE OPERATING IN A VACUUM,
PERHAPS THIS SEEMS LIKE A

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:09.560
PURIST INTERPRETATION.

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:13.660
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THESE
DECISIONS ARE AFFECTING PEOPLE,

00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:16.520
YOU SEE A LOT OF OPINIONS WHERE
THE DISSENT JUST CANNOT BELIEVE

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:20.430
THAT THE MAJORITY IS NOT
TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:23.860
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: THANK YOU.

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.570
I WAS GOING TO LET THEM JUST
TALK ABOUT THE CASES THAT THEY

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:27.480
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT.

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.240
BUT IT TURNS OUT A LOT OF YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT ANOTHER

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.300
CASE.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.030
NOT THE ONE THAT HASN'T
BEEN DECIDED YET.

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:35.570
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.880
BUT CITIZENS UNITED.

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.180
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY
JUST AVOIDED TALKING ABOUT IT.

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:44.410
BUT THEY DIDN'T.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:45.690
BUT ANY WAY.

00:58:45.690 --> 00:58:48.060
JUST A TON OF QUESTIONS UP HERE.

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.520
DO YOU THINK ANY OF THE JUSTICES
IN THE MAJORITY IN CITIZENS

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:56.100
UNITED SEE IT AS NOW A DISASTER
FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY?

00:58:56.100 --> 00:59:00.360
WILL THE PANEL PLEASE
COMMENT ON CITIZENS UNITED?

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.810
OR I WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT CITIZENS UNITED.

00:59:03.810 --> 00:59:05.840
OR CAN YOU PLEASE?

00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:06.580
AND SO ON.

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:07.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.600
OKAY, MICHAEL.

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.860
PLEASE COMMENT ON
CITIZENS UNITED.

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:13.780
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL KLARMAN: SO THIS
ACTUALLY TIES IN REALLY WELL

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:17.600
WITH THE LAST QUESTION
ABOUT ACTIVISM.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.760
AGAIN, IF YOU TAKE AS AN
EXAMPLE ABORTION REGULATION,

00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:23.300
WHEN THE COURT STRIKES DOWN AN
ABORTION REGULATION, JUSTICE

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.350
SCALIA AND THOMAS WOULD SAY,
THE ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING

00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:28.710
OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH ABORTION.

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:31.600
THIS SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO
LEGISLATIVE REGULATION.

00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:35.140
SO THE QUESTION IS, HOW DID
THE FIVE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES

00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:38.970
JUSTIFY STRIKING DOWN
A BAN ON CORPORATIONS,

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:42.980
MAKING INDEPENDENT SPEECH
STATEMENTS IN ELECTIONS?

00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.842
AND THIS GETS BACK TO
MARGIE'S LAST QUESTION

00:59:45.842 --> 00:59:48.050
WHICH IS HOW WOULD THEY
DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST THE

00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:49.660
CHARGES OF ACTIVISM.

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.220
AND THE ANSWER IS THEY'LL
JUST SAY THE TEXT OF THE FIRST

00:59:52.220 --> 00:59:55.850
AMENDMENT TELLS YOU THAT SPEECH
IS SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTED AND

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:58.711
IT DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT WHO THE SPEAKER IS.

00:59:58.711 --> 01:00:01.210
BUT THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE,
WELL FIRST OF ALL THE FACT THAT

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:03.418
THE FIRST AMENDMENT TALKS
ABOUT THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH

01:00:03.418 --> 01:00:05.240
DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT SPENDING MONEY.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.030
THE PEOPLE WHO WROTE
THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:09.490
HAD AN INCREDIBLY NARROW
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:10.620
WAS PROTECTED.

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:12.120
NONE OF THEM WOULD
HAVE DREAMED THAT

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.590
THE IDEA OF SPENDING MONEY ON
ELECTIONS WAS PROTECTED SPEECH.

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:17.620
WHEN CONGRESS PASSED
A SEDITION ACT

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.760
IN THE FIRST DECADE OF
THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY,

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.910
WHICH PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL FOR
CRITICIZING JOHN ADAMS TOO

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:25.380
HARSHLY AS PRESIDENT.

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.110
NOT A SINGLE FEDERAL JUDGE IN
THE COUNTRY THOUGHT THAT LAW

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:31.320
WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE
THEY HAD SUCH A NARROW

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.660
VIEW OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.120
BUT THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES
WON'T TALK ABOUT THE ORIGINAL

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.203
UNDERSTANDING OF THE 1ST
AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT'S SO

01:00:37.203 --> 01:00:40.480
STRONGLY AGAINST THEIR POSITION,
THEY JUST SAY THAT WE WON'T GET

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.930
TO THE ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING,
BECAUSE THE FIRST AMENDMENT

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:45.770
TALKS ABOUT SPEECH AND
SPENDING MONEY IS SPEECH.

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.680
I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OUTRAGEOUS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:51.200
ONES THAT SAY WE OUGHT TO LOOK
AT ORIGINAL UNDERSTANDING AND

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.990
THERE'S REALLY NOT A SHRED OF
EVIDENCE ON THEIR SIDE ON THAT

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:53.210
ISSUE.

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:53.710
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:56.216
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL:
LAUREN, LINDA?

01:01:01.930 --> 01:01:06.430
&gt;&gt; LINDA GREENHOUSE: WELL YOUR
QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER ANY OF

01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:13.070
THE CURRENT CITIZENS UNITED
MAJORITY ARE ABOUT TO

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.960
RECALIBRATE THEIR UNDERSTANDING.

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.940
THEY HAD THAT CHANCE QUITE
SOON AFTER THE DECISION.

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:24.360
A CASE CAME UP FROM MONTANA
WHERE THE MONTANA SUPREME COURT

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:28.520
IN THE KIND OF DEFIANCE OF
CITIZENS UNITED HAD UPHELD

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:34.120
STATE CORPORATE CAMPAIGN
SPENDING LIMITS UNDER THE STATE

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.410
CONSTITUTION.

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:38.830
AND MONTANA HAD A VERY
INTERESTING HISTORY WHERE

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:41.880
CORPORATIONS HAD BASICALLY
BOUGHT U.S. SENATORS

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.060
BACK IN THE DAY WHEN
SENATORS WERE APPOINTED BY

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.090
STATE LEGISLATURES.

01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:49.410
SO THE MONTANA SUPREME COURT
SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE ACTING OUT

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:51.270
OF OUR OWN SPECIAL HISTORY.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:52.360
AND WE HAVE THESE LAWS.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.610
AND WE THINK WE
CAN MAKE THE CASE

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:57.520
THAT THE NOTION OF
CORRUPTION WHICH

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.150
IS AT THE HEART OF CITIZENS
UNITED, A VERY NARROW VIEW.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:03.280
A QUID PRO QUO BASICALLY
BRIBERY, CORRUPTION.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.640
THAT WE UNDERSTAND CORRUPTION
MORE DEEPLY AND THIS

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.300
IS WHAT WE THINK.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.320
THE COURT OVERTURNED IT
EVEN WITHOUT AN OPINION.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.900
OVERTURNED THE MONTANA
SUPREME COURT AND

01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:17.530
SAID THAT STATE LAW
WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:19.530
SO THAT WAS A CHANCE
TO EXPRESS A LITTLE

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:20.750
BIT OF BUYER'S REMORSE.

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:27.710
AND I DON'T SEE THAT ANYTHING
HAS COME THEIR WAY SINCE

01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:31.150
THAT'S GOING TO, IF ANYTHING,
THEY'RE DRILLING DOWN BECAUSE

01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:33.610
LAST TERM IN THE CASE
CALLED McCUTCHEON,

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:38.260
THE CHEIF JUSTICE WROTE THE
MAJORITY OPINION ERASE THE

01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:43.800
LIMITS ON AGGREGATE INDIVIDUAL
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.480
IT SEEMS THAT EVERY TIME THEY
GET A NEW CHANCE WHERE THEY

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.760
MIGHT PULL BACK A LITTLE,
INSTEAD THEY GO FURTHER.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.880
&gt;&gt; LAUREN SUDEALL LUCAS: AND
CORPORATIONS NOT ONLY HAVE FREE

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.290
SPEECH RIGHTS, BUT THEY NOW
HAVE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS TOO.

01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:56.260
SO THEY'RE BECOMING MORE
AND MORE LIKE PEOPLE.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:01.220
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: OKAY.

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:06.370
I THINK THAT TOOK CARE OF
CITIZENS UNITED. [LAUGHTER]

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:09.650
THIS IS REALLY NOT ON POINT,
EXCEPT IT IS ON POINT.

01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:13.020
QUITE OFTEN WHEN I'VE HAD WITH
JUSTICE SCALIA ON THIS POINT HE

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:15.080
SAYS I WOULD LIKE TO
SEE THE NEW YORK TIMES,

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.327
KNOWING VERY WELL THAT I WAS
MARRIED TO SOMEONE WHO WROTE TO

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:19.660
THE NEW YORK TIMES FOR 50 YEARS.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:23.080
HE SAID I'D LIKE TO SEE THE
NEW YORK TIMES SAYI THAT THEY

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:29.130
DIDN'T HAVE THE FREE SPEECH
RIGHT TO CHARGE MONEY FOR THE

01:03:29.130 --> 01:03:31.940
THEIR EDITORIALS, WAS
ESSENTIALLY HIS POSITION.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:37.260
MY VIEW WAS THERE'S PROTECTION
OF THE PRESS, AS WELL.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.820
IT'S NEVER BEEN A VERY ENGAGED
DISCUSSION, I HAVE TO SAY.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:40.320
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:46.140
I DO WANT TO SAY ONE
ADDITIONAL THING.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.880
ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO THINKS
ABOUT CITIZENS UNITED

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.260
THINKS ABOUT IT FROM THE
CONTEXT OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:54.570
AND ESPECIALLY
CONGRESSIONAL RACES,

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.920
OR LEGISLATIVE
RACES IN THE STATES.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.360
THERE ARE MANY STATES
THAT HAVE ELECTED JUDGES.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:01.950
37 STATES THAT HAVE
ELECTED JUDGES.

01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:04.950
AND CITIZENS UNITED
APPLIES TO THOSE, AS WELL.

01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:07.400
AND SOMETHING REALLY
TERRIBLE IS GOING ON

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.250
IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM
IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:13.880
IT'S NOW COSTING HUGE AMOUNTS
OF MONEY IN SOME OF THOSE RACES.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.740
AND SOME OF THE BEST
JUDGES ARE SIMPLY NOT

01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.490
AGREEING TO BECOME JUDGES OR
STEPPING AWAY FROM THE COURT.

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:28.190
MY MONTANA COLLEAGUES FELT VERY,
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THAT CASE.

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:32.200
AND I THINK IN MONTANA,
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:36.140
AN AMICUS BRIEF FILED BY FORMER
CHIEF JUSTICES OF THE MONTANA

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.280
SUPREME COURT IN THAT CASE.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.110
THEY KNOW VERY
WELL WHAT HAPPENS.

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:43.600
IT'S BAD ENOUGH PUTTING
MONEY INTO CONGRESSIONAL

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.210
AND PRESIDENTIAL RACES,
BUT IT HAS A VERY POWERFUL,

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:52.340
NEGATIVE IMPACT WHEN YOU PUT IT
INTO JUDICIAL RACES, AS WELL.

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.780
THAT'S CERTAINLY
SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:05:02.460
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:11.280
PERHAPS AS A FINAL QUESTION
BEFORE WE TURN TO MICHAEL,

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.170
THERE'S A MOVEMENT
UNDER WAY NOW KIND OF.

01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:19.070
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN PERSUADE
THEM TO HAVE NEW JUSTICES

01:05:19.070 --> 01:05:21.920
THAT ARE APPOINTED TO THE COURT
TO AGREE THAT THEY WILL STEP

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:24.520
ASIDE AFTER A PARTICULAR
PERIOD OF TIME.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:28.180
IN OTHER WORDS IT GOES
TO THE LENGTH OF TENURE.

01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.410
FEDERAL JUDGES, AS YOU
KNOW, SERVE FOR LIFE.

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:33.860
AT THE TIME THE
CONSTITUTION WAS WRITTEN.

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:37.890
THE APPROXIMATE
LIFE SPAN WAS 50.

01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:41.710
SO MANY OF US ARE VERY HAPPY
THAT THERE'S BEEN MEDICAL

01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:44.310
PROGRESS SINCE THAT TIME.

01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:47.300
BUT IT HAS MEANT
THAT OUR JUSTICES ARE

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:51.510
SERVING FOR LONGER AND LONGER
AND LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.

01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:54.430
THAT IS TRUE BY THE WAY FOR
THE ENTIRE FEDERAL SYSTEM,

01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:57.400
NOT JUST FOR THE NINE JUSTICES
ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:57.900
COURT.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.830
BUT CONGRESS HAS CREATED
A MECHANISM WHICH MAKES IT

01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:05.590
POSSIBLE FOR FEDERAL JUDGES
ON THE CIRCUIT COURTS AND THE

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.720
DISTRICT COURTS TO TAKE
WHAT'S CALLED SENIOR STATUS.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.300
IT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT
WE DO AT UNIVERSITIES NOW AFTER

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:16.680
THEY PUT AN END TO 70 YEARS
A MANDATORY AGE RETIREMENT,

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:21.260
WHERE YOU CAN REMAIN FULL TIME
ACTING JUDGE OR PART TIME.

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:24.020
BUT YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET
ANOTHER JUDICIAL POSITION IN

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.720
YOUR COURT, THAT OF COURSE WE
CAN'T DO IN THE UNITED STATES

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:29.840
SUPREME COURT, BECAUSE WE
HAVE THE NINE JUSTICES.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.820
ANY VIEWS FROM ANY OF
YOU ABOUT WHETHER THAT'S

01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.490
A GOOD OR BAD IDEA AND
WHAT'S THE LIKELIHOOD OF IT

01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:36.690
SUCCEEDING?

01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:39.559
AND MICHAEL, YOU
NEED NOT ANSWER,

01:06:39.559 --> 01:06:41.350
BECAUSE YOUR JUSTICE
IS SITTING RIGHT HERE.

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.160
OR MAYBE YOU HAVE
A VERY STRONG VIEW.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:43.660
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.200
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL KLARMAN: I HAD A
COUPLE STUDENTS WHO WROTE A

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.490
NOTE YEARS AGO AND THEIR
PROPOSAL WAS LIMITED TO THE

01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:54.480
SUPREME COURT, BUT IT WOULD
BE 18 YEAR STAGGERED TERMS.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:56.230
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
A BRILLIANT PROPOSAL.

01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:58.313
I DON'T THINK IT HAS ANY
PRACTICAL CHANCE OF BEING

01:06:58.313 --> 01:07:01.060
ADOPTED, BUT IT WAS BRILLIANT
PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT SOLVES ALL

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.780
OF THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST
WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEMS.

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:06.150
SO THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH
STRATEGIC APPOINTMENTS.

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:08.350
PRESIDENTS WILL APPOINT
PEOPLE YOUNGER AND YOUNGER,

01:07:08.350 --> 01:07:11.000
BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND IT'S
IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PARTICULAR

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.260
VIEW REPRESENTED
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:14.920
THERE ARE STRATEGIC RETIREMENTS.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.760
JUSTICES WILL LEAVE
THE COURT WHEN

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:20.070
THERE'S A PRESIDENT SITTING WHO
THEY BELIEVE ROUGHLY REPRESENTS

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.240
THE VIEWS THEY WANT
WRITTEN INTO LAW.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.000
THERE'S THE PROBLEM OF FORTUITY.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.480
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT
HAD 5 OR 6 APPOINTMENTS

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:27.730
IN ONE 4 YEAR PERIOD.

01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:32.180
JIMMY CARTER HAD NONE DURING
HIS 4 YEAR TERN IN OFFICE.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.165
AND IT'S A MANDATORY
RETIREMENT, WHICH

01:07:34.165 --> 01:07:36.540
WE HAVE IN MOST AREAS OF LIFE,
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.498
PROBABLY BE A PRETTY GOOD
IDEA IN THAT CONTEXT.

01:07:38.498 --> 01:07:40.000
&gt;&gt; NOT IN ACADEMIA, MICHAEL.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.500
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.970
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: I THINK
I CAN SPEAK FOR MICHAEL.

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:47.730
YOU WOULD SUPPORT MANDATORY
RETIREMENT FOR PROFESSORS.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:49.970
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL KLARMAN: I WOULD.

01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:55.900
&gt;&gt; LINDA GREENHOUSE: I
THINK THE 18 YEAR TERM.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.790
I THINK I READ
THAT STUDENT NOTE.

01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:03.280
IT'S WORTH DISCUSSING FOR THE
REASONS THAT MICHAEL SAID.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.610
THE NOTION THAT SUPREME COURT
NOMINEES SHOULD VOLUNTARILY

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:09.365
PLEDGE THAT THEY WOULD DO IT
STRIKES ME AS KIND OF NUTTY.

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:18.740
IT'S INTERESTING THAT DEMOCRACY,
OR WHAT PASSES AS DEMOCRACY

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:21.069
HAS SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD
AND DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:23.970
HAVE ADOPTED ASPECTS
OF OUR SYSTEM,

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:26.609
INCLUDING CONSTITUTIONAL COURTS.

01:08:26.609 --> 01:08:30.200
NOT A SINGLE COUNTRY
HAS ADOPTED LIFE TENURE.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:34.899
THEY EITHER HAVE AGE LIMITS,
THEY HAVE TERM LIMITS.

01:08:34.899 --> 01:08:37.890
OF THE 50 STATES,
ONLY RHODE ISLAND

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:39.710
HAS LIFE TENURE FOR ITS JUDGES.

01:08:39.710 --> 01:08:44.460
EVERY OTHER STATE HAS EITHER
TERM LIMIT OR AGE LIMITS.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:47.950
SO THESE SYSTEMS ARE
VOTING WITH THEIR FEET THAT

01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:51.700
THERE IS SOMETHING A LITTLE
PROBLEMATIC ABOUT IT.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:59.430
AND IT CERTAINLY DOES ELEVATE
THE KIND OF DRAMA AROUND ANY

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:03.560
SUPREME COURT VACANCY BECAUSE
YOU'RE LOOKING OUT AT SUCH A

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.990
LONG TIMELINE.

01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:11.330
AND AS MICHAEL SAID, JUSTICES
ARE GETTING APPOINTED AT

01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:12.420
YOUNGER AND YOUNGER AGES.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:16.380
JOHN ROBERTS AT 50 WAS
THE YOUNGEST CHIEF JUSTICE

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.770
TO BE APPOINTED
SINCE JOHN MARSHALL.

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:22.090
SO THERE'S STUFF TO
DISCUSS ABOUT THIS.

01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:26.109
IT'S A WORTHWHILE CONVERSATION,
BUT IT'S A VERY LONG TERM ONE.

01:09:26.109 --> 01:09:28.920
AND EXTRACTING PROMISES FROM
NOMINEES IS NOT THE ANSWER,

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.630
I'M PRETTY SURE OF THAT.

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:33.849
&gt;&gt; LAUREN SUDEALL LUCAS: I WOULD
JUST ADD THAT I DON'T KNOW IF

01:09:33.849 --> 01:09:35.890
IMPLEMENTING THESE TYPES
OF PROPOSALS WOULD HELP.

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:38.620
BUT I THINK THERE'S A REAL
NEED AND PERHAPS HAVING MORE

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.010
FREQUENT TURNOVER
WOULD HELP WITH

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:44.160
THIS, HAVING A DIVERSITY OF
EXPERIENCE NOT JUST TALK ABOUT

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:47.120
DIVERSITY OF RACE AND GENDER
IN TERMS OF WHO'S ON THE COURT.

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.359
BUT ALSO DIVERSITY OF EXPERIENCE
AND HAVING A RELATIVELY RECENT

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:52.140
EXPERIENCE WITH HOW
CASES ARE LITIGATED

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.540
IN PRACTICE, PARTICULARLY IN
OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:57.250
I LIVE IN A STATE WHERE PEOPLE
ARE ROUTINELY UNREPRESENTED BY

01:09:57.250 --> 01:09:58.180
COUNSEL.

01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.300
THE CASES ARE RESOLVED
WITHOUT A DEFENDANT EVEN

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:02.160
SPEAKING TO A LAWYER.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:04.160
AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE
PROSECUTORIAL EXPERIENCE,

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.660
OR PUBLIC DEFENDER EXPERIENCE
AND ACTUALLY KNOWING HOW THESE

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:09.720
THINGS WORK ON THE GROUND AND
PRACTICE OBSERVING INTERACTIONS

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.330
BETWEEN CITIZENS AND
POLICE WOULD REALLY HELP

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:15.020
WITH HELPING THE COURT GRAPPLE
WITH THESE ISSUES AS THEY TRY

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:15.120
TO DECIDE HOW TO DEAL
WITH IT AT THIS LEVEL,

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.200
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO
UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.600
OPERATE ON THE GROUND.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.100
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.530
&gt;&gt; MARGARET MARSHALL: I
WOULD ADD ONE LAST THING.

01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:24.190
I THINK I'M CORRECT,
MAYBE I'M NOT.

01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:28.050
BUT I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST
COURT EVER WHERE THERE'S BEEN

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:30.130
NOBODY WITH ANY
STATE EXPERIENCE.

01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:31.960
AND I DON'T MEAN
JUST STATE, JUDICIAL.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.650
BUT JUSTICE SOUTER HAD OF
COURSE BEEN A STATE COURT JUDGE,

01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:37.750
AND CHIEF JUSTICE
WARREN, GOVERNOR.

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.180
PEOPLE HAVE HAD
STATE EXPERIENCE.

01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.880
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT
WE ARE BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.771
FEDERALIZED COURT.

01:10:43.771 --> 01:10:46.270
MICHAEL, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS
YOU OR JOHN WHO TOLD ME THIS

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:51.160
YEAR THE COURT HAS TAKEN A VERY
FEW NUMBER OF CASES FROM STATE

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:51.700
COURTS.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:55.280
AND THAT'S WHERE MOST OF
THE JUSTICE GETS DONE.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.820
I FOR ONE HAVE A PROPOSAL
THAT IF WE HAVE LIMITED

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:03.470
TENURE, EITHER BY
AGE LIMITATION, OR BY

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:06.990
NUMBERS OF YEARS SERVED, THAT
IT NOT BE IMPLEMENTED UNTIL

01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:10.500
AFTER THE LAST SITTING JUDGE
HAS NO LONGER APPLIED TO THEM,

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.930
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY
PROBLEMATIC WHEN YOU TRY

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:15.500
TO DO IT WITH A SITTING COURT.

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:19.100
AND IN ANY EVENT, I WOULD
LIKE TO THANK JOHN ADAMS

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.300
IN THE MASSACHUSETTS
CONSTITUTION FOR TELLING US

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:23.930
THAT WE HAD LIFETIME TENURE.

01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:26.060
BECAUSE IF WE DIDN'T,
WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:28.510
EXTRAORDINARY,
BRILLIANT, WONDERFUL,

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:45.580
AMAZING WOMAN THAT WE HAVE
TO CELEBRATE HERE TODAY.

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.390
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:51.990
SO IF YOU ARE A
LAWYER, ESPECIALLY ONE

01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:54.260
WHO'S JUST BEGINNING
THEIR CAREER, WHAT

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:59.480
IS THE VERY, VERY, VERY
BEST JOB IN THE WORLD

01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:02.940
THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE?

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:07.010
IT IS NO DOUBT TO BE A LAW
CLERK FOR JUSTICE RUTH BADER

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:08.920
GINSBURG.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.500
AND MICHAEL KLARMAN IS
GOING TO GIVE US A LITTLE

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.720
PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT IT IS
LIKE TO HAVE THAT BEAUTIFUL

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:17.390
POSITION.

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:20.190
MICHAEL?

01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:23.020
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:28.910
&gt;&gt; MICHAEL KLARMAN: THANK YOU.

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:31.840
WHEN PRESIDENT CLINTON
NOMINATED RUTH BADER GINSBURG

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.250
TO THE SUPREME COURT
IN 1993, HE SAID

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:37.260
QUOTE MANY ADMIRERS
OF HER WORK SAID

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:40.170
THAT SHE IS TO THE WOMEN'S
MOVEMENT WHAT FORMER SUPREME

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.950
COURT JUSTICE
THURGOOD MARSHALL WAS

01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:44.770
TO MOVEMENT OF THE RIGHTS
OF AFRICAN AMERICANS.

01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:47.010
CLINTON WHO WAS A GRADUATE
OF A LAW SCHOOL OTHER

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:50.070
THAN HARVARD THAT SHALL NOT BE
NAMED, EXPLAINED THAT HE COULD

01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:52.690
THINK OF NO GREATER
COMPLIMENT TO BESTOW ON

01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:54.200
AN AMERICAN LAWYER.

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.850
INDEED JUSTICE GINSBURG
IS ONE OF THE FEW JUSTICES

01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:00.430
IN AMERICAN HISTORY WHO WOULD
BE A DESERVED FAMOUS AMERICAN IF

01:13:00.430 --> 01:13:03.580
SHE HAD NEVER SERVED
ON THE SUPREME COURT.

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:06.300
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU A FEW
STORIES ABOUT JUSTICE GINSBURG

01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:10.780
AND HER BIOGRAPHY AND HER
ROLE AS A TRAILBLAZING

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:13.300
LITIGATOR FOR SOCIAL REFORM.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.210
AS MARGIE SAID, I HAD
THE GOOD FORTUNATE TO

01:13:15.210 --> 01:13:16.630
CLERK FOR HER 30 YEARS AGO.

01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:20.450
SO I KNOW SOME OF THESE STORIES
AS A RESULT OF HAVING WRITTEN

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:22.200
SOME ABOUT HER IN THE PAST.

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:24.320
GINSBURG'S PERSONAL
STORY ILLUSTRATES

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.800
WHAT THE PROFESSIONAL WORLD WAS
LIKE FOR WOMEN HALF A CENTURY

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:28.580
AGO.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.790
HOW MUCH IT'S CHANGED SINCE
THEN, AND HOW THE EFFORTS

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:34.970
OF A TALENTED AND HARD
WORKING LAWYER CAN CONTRIBUTE

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:37.210
TO PROGRESSIVE SOCIAL REFORM.

01:13:37.210 --> 01:13:40.890
WHEN GINSBURG ENTERED
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL IN 1956,

01:13:40.890 --> 01:13:45.400
SHE WAS ONE OF ONLY NINE
WOMEN IN A CLASS OF OVER 500.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.220
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL HAD NOT
ADMITTED WOMAN AT ALL UNTIL

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.510
1950.

01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:53.640
AT THE TIME THAT GINSBURG WAS
MATRICULATED AT HLS, WOMEN WERE

01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:56.160
NOT PERMITTED TO LIVE IN
LAW SCHOOL DORMITORIES,

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.950
AND THEY WERE DENIED
ACCESS TO DINING TABLES

01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:00.610
AT THE FACULTY CLUB.

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:03.470
AND THE ANNUAL LAW
REVIEW BANQUET ENCOURAGED

01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:07.190
MEMBERS TO BRING WITH THEM THEIR
FATHERS, BUT NOT THEIR MOTHERS

01:14:07.190 --> 01:14:08.910
OR THEIR WIVES.

01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:12.200
EARLY IN THE SCHOOL YEAR THE LAW
SCHOOL'S DEAN INVITED THE NINE

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.040
WOMEN IN THE CLASS TO HIS
HOUSE FOR DINNER AND DURING THE

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.060
COURSE OF THE
EVENING'S CONVERSATION,

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:20.740
HE ASKED THEM WHY THEY WANTED
TO ATTEND HARVARD LAW SCHOOL,

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.880
TAKING UP A SPACE THAT A MAN
COULD PRESUMEDLY PUT TO BETTER

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.020
USE.

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.590
GINS BURG REPORTS BEING
UNPREPARED FOR THE QUESTION.

01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:31.070
NOW AS YOU MAY KNOW HER
SPOUSE, MARTY GINSBURG

01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:33.700
WAS A YEAR AHEAD OF HER
AT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL.

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.920
AND AS SHE LATER RECOUNTS
HER REJOINDER TO THE DEAN,

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:39.660
ALL I COULD THINK TO
SAY WAS THAT MY HUSBAND

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.460
WAS IN THE SECOND YEAR
CLASS, AND IT WAS IMPORTANT

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:45.080
FOR A WIFE TO UNDERSTAND
HER HUSBAND'S WORK.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.840
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.650
FEW PEOPLE AT THAT POINT COULD
HAVE CONFIDENTLY PREDICTED

01:14:50.650 --> 01:14:53.460
THERE WOULD EVER BE A WOMAN ON
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:56.740
AND INDEED THERE WAS NOT
FOR ANOTHER 25 YEARS.

01:14:56.740 --> 01:15:00.460
GINSBURG TRANSFERRED TO COLUMBIA
LAW SCHOOL AFTER TWO YEARS AT

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:02.700
HARVARD WHEN MARTY
GRADUATED AND TOOK

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:04.640
A JOB WITH A NEW YORK LAW FIRM.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.030
THEY WERE RAISING A YOUNG
DAUGHTER AT THE TIME.

01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:09.510
GINSBURG GRADUATED IN 1959.

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:12.210
SHE WAS TIED FOR FIRST
IN HER CLASS AT COLUMBIA,

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:15.160
AND SHE HAD BEEN ON THE LAW
REVIEW BOTH AT COLUMBIA AND AT

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.060
HARVARD.

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:19.440
YET HER PROFESSORS HAD
TROUBLE FINDING HER A FEDERAL

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.140
CLERK COURTSHIP, EVEN THOUGH SHE
WAS EMINENTLY QUALIFIED FOR IT.

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:25.360
NO FEDERAL JUDGE IN
THE NEW YORK CITY AREA

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.650
WOULD HIRE A YOUNG
MOTHER AS A LAW CLERK.

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:31.270
FINALLY ONE OF HER
PROFESSORS, GERALD GUNTHER,

01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:34.180
PREVAILED UPON A FEDERAL
DISTRICT COURT JUDGE EDMOND

01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:38.970
PALMIERI TO HIRE GINSBURG BY
OFFERING A PERSONAL GUARANTEE

01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:43.930
THAT IF SHE DID NOT WORK OUT HE
WOULD FIND A MALE REPLACEMENT.

01:15:43.930 --> 01:15:47.200
SHE WORKED OUT SO WELL THAT IN
THE FUTURE PALMIERI COULD NOT

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.660
GET ENOUGH FEMALE CLERKS.

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.460
AS MOST OF YOU KNOW
JUSTICE GINSBURG

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.040
WAS THE LEADING WOMENS RIGHTS
LAWYER IN THE UNITED STATES

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.450
IN THE 1970S.

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:58.800
SHE ARGUED 6 LANDMARK CASES
IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:01.070
COURT, WINNING 5 OF THEM.

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:04.150
NOW ONE FAIRLY UNIQUE
OBSTACLE CONFRONTED BY LAWYERS

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:06.880
FOR SOCIAL REFORM IS EVEN
HAVING THEIR ARGUMENTS TAKEN

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.090
SERIOUSLY.

01:16:08.090 --> 01:16:11.100
IN 1938 CHARLES
HAMILTON HOUSTON,

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.970
ONE OF THE LEADING
BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS

01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:16.230
LITIGATORS IN THE COUNTRY AND A
GRADUATE OF HARVARD LAW SCHOOL

01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:19.200
LITERALLY HAD ONE OF THE
JUSTICES TURN HIS BACK

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.240
ON HIM IN DURING ORAL
ARGUMENT IN A LANDMARK RACE

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.680
DISCRIMINATION CASE
IN ORDER TO INDICATE

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.580
HIS PROFOUND DISRESPECT
FOR A BLACK MAN.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.780
40 YEARS LATER, ORAL ADVOCATE
RUTH BADER GINSBURG HAD TO

01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:33.620
CONFRONT CONDESCENDING
HUMOR FROM THE BENCH AS SHE

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:35.850
CHALLENGED THE EXCLUSION
OF WOMEN FROM JURIES

01:16:35.850 --> 01:16:37.350
IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI.

01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:40.010
AFTER GINSBURG HAS
CONCLUDED HER ORAL ARGUMENT

01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:43.450
IN THE CASE, ONE OF THE JUSTICES
LEANED OVER FROM THE BENCH TO

01:16:43.450 --> 01:16:45.670
ASK ONE FINAL QUESTION.

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:47.750
YOU WON'T SETTLE
FOR PUTTING SUSAN B.

01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:50.300
ANTHONY ON THE DOLLAR
THEN I TAKE IT?

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.600
IN ANOTHER LANDMARK CASE ONE
OF THE JUSTICES PRIVATELY

01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.440
CRITISIZED GINSBURG'S
BRIEF AS BEING EMOTIONAL,

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:00.560
INVOKING ONE OF THE TRADITIONAL
GENDER PUTDOWNS OF THE ERA.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.300
IN ADDITION TO THE CHALLENGE
OF BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY,

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:06.150
ONE OF THE PRINCIPLE
DIFFICULTIES THAT SOCIAL REFORM

01:17:06.150 --> 01:17:09.040
LITIGATORS FACE IS
CONVINCING JUSTICES

01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.680
OF THE UNFAIRNESS OF A SYSTEM,
UNDER WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAD

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.030
BENEFITED AND WHICH
HAD BECOME GROUNDED

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:19.690
IN AN IDEOLOGY SO PERVASIVE THAT
THEY HAD TROUBLE EVEN NOTICING

01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:22.080
THAT IT'S ASSUMPTIONS
ARE CONTROVERSIAL.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.990
GINSBURG CONFRONTED
EXACTLY THAT PROBLEM TRYING

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:28.530
TO CONVINCE ELDERLY MALE
JUSTICES IN THE 1970S

01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:32.980
OF THE INSIDIOUS CONSEQUENCES
OF SEX CLASSIFICATIONS.

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:36.040
VIRTUALLY ALL SEX
CLASSIFICATIONS ARE AS JUSTICE

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:39.660
GINSBURG LIKES TO SAY
A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:43.350
MANY SUCH STATUTES TANGIBLY
DISADVANTAGE MALES AND NOT

01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:47.530
FEMALES, THAT THEY INTANGIBLY
HARM WOMEN BY PERPETUATING

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:50.570
STEREOTYPES OF FEMALE
DEPENDENCY, PASSIVITY,

01:17:50.570 --> 01:17:52.680
AND LACK OF BUSINESS ABILITY.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:56.940
GINSBURG NEEDED TO CONVINCE
THESE JUSTICES THAT WOMEN WERE

01:17:56.940 --> 01:18:01.090
HARMED FOR EXAMPLE BY STATUTES
THAT REQUIRED MEN BUT NOT

01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:04.960
WOMEN TO PAY ALIMONY OR THAT
PERMITTED WOMEN, BUT NOT MEN

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:07.380
THE CHOICE OF WHETHER
TO SERVE ON A JURY.

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:10.330
IN A TELLING CONVERSATION WITH
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL STUDENTS

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:14.670
EARLY IN 1973, ONE OF THE MALE
JUSTICES AND THERE WERE ONLY

01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:18.820
MALE JUSTICES IN 1973
EXPRESSED BEWILDERMENT AS TO

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:21.800
WHY WOMEN WANTED AN
EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.700
IN HIS VIEW, THE
FEMALE OF THE SPECIES

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.560
HAS THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.110
SHE CAN ATTACK LAWS THAT
UNREASONABLY DISCRIMINATE

01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:32.890
AGAINST HER, WHILE PRESERVING
THOSE THAT FAVOR HER.

01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:35.020
GINSBURG REPORTED
BEING DEPRESSED

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:37.420
WHEN SHE HEARD THE
ACCOUNT OF THAT SPEECH.

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:39.880
A LENGTHY EXCHANGE
BETWEEN GINSBURG AND TWO

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.010
OF THE JUSTICES
AT ORAL ARGUMENT,

01:18:42.010 --> 01:18:47.300
IN THE CASE OF CALIFANO V.
GOLDFARB IN 1976 REVEALS HOW

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:51.550
DIFFICULT IT WAS TO CONVINCE
ELDERLY MALE JUSTICES THAT ALL

01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:55.490
SEX CLASSIFICATIONS ADVERSELY
AFFECTED WOMEN BECAUSE

01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:57.910
OF THIS DOUBLE EDGED NATURE.

01:18:57.910 --> 01:18:59.670
THE SOCIAL SECURITY
PROVISION THAT

01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:03.040
WAS AT ISSUE IN GOLDFARB
AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDED

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.530
SURVIVORS BENEFITS FOR
THE WIDOWS OF COVERED MALE

01:19:06.530 --> 01:19:09.440
EMPLOYEES, BUT REQUIRED
THAT THE WIDOWERS

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:13.120
OF COVERED FEMALE EMPLOYEES
DEMONSTRATE ACTUAL

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:15.960
ECONOMIC DEPENDENCY
ON THEIR SPOUSES.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.400
TO GINSBURG SUCH A PROVISION
HAD THREE DIFFERENT FLAWS.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.600
FIRST OF ALL IT DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST FEMALE WAGE EARNERS,

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:25.600
SECOND IT DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST THE MALE BENEFICIARIES,

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.680
AND THIRD IT PROPETUATED THE
PERFIDIOUS SEX STEREOTYPE THAT

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.860
MALES WERE PRIMARILY BREAD
WINNERS AND WOMEN WERE

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:34.610
PREDOMINANTLY HOMEMAKERS.

01:19:34.610 --> 01:19:38.040
SOME OF THE JUSTICES HAD
DIFFICULTY SEEING THESE POINTS.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.840
THE FIRST QUESTION
THAT WAS DIRECTED

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:43.020
TO GINSBURG FROM THE BENCH WAS
WHETHER THE PROVISION AT ISSUE

01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:45.940
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST
MALES OR FEMALES,

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:49.540
WHETHER IT COULD NOT BE CAST
IN EITHER WAY, AND WHY SHE HAD

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:52.890
CHOSEN TO TREAT IT AS AN
ANTI FEMALE DISCRIMINATION.

01:19:52.890 --> 01:19:56.700
IF THE SEXES WERE SWITCHED,
AND ONLY FEMALE BENEFICIARIES,

01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:59.530
WHERE WE'RE REQUIRED TO
ESTABLISH ACTUAL FINANCIAL

01:19:59.530 --> 01:20:02.350
DEPENDENCY, ONE JUSTICE
WONDERED WOULD THAT MAKE A

01:20:02.350 --> 01:20:04.280
CONSTITUTIONAL DIFFERENCE?

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:07.690
GINSBURG'S RESPONSE
WAS THE LINE DRAWN HERE

01:20:07.690 --> 01:20:10.980
LIKE VIRTUALLY EVERY GENDER
DISCRIMINATION IS A TWO EDGE

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:11.980
SWORD.

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:13.870
HER INTERLOCUTOR PERSISTED.

01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:16.150
SOME RECENT COURT
DECISIONS HAD FOCUSED ON

01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:18.620
THE HISTORY OF
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN,

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:20.990
BUT HE DOUBTED THAT
ANY ANALOGOUS HISTORY

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:23.650
OF DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST MEN EXISTED.

01:20:23.650 --> 01:20:27.860
GINS BURG RESPONDED THAT MOST
ANTI-FEMALE DISCRIMINATION

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:31.340
WAS DRESSED UP AS DISCRIMINATION
FAVORING THE WOMEN.

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:34.570
THE JUSTICE REPLIED
IMPATIENTLY, I KNOW THAT.

01:20:34.570 --> 01:20:36.620
I KNOW THAT BUT
THE COURTS THROUGH

01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.860
HELP OF ADVOCATES SUCH AS
YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE

01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:41.570
THAT, HAVENT THEY?

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:44.490
THAT COMMENT ELICITED
LAUGHTER IN THE COURTROOM.

01:20:44.490 --> 01:20:46.870
GINS BURG GAMELY
REITERATED THAT SEX

01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:50.370
CLASSIFICATIONS ALMOST
INEVITABLEY HARMED WOMEN.

01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:52.330
PERSISTING THIS
JUSTICE ASKED HER

01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:56.010
TO IMAGINE AN INSTANCE OF
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MALES.

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.590
WOULD HER CONSTITUTIONAL
ARGUMENT BE EQUALLY STRONG?

01:20:59.590 --> 01:21:03.080
GINSBURG REPLIED THAT HER
ARGUMENT WOULD REMAIN UNCHANGED

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:06.220
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
OF ANY PURELY ANTI-MALE

01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:07.380
DISCRIMINATION.

01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:10.540
IN THE END, THE WOMEN ARE
THE ONES WHO END UP HURTING.

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:13.420
IN A MOMENT LATER,
ANOTHER OF THE JUSTICES

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.770
TOOK UP THE SAME
LINE OF QUESTIONING.

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.700
SHOULD DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST MALES

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.870
BE SUBJECTED TO THE SAME
STANDARD AS DISCRIMINATION

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:24.080
AGAINST FEMALES OR
TO A DIFFERENT ONE?

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:26.700
GINSBURG REPEATED
HER PREVIOUS ANSWER.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:29.520
ALMOST EVERY DISCRIMINATION
THAT OPERATES AGAINST

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:33.250
MALES OPERATES AGAINST
FEMALES, AS WELL.

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:37.010
BEWILDERED AND APPARENTLY
ANNOYED, THE JUSTICE RESPONDED

01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:39.940
IS THAT A YES OR A NO ANSWER?

01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.620
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:44.230
ARE YOU TRYING TO
AVOID THE QUESTION?

01:21:44.230 --> 01:21:48.340
GINSBURG INSISTED SHE WAS
TRYING TO CLARIFY, NOT EVADE.

01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:50.880
SHE WAS AWARE OF NO SEX
CLASSIFICATIONS THAT DID

01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.750
NOT OPERATE AS A
DOUBLE EDGED SWORD.

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:55.810
THE EXCHANGE WENT
ON TO SIMLAR EFFECT

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:58.860
FOR A WHILE LONGER THEN CAME
THE FOLLOWING QUESTION FROM THE

01:21:58.860 --> 01:21:59.560
BENCH.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:02.580
BUT YOUR ANSWER ALWAYS
DEPENDS ON THERE FINDING SOME

01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:04.790
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FEMALES.

01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:08.600
YOU SEEM TO PUT THAT IN EVERY
ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:11.220
YES.

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:12.800
GINSBURG WHO MUST
HAVE BEEN GROWING

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.730
EXASPERATED AT THIS POINT
REITERATED THAT QUOTE.

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:19.370
I HAVE NOT YET COME ACROSS A
STATUTE THAT DOESN'T HAVE THAT

01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:20.250
AFFECT.

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:21.730
HER QUESTIONER PERSISTED.

01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:23.180
I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP.

01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:26.210
BUT IF THERE WERE ONE, THEN
WOULD YOU SAY IT WOULD BE

01:22:26.210 --> 01:22:29.280
TREATED UNDER A DIFFERENT
STANDARD I TAKE IT?

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.910
NOT WISHING TO ALIENATE
A POTENTIAL ALLY,

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.830
OR TO MAKE A CONCESION
THAT COULD HARM HER

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:36.150
CASE, GINSBURG RELENTED.

01:22:36.150 --> 01:22:38.930
IF THERE WERE SUCH A
STATUTE, SHE WOULD RESERVE

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:41.540
JUDGMENT ON WHAT THE
STANDARD WOULD BE.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:47.070
BUT SHE REPEATED SHE HAD YET
TO COME ACROSS SUCH A STATUTE.

01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:49.020
THE JUSTICES WHO
WERE ASKING THESE

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:51.700
QUESTIONS WERE VERY SMART MEN.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.520
THEIR INABILITY
TO COMPREHEND WHAT

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:57.160
WOULD STRIKE MOST OF US TODAY
AS A FAIRLY SELF EVIDENT POINT

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.450
SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT THE
CHALLENGES THAT SOCIAL REFORM

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:04.380
LAWYERS FACE IN CONFRONTING
THE DEEPLY ROOTED IDEOLOGIES

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:08.461
THAT MAKE A SYSTEM OF OPPRESSION
SEEM JUST AND NATURAL.

01:23:08.461 --> 01:23:10.960
I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SOME
OF THE CHALLENGES THAT GINSBURG

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.630
FACED IN COURT OF CONVINCING
MALE JUSTICES AS WHY SEX

01:23:14.630 --> 01:23:17.870
CLASSIFICATIONS WERE HARMFUL TO
WOMEN AND AS SHE WOULD WANT ME

01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:19.500
TO ADD TO MEN AS WELL.

01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.030
BUT NOW I WANT TO TURN TO
ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE JOB

01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:23.990
OF SOCIAL REFORM LITIGATORS.

01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:26.220
WE TEND TO THINK OF
LAWYERS AS PEOPLE

01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:29.500
WHO GO INTO COURT IN
PURSUANCE OF A LEGAL CLAIM.

01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.920
BUT IN SOME WAYS THE
MOST IMPORTANT JOB

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.690
OF THE SOCIAL REFORM
LITIGATOR DOES NOT TAKE

01:23:34.690 --> 01:23:36.580
PLACE IN THE COURTROOM AT ALL.

01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:38.720
THE STRATEGY OF THE
WOMEN'S RIGHTS PROJECT,

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:43.190
WHICH GINSBURG HEAD IN THE 1970S
INCLUDED NOT JUST LITIGATING

01:23:43.190 --> 01:23:46.870
CASES, BUT ALSO LOBBYING
LEGISLATURES, TRAINING LAWYERS,

01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:49.120
AND EDUCATING THE
GENERAL PUBLIC ABOUT

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.760
ISSUES OF SEX DISCRIMINATION.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:56.400
GINSBURG AND THE WRP OFFERED
ASSISTANCE TO ACLU AFFILIATES

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.470
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
WHO WERE ENGAGING

01:23:58.470 --> 01:24:00.600
IN SEX DISCRIMINATION
LITIGATTION.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:04.080
SHE ADVISED THEM ON
PRIORITIES AND THE WRP SERVED

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.370
AS A CLEARINGHOUSE
FOR INFORMATION,

01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:09.780
BOTH ABOUT PENDING SEX
DISCRIMINATION CASES AND ABOUT

01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:12.250
LAWYERS WHO WERE WILLING
TO HELP OUT WITH THEM.

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:15.110
AFTER HER LEGAL VICTORIES,
GINSBURG WOULD WRITE MEMOS

01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:17.840
TO ACLU AFFILIATES
INSTRUCTING THEM ON HOW

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:21.380
TO PURSUE FOLLOW UP LITIGATION
AND LEGISLATIVE LOBBYING.

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:23.220
GINSBURG DEVOTED
AT LEAST AS MUCH

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:27.090
OF HER TIME TO EDUCATING PEOPLE
ABOUT SEX DISCRIMINATION AS SHE

01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:30.320
DID LITIGATING SEX
EQUALITY CASES.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.150
WHEN HER FEMALE
STUDENTS AT RUTGERS

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:36.100
LAW SCHOOL IN THE 1960S
ASKED FOR A SEMINAR ON WOMEN

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:39.590
AND THE LAW, GINSBURG SPENT A
MONTH IN THE LIBRARY READING

01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:42.410
EVERY COURT DECISION
AND LAW REVIEW ARTICLE

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:45.660
ON THE SUBJECT SHE
COULD FIND, WHICH

01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:48.040
SHE REPORTS WAS NOT A
VERY TAXING ENDEAVOR,

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.230
GIVEN HOW LITTLE THERE WAS.

01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:52.730
THEN SHE INITIATED
SUCH A COURSE AND WITH

01:24:52.730 --> 01:24:55.200
TWO OF HER COLLEAGUES SHE PUT
TOGETHER ONE OF THE NATION'S

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:58.010
FIRST CASE BOOKS ON
WOMEN AND THE LAW.

01:24:58.010 --> 01:25:00.830
SHE ALSO WROTE NUMEROUS
LAW REVIEW ARTICLES

01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:02.820
ON SEX DISCRIMINATION
LITIGATION,

01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:05.500
AND SHE MAINTAINED A STEADY
STREAM OF CORRESPONDENCE,

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:08.470
WHICH STUDENT LAW REVIEW
EDITORS, URGING THEM TO WRITE

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.830
ABOUT RACE AND SEX
DISCRIMINATION CASES, EDUCATING

01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:14.940
THEM ABOUT THE ISSUES, AND
PROVIDING THEM WITH BRIEFS

01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:17.890
AND OTHER MATERIALS TO
ENHANCE THEIR SCHOLARSHIP.

01:25:17.890 --> 01:25:21.200
AND SHE TRAVELED AROUND THE
COUNTRY TESTIFYING BEFORE

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:24.120
LEGISLATURES IN SUPPORT OF
THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.440
AND SPEAKING TO ACLU AFFILIATES
AND UNIVERSITY AUDIENCES ABOUT

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:30.300
ISSUES OF SEX EQUALITY.

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:33.750
SHE WAS AN ORGANIZER, A
MOBILIZER, A PUBLICIST

01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:36.600
AND AN EDUCATOR FOR THE
SEX EQUALITY MOVEMENT,

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.070
MUCH AS THURGOOD MARSHALL
HAD BEEN FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS

01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:41.560
MOVEMENT A GENERATION EARLIER.

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.850
WHLE DOING ALL THESE THINGS THE
SOCIAL REFORM LITIGATOR ALSO

01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:48.540
HAS TO FACE THE DAY TO DAY
CHALLENGES POSED BY AN UNJUST

01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:51.380
STATUS QUO THAT THEY'RE
LITIGATING AGAINST.

01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:53.630
WHEN ARGUING RACE
DISCRIMINATION CASES

01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:57.180
IN THE SUPREME COURT
IN THE 1930S AND 1940S,

01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:00.360
THURGOOD MARSHALL HAD A HARD
TIME FINDING A RESTAURANT TO

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.490
EAT AT IN THE
THOROUGHLY SEGREGATED

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.220
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:06.860
GINS BURG FACED A SIMILAR
CHALLENGE AS CAPTURED

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.520
IN A STORY SHE TELLS
FROM THIS TIME PERIOD.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:12.030
NOW REMEMBER, SHE'S A TENURED
PROFESSOR AT COLUMBIA LAW

01:26:12.030 --> 01:26:13.930
SCHOOL, SHE'S HEAD
OF THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS

01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:16.110
PROJECT, SHE'S A
SUPREME COURT LITIGATOR

01:26:16.110 --> 01:26:19.710
AND A FREQUENT WITNESS ACRSS THE
COUNTRY ON BEHALF OF THE ERA.

01:26:19.710 --> 01:26:22.750
BUT SHE'S ALSO RECEIVING
REPEATED PHONE CALLS AT HER

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:25.900
OFFICE ABOUT HER SON JAMES
WHO IS THEN TEN YEARS

01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:29.350
OLD WHO IS ACTING UP AT SCHOOL
IN THE WAY 10 YEAR OLDS ARE

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:30.690
WANT TO DO.

01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:34.090
FINALY EXASPERATED AT THE
REPEATED PHONE CALLS GINSBURG

01:26:34.090 --> 01:26:36.880
RESPONDED TO ONE
OF THEM AS FOLLOWS.

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.400
THIS CHILD HAS TWO PARENTS.

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:42.150
I SUGGEST FROM NOW ON
YOU ALTERNATE BETWEEN

01:26:42.150 --> 01:26:45.130
THEM WHEN YOU NEED TO SPEAK
TO SOMEONE ABOUT JAMES.

01:26:45.130 --> 01:26:48.122
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:58.360
GINSBURG REPORTS THAT EVEN
THOUGH JAMES' BEHAVIOR DID NOT

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:01.190
MATERIALLY IMPROVE,
THE PHONE CALL CEASED

01:27:01.190 --> 01:27:02.760
BECAUSE THE SCHOOL
WOULD NOT DREAM

01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:08.940
OF BOTHERING A BUSY MALE TAX
ATTORNEY AT HIS OFFICE DURING

01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.490
WORKING HOURS.

01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:13.560
SOCIAL REFORM LAWYERS NOT
ONLY MOBILIZED PROTESTS,

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.700
THEY ALSO PROVIDE,
I'M ALMOST DONE,

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:19.490
VALUABLE ROLE MODELS FOR MEMBERS
OF TRADITIONALLY SUBORDINATED

01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:20.220
GROUPS.

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.960
IN 1960 OF COURSE, THERE
HAD NEVER BEEN A WOMAN

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.710
ON THE UNITED STATES
SUPREME COURT.

01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:27.720
THERE HAD BEEN ONLY TWO
OR THREE FEDERAL FEMALE

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.020
JUDGES IN THE HISTORY
OF THE COUNTRY.

01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:33.230
IN THE LATE 1940S, PRESIDENT
HARRY TRUMAN APPARENTLY BRIEFLY

01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:36.390
CONSIDERED APPOINTING A WOMAN
TO THE SUPREME COURT, FLORENCE

01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:39.770
ALAN, WHO WAS SITTING ON THE 6TH
CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, BUT

01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:42.090
WHEN HE CONSULTED WITH
THE SITTING JUSTICES,

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:45.760
APPARENTLY THAT WAS A MISTAKE,
THEY URGED AGAINST DOING SO,

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.790
APPARENTLY THEIR CONCERN WAS
THAT HER PRESENCE WOULD INHIBIT

01:27:48.790 --> 01:27:52.520
THEM FROM TAKING OFF THEIR TIES
AND KICKING UP THEIR FEET AT

01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.450
CONFERENCE.

01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:55.850
IN THE MID 1960S,
WOMEN WERE ONLY

01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:58.450
ABOUT 1% OF SUPREME
COURT LITIGATORS.

01:27:58.450 --> 01:28:01.480
LESS THAN 2% OF THE
NATION'S LAW PROFESSORS.

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:04.720
JUSTICE GINSBURG DID NOT HAVE A
SINGLE FEMALE PROFESSOR DURING

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.470
HER THREE YEARS OF LAW SCHOOL.

01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:09.620
NOT UNTIL 1970, IF
YOU CAN BELIEVE THIS,

01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:12.680
DID THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
OF LAW SCHOOLS AMMEND ITS RULES

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.900
TO BAR SEX DISCRIMINATION
AT MEMBER INSTITUTIONS

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:18.390
AND AS OF THAT YEAR
WOMEN WERE ONLY

01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:21.840
ABOUT 10% OF LAW
SCHOOL STUDENT BODIES.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.600
GINSBURG APPRECIATED
THE IMPORTANCE

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.970
OF FEMALE LAWYERS PARTICIPATING
IN SEX EQUALITY CASES.

01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:30.630
WHEN SHE LEARNED OF THE ACLU'S
INVOLVEMENT AND WHAT TURNED OUT

01:28:30.630 --> 01:28:33.010
TO BE THE SUPREME COURT'S
LANDMARK SEX EQUALITY

01:28:33.010 --> 01:28:35.370
DECISION IN 1971.

01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:38.150
SHE ASKED THE ORGANIZATION'S
LEGAL DIRECTOR WHETHER

01:28:38.150 --> 01:28:41.510
A WOMAN OUGHT NOT TO BE INVOLVED
AS CO-COUNCIL IN THE CASE.

01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:44.130
HE AGREED AND OFFERED
HER TO JOIN HIM.

01:28:44.130 --> 01:28:48.970
IN WRP LITIGATION WOMEN'S RIGHTS
PROJECTS LITIGATION GINSBURG

01:28:48.970 --> 01:28:51.320
LATER NOTED,
PARTICULAR ATTENTION

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:54.320
WAS GIVEN TO ENCOURAGING
PARTICIPATION BY WOMEN LAWYERS

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.210
WHO SEEK ASSISTANCE IN
MAINTAINING THEIR SKILLS DURING

01:28:57.210 --> 01:28:59.720
PERIODS WHEN FAMILY
RESPONSIBILITIES PREVENT

01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:02.100
THEM FROM WORKING FULL TIME.

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.940
GINSBURG'S LEADERSHIP
OF THE WRP AND HER ORAL

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.410
ADVOCACY IN THE UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT WERE

01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:09.940
INSPIRATIONAL TO
COUNTLESS WOMEN.

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:12.170
SHE HERSELF NEVER FAILED
TO HIGHLIGHT THE COUNTLESS

01:29:12.170 --> 01:29:15.410
CONTRIBUTIONS OF PAST
GENERATIONS OF FEMINISTS TO HER

01:29:15.410 --> 01:29:16.250
OWN WORK.

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:19.070
IN HER BRIEF IN THE COURT'S
LANDMARK SEX DISCRIMINATION

01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:22.840
CASE, SHE PLACED THE NAMES OF
TRAILBLAZING FEMINISTS DOROTHY

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:25.510
KENYON AND PAULI MURRAY
ON THE TITLE PAGE

01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:29.230
AS A SYMBOLIC ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF
THE INTELLECTUAL DEBT OWED TO

01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:31.510
THEM BY CONTEMPORARY FEMINISTS.

01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:34.020
AND LATER AS A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE SHE WROTE NUMEROUS

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.260
ARTICLES DESCRIBING
THE CONTRIBUTION

01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:39.420
OF PIONEERING FEMINIST
LAWYERS AND JUDGES, AS WELL

01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:42.160
AS THE WIVES OF
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.180
MANY SOCIAL REFORM
ACTIVISTS DO NOT LIVE TO

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:47.960
SEE THE DAY THAT THEIR
DREAMS ARE REALIZED.

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:51.780
MANY OF THE FIRST GENERATION OF
ABOLITIONISTS DID NOT SURVIVE

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:55.010
TO SEE THE ENACTMENT OF THE 13TH
AMENDMENT ENDING OF SLAVERY.

01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:58.530
AND SUSAN B. ANTHONY AND
ELIZABETH CADY STANTON DID NOT

01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:01.960
LIVE TO SEE THE ENACTMENT OF
THE 19TH AMENDMENT ENFRANCHISING

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:02.750
WOMEN.

01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:05.160
JUSTICE GINSBURG, OF
COURSE, HAS NOT ONLY LIVED

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:07.870
TO SEE THE ENORMOUS
CHANGES IN SEX EQUALITY,

01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:11.250
BUT HAS HELPED TO BRING THEM
ABOUT AS A SUPREME COURT

01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:15.910
JUSTICE AS IN HER LANDMARK
DECISION 20 YEARS AGO REQUIRING

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:19.320
