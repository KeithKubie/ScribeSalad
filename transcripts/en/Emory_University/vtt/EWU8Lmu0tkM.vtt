00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.070
So a major interest that we have in our
lab is understanding immunological memory

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.430
to the infections that we have gotten as
children or even as adults or the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.590
vaccines that we get as children immunological memory is the ability of the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.470
immune system to respond much faster
upon re-exposure to the same pathogen

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.270
and that's the basis of vaccination so
if you get as a child you get a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.140
polio vaccine or a measles or mumps
vaccination and you're protected from

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.430
that disease for many many years
sometimes for life and the reason for

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.500
that is because you've got memory you've
got t-cells and b-cells that recognize

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.359
that pathogen and will protect you
immediately upon re-exposure to that

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:56.640
pathogen so our lab has been interested
understanding how long-term immune

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.480
memory or immunologic memory is
maintained after either infection or

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.760
vaccination so what we'll cover in our
in my presentation today are four things

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.670
first I'll talk to you about logical
memory then I'll talk to you about in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.950
particular the properties of memory
t-cells

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.790
what makes memory t-cells do what they
do which is protect us from infections

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.790
or in rapidly respond so a something
about the properties of memory t-cells

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.280
and then I will switch to what for us
was a very exciting line of research

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.420
which is what happens if there's a
chronic infection so start with them

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.280
logical memory then talk about
functional memory t-cells you get after

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.600
an acute infection or vaccination and
then tell you about what happens if

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.880
there is a chronic persistent antigenic
stimulus as you have during chronic

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.920
infections or in the conditions of a
cancer with the constant stimulation met

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.990
humor antigen and then I'll tell you
about a inhibitory receptor that

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.640
actually results in dysfunction of these
t-cells during a chronic infection or in

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.660
a tumor setting so it's like a break
that comes on and keeps them from being

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.670
functional and then I'll talk to you
about how you can restore function in

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.460
these cells by releasing that
that break and then I'll end by the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.110
clinical implications in treatment of
cancer of using the PD one directed

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.710
immunotherapy

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.970
so what I shared with you today
some studies that we have done on

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.150
understanding t-cells memory in
particular cytotoxic CD8 t-cells memory T

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.129
cells are composed of two major subsets
the CD4 t-cells which provide help for

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.700
antibody responses predominantly and
then you have CD8 t-cells these are T

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.290
cells that recognize infected cells and
can kill these infected cells

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.799
a CD8 t-cell is the best mechanism that
we have are the best soldiers that we

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.209
have to eliminate either virally
infected cells or tumor cells so this is

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.430
a very important way of eliminating your
infected cells the CD8 t-cells can

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.560
actually they will attach to the
infected cell or to the tumor cell they

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.510
do this because the t-cell receptor will
recognize peptides they can either be

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.040
tumor antigen peptides or they can be
peptides coming from the virus for

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.290
example if the cell is infected with HIV
there will be peptides from the HIV

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.790
virus which are expressed
presented by MHC class 1 molecules on

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.609
the cell surface so here you've got a
piece of the bar a peptide sticking on

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.590
the surface of the infected cell you've
got a t-cell which recognizes that

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.829
particular peptide presented by the MHC
class 1 molecule that interaction will

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.950
result in that t-cell then killing that
infected cell and so the CD8 t-cells are

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.950
referred to as cytotoxic CD8 t-cells or
CD8 t-cells are these difference so when

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.090
I talk now in for the next 15 minutes or
so I will use these terms

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.630
interchangeably I might say CTL and I
might say CD8 t-cell but it's the same

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.359
thing a cell that can kill that
eliminate a virally infected cell so we

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:28.710
use this mouse model of acute infection
to study the properties of memory CD8 T

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.520
cells and what we found was that memory
CD8 t-cells basically can live for the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.620
life of the mouse after vaccination or
after the infection is cleared and we

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.729
have then extended these studies in
humans and shown that people who got the

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:48.690
smallpox vaccine even 78 years ago
have memory CD8 t-cells that recognize

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.420
that the smallpox virus so long-term T
cell memories maintained not only in

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.340
mice but also in humans and can last for
literally 50 years or longer so you get

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.990
D so then the question was how are these
t-cells maintained and work that we did

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.330
along with other people showed that the
t-cells are maintained two ways one they

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.520
are actually intrinsically very
long-lived

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.770
they can live for many many years and
most of the time they're just very quiet

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.700
they're not dividing there's a setting
Esquires themselves likewise sent I mean

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.980
they're not replicating or dividing the
sitting as a cell that's in a g0 g1

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.800
phase but they also undergo what we and
others have termed a homeostatic

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.030
proliferation that is they have a stem
cell like property where they can

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.080
self-renew
so every few months in a mouse and every

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.550
few years in a human the it there's a
capacity of these cells to self renew

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.110
they will undergo another division to
maintain the numbers so there's a slow

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.520
attrition or death of these cells
there's also a slow birth of these cells

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.740
that maintains numbers at fairly
constant levels for many many years so

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.490
this is one intrinsic property of a
memory t-cells it can self renew itself

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.360
and that's how it's maintained for such
a long period the other very interesting

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:13.500
property of memory t-cells is that when
they now see the infecting pathogen -

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.860
what the which they were they can
recognize they make a very rapid

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.820
effector response and we're dealing here
with cytotoxic CD8 t-cells so even

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.100
though this memory cell is very looks
like a very quiet cell sitting without

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:36.210
any replication as soon as it sees the
invading pathogen to which it which it

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.470
can recognize it very rapidly elaborates
effector function and what I mean by

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.540
effector function is that it can now
very rapidly kill that cell so a memory

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.820
cell has two properties which are very
different from that of a naive so there

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.390
is one that has not gotten this program
of being a memory cell one it's much

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.010
longer lived intrinsically it has the
capability of the soma static

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.419
proliferate
to maintain its numbers and it has the

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.099
ability to elaborate effector function
very rapidly and that's the basis that's

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:13.349
the cellular basis of memory by CD8
t-cells so while we were doing these for

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:18.180
many years my lab has been interested in
this question for almost 30 years now I

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.410
was at UCLA when we first started these
studies and then I moved to Emory

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.479
University in 1995 and for the last 20
years we have been continuing these

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:31.470
fundamental Studies on t-cell memory
both in animal models and in humans and

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.430
obviously these have a lot of
implications in terms of optimizing and

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.659
developing different vaccines

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:50.390
it's also one of the challenges in
research is how do you pick a topic how

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:56.570
do you pick a model what I think here
that the key thing is you should ask an

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.590
important question you should ask a
question that a lot of people are

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:07.010
interested in they should ask a question
that has broad implications and that's I

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.180
think we were lucky I was or I should
say I was the kid that when I started my

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.620
lab I asked a question that perhaps was
a good question to ask and the question

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.930
I asked was how do you maintain a
logical memory to an infection you got

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.460
or a vaccine you got 20 years ago or 30
years ago in 50 years ago how does this

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:30.620
memory maintain so I think the question
was a very good one but then you Sefton

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.900
that but the next stage is how do you
study that question and I would the

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.920
advice I would give is pick a model
where you can really study the question

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.790
the way you can really dissect it you
can understand it in some detail so we

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:49.310
again I think made a good choice we
picked a mouse model sometimes people

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.730
don't like what you learn from mice and
they not everything you learn they're

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.480
extrapolates into humans but still I
think if you ask the right question do

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.060
it well those discoveries won't hold as
you move up towards human studies again

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.810
so we picked a mouse model and why you
pick that particular mouse model we

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.250
picked it because that was a natural
this virus that we used which because F

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:16.640
CMV is a natural pathogen of mice it in
fact it's you can find wild mice in the

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.760
nature which are infected with this of
course we were not working with those

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.290
mice we're working with mice in the lab
that we infected with LCM B but the

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:32.840
reason I emphasize the there it's a
mouse virus is pathogens evolve with its

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.490
own host so when if you're studying a
mouse virus in a mouse you re looking at

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:44.180
the interaction between a virus and its
natural host and this is a much better

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:49.190
than sticking a human virus that doesn't
replicate in my saw replicates poorly so

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:54.350
if you want to discover fundamentals of
immune responses do it with a natural

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.550
host natural
pathogen and the virus that will

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.420
replicate efficiently and give you the
all the things that you need to study in

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.470
terms of viral infections so I think
it's picking the model and then you ask

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.579
the right questions in this case it was
you know I should right that's questions

00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:14.980
I should say you should then study what
you want to look at in as much detail as

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.500
you can and again the mouse model allows
you to do this in this particular one

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.370
reagents were available for analyzing
the t-cells reagents were available to

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:29.139
look at what the virus was contributing
so it was a well-defined model for

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:33.190
studying immune responses to two
borrowed infection and then it's

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:38.319
interesting how science moves forward it
depends on how technology is being

00:10:38.319 --> 00:10:43.620
developed so our lab was never
developing new technology we were real

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.050
immunologists more I would say
biologists fear viola just asking

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:52.839
biological questions we are not we were
not creating any tools and any reagents

00:10:52.839 --> 00:10:57.009
but others where the science moves
forward because many people do many

00:10:57.009 --> 00:11:00.639
great things so we were greatly helped
in many different things so I mentioned

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:04.269
to you that we did this gene expression
profiling

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:08.769
of course that we didn't develop them
but those tools became available tools

00:11:08.769 --> 00:11:13.389
became available worked in other places
in terms of looking at at the

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:18.490
appropriate single cell assays developed
to look at expression of different

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.810
cytokines so the techniques and reagents
that develop one of the most important

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:30.069
reason that was developed Baxley was
worked at john altman who's a faculty

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:33.399
member at emory vaccine center did when
he was at stanford university as a

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:38.589
postdoc and that was the development of
these MHC class when tetramers these are

00:11:38.589 --> 00:11:43.930
reagents that you can use to identify
specifically t-cells reacting against

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:49.389
different viruses so this development of
the tetra Murray agent greatly helped in

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:54.310
the analysis that we did so my advice
there is that as you ask the right

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.329
question pick the right model and be
aware of all the wonderful technology

00:11:58.329 --> 00:12:03.250
that's developing around you because you
have to apply then the state-of-the-art

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:07.839
techniques no matter who's developed it
you don't need to be an expert in it you

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:10.240
just bring the technique in
to your lab or you collaborate with

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.470
those people and move it

00:12:19.209 --> 00:12:24.930
what happens if instead of day
infection or a good vaccine that gives

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.700
you this long lived memory responses
what will happen if you have a

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.440
persistent infection that is you have a
chronic infection like you have in HIV

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.690
or hepatitis B virus infection or
hepatitis C virus infection or you would

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:45.149
have in many tumors because the tumor
antigen is there continuously so in an

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:49.589
acute infection setting where the t-cell
is stimulated for a short period it gets

00:12:49.589 --> 00:12:54.089
all the right cues and gets all the
right buttons are pushed so you generate

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:59.010
these highly functional memory cells
what would happen if that antigen does

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.380
not disappear and continues to stimulate
the t-cell

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:10.700
we made the discovery that t-cells are
functionally exhausted it was known look

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.839
that actually we had done and many other
people had done is that if there is a

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:20.690
chronic infection and you look at you
tried to measure a t-cell or even

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.140
sometimes Abby's ever certainly when try
to measure a t-cell response against

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.370
that particular chronic infection you
couldn't detect those cells by

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:33.170
functional assays and because that were
the only asset available and the

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:37.850
assumption was that either the t-cells
are not there or they were never

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:44.839
generated so the fact that there was a
decreased immune response against a

00:13:44.839 --> 00:13:50.000
chronic pathogen was known in fact we
had published a paper on this many years

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.910
back in the 1980s but the basis for that
this non-responsiveness was not known

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.810
and most people had assumed that the T
cells were not there that they were

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:08.660
deleted in fact that was a favorite
hypotheses that that you delete antigen

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.220
reactive t-cells or self reactive T
cells in the thymus and they also you

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.600
have really this kernel deletion and you
don't have the t-cells or this or the

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.459
virus did something to inhibit the
generation of this t-cell response so

00:14:22.459 --> 00:14:27.830
immune suppression by the virus to
inhibit the response or the deletion of

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:32.360
these cells made the two major
mechanisms for not being able to control

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.350
a chronic infection and that of course
also extended to the tumor setting so we

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:42.830
then again modeled these studies in in
the mouse model that we use to study the

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:48.260
good memory cell generation so when and
then we got a very interesting result we

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.930
found that when there is a chronic
antigenic stimulation the t-cells

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:59.240
actually get functionally exhausted and
and that was a paradigm shift because

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.080
the if the t-cells are there that means
you can try and fix things if they're

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.170
dead there's nothing you can do if they
were not generated there's not a whole

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:10.279
lot that you can do so that was a
paradigm shift in terms of showing that

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:14.150
the t-cells are physically present but
they're dysfunctional so the t-cells are

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.060
physically present but now they're no
longer able

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:24.360
kill the infected target cell they are
no longer able to secrete cytokines

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.680
which have antiviral activities both the
cytokine ability the ability secrete

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.520
cytokines which have antiviral effect
that's lost as well as the ability to

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.050
kill the cells as lost and also their
ability to proliferate and expand

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.970
greatly after antigen stimulation is
lost so we define so this ours was the

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.590
first group to define this t-cell
exhaustion this was a paper we published

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.330
in 1998 actually this is a paper that
was published from Emory University

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.520
Alan's a AK who was a postdoc in the lab
made this discovery that t-cells are

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.220
present but they are dysfunctional and
are functionally exhausted yes one of

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.500
the one of the joys I should say of
science is that if you kind of make an

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:13.200
interesting discovery and then see how
it moves forward so for us the t-cell

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:17.070
exhaustion part that Alan say Acme were
really there was excitement in the lab

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:22.560
that we had made this discovery and
allowing the possibility of maybe fixing

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.430
these cells and then when Dan Barbara
did really that but I think with truly

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:32.220
seminal experiments with the blockade
there was huge huge excitement in the

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.900
lab dan was really excited everyone in
the lab was excited that we could do

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.920
something so simple whoo the experiment
was very very simple we had a

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.380
chronically infected mouse and all Dan
did was he injected some antibody to the

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:52.350
mouse very unsophisticated experiment
that anybody could do that's the single

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:57.540
injection and then the result really was
quite was quite striking after we

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:03.510
reported the finding that t-cells become
functionally exhausted during chronic

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:08.520
stimulation in this mouse model several
other investigators at other places and

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.220
also at Emory University showed that the
same finding of t-cell exhaustion occurs

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.640
in human infections so it was then shown
that people who are infected with HIV

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:25.110
have HIV specific CD8 t-cells in their
blood that you can easily detect that

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.179
even in their lymph nodes when some limb
from biopsies

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:33.010
but they are not able to kill the target
self so they become dysfunctional other

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:37.539
investigators showed the same thing in
chronic hepatitis C virus infection

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:41.860
hepatitis B virus infection so that
became very quickly established that

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:47.740
human chronic viral infections like HIV
HCV HPV which have very high levels of

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.090
antigen high levels of virus and persist
for the life of the individual unless

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:56.220
they get treated with appropriate drugs
okay you get this t-cell dysfunction

00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:02.289
also people at around the same time who
were working in cancer models t were

00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:06.100
models in mice showed the same thing
they showed that there is t-cell

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:11.020
dysfunction in the t-cells that
infiltrate the tumor these cells are

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.460
referred to as tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes tells as the abbreviation

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.140
that's used so it was shown that tails
also have this t-cell dysfunction

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:26.500
because of the chronic stimulation by
the tumor antigens and then oncologists

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.370
who were working with human cancer
patients found the same thing so this

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:35.350
phenomenon of t-cell exhaustion which
was first described in this mouse model

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:40.990
of that we use sa virus called
lymphocytic Korea meningitis virus you

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:45.399
don't need to know worry about what the
name is and what it does it can infect

00:18:45.399 --> 00:18:48.970
humans it has its really of not.but
significance there is a wonderful mouse

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.049
model to study many different aspects
billion systems so these studies which

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:58.360
came out of this LC MB mouse model of
t-cell exhaustion we quickly extended

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:05.399
into human cancer t-cells and in human
chronic viral infections

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:14.600
the next question was what is the
mechanism of this t-cell exhaustion why

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:19.670
are these t-cells not able to kill the
target cells why they're not able to do

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.540
what the good memory central so the
contrast here was with the highly

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:28.550
functional memory cells with the
dysfunctional cells and the chronic

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:36.980
infection so what we then decided to do
was that we said let us look at the gene

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:42.170
expression profiling of a highly
functional memory cell and compare it to

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:48.050
that of the highly dysfunctional cell
and the system that we used allowed us

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:54.080
to take t-cells of the same specificity
and what I mean by that is it's a t-cell

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.000
which has a t-cell receptor but sees the
same peptide from the virus that we're

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.320
studying but one was under the
conditions of an acute infection and the

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.160
cells are highly functional another is
under conditions of the chronic

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.400
infection where the cells are
dysfunctional so we're not comparing

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.870
apples and oranges we'd be comparing
different flavors of the same fruit and

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:21.250
so we looked at the 20,000 plus genes
which are expressed by these cells and

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:26.210
we found that there were some striking
differences in the gene expression

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.080
profiling of the exhausted cells
compared to the functional cells and

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.100
there are many many differences but what
we were struck with and that was the

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.000
thing that really was the most
differentially expressed between these

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.670
two cells where was the expression of
inhibitory receptors so there are

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:49.160
inhibitory receptors that a cell can
express and these intimate receptors

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.050
actually inhibit t-cell receptor
signaling t-cell receptor is what

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:59.390
recognizes the tumor cell or the
infected cell and it's signaling to the

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:06.010
t-cell receptors needed for the cell to
then kill the target cell so these are

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:11.360
inhibit receptors that come up and are
regulating that t-cell receptor and the

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:17.210
most striking receptor that we
identified in terms of t-cell exhaustion

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:23.929
was a molecule called PD one PD one
strands for programmed cell death one

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:31.170
this was a gene that was cloned by
tasuku Hanzo in Japan in the early 1990s

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:37.380
Dean had been around for a long time but
its function in terms of chronic

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.720
infections its function in terms of
t-cell exhaustion was not normal so our

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:49.070
studies identified that this molecule
was expressed at very high levels on

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:54.750
these dysfunctional or exhausted CD8
t-cells but then what really clinched

00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:00.600
the deal here was in a collaborative
study with gordon freeman who's a

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.059
scientist at dana-farber Cancer
Institute at Harvard Medical School

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:12.030
Gordon Freeman had antibodies that could
bind the inhibitory receptor and the way

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:17.700
the municipal works is that the speedy
one will bind to a ligand that's either

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:23.250
on the tumor cell or on the infected
cell this ligand is known as PD n1l

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.090
standing for lanyons it's a it's a
molecule that will bind the inhibitory

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:32.400
receptor so what Gordon had made was
antibodies that would either bind the

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.350
inhibitory receptor or the ligand and
prevent the block interaction between

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:42.000
these two so if you prevent interaction
of the PD one which is on the t-cell the

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.679
PDL one which is on your target cell if
that interaction is blocked then the

00:22:46.679 --> 00:22:51.120
inhibition does not happen and the
results we got were really quite

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:56.760
striking we showed that if you take a
chronically infected Mouse and you

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.440
infuse this Mouse to inject into these
mice antibody either against the

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:06.420
inhibitory receptor or against the
ligand disrupting that inhibitor

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.679
interaction suddenly now you restore
function back in the cells the cells

00:23:10.679 --> 00:23:15.480
begin to expand because they have the
TCR stimulation they are able to kill

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.650
the virally infected cells secrete
antiviral cytokines and most importantly

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.230
bring about a reduction of the viral
load so this was the first demonstration

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:30.150
that this blockade of the speedy one
pathway in vivo and the condition

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:33.960
electronic infection will restore
function back into the t-cells and

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.919
result in viral in
control of the viral infection so this

00:23:37.919 --> 00:23:42.630
finding had a huge impact this work was
done actually by a graduate student at

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:47.970
Emory University then Barbara what what
happens not antigen disappears and this

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:52.320
paper attractive does not recipient
continues Force Unleashed so before we

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:58.860
six immediately there was a flurry of
papers that came and some of those B

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.360
were involved in collaborating with our
friends showing that BB one also is

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:09.779
involved in inhibiting HIV specific
t-cells and this was a study we did with

00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:13.980
Bruce while what could happen that
antigen design then in studies that we

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.669
did at embryos that's not busy who's a
faculty member at the Emory vaccine

00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:23.130
Center are assured that the same thing
happens in HCV infected people people

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:26.880
who are chronically in trade with
hepatitis C virus do have CD8 t-cells

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.330
that recognize HCV but they have very
high levels of pd-1

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:36.529
on on their cell surface and that
inhibits the function of those t-cells

00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:40.139
others showed the same thing with
hepatitis B and so on so basically is

00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:44.940
very quickly established not that t-cell
exhaustion as I told you happens in many

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:49.139
chronic infections but now it has also
shown that a major regulator of the

00:24:49.139 --> 00:24:53.909
t-cell exhaustion is this inhibitory
receptor pd-1 and that blockade of this

00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:57.929
interaction results in functioning in
those cells so think of it as a break

00:24:57.929 --> 00:25:03.419
that's coming on the t-cells so that the
t-cell receptor you're pressing so

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:07.049
you're pressing the accelerator because
there's antigen stimulation but the

00:25:07.049 --> 00:25:11.549
break is on so basically nothing nothing
happens and releasing pd-1 is releasing

00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:14.779
a break on the t-cells

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.120
and people who were working in tumor
systems also made the similar

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:28.340
observation that vd1 is a major target
in on the tills

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:32.600
these tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
that get into the tumor but cannot kill

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.860
the tumor have very high levels of pd-1
then there was a lot of interest in

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:43.220
extending these in vivo experiments to
from mice into non-human primates and so

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.590
on so actually we did a study with rama
mara who's also a faculty member at the

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:53.630
mini vaccine center and rama showed that
if you give an infusion of this blocking

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:58.100
antibody to monkeys that were infected
with SIV SIV

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.750
stands for simian immunodeficiency virus
it's a cousin of HIV and basically it's

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:08.120
the HIV virus of monkeys and what Rama
in his called his group showed is that

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.280
if you block auntie pd-1 PDL an
interaction non-human primates you get

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.020
an increase in the function of the SIV
specific t-cells and a reduction of the

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:23.990
virus and these in these monkeys in a
collaboration we did with with a group

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.520
in Ohio with Chris Walker
we showed the same thing in the HCV

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:33.680
model of chimpanzees that's really the
only model for HCV that that can be done

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:37.930
and then Chris showed the same thing
happening in HCV infected chimpanzees

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:42.590
and as I mentioned a lot of people
working in tumor models showed the same

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:47.960
thing and then what has been quite
amazing to see is the very very very

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.550
rapid advances that have happened in
terms of clinical trials of pd-1

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:58.790
in cancer patients this of course is not
our work it's we don't work on in cancer

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.780
models we actually never even worked on
a mouse cancer model okay but the real

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:08.480
benefit of pd-1 and the progress has
been quite remarkable has happened in

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.370
the last four three or four years and
these studies have been led by many

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:18.710
major pharmaceutical industries but
three in particular Merck bristol-myers

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:24.890
Squibb and Genentech these three big
pharmaceutical companies have developed

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:30.599
anti pd-1 antibodies and also anti PDL
one antibodies I told you both in a

00:27:30.599 --> 00:27:34.739
do the same thing they block this
inhibitory interaction and release the

00:27:34.739 --> 00:27:41.279
brake on the t-cell and the results have
been quite promising PT 1 blockade has

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:46.159
been shown to be effective in both phase
1 and phase 2 clinical trials for

00:27:46.159 --> 00:27:52.649
multiple different cancers in particular
from melanoma and for lung cancer in

00:27:52.649 --> 00:28:00.679
particular lung cancer really had hardly
any if therapy was there in terms of

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:06.179
chemotherapy all of that was really not
not that effective but depending on but

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:13.009
the PD one has given promising results
in 15 to 20% of the treated people

00:28:13.009 --> 00:28:17.639
there's not a very large number of n but
when you go from basically no survival

00:28:17.639 --> 00:28:21.329
zero percent survival to 15 to 20
percent there's really quite a dramatic

00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:28.589
change in in the treatment of cancer and
within three or four years of these

00:28:28.589 --> 00:28:35.219
human clinical trials starting both
Merck and BMS have a licensed drug so

00:28:35.219 --> 00:28:40.709
pd-1 was licensed last year for melanoma
treatment actually fear and a half pack

00:28:40.709 --> 00:28:46.529
for melanoma and last year also for for
lung so this has been quite remarkable

00:28:46.529 --> 00:28:52.289
to see and I give this as an example for
how science should be done when we first

00:28:52.289 --> 00:28:58.349
started this path down this path making
years ago 2530 years ago really was

00:28:58.349 --> 00:29:02.399
interest was very simple we asked what
how do you maintain t-cell memory long

00:29:02.399 --> 00:29:06.959
term we were not thinking of cancer we
were not thinking of mean therapy that

00:29:06.959 --> 00:29:12.779
was completely out of are completely out
of our radar but these fundamental

00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:18.029
Studies on understanding t-cell memory
led to t-cell exhaustion the t-cell

00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:23.969
exhaustion led to the linking of pd-1
Berkeley cell exhaustion and then a

00:29:23.969 --> 00:29:28.469
potential therapy for the rescue of
those exhausted cells and that has very

00:29:28.469 --> 00:29:33.209
quickly brought really really work done
and the credit for this goes to the

00:29:33.209 --> 00:29:36.359
oncologist who took these clinical
trials in different places these

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:41.639
companies who move things very far
forward very quickly but essentially you

00:29:41.639 --> 00:29:46.309
now have drugs which are
effective in treating melanoma and also

00:29:46.309 --> 00:29:49.869
in treating lung cancer

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.920
in conclusion I would like to say that
this has been a fantastic journey for us

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:04.650
and the wonderful team of people that
I've had in my lab that's really for me

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:09.060
that's one of the best things to see
these people do great work and they're

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:14.400
gonna move on and set up their own labs
and flourish on their own and in terms

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:20.370
of where we are now in terms of
understanding t-cell exhaustion and

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:24.690
understanding how to restore function
back and in terms of clinic I think we

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:30.150
still have a ways to go because we would
want to be able to get much better

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:34.080
response rates in the cancer patients we
want to be sure that there is durability

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:39.810
of the treatment that they're getting so
here would require greater understanding

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:47.010
of the t-cell exhaustion mechanisms I
would say maybe beyond pd-1 you know

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:53.160
what can you do beyond pd-1 to take it
to even to the next stage combination

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.360
therapies where these are cytokines or
other inhibitory receptors or with

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.280
therapeutic vaccinations are
possibilities but there are other ways

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:08.900
also there is a work that we and others
are doing looking at the epigenetic

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:15.540
landscape of exhausted cells and could
we change basically the insides the PD

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.950
one actually is working at the outside
well inside can we change the chromatin

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:26.940
of the cell can we change the epigenetic
landscape of the cell so these are not

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.900
easy to do but there are ways of doing
this there are enzymes that methylate

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:35.850
for example the DNA that regulates gene
expression so one we have some

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:40.650
preliminary data that modulating some of
these methyl transferases will change

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:44.700
the function of the cells so there's
very exciting and challenging things

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:48.870
that can be done to what I would call
changing the insides of the cell so the

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:53.730
goal would be release the brake and
change the insides of the cell the next

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:58.710
stage now is that why don't why doesn't
everyone respond why is it only that the

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:02.790
rates are from melanoma rates actually
are quite high in a normal response to

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:07.110
that as high as 40 percent response rate
and eight-state melanoma

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:11.200
but then you ask her what about the
other 50% why don't find well they're

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.510
not responding I think this is far as
the next challenge

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:17.740
are there other inhibitory receptors
that need to be identified and the comp

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:23.980
the right combination try or do you need
to provide some other kinds of stimulus

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.900
to do you need to combine the PD one
blockade with the therapeutic vaccine

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.710
with the vaccine against the cancer
antigen so there's a very active area of

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:38.440
research many companies many groups and
we're also exploring these things and

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:44.830
how can you take it from being 30% 40%
out to 80% or 90% that's a very very

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:49.960
high bar but I think that's what the
goal will be for us and for all the

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.220
other people working in this in this
area the other question is and for this

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:59.710
we don't have the answer yet pd-1 has
only gone into cancer patients in the

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:03.730
last few years and as I mentioned to you
in lung cancer the response rates are

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:10.210
between 20% in that range for melanoma
about 40 50 percent range 40% range but

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:13.900
the question is so so instead of their
survival being 3 months now they're

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:17.590
still alive two years or three years but
the question is how long will be the

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.370
durability of this response well they
will the cancer again come back if it

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.100
come back what the thing would be so
they're two issues that need to be

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:29.410
assessed how long will be the durability
of this effectiveness and how can we get

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:34.330
a response in the patients who don't get
the response so I think this science

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:38.640
here is very exciting I would encourage
any medical student who looks at this to

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:44.800
go into the area of cancer immunology
fascinating area where you can do basic

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:50.050
science and also see applications in the
clinic very quickly and again I think

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:55.240
the main message I want to give you is
do fundamental discovery work and that

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.280
will result in something useful
