00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.790
 Oh, election day. The day Americans cast their votes everywhere on who will be their next president. 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.120
 Except, they don't really do that. 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.690
 So, what really happens on election day? It's a little complicated because of something 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.620
 It's called "the Electoral College" (Electoral College). 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.500
 To make it a little simple, think of the Electoral College as a collection of the 538 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.300
 votes that decide who the president will be. 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.720
 Why 538? 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.660
 Because it is the number of senators (100) plus the number of representatives (438) in 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.350
 Kongresset. Why are there 438 representatives in Congress? 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.990
 Stop asking so many questions we try to keep it simple: 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.070
 These 538 votes in the electoral college are not given directly to the citizens, but instead 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.780
 shared between the LÃ¤nder. 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.910
 So how do the electoral college delegate the votes? 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.040
 Each state, regardless of population, gets 3 votes to begin with. The remaining votes 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.430
 be fed in proportion to the population of the state. The more people 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.070
 The state has, the more votes it gets. 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.399
 Here is a map of the USA that shows how much voting power they have by doing 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.910
 a hexagon equal to a vote in the electoral college. 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.460
 Because the voices are mostly - albeit not always - proprietary to the crowd, is 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.790
 It also includes a map of where people live, with a small bonus for the smaller states to make them 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.229
 a bit bigger than they would otherwise be. 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.509
 In early November, when the citizens go to the polling stations, they do not vote directly on the president, 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.310
 in fact, they show their state how they think the state should use its votes in the electoral college. 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.109
 48 out of 50 states give all their votes to the candidate who wins 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:17.959
 majority in their state. 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:22.649
 Take Florida, which has 29 votes in the Electoral College. If a candidate wins majority, 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.200
 No matter how narrow the majority is, he gets all the votes. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.109
 Then the road to the White House is simple: wind majority in enough states to get 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.979
 more than half the votes in the electoral college and then you are allowed to sit at "the Big Desk". 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.429
 It wasn't so complicated you say so. 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.819
 But some details are still missing: 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.149
 The Electoral College loves states, but what about the 11 million Americans who do not live 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.869
 in a state? 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.759
 What happens to their voice and where do they really hide? 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.079
 There live approx. 600,000 in Columbia districts, which is a site specifically set aside for * not * 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.209
 to be a state so that the main state would be free of local politics. 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.560
 For most of American history, people living in DC were not allowed to vote 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.109
 in the presidential election. Until 1964, when the Constitution was changed to give the district the same number 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.179
 votes as the least populated state, Wyoming. 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.389
 So the Electoral College likes DC But do you know who it doesn't like? Territories. 

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:08.099
 They often forgot Puerto Rico, Guam, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.459
 get no votes from the electoral college as they are not states and do not have any particular 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.790
 constitutional change that recognizes them. 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.439
 Which is a little strange since they are part of the United States and everyone who lives in the United States 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.790
 are US citizens, so - in most cases - they are exactly like DC 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.629
 4.4 million people live in the territories - it may not sound like much, but it's more 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.489
 than in Wyoming, Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska and Delaware. 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.040
 Together. 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.340
 But still, they get no votes in the electoral college. 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.269
 The whole situation with the territories is extraordinary when considering the last group 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.349
 by Americans who do not live in the states - the 6.3 million Americans living abroad. 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.239
 If you are a US citizen who moves to another country, you can as a rule send 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.360
 your vote by post to the last state you lived in. 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.650
 But if you move * within the United States * to one of its territories, you lose the court 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.719
 to vote for the presidential election as long as you live there - making these areas the only areas 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.459
 on the whole globe where Americans cannot vote for the presidential election. 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.079
 In fact, the only areas in the entire universe when American astronauts are allowed 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.909
 to vote from the room. 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.180
 The last complicated part of the electoral college is the strangest and has to do with the voices 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.030
 in itself. 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.609
 In fact, the state of Florida - and all the other states - does not give the votes of a candidate 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.310
 it's just a simplified way to explain it because in reality the situation is ... 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.909
 curios. 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.670
 What the citizens vote for on election day is a group of electorate appointed by the political 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.739
 parties that elect the president on behalf of the citizens. 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.719
 The number of votes a state receives from the Election College is actually that number 

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:24.209
 electorate the state must send to the college meeting to vote for who the president 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.390
 becomes. 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.430
 What makes it strange is that while these constituents promise they will vote for 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.349
 The desire of the citizens is actually mandatory. 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.870
 Electors are actually free to vote as they please. While this has never swung a choice, 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.920
 It has happened 87 times before voters voted against the wishes of the people who have chosen 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.609
 them. 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:43.689
 Why have you seen this crazy system where a small number of people who are basically totally unknown 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.670
 the civilian population, really choose who the president should be? 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.689
 Because in the 1700s - when the Election College was conceived - was the quickest way to 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.040
 Providing information to write it on a piece of paper, give it to a guy on one 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.780
 horse, wish him "godspeed, good sir" (good luck) and hope that he was not killed by Indians or died of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.159
 dysentery on the road. 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.590
 Because information was moving so slowly and landing was so great, the idea was 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.090
 to send all the constituents to Washington where they could have the most current information 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.269
 to make the decisions for the people at home who did not know the latest news. 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.560
 Today, where we send information with light rays in fiber optic wires instead 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.440
 on the back of herd animals, this aspect of the electoral college might seem 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.660
 a bit old fashioned. 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.500
 Nevertheless, while most believe that the presidential election will take place in early November, 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.430
 Don't do it - it's the choice that decides who the constituents will be. 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.620
 The 538 electors who are elected then meet in early December and cast the right votes 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.100
 who decides who is the next president of the United States.
