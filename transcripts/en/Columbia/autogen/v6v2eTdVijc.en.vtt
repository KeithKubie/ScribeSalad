were hiring for that position we sort of
really thought carefully about whether

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.310
really thought carefully about whether
 

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.370
really thought carefully about whether
we wanted a person who is an empiricist

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:21.380
we wanted a person who is an empiricist
 

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.070
we wanted a person who is an empiricist
first and a librarian second a person

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080
first and a librarian second a person

first and a librarian second a person
who was a librarian first an empiricist

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:25.760
who was a librarian first an empiricist
 

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.270
who was a librarian first an empiricist
second or a person who was a librarian

second or a person who was a librarian
 

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.620
second or a person who was a librarian
first and last that had some

understanding of empiricism and the
 

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.110
understanding of empiricism and the
conclusion we came to was that you know

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120
conclusion we came to was that you know
 

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.120
conclusion we came to was that you know
sort of in this it was that whatever

partnerships we created we sort of had
 

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.220
partnerships we created we sort of had
to create among ourselves because the

let Larry give you a taste of it but
from its practical aspect so most of you

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:03.740
from its practical aspect so most of you
 

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.670

be interesting to talk about what we're

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:27.490
be interesting to talk about what we're
 

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.450

doing so this these are the 14 there are

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:30.460
doing so this these are the 14 there are
 

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.629
doing so this these are the 14 there are
14 law reviews here at Columbia these

00:27:33.629 --> 00:27:33.639
14 law reviews here at Columbia these
 

00:27:33.639 --> 00:27:38.310
14 law reviews here at Columbia these
are the 14 that some some you may have

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320
are the 14 that some some you may have
 

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.990
are the 14 that some some you may have
heard of some you may not have heard of

heard of some you may not have heard of
 

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.860
heard of some you may not have heard of
and I think probably there's a new law

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:43.870
and I think probably there's a new law
 

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:46.560
and I think probably there's a new law
review that that starts every year or so

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:46.570
review that that starts every year or so
 

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:50.820
review that that starts every year or so
i think that's that's a fair to say so

would help everybody to get online so

00:30:09.419 --> 00:30:09.429
would help everybody to get online so
 

00:30:09.429 --> 00:30:11.100
would help everybody to get online so
buy online they now I mean they put

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:11.110
buy online they now I mean they put
 

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.230
buy online they now I mean they put
their abstracts up and and here you can

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240

Larry can both talk more about that but

00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:20.679
Larry can both talk more about that but
 

00:30:20.679 --> 00:30:22.860
Larry can both talk more about that but
we do try very much to encourage those

00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:22.870
we do try very much to encourage those

people who come on board with us to

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:24.940
people who come on board with us to
 

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.080
people who come on board with us to
think very differently about what 21st

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:28.090
think very differently about what 21st
 

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:32.160
think very differently about what 21st
century a publication looks like and so

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.170
century a publication looks like and so
 

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:34.650
century a publication looks like and so
again we have a conversation with the

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:34.660
again we have a conversation with the
 

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.049
again we have a conversation with the
editors they tell us what they want they

00:30:37.049 --> 00:30:37.059
editors they tell us what they want they
 

00:30:37.059 --> 00:30:39.600
editors they tell us what they want they
tell us what they envisioned and and

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:39.610
tell us what they envisioned and and
 

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:42.120
tell us what they envisioned and and
then we decide which level of service to

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:42.130
then we decide which level of service to
 

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.740
then we decide which level of service to
provide and we are not a cost recovery

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:45.750
provide and we are not a cost recovery
 

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:48.100
provide and we are not a cost recovery
service and so consequently

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.110
service and so consequently
 

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.740
service and so consequently
we give them a very reasonable even for

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:50.750
we give them a very reasonable even for
 

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:52.720
we give them a very reasonable even for
those things that say fee we give them a

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:52.730
those things that say fee we give them a
 

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:57.160
those things that say fee we give them a
very reasonable rate to to play around

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:57.170
very reasonable rate to to play around
 

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.049
very reasonable rate to to play around
with and sometimes they go away and say

00:30:59.049 --> 00:30:59.059
with and sometimes they go away and say
 

00:30:59.059 --> 00:31:01.810
with and sometimes they go away and say
wow that's too much and you know I have

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:01.820
