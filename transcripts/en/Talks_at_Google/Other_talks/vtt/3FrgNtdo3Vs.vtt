00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.880
KATE: Authors at Google New York
is very excited to have a

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.275
selection of poets from
the new book, The Best

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:12.010
New Poets of 2012.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.500
It is my personal pleasure
to introduce

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.890
our first poet today.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.800
Daniel Meltz is a Googler, and
is on my team, and I'm pleased

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.760
as punch that we are here, and
talking about some of the

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.420
stuff he likes to do when
he's not doing the

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.310
stuff that he does.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.440
So thank you, everyone.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.304
Ladies and gentlemen,
Daniel Meltz.

00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:38.910
DANIEL MELTZ: Thank you,
and thanks, Kate, for

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.870
arranging all this.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.130
I'm going to introduce the first
poet, but we're going to

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.860
go into alphabetical order.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.430
So the first poet is Elizabeth
T. Gray, Jr. She's a poet,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.855
translator, and corporate
consultant.

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:53.735
Her translations of Iran's major
mystical poet Hafez-e

00:00:53.735 --> 00:00:58.900
Shirazi, died in 1389, were
published by White

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.760
Cloud Press in 1995.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.910
Poems and translations from
Persian and Tibetan have

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.250
appeared or are forthcoming in
the "Kenyan Review," "Beloit

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.960
Poetry Journal," the "Harvard
Review," "The Cimmaron

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.690
Review," "Poetry International,"
[INAUDIBLE],

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.010
"The New Orleans Review,"
"The New Haven Review,"

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.600
[INAUDIBLE], and "Provincetown
Arts."

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.700
She has a JD from Harvard Law
School, and an MFA from Warren

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.470
Wilson College.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.840
She lives in New York
City, and she's at

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.024
elizabethgrayjr.com.

00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:30.425
Elizabeth T. Gray.

00:01:33.694 --> 00:01:34.640
ELIZABETH T. GRAY:
Thanks, Dan.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.170
And thank you all for having
us and sharing

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.980
your lunch with us.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.350
It's been really fun
to meet the other

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.450
poets in the anthology.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.700
And I'm just really pleased
to be here today.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.690
I'm going to start with
one of the poems

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.700
that's in the anthology.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.900
It's called Albania.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.580
I grew up at the height of the
Cold War in the '50s and the

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.150
'60s, and of all the communist
countries, Albania was the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.630
most mysterious.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.050
I mean, you just couldn't find
out anything about it.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.970
It wasn't on the hit list
of evil countries.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.920
But my first passport said, if
you take this passport into

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.525
Albania, it will
become invalid.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.380
So time passed.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.540
Fast forward.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.910
In the year 2005, my husband
and I were on a boat,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.910
homeschooling our kids
in the Mediterranean.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.040
And as we were going up the west
coast of Greece, I looked

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.660
at the charts.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.710
And there was Albania.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.250
So this was written
after we'd left.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.620
We were heading up the
coast of Croatia.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.820
"Albania.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.970
On Sunday, I went to Albania.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.280
No one understood clearly at
first why I or anyone would go

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.820
to Albania, except my father,
who knew at once.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.140
Because before, you couldn't
go to Albania.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.650
It had never occurred
to me before to

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.130
actually go to Albania.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.620
For years, it was there,
a Mars, the

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.000
ultimate hole in the atlas.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.900
Albania.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.820
Our government said you couldn't
go to Albania.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.090
Passports self-vaporized,
I thought,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.653
if you want to Albania.

00:03:19.653 --> 00:03:24.050
It was like the Middle
Ages with missiles,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.910
over there in Albania.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.250
And sometimes China, Albania.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.960
But then it was Sunday,
40 years later.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.320
And I was right there.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.900
I was right next to Albania.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.290
There's a thin strait
and small islands.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.330
You pay a ferryman to
cross to Albania.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.240
Before, people who tried to swim
away were shot by men in

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.280
trenches and towers
guarding Albania.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.270
Everyone was surprised when
I left alone for Albania.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.680
Given her history, were you
worried when your mother went

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.560
off to Albania?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.680
No-- well, maybe a little,
they said.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.220
She never mentioned Albania.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.230
When I came back, everybody
asked about Albania.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.040
They said, what did you
see in Albania?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.900
I began to reply.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.760
But that was enough
of Albania.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.730
Perhaps it was hard for them,
the idea of Albania.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.580
Maybe they never
had an Albania.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.020
They weren't panicked.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.600
They didn't ask, what
will we do, now that

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.850
you can go to Albania?

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.110
It's been a few days now.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.440
It's as if nothing happened, as
if I never went to Albania.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.190
The chart shows two ports and
several small harbors.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.990
But from this far offshore,
there are no lights anywhere

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.130
along the coast of Albania.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.810
And as we move north, somewhere
to starboard, steep

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:05.800
and with snow, is Albania."

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.580
I'm also thrilled that this poem
is actually about to be

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.290
translated into Albanian by
my new friend, [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.330
Kalusche, who read the poem.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.150
And now I've been introduced
to all this Albanian

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.650
literature, and Albanians.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.960
And New York is full,
and Facebook is full

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.060
of all these Albanians.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.020
And it's just an astonishing
introduction to a country that

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.270
I never thought actually
existed.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.270
I'm a translator of classical
Persian poetry, and studied in

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.520
Iran and Afghanistan and
Pakistan, mostly in the '70s,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.250
some in the '80s.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.450
So the next poem moves east a
little in terms of geography.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.840
On my first trip east,
hitchhiking from Istanbul to

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.180
Kathmandu, I traveled for the
first time across that

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.090
geography with my first
devastating true love.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.770
And this poem is a poem
written to him later,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.400
obviously, that speaks directly
to him, but draws on

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.060
a tradition in Islamic poetry
which we really don't have.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:21.820
It's using poems as pre-battle
jihadist exhortations or

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.040
curses against the enemy.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.120
And some of the lines, I
confess, are stolen.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.200
They were stolen from a document
that was posted on an

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.210
Al Qaeda website in 2005 called
An Ultimatum to the

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.460
Shiites and Crusaders, by Abu
Musab al-Zarqawi, who was

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.790
running Al Qaeda in
Iraq at the time.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.820
So it's called, "In The Alleyway
of the Beloved." And

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.700
it starts with a verse
from the Koran.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.210
Here's the Koran [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:00.180
"Whatever vow you vow, surely
Allah knows it.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.780
And the evildoers will
have no help.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.990
It was no dream back then, in
the high cold between the

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:17.950
mountains, at the rim of the
gravel pits west of the city,

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.890
watching the dog fights, the
men with whips taking bets,

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:28.650
where we swore to it, and again,
later, we swore to it,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.580
where the money changer's
boy brought us

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.730
tea on a copper tray.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:40.930
I kept faith, kept to faint goat
tracks in snow, became

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.490
both wraith and arrow,
embedded, a

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.590
blade end in your rib.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.740
You remember, there in your
broad California, how dust

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.050
hangs like breath or gold in
the air here in the land of

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.450
the two rivers.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:08.320
In this maze of narrow lanes,
there will be no mercy.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.230
That word in my throat
has been slit.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.460
You will be given to
drink from the

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.200
various goblets of death.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.080
It is written.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:30.860
He who warns is excused."

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.110
Moving from that
cheerful note--

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.960
it took me 30 years
to write that.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.900
I hope someday he
gets to read it.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.809
The last poem is from a
manuscript that is forthcoming

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:47.380
from Four Way Books,
where Victoria, our

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.070
next reader, works.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.810
It's going to be published
in the spring of 2015.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.850
It's a series of poems loosely
based on the adventures of a

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:59.960
bunch of young travelers and
hippies who are traveling

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.130
through India.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:08.290
And in this one, Blake, who's
a Brit, is sharing with a

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:15.160
group of his friends, one of
whom's name is Sarah, a way

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.070
cool new tantric strange
bizarre visualizate and

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.400
meditation technique that
he's heard about.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.405
"Blake was talking
up a new rite.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.770
You go alone to a really scary
place, spread out your skin,

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:40.520
cook your body parts up in your
iron pot, add specific

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.880
syllables, summon the demons,
feed them, and you're free.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.360
You have to get it just right.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.490
So he went over the invitees
and ingredients again--

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:59.210
dandling lung, aorta, liver,
femur, dipthong.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:03.180
Brad said nothing, but Nadia
offered the room a few more

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.320
inches of arm.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.270
I never have to call
them, said Sarah.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.050
Two of them are always there,
an opaque, imperceptibly

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.070
moving surface that stretches
away on every side, and

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.370
betrayal for which there is no
evidence but of which I am

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.370
entirely certain.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.590
Doesn't love dismember
our selves?

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:34.170
Every curve and secretion,
offered up?

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.520
Afterward, you pick up
your skin and go

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.620
home." Thank you.

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.950
Let me introduce Victoria.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.190
Victoria Lynne McCoy holds an
MFA in poetry from Sarah

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.420
Lawrence College.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:02.190
Her works appeared in "Boxcar
Poetry Review," "Used

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:06.140
Furniture Review," "PANK," and
"Union Station Magazine,"

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.630
among others.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.450
A member of the louderARTS
Project, Victoria lives in

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.910
Brooklyn and works for
Four Way Books.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.160
Welcome, Victoria.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.060
VICTORIA MCCOY: Hi.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.590
Thanks, Kate, for setting this
all up and having us.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.420
And thank you for sharing
your lunch hour with us.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:35.930
I'll start by reading the
poem from the anthology,

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.590
"Self-Portrait in Unfinished
Letters."

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:46.430
"Dear, the Gulf is bleeding
black again.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.150
They say they'll fix it.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:53.350
They say Claude Chabrol is dead
for the first time today.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.050
September 12th, and church
bells through

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.470
the courtyard window.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.010
I meant to see more of his
films while he was alive.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:08.260
Barreling down Pacific Coast
Highway, what was that song?

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:14.570
Do you remember what Alison
sounds like sitting shotgun?

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:20.290
Dear, I quit vegetarianism
last month.

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:25.190
Remember when the teacher said,
I'm too old to protest?

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.960
The largest picture on the front
page of the paper is a

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.640
man crossing Bryant Park with
a mannequin under arm.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.420
They said they'd fix it.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:40.110
A city of moths to the
tent-white sheen of celebrity.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.080
I try to leave her
out of this one.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:48.070
Alison, a choir of whispers
in the dark.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:53.610
Dear, they decided not to burn
the Koran yesterday.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.590
You've always liked it
better when there's

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.880
a they in the story.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.250
I've lost faith in
my own impact.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.790
The Nile is drowning in
100 tons of gasoline.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:10.360
And Alison is dead for the
1,717th time when I wake.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.280
There's a fire under the
earth they can't fix.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.700
Dear, [FRENCH]

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:23.010
in a near empty theater, my
appendages haunted with so

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.150
many almosts.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.300
I've forgotten her face for
the third time today.

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.500
A sunken-in man on the subway
sings about a city built

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.090
entirely of instruments
that make no sound.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.990
The train doors open, their
ghost-bright mouths a calling.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:51.540
I'll go anywhere the sirens
can't find me."

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:58.400
This next poem is borrowed from
a Japanese form called

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.840
the zuihitsu.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:06.060
That's a sort of collage-like
poem of fragments.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.760
And it means the moving brush.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.720
So it's after Kimiko Han.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.710
"The Body Breakable."

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:20.210
"I watch the lifeguards clasp
hands, a human rake, wade into

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.790
the white wash for the body of
a girl who never surfaced.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.100
Somewhere an ocean is
unbroken by rain.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.280
My limbs, furious with sleep,
now the night is beginning to

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.230
secede from Brooklyn.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.080
The line that has haunted me.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.620
You ought to wake up with
your mouth full of pity.

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:46.460
I am constantly falling
in love with the

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.370
impossibility of a thing.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:52.590
Again, the knee splits open.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:57.860
Autumn is one long lesson in
what makes the body breakable.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.210
Some nights, there is a cliff.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.160
Others, a slight mattress shift
under some invisible

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.520
weight at my back.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.930
A siren croons its lullaby
from the sea of passing

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.590
headlights.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:17.490
Her name has erected a glass
cathedral around me.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.020
Reading again today about
how Zeus once split

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.480
the humans in half.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.070
Ruined cities.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:33.100
Are we defined by what
is missing?"

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:42.300
And this next poem is called
"Aubade In Pieces."

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.350
"Even as I deliver my body from
the subway's tenebrous

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:50.040
mercy, I cannot unknow this.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.030
Each time daylight invades our
limbs, the sun marching its

00:15:55.030 --> 00:16:00.240
restless armies up the sheets,
my love will put entire states

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:03.550
between us, and there's no
telling when the map will

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.930
tesseract itself to
bring him back.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:13.570
Always his breath that first
breaks me, his chest a hum of

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:18.240
lightning bugs, lethal
little darlings.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:21.400
His fingers swarm my thighs.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.060
He leaves teeth prints
to miss him by.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.450
Praise this skin, its miracle
cells, their blessed

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.740
forgetfulness.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.680
Under my pillow, a Mason jar
where I collect my name each

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.940
time it burns his mouth open.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.270
Fireflies in the summer
porch of him.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.280
I pin their wings down.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.895
I sing to them of the hour
before the wolf comes.

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.600
Still Life With Geese
in the Water.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.750
On the border between
Pennsylvania and New Jersey,

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.970
the geese gather behind the
bridge's concrete legs to keep

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:10.020
from carrying away
with the current.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.240
The river, lightsome and
long, and the horizon

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.970
a great mouth calling.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.640
I recognize the voice.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.510
I am not afraid to be dead.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:25.000
Only of the act of dying.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.910
My favorite first date was a
surprise helicopter ride--

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.360
an aerial tour of Long Beach
Harbor, which I'd known from

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.770
the ground all my life.

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.380
I've always loved heights.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:43.280
I think I'd enjoy the falling
before the body breaks.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.540
I left the small bird contorted
on the grass, soft

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.510
landing place below the window
it tried to fly through when

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.210
it tired of all that
possible sky.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:59.310
I'd like to know what's
on the other side.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:03.570
I scrounge in my purse for the
pills to stop the jackhammer

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:05.590
behind my eyes.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.280
I think my sight is failing.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.070
The stop lights have all grown
coronas, and the time blurs in

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:16.110
its black box.

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:20.840
A cyst blooms between my wrist
bones like a promise.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.810
This body you will someday
forgo me completely.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:29.200
The metacarpals parting in my
hand when I write, a sharp

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.950
piercing up my arm that
might be mercy."

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:37.990
And this is my last poem.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.080
Again, thank you all
for being here.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.330
"Self-Portrait as Odysseus.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:50.490
If there is wreck in me, let
it be anchor and all.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.690
Oh, you beautiful ones with your
jackal call, the steel

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.300
trap of you and your meadow
starred with flowers, you

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.640
honey throated ghosts, ripples
in the windless hours.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.440
My dead are waiting
at the bottom.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.720
Sing the bees free of me
that I may listen.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.180
Sing the wound clean
out of the skin.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:20.280
I come to you lying down in
my petal thin excuses.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.130
You already know my name.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.040
Sing me soft boned.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.450
Sing me home, you with the
map of the unknown

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:30.350
carved in your palms.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.730
Untie me from grief's
tall mast.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.780
See how it's made
a gully of me.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:49.700
Oh, you gods of relief,
let the water in."

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.270
And our next poet will
be Daniel Meltz.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.010
Daniel Meltz is a technical
writer at Google.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.880
As a younger man, he taught
geometry to the deaf, and

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.840
WordPerfect to the blind.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.970
He lives in midtown Manhattan
between a beauty parlor and a

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.310
nail salon.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.240
His work has been published in
"American Poetry Review,"

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.580
"upstreet," "Mudfish," "Audio
Zone," [INAUDIBLE], "Assisi,"

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.980
"40 Ounce Bachelors," and
"CrossConnect." Please welcome

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.754
Daniel Meltz.

00:20:17.754 --> 00:20:18.730
DANIEL MELTZ: Thank you.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.170
Thanks for coming.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.900
OK, this first poem is
from the anthology.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.970
It's called "Intrinsic
Marimbas."

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.680
"I had 45 minutes, so I went to
my favorite shoelace store

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.880
on East 59th, where the shoelace
boy's always flirting

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.970
with the hot cashier in
her skintight top.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.910
They're appealing, although they
don't exactly take me in.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.310
And then it's out into the
street again, where nobody's

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:45.620
sure if it's drizzling enough
to haul out the umbrella.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.390
The crowds are staggering.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.210
The tourists in the glass apple
elevator, the arm in arm

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.610
Brazilians, the jaywalking
bullies, the women in

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.770
flip-flops, toes serenely
gripping.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.360
The man and woman in gorgeous
sweaters and matching tans,

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.350
emerging from Bergdorf's, door
held, two big doormen with

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.470
creased smiles and
no sense of pomp.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:11.650
I was here a couple months
ago at Doug's suggestion.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.680
It was drizzling then, too.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.670
He loves that little shoelace
store where they also do

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.810
shines and repairs, of course.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.520
He was always saying of course,

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.420
which I hated at first.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.815
It seemed so condescending, but
then I came to understand

00:21:25.815 --> 00:21:28.580
his odd expressions
of delight.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.740
I do not miss him, but I miss
the way he showed up jumping

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.780
and took off bouncing and looked
at me as if we were

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.740
jackhammering sidewalk, worker
and foreman, deep into sex.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.490
But the crowds were exciting,
the drama of the criss-cross.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.390
And then a walk through
Crate and Barrel.

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.590
I bought a pillow,
black and green.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.900
Two men helped me, one large,
one small, both Filipino.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.460
A double barreled cruise
that only added to

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.830
the jolt of the purchase.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.700
They put my pillow in a see
through bag, which made me a

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.770
little embarrassed.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:03.630
I thought, let me take
58th back west to get

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.920
away from the people.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.950
But after a block,
I was bored.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.190
I wanted to see the trees, so I
circled around and into the

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.390
park where everything was
shockingly green from all the

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.350
rain of this week, and the
barks were black--

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:19.740
greens and blacks, as exciting
as the black and green of the

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.160
pillow I'd bought.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.070
The lindens and flowers smelling
like Juicy Fruit,

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.150
soil, sopping, mossy, quiet.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:30.610
The dark pane of quiet so close
to all the traffic.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:34.910
An awesome shart with spandrel
branches and stained glass

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:39.320
leaves and fog in
the spandrels.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.910
The fog's been settled in among
the building tops for

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.100
days, so unusual in midtown.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.300
You can't see the top
of Time Warner.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.730
It disappears into the fog,
along with the top of the

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.640
ugliest trump in the world, and
the memory of a boat ride

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.230
in the snow.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:59.370
Later, there he was, Doug, in
front of CBS, whispering my

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:05.890
name before he slipped
inside."

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:09.672
So this next one--

00:23:09.672 --> 00:23:14.450
I'm not really used to reading
poetry in public.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.120
This one is called "On A Murphy
Bed Mattress Full of

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.270
Easter Egg straw."

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.940
"I would write and the lines
would spool out of me.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.140
It was a physical need to keep
defining myself, but I never

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.580
felt defined.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.430
I filled notebooks, I covered
walls, I hung a

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.820
pen around my neck.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.070
That was the strangest.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.620
The pen around my neck.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.540
I counted out the beats of
the words on my fingers.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.900
I broke the thesaurus.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.620
I consulted the forms.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:46.390
Pyramids, houses, concertos, pup
tents, anything to give a

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.130
shape to my thoughts that ran
screaming from the feelings my

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.150
thoughts turned up in rampages
of anxiety and unbroken hours

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.410
of unconsidered scribble.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:58.860
When I had no money, I scotch
taped notebooks together and

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.120
wrote poems and plays and serial
comic novels, starting

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.880
from the back next to the inside
cover that in a store

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.590
bought version, would show
a multiplication table.

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.000
When I had a little money,
I bought a computer.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.850
When I had a little more,
I started watching TV.

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:17.380
It was while channel surfing
that I saw it all clearly.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:20.330
In the crooked smile of an
anime warrior, in Anne

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:24.200
Bancroft's persistent finger
spelling, in the pitiless

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.290
debating of the whiners and
the chest beaters, on the

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.760
faces of the chubby kids turning
cartwheels on the

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.690
Disney Channel, in the AIDS
reports, in Mike Wallace's

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.510
wrinkles, in Barbara Streisand's
tears, in the

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.360
squalor after the flood,
in the hubris after the

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.750
landslide, in a softened
Archie Bunker, in a

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.200
confrontational Edith, in
the wind in the trees.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:46.900
I saw it.

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.820
I took a picture of it with
my cell phone camera.

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.330
Mike's face morphing
into Barbara's.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.440
God's feet slipping into a
sinister pair of slingback

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.100
energetics.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:58.590
It's in the lines, see.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:01.670
The lines that differentiate the
heads from the curtains,

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:08.450
the ankles from the pantyhose,
the other from the me."

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:13.230
This next poem is called "Just
Outside of Bowler City." And

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:17.450
when I was a kid, there was a
bowling alley in Hackensack,

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:18.980
New Jersey that claimed
to have the most

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.890
alleys on the planet.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:24.560
It had 50 bowling alleys,
50 lanes, I mean.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.160
"Just Outside of Bowler City."

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:29.940
"My first teacher was my father,
a sarcastic figure in

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.100
underpants.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.790
He taught me how to idolize
and instigate.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.740
My mother ran from him.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.010
She brushed her hair
til it bounced.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.130
She used the hairbrush
as a weapon.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.100
She loved the smell of the
future, but she never

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.840
stepped into it.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.620
My sister showed me her
workbook, a multiplication

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:49.060
table and spelling lists.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.640
She read Black Beauty
aloud to me.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.830
She turned on cartoons, Heckle
and Jeckle, two angry crows.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:59.090
She told me about her
teachers at school.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.850
The teacher with the swinging
can, the teacher with the

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:05.620
blubbery neck, the one with the
swishing stockings, the

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.300
one with the tangerine
lipstick.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.780
We shared a bedroom with
a kidnap window.

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:12.810
We stage whispered at daybreak,
biting the cream out

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:13.720
of cookies.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.410
We broke bobby pins in two, and
scratched every inch of a

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.880
crap credenza."

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.670
I'm going to read two more.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:27.190
This one's called
"Nine Lives."

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.150
"It's years since I've had an
answering machine, but there

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.860
are still many nights I turn the
key in the lock, eager to

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.700
play whatever messages were
left while I was working.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:40.860
At times, I still think the
radio will go off when I turn

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.650
out the bathroom light, though
it's even more years since

00:26:43.650 --> 00:26:45.600
that was how it functioned.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.900
These are memories like dreams
from a previous life that

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.220
flicker in an updraft of mylar
confetti at the back of the

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.680
hero waving from his Jeep.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.330
We forget how much we've
changed, but the diarists and

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.010
the face blind know.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.630
It's hard for them to remember
and recount their humiliations

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:06.760
on yellowing paper and in the
offended glares of the

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.430
forgotten."

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:16.237
This last one is called
"Narcoleptic Karaoke." You

00:27:16.237 --> 00:27:18.950
know, some of these I have
expurgated because coworkers

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:20.090
are here, so--

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.160
yeah.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.935
There are some things, Greg,
I just could not read to--

00:27:24.935 --> 00:27:25.796
I don't know.

00:27:25.796 --> 00:27:29.220
But I just took a couple words,
just a couple words.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.560
But anyway, this is "Narcoleptic
Karaoke."

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.150
"I used to make lists of the
names of my friends--

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:39.770
John, Larry, Ernest, Jeffrey,
Rick, Gene, Steve, Lee.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.940
Then every couple of days, I'd
rewrite the list on a scrap of

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.130
paper, or on a blank
page in my diary.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.150
Over time, the list
would change.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:52.340
John, Larry, Jeffrey, Mitch,
Gene, Lee, Ellen, Bill.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.090
Sometimes the list was lined
up with my groceries.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.240
Mitch, coffee, John, yogurt,
David, shredded wheat,

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.960
Jeffrey, tomato juice.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.320
Or lined up with my groceries
and the movies I'd seen.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.810
Tom, wheat germ, 'A Room With
A View,' Larry, chick peas,

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.570
tuna, 'Blue Velvet.'

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.100
I used to write down
everything we

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:12.450
talked about in therapy.

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:14.230
You're full of murderous rage.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.530
I can't hear you.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:16.720
Then I burst into tears.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.350
She's right!

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:18.230
She's right!

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.570
As much verbatim as
I could remember.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.040
A one act play three
times a week.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.880
I wrote down everything I
saw and who I went with.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:29.080
I recorded record highs and
lows, and the names of the

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.230
trees and every penny I spent.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.920
I recorded orgasms, sick days,
days I'd smoked pot, the

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.310
length of the movie, the number
of hours since I'd last

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:41.400
seen Howie, since I'd first met
Linwood, since recorded

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.880
rain had fallen.

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.620
Inches of snow, days above 90,
the 10 most populous, the

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:51.680
driest, the loneliest, the lone
list, the one list, the

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.360
on list, the off list.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.410
Eventually, I threw them out.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.040
Eventually, you wake
up startled.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.030
What are you keeping
lists for?

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.220
What's with all the
ledger domain?

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.570
It wasn't a question of what to
remember, the diving birds

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:05.690
told me, but who to

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.240
forget." That's it.

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:18.060
So, our next reader
is Ben Purkert.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.530
His poems have recently appeared
or are forthcoming in

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.430
"The New Yorker," "Fence,"
"Denver Quarterly," "The

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:29.060
[? ALL ?]," "DIAGRAM," "New
Orleans Review," "Carolina

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.760
Quarterly," "Spoon River Poetry
Review," and elsewhere.

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.810
He holds an MFA from NYU, and
is currently completing his

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.400
first poetry manuscript,
"One Good."

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.220
He is also poetry editor of
Bodega at bodegamag.com.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.821
Please welcome Ben Purkert.

00:29:43.821 --> 00:29:47.118
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.580
BEN PURKERT: Thank you, Dan.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.570
These poems will be completely
uncensored.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:55.861
So just really--

00:29:55.861 --> 00:29:58.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.090
Thank you, Google, so much.

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.945
Thank you to all of you for
making time for poetry

00:30:02.945 --> 00:30:04.750
in your busy day.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.560
Thanks also to the University
of Virginia Press, who put

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.380
this anthology together.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:09.980
It's beautiful.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.020
The work is really great.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.700
So I'm appreciative
to them, too.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.060
I'm going to read a
few shorter poems.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.940
This is the one that appears
in the anthology.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:27.350
It's called "Ode to Stretch
Armstrong."

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:31.440
"Didn't you ever fling him
across the mud room?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:37.640
All these rules around a body,
how far it can or cannot.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:40.200
Stretch could land hard,
and never look,

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.690
so to speak, thrown.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:46.010
Like a pronoun, he'd leap
rivers to attach

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.810
to something else.

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:52.750
Don't you lose him in the
heat vents by the door.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:57.210
Somewhere, you can bet, more
of Stretch is being made.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:01.300
Every moment on the assembly
line is itself assemblage.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.230
Hands gluing on the legs, or
virtually no hands at all,

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:10.520
only the sun, which
is also a machine.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:15.330
Once a Boy Scout on your block
had eight gold screws inserted

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.160
in his shin.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.670
Once on TV, a chopper flew
so low to the earth

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.950
it missed it entirely.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.780
U-Haul and the Dream
of Arrows.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.356
A little pink lemonade in
the nick of my thumb.

00:31:36.356 --> 00:31:41.850
A little radio static ringing
in my lungs, and each lung

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:46.340
works like a cutout, since the
body can't be everywhere,

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.740
can't be all things
to all mirrors.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.160
And with my windows down, I'll
pretend this isn't a U-Haul,

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.480
but a huge-ass space bot bearing
me in its gaping

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.760
mouth, and the two of us could
toss around ideas for miles.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.620
We could blow by a million signs
lit up, high in the sky

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.160
with arrows pointing down.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:15.940
And I think maybe that's what
sky is, just a whole mess of

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.220
incredibly sharp ends.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.720
And the U-Haul has something
he needs to say.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:29.630
He nearly breaks down
from not saying it."

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:30.880
I decided to read
this next poem.

00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:35.220
It felt sort of topical with
the Super Bowl coming up.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.070
I read sort of this horrifying
statistic--

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.870
America consumes more than a
billion chicken wings on the

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:45.095
day of the Super Bowl,
more than a billion.

00:32:45.095 --> 00:32:46.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.280
BEN PURKERT: Yeah.

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.970
That's sort of staggering.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:56.260
The title of this poem, "Very
Nearly A Billion Wings."

00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.450
"This Rose Bowl, America will
polish off nearly a billion

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.830
wings alone.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:08.400
Let's start looking at each wing
as one half of a couple

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.260
in a movie theater.

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:15.250
Or instead, a dent in the gross
figure of what we can

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.140
count on one hand.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:24.570
A bird less its wings has a span
around five seconds left.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.620
Then, the big game unravels.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.400
One fumble too many.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:35.440
Loudly, a fan on his barstool
might snap, why are they

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.510
cutting to the mascot?

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:47.290
How hard is it to film
the damn field?"

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:48.540
Just three more poems.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.695
So I work in advertising,
branding.

00:33:53.695 --> 00:33:55.490
I freelance for a few
different agencies.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:00.970
So a lot of my work involves
themes relative to

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:05.420
consumerism, and how we sort
of process ads, and the

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.690
relationship to the mind.

00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:08.739
So this is a poem
that sort of is

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:11.620
interested in that territory.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.364
"Shown an image of an M&amp;M
wrapper, a subject salivates.

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:21.230
The mind is so easily had.

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:26.310
It's easily the first picked off
deer from a herd, the one

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:31.480
the herd guest would go first,
but never said anything.

00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.070
And they let the mind
be ravaged.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:37.350
This way, they might
stand a chance.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:42.040
And it was so freeing to look
on with no mind, the parts

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.020
being eaten in sequence, the
jaws closing on the very slim

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.290
bones of the mind.

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:53.920
And when the herd left to roam,
they fell sideways,

00:34:53.920 --> 00:35:04.530
their mouths, oh so close,
in the grass."

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.420
I don't know what this means,
or if this is only me.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.150
But I feel like I've been seeing
a ton of people that

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:12.400
have butterfly tattoos.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.290
Not just recently, but just sort
of throughout the course

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:19.710
of my life, it's been sort of
this really quiet trope.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.440
I don't know.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.950
So I was interested in that, and
then I decided, instead of

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:30.060
a person with a tattoo of a
butterfly, what about a

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.525
butterfly with a tattoo
of a person.

00:35:31.525 --> 00:35:37.020
And that sort of ballooned
into whatever this is.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:41.010
"Tattoo On A Butterfly
Of A Woman."

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.610
"The TV's so loud I
start squinting.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:49.800
I start at the corner of each
eye, pinching it barely enough

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.630
to ruffle a bedsheet.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:56.680
With visible force, the TV
booms, what's coming up next.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:59.570
And this is distinct
from the future.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:04.340
I think the future's a tough
skin we always chew.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.000
We even leave some very
light marks on it.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.760
Once, on a date, a butterfly
lifted her wings to me.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:19.100
She was revealing
some pattern."

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.740
And this is the last poem.

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:22.650
Thanks again.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:26.960
"Love Like A Fork And Knife."

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.600
"For weeks, rain bruises the
backyard, where one tree

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:35.600
shines as a proxy for
standing upright.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.430
But a tree can't separate twigs
from leaves, let alone

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.660
clouds from passing planes.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.360
And maybe it's both male and
female, so each can't split

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:53.430
from the other, each half rooted
in something hard.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:58.660
And the tree is no billboard,
but still flashes like one

00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:03.560
white hot bulb, soaking up
the electric, and says to

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.860
whoever's around, there's
water where I am.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.970
Also some sun here.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:17.890
It's possible to say things
simply by not dying."

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:19.140
Thank you very much.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.830
And the next and last and very
talented poet we have is

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.350
Sophia Starmack.

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:35.060
She received an MA in French
and Francophone literature

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.280
from Bryn Mawr College, and is
currently completing an MFA in

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.930
poetry at Sarah Lawrence.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.820
She works as a writing teacher
and tutor in New York City.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.070
Sophia.

00:37:50.385 --> 00:37:51.480
SOPHIA STARMACK:
Thanks so much.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.510
I'm really excited that I
finished that MFA since this

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:55.285
book was published.

00:37:55.285 --> 00:37:57.570
Yeah.

00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:01.340
No, it's really important
you can finish things.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:02.470
Thanks so much.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:04.775
It's really special
to be here.

00:38:04.775 --> 00:38:08.710
The poem in the book is from a
long poem that I wrote, which

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.350
is sort of a love story that I
wrote for myself, and also for

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:15.880
the place where I grew up, which
is in Western New York--

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.980
a really small village.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.860
So I'm going to start there, and
just keep going and read

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.975
you a bit from that
very long poem.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.740
"If I, too, thinks Alice,
then the glacier.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:37.425
In the beginning, grinding its
fingers, the grit of schist

00:38:37.425 --> 00:38:41.610
and granite sticks to its lonely
bone, its white soul to

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.840
steer it, a whale bone
whistling north.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:50.910
If the glacier, thinks Alice,
then I. If I, then the ice.

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:54.320
If I, too, then the mouth of the
river, the mouths of the

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.160
dead through my dream.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.120
If I, too, then the rock and the
names carved in the rock.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.840
If I, too, then my mother, her
fringe leather jacket.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.070
If I, too, then the calf, and
the cow's hanging udder.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:12.280
If I, too, then the field,
each wheat spear turning.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.670
If I, too, then the song, under

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:17.100
the light shaft striking.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.990
If I, too, then each blade
of sun unturning, and the

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:26.010
darkness and the darkness
hollering over the valley and

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:29.315
after 10 millennia, even a
glacier gives up the ghost.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.990
I had forgotten they still made
places, thinks Jo, like

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:46.850
this, when the hot sun slams
back in, her eyelids, the ripe

00:39:46.850 --> 00:39:50.125
darkness, the drugstore
softens around her.

00:39:50.125 --> 00:39:54.280
What is a drugstore after
all, remembers Jo?

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.130
Something about sweet syrup
and chipped ice.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:01.920
Something about penny candy,
thinks Jo, asking the pimpled

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.870
boy behind the counter
for a soda.

00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:09.160
The sly ceiling fan unwinding,
dust from hot September.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:13.100
I'll take it, she says, and
pays for a cherry Coke.

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.580
Cherry Coke, please, says
Alice in her sun dress,

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:24.440
sitting on the concrete stoop,
Alice in her feather down,

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.080
furs like a blonde coat.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.890
Alice, on the edge of becoming
Alice, drinks like a greedy

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:35.470
wolf from the waxy paper cup,
leaves sweet sweat on the rim.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.560
It's only the strap of a sun
dress in hot September, the

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:47.790
poured cement of an old time
drugstore, the strap of a

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.260
sundress, a sun-peeled
shoulder.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:53.470
Shouldn't you be, asks
Jo, in school?

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.910
But Alice holds her eye.

00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:57.000
Says nothing.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.270
They sip at Cherry Cokes and
suck the ice, the wax, flakes

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:04.750
on the cup, the skin peels
on the shoulder.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.070
I have become a woman, writes
Alice in her notebook, but

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:12.260
before disappearing through the
greening light it slips,

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.820
just the strap of her sun
dress, her peeled skin

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:18.250
shoulder, and Jo, without
thinking, pulls it up.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.920
With the radio down, and the
windows at one with her

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.040
thoughts, Jo's got seven
women on her mind.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.600
Seven women like seven stars,
one for each finger of her

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.700
left hand, and two for the
invisible fingers of feeling.

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.910
One the stories she reaches
out for, two the stories

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.050
reaching back.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:45.050
Seven women, seven stars,
seven sisters, tucked in

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.900
Orion's belt.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.850
Jo knows Orion, knows his heavy
shield, buckles against

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:55.320
the night, knows the heavy arms
of his terror, knows the

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.678
little knife keeps
tucked close.

00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:05.900
Which is more illicit?

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.320
A not so little girl in the
street light, or the driver,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.440
home from a guilty errand?

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.680
Alice owns the street, tuned
to the night machine, a car

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.640
shining approaching, holding
her ground in

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.900
the one lane street.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.020
The thrill in her t-shirt,
the dew and the crickets.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:29.230
Alice knows summer is dying, and
Alice wants to be real in

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:33.030
the headlight, wants to be
touched under her dress by

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:37.240
flakes of light that beam from
the headlights, holds the

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:40.830
unknown gaze of the stranger,
late from work,

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:42.180
or something worse.

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:45.200
They both know the needle
of night time.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.470
Alice spreads herself on the
darkness and bounds into the

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.220
arms of the ash tree.

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:52.490
The car slows, and
scuttles by.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:56.045
They have seen, not
seen, each other.

00:42:56.045 --> 00:43:02.910
For everyone knows this town
goes to bed at 9:00.

00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:08.200
Back home, the driver considers
the moon, its horns

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.860
and its feathers, the orange
disc of its suffering.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.610
Down the hill he steers his
lonely station wagon.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.055
This is the weight of one.

00:43:18.055 --> 00:43:22.210
He slides his feet, his leather
clogs and hand-knit

00:43:22.210 --> 00:43:25.260
socks, his graying beard
his weakness.

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:29.320
Slumps at the table, leaves
the light untouched.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.830
Upstairs, his wife
breathing, the

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.530
children sticky with dreams.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:40.350
He has a taste at once of frost,
October coming, the

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.510
moon dropped pebbles
of ice and trouble.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:46.160
The driver watched them glitter
off the skin of the

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.250
girl made real in
his headlight.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:53.530
Hands strong and sullen,
he cradles his head.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:57.750
Alone in the darkness alone, in
the breathing, and winter

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:58.770
to come."

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.230
Thank you so much.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.480
Thanks to everyone.
