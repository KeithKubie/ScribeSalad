00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
&gt;&gt; Hello to all the YouTube community.
I'm Pablo Camacho.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.540
I was the winner of the 2009 Davos Debates.
And I'm addressing you now simply because

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.660
I was asked to say a few
words, maybe draw what I can from my experience

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.120
of the World Economic
Forum and maybe offer some advice to the new

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.550
participants.
This means that now instead of interviewing

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.390
Davos attendees, I have to
do something a bit strange and that is interview

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.070
myself.
So what should a Davos Debates participant

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.780
do?
Well, maybe while pondering what to put in

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.320
your video, you could
realize that the most appealing and sort of

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.870
striking feature for the
people who are looking for that one winning

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.420
entry, could be precisely
that which is not in the video.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.989
That is, that a good response sort of creates
an access meaning both

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.330
that it produces lateral discussions, and
more importantly, that it

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.840
points towards a sort of potential that seems
bigger than the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.500
three-minute limit on the video.
That sort of potential that surpasses the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.570
contest itself is really
asking to be set loose on an event such as

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.080
the World Economic Forum.
But this is actually not what truly matters.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.210
This is sort of just strategy talk.
What becomes really valuable is the way in

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.680
which you achieve that and
that is by finding within yourself, your genuine

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.750
concerns about the
impending issues right now.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.380
Because when you do that, you sort of then
have everything to say about

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.920
it and you can talk forever.
And this is what creates that access that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
sort of surpasses the video
and the contest itself.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.330
And it is through this perspective where you
can see how this sort of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.020
gimmicky, strategic context of video contests
actually meets with

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.810
honesty, authenticity, and the truthfulness
that is so crucial for this

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.469
kind of outsider, citizen figure in an event
such as the World Economic

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:21.540
Forum.
So I hope this can be useful in any way, and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.950
I'd like to take this
chance to prematurely congratulate the winner

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.160
and all of you
participants for taking their voice and their

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.590
time and transforming
them in public worldwide contributions.
