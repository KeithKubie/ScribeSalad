We got a packed house today.

00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:03.903 align:end size:78% position:78% line:91%
Packed house, film crew,
Becky Rodriguez.

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.373 align:start position:0% line:85%
Rodriguez?

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:09.709 size:88% position:44% line:85%
Isabella, Christine, DJ Lou.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:12.579 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Becky Rodriguez, want me
to take photo of you?

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.915 align:end size:88% position:88% line:91%
I like to piss on my camera
to make sure it grips.

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:19.319 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I like to piss on my hand
to make sure I don't get-

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.587 align:start position:0% line:85%
The grip on the camera.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.855 size:84% position:42% line:85%
I get a grip on the camera,

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.057 size:72% position:36% line:91%
I don't drop the camera
in the agua.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.326 size:75% position:38% line:91%
I don't drop the camera
in the soda pop,

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.560 size:75% position:38% line:85%
I don't drop the camera-

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:28.862 line:85%
Or, the Gatorade. The Gatorade.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.765 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Or, the Gatorade,
or the Jarritos.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:33.199 align:start position:0% line:85%
I love Jarritos.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.401 align:start position:0% line:85%
It's garbage.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:35.602 size:84% position:42% line:91%
What?
It's made for assholes.

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:36.870 size:84% position:42% line:91%
What the fuck
are you talking about?

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:37.871 align:start position:0% line:85%
I don't know.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:38.938 size:78% position:39% line:91%
You touched a hard line
that you drink it.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.173 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I didn't say anything bad
about it.

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.674 line:91%
I said I liked it,
then you had to be a dick.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:42.909 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Yeah, but you came like,
"I liked it."

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.779 line:91%
Like you, "Hey, so what
your mouth from here on out.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.881 line:91%
I like it so watch your mouth
and when you're-"

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.617 align:end size:75% position:75% line:91%
So hey, that's a family
fucking friend.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.285 size:78% position:39% line:91%
We were all laughing,
I said, "Jarritos,"

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:54.054 size:72% position:36% line:91%
and you went,
"Fuck you say?"

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.895 line:91%
It's The Bonfire, Comedy
Central Radio, SiriusXM 95.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.430 size:72% position:36% line:91%
Cory, you do whatever
you got to do.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:04.631 line:85%
Cory, you're a good man though.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:05.932 size:84% position:42% line:91%
You do what you have to do,
I understand.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.901 line:91%
Just making that move of turning
on the lights a little bit.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:10.336 line:91%
I'll work with whatever you guys
need me to work with.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.439 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Thank you. Mic condoms,
so don't pop my pees.

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:13.940 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Hell yeah.
I'm Big Jay Oakerson.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:16.509 line:91%
And that handsome son of a bitch
with much more depth

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.278 size:69% position:34% line:91%
than just looks is Dan
Soder.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.546 align:start position:0% line:85%
Thank you, Jay.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.047 align:end size:88% position:88% line:91%
Jacob's doing a weird thing
on the wall over there.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.315 align:start position:0% line:85%
What the hell is that?

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.350 line:91%
Were you trying to be a bad boy,
and hang against the wall?

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:26.252 line:91%
Trying to Mel Gibson
your shoulder back into place?

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:27.754 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Oh, were you
Lethal Weapon-ing it?

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:28.955 align:start position:0% line:85%
I was trying.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.623 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Wait, did you pop
your shoulder out?

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:31.991 size:88% position:44% line:85%
No. I was just trying to ...

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.193 align:start position:0% line:85%
What were you doing?

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.761 size:84% position:42% line:91%
You want me to do the thing
where you link arms,

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.130 size:88% position:44% line:91%
and I bend over,
and you go up on my back?

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.631 align:start position:0% line:85%
That'd be awesome.

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:40.133 line:91%
No, I'm good.
I'm not going to try that.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.534 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Do you want me
to walk on your back?

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.503 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Do you want Dan
to walk on your back?

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.705 line:91%
I just found out I'm stepping
on the scales at 220,

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:46.973 align:start position:0% line:85%
so I'll re-correct.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:48.408 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Christine, how good
are my back cracks?

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.609 align:start position:0% line:85%
Great.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:53.213 align:start position:0% line:91%
World class.
Learned from a licensed person.

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:54.848 line:91%
Dude, what if you broke Jacob?
Then he's like

00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:56.082 align:start position:0% line:85%
[inaudible 00:01:55].

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.951 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Then we gotta
just haul his body.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:01:59.219 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I learned from
a licensed person.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.386 align:start position:0% line:85%
I could do it good.

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:01.688 size:81% position:41% line:85%
Who? What kind of license?

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:02.989 align:start position:0% line:85%
My ex mother-in-law.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.224 align:start position:0% line:85%
Okay.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.425 size:78% position:39% line:85%
Yeah, look what she does.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.093 align:start position:0% line:85%
She does realignments?

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.795 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Yeah, all right?
Isabella's here, right?

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.931 size:88% position:44% line:91%
That's what she does.
I don't know if it works.

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:13.833 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I wasn't asking you to get
on the microphone there,

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.369 size:78% position:39% line:91%
you glory hound.
You could just nod.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:18.505 size:72% position:36% line:91%
You're the opposite
of a stage mom.

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:21.608 line:91%
You're like, "You stay off
the mic. Mama's on the mic."

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:24.577 size:84% position:42% line:91%
She's a licensed massage
therapist, right? Yeah.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.778 size:84% position:42% line:85%
Okay, so she did teach you?

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.080 size:81% position:41% line:85%
How many times in her life

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.681 size:81% position:41% line:91%
was she definitely
approached with the-

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:29.949 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh, for a handy?

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:32.352 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Yeah, "So thanks
of the massage."

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.254 align:start position:0% line:85%
Now ...

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.189 align:end size:75% position:75% line:91%
You flop your towel off
and you go ...

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.763 line:91%
Female masseuses have to
probably see so much hard dick

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.131 size:88% position:44% line:85%
that they don't want to see.

00:02:45.164 --> 00:02:47.934 align:end size:81% position:81% line:91%
I know, like, "I'm trying
to help you heal."

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:50.170 line:85%
"Sir, you have a shoulder tear.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:52.539 align:end size:72% position:72% line:91%
Stop putting your hand
on your lap."

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:53.773 size:78% position:39% line:85%
Oh, I have shoulder tear.

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.074 size:72% position:36% line:91%
I've been looking at it
a little bit.

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.476 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I was wondering if you could
tear something else up.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.710 line:85%
Just look at it a little bit.

00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:59.045 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:59.045 line:92%
Look at it.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.213 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.213 line:92%
You looking at it?

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.915 align:start position:0% line:85%
It's moving.

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.983 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Dude, then that's
just their shift.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:06.252 line:91%
That's like the coal
mining for women. There's so-

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.554 align:start position:0% line:85%
Okay, time to go.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.222 size:88% position:44% line:85%
All right, please. Oh, fuck.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.957 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Any accent on you
and they're like,

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.625 align:start position:0% line:85%
oh, well, you have to.

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:15.261 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Time to go, grab hot coals,
burn hands.

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.432 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Coming in with ... who was
the baseball player

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.568 align:end size:84% position:84% line:91%
that pissed on their hands
to give them callous?

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:22.969 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Who was that?
That who was that?

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.804 size:84% position:42% line:91%
There was a baseball player
that famously peed

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:26.573 line:85%
on his hands to callous them.

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:27.974 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Really?
For holding the bat.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:29.442 line:91%
Does that work?
I don't know, man. Let's try-

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:30.677 align:start position:0% line:85%
Pee on your hands.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.078 line:85%
Why don't you give it a shot.

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:33.947 line:91%
Oh, yeah, dude. It says
gives you the best grip ever.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.148 align:start position:0% line:85%
Maybe you should-

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:37.550 line:91%
Yeah, dude, I heard
it's really good for radio.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.353 line:85%
Yeah, I don't know who it is.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.654 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Come in, everyone's laughing
when I go,

00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:43.423 align:end size:72% position:72% line:91%
"Dan, I've been peeing
on my hands."

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:45.892 line:91%
No, that's not him.
It's a famous baseball player.

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.228 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Like a reliever from the 70s
from Boston?

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:54.667 line:91%
No, it's ... I think he's Cuban
and he was on the expos.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.035 align:start position:0% line:85%
Fuck, that's a-

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:57.570 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Was anybody with us
on the cruise ship

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:00.206 align:start position:0% line:91%
that was dumb enough
that we could've convinced them

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.141 size:88% position:44% line:85%
before we go into the ocean,

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:04.811 size:88% position:44% line:91%
if you don't want
to get pressure sickness-

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:06.045 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:07.647 align:end size:72% position:72% line:91%
That you have to drink
your own pee?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.149 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Is there anybody we could've
got to do that?

00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:11.351 align:start position:0% line:85%
Probably-

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:12.885 size:72% position:36% line:91%
'Cause there's no way
to look it up.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.320 line:91%
Well, they were selling those-
We had no internet.

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:17.857 align:start position:0% line:91%
They were selling those
bracelets that stop queasiness,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.292 line:85%
which I think is just placebo.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.094 line:91%
I think it's just placebo too.
It has to be placebo.

00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:22.629 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I said it, I don't know how
[inaudible 00:04:22]

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:23.896 size:78% position:39% line:91%
People are walking around
with bands

00:04:23.929 --> 00:04:25.131 size:72% position:36% line:91%
and they're like,
"I feel good."

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:26.633 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Yeah, John McEnroe
bands all the sudden.

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.900 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:30.036 align:end size:94% position:94% line:91%
One thing about John McEnroe,
never dizzy, never queasy.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.604 line:91%
Never queasy.
Guy's always on stable feet.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:32.839 align:start position:0% line:85%
Guy was always-

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.608 line:91%
That's why he can return a serve
like a mother fucker.

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.076 size:84% position:42% line:85%
That guy's on solid ground.

00:04:37.109 --> 00:04:40.546 line:91%
That guy's sending 112 miler at
you, even in windy conditions.

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:45.385 line:91%
He's like, "I can trip myself
and still return the serve."

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:47.553 line:91%
I never have boat
sickness trouble. And I feel-

00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:49.355 line:91%
Moises Alou, that's who it is.
He's not a ...

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:51.224 line:91%
I apologize.
Is he Cuban? No, what is he?

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:52.425 size:66% position:33% line:91%
I remember Moises.
Dominican?

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:53.660 align:start position:0% line:85%
I remember Moises.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:55.762 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Moises Alou used to pee
on his hands instead

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.263 align:end size:81% position:81% line:91%
of having batting gloves.
Where was he born?

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.966 align:end size:81% position:81% line:91%
That was in the era of me
watching baseball.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.267 line:85%
He's Dominican, all right, yeah.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.635 size:84% position:42% line:85%
They're all Dominican, Dan.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:03.870 align:start position:0% line:85%
There's some Cuban.

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.104 align:start position:0% line:85%
Huh?

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:06.306 size:84% position:42% line:85%
There's some Cuban players.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:08.341 align:start position:0% line:91%
If you see ones that are
frustrated to be wearing shoes,

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.575 align:start position:0% line:85%
they're Dominican.

00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:11.311 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah, right.

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:13.780 align:start position:0% line:85%
Thank you, black love.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.381 size:75% position:38% line:91%
He revealed that during
baseball season-

00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:16.883 align:end size:75% position:75% line:91%
Why you have to keep me
so constricted?

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.117 align:start position:0% line:85%
I try to play baseball.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.154 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Le ball by my feet.
I try to play baseball-

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.388 align:start position:0% line:85%
He says he urinates-

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:23.923 line:85%
Ask the Dominicans, the upswing.

00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:26.826 align:start position:0% line:91%
I try to play baseball
and you make me wear these shoe.

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:28.261 size:84% position:42% line:85%
I put this bag on the ball.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.263 line:85%
So instead, I pee on my hands.

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:33.333 size:88% position:44% line:91%
So in protest,
I take a pees on my hand

00:05:33.366 --> 00:05:34.934 size:88% position:44% line:91%
and then my hand
get rough and calloused.

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.135 align:start position:0% line:85%
Moises is-

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:37.370 size:84% position:42% line:85%
Then I hold the bat better.

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:38.671 align:start position:0% line:85%
He said the bat better.

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:41.574 size:88% position:44% line:91%
He says he sounds
like a terrible teammate.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:43.643 size:84% position:42% line:91%
'Cause he used to not
only pee on his hands-

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.545 line:85%
He was always into high fives.

00:05:45.578 --> 00:05:47.580 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Yeah, high fiving
like a son bitch.

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:50.717 line:91%
He was peeing on his own hands,
he was mega into high fives.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.585 size:88% position:44% line:91%
And pranking teammates
while they were sleeping

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:56.122 size:78% position:39% line:91%
in the locker room.
He go, "High five."

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:57.657 line:91%
You go, "No, Moises,
I'm not falling for that."

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.891 align:start position:0% line:85%
Come on, high five.

00:05:58.924 --> 00:06:00.226 size:81% position:41% line:91%
High five.
What's the big deal.

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.895 line:91%
I pee on my hand to give them
better grip on the bat.

00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:05.064 size:78% position:39% line:91%
You want me to hold
your plate of food?

00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:06.432 align:start position:0% line:85%
I have a good grip.

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:07.934 size:72% position:36% line:91%
Hey, you want half
of my sandwich?

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:09.168 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Yeah.
I see you looking at it.

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.903 align:start position:0% line:85%
I have a good grip.

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:13.806 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Go on, take the sandwich
if you can.

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:15.308 size:72% position:36% line:91%
Moises, stop peeing
on your hands.

00:06:15.341 --> 00:06:17.377 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I would do it
in front of people.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.578 size:88% position:44% line:85%
I could never play on a team

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.480 size:81% position:41% line:91%
where the guy's
pissing on his hands.

00:06:21.247 --> 00:06:23.049 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Yeah, you could
if he was hitting 365.

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:24.417 size:66% position:33% line:91%
You'd be fucking fine
with it.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.119 line:91%
I'd go over to it like it was
a natural spring

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:27.320 size:81% position:41% line:91%
and be like,
give me some of that,

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:29.355 align:start position:0% line:85%
Moises.

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:29.355 line:92%
Moises.

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:31.424 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I go this is purified
by your sweet kidneys.

00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:32.825 align:start position:0% line:85%
This is warm.

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:35.795 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Wow, man, someone had
asparagus for lunch.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:37.730 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Yeah. You go how tough
are my hands gonna be

00:06:37.763 --> 00:06:40.233 line:91%
when it's another dude's piss?
Are you gonna-

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.335 size:81% position:41% line:85%
Have you been mixing piss?

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.670 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Have you been mixing my piss
with another man piss?

00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:45.872 align:start position:0% line:85%
That's dangerous.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.140 line:85%
That's dangerous game you play.

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.374 align:start position:0% line:85%
Dangerous game, man.

00:06:48.407 --> 00:06:50.843 line:91%
You're dancing, you're walking
a very tight rope.

00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.981 line:91%
Why is this just written down.
Can I say it?

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:56.482 size:84% position:42% line:85%
'Cause I couldn't remember-

00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:57.750 align:start position:0% line:85%
I love wake up.

00:06:57.783 --> 00:06:59.051 align:start position:0% line:85%
I found out after.

00:06:59.084 --> 00:07:01.087 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Wake up is evil Jacob,
is the Wario for Jacob.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.388 align:start position:0% line:85%
He loves it.

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:04.123 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Wake up, that's his
diabolical laugh

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:05.391 size:84% position:42% line:85%
with the Sebastian tickets.

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:06.592 size:75% position:38% line:85%
Oh, with curly mustache?

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.162 size:84% position:42% line:91%
But look at it. It's Jacob
with a curly mustache.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:12.298 line:91%
Someone's gonna make an evil
Jacob online now, for sure.

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.634 size:84% position:42% line:91%
You have to.
Wake up the evil Jacob.

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:17.003 line:85%
Look at his evil handwriting.

00:07:17.036 --> 00:07:20.440 align:start position:0% line:91%
You can tell it's like a ...
and it says Lou's Facebook scam.

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:22.008 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'm so excited.

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:25.878 line:91%
Oh, it says ... mine says,
Lou's scam, Facebook chick.

00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.481 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Okay, mine's
Lou's Facebook scam.

00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:31.717 line:91%
Which means yet again,
fucking all thumbs over here.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.952 align:start position:0% line:85%
Dude-

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.187 align:start position:0% line:85%
Old swipey swiperton-

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.589 size:84% position:42% line:85%
This wobbly legged gazelle.

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:38.458 line:91%
He's getting caught
by every predator out there.

00:07:38.491 --> 00:07:40.293 line:85%
I mean Jesus Christ. He is ...

00:07:41.093 --> 00:07:43.529 align:start position:0% line:91%
Lou, you are out there
in the world looking for broads.

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:45.498 align:start position:0% line:85%
I love it.

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.233 line:85%
I love an evil Jacob segment.

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:51.237 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah, really. So evil.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.074 size:88% position:44% line:91%
It's just fucking got it
deep down in his plumbs.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:57.577 align:start position:0% line:85%
Lou.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.612 line:91%
Do you want to explain yourself?
Or do you want us-

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:00.746 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Hang on, I'll be
honest with you,

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:02.048 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I'll shut up for
the next four minutes

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:03.583 line:85%
and listen to the whole song.

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.551 line:91%
I'll pee on my hands.
You think I'm afraid of it?

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:06.786 line:85%
You all sits on my hands here.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:08.054 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Hang on, let me
pull this thing out.

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:09.255 size:69% position:34% line:91%
All right, you guys,
give me some.

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:10.490 align:start position:0% line:85%
First off.

00:08:09.288 --> 00:08:10.490 line:92%
All right.

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:11.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
Get it going.
Hang on. I'm thinking about it.

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:13.059 align:start position:0% line:85%
Don't look at me.

00:08:13.092 --> 00:08:14.494 line:91%
I'm gonna put my hand
in my glass of water here.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:16.128 line:91%
There it is.
Let me get some on my hands.

00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:17.997 size:78% position:39% line:85%
There it is. Right there.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.232 align:start position:0% line:85%
Jacob, get in this.

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.533 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Jacob, you want
a little bit, Jacob?

00:08:20.566 --> 00:08:21.901 size:88% position:44% line:91%
You feeling
your grip's loose, Jacob?

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:23.169 size:66% position:33% line:91%
Get some of this
right here.

00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:24.370 align:start position:0% line:91%
Christine, tell me you
won't have a better mouse grip.

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:25.638 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh, who am I kidding?

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:26.873 size:72% position:36% line:91%
You probably bathe
in this stuff.

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:28.107 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:28.107 line:92%
Lou.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.575 size:88% position:44% line:85%
Oh, Christine showers in it.

00:08:29.608 --> 00:08:30.810 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:33.713 line:91%
Christine just has an exterior
skeleton of piss from you.

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:35.047 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.049 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Day time's for water,
evening's for the urine.

00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:38.851 line:85%
Yeah. Christine's like a knight.

00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:40.686 line:91%
Yeah, she gets
a clear shower in the day.

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:41.888 size:72% position:36% line:91%
Golden shower
in the evening.

00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.122 size:81% position:41% line:85%
Oh, man, [Vekion 00:08:43]

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:45.191 size:88% position:44% line:91%
and I should start peeing
on each other. You know?

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:47.493 line:91%
I don't know, this is exactly
what Peter Cetera had in mind

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:48.728 size:66% position:33% line:91%
when he penned
this song.

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:50.897 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah. Men sharing pee.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.198 align:start position:0% line:85%
I don't wanna lose you.

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:53.399 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Well, he's worried
he's gonna lose her

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:54.867 size:84% position:42% line:91%
because he's presented now
that he's into peeing.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.068 line:85%
Yup. Then it starts building.

00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.303 line:85%
And she's not taking it, yeah.

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:58.538 line:85%
Building, building, building.

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.506 align:end size:88% position:88% line:91%
She's walking out the door,
but she's like, "Hmm."

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:01.974 size:72% position:36% line:91%
It's funny, she reaches
for the door,

00:09:02.007 --> 00:09:03.209 align:start position:0% line:85%
she grabs the doorknob,

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:06.212 line:91%
and her hand slips.
Will fight for your honor.

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:07.947 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah, he lets her know.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:11.150 line:91%
Then he offers up,
he points down to his penis.

00:09:11.183 --> 00:09:12.351 align:start position:0% line:85%
Okay.

00:09:12.384 --> 00:09:14.086 size:69% position:34% line:91%
And he starts a nice
thick stream.

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.790 size:75% position:38% line:91%
And while he's going,
she reaches down

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:20.393 size:78% position:39% line:85%
and gets her hands in it,

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:23.462 line:91%
grabs the doorknob,
turns it on the first try,

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:25.998 size:78% position:39% line:91%
opens it, looks out,
looks back at him.

00:09:26.599 --> 00:09:28.100 align:start position:0% line:85%
Closes the door, stays.

00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:31.804 line:91%
And goes and hits 350 in her
softball league that year.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:33.039 align:start position:0% line:85%
It's unbelievable.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.407 line:85%
'Cause that grip, it's airtight.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.675 align:start position:0% line:85%
That goddamn grip.

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.977 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Airtight. It's like
wearing an Easton glove.

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:40.413 size:75% position:38% line:85%
Fucking grip it, rip it.

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:41.948 line:91%
It's like stick em.
It's like back in the 80s.

00:09:41.981 --> 00:09:43.149 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:44.984 size:72% position:36% line:91%
You're just putting tar
on your bat.

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:48.020 size:78% position:39% line:91%
It's got that tar grip
'cause of his piss.

00:09:48.053 --> 00:09:49.755 line:85%
Lou, how did you get scammed?

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:52.692 align:end size:72% position:72% line:91%
I tried to buy a Jetta
on Facebook.

00:09:52.725 --> 00:09:55.027 size:88% position:44% line:85%
Oh, no, what? Also, a Jetta?

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.228 size:88% position:44% line:85%
Why were you buying a Jetta?

00:09:56.261 --> 00:09:59.465 line:91%
Are you giving a teenage girl
a quinceañera present?

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:01.834 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I didn't know you were
an Applebee's hostess.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:04.337 align:start position:0% line:85%
Are you and your girl-

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.573 line:91%
You put one of those Roxy hearts
on the back of your fucking car?

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:09.709 line:91%
Are you girls going to the beach
and just dancing tonight?

00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.377 size:81% position:41% line:85%
But just dancing, no guys.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.678 size:78% position:39% line:91%
No guys.
We're just dancing.

00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:13.946 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh, my god.

00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:16.048 line:91%
Let me guess, you gotta go smoke
one of your Newport Lights

00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:17.783 size:72% position:36% line:91%
around the corner
and steam off.

00:10:18.551 --> 00:10:20.586 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Are you going beach towel
shopping?

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:22.355 align:end size:78% position:78% line:91%
Are you and your friends
gonna ride around

00:10:22.388 --> 00:10:24.957 line:91%
with the top down and
wearing oversized sunglasses?

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.259 size:78% position:39% line:91%
You just gonna blare
your Sister Hazel?

00:10:27.292 --> 00:10:28.995 align:start position:0% line:85%
And just drive around?

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:31.464 align:start position:0% line:85%
Hey, it's me Lou.

00:10:31.497 --> 00:10:33.566 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Me and the gals
are gonna head out.

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:36.802 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Girls day.
I mean a real girls day.

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:39.171 line:85%
No guys, put the phones away.

00:10:39.204 --> 00:10:41.907 line:91%
We're gonna eat what we want,
buy what we want.

00:10:42.808 --> 00:10:45.978 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Come on.
The future is feminine.

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:49.915 line:91%
Oh, girls, promise me, let's all
buy these best friend pendants

00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:51.517 size:78% position:39% line:85%
that breaks in four ways.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.620 size:81% position:41% line:91%
You bitch, those jeans
look perfect on you.

00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:57.323 size:81% position:41% line:91%
We're going
to the Teaneck Mall.

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:02.962 align:start position:0% line:91%
Is it a little tawdry?
Sure, but you know, it's Friday.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:04.697 size:81% position:41% line:85%
Yeah. Lou, why did you ...

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:06.565 size:84% position:42% line:91%
were you just in the market
for a car?

00:11:06.598 --> 00:11:08.167 size:88% position:44% line:85%
Are you trying to buy a car?

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.203 line:91%
I mean I enjoy the bus a lot,
I swear to god. But-

00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:12.438 align:start position:0% line:85%
Come on, buddy.

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.273 size:78% position:39% line:91%
It just presented itself.
This idea.

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:17.677 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Somebody posted
on our hometown group,

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.911 size:78% position:39% line:91%
those of us
from the same town.

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:20.212 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:21.681 size:81% position:41% line:91%
You're in a Facebook group
from your hometown?

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:22.882 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:24.216 line:85%
I've never heard of that either.

00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:25.851 align:start position:0% line:85%
You are too?

00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:25.851 line:92%
No.

00:11:25.884 --> 00:11:27.620 line:85%
You guys don't about community?

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:29.255 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I'm on Facebook,
but I don't go on it.

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:32.692 line:91%
But you're on ... no, no, no.
He's on a group.

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:33.926 align:start position:0% line:85%
No, I know. I'm not ...

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:35.127 align:start position:0% line:85%
That's like-

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.896 size:84% position:42% line:85%
That's a crazy subcategory.

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:39.565 size:78% position:39% line:91%
He's with people
from near Teaneck.

00:11:39.598 --> 00:11:41.534 size:81% position:41% line:91%
What, you don't have a ...
yeah.

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:42.735 align:start position:0% line:85%
Exactly.

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.036 line:85%
Teaneck adjacent Facebook group?

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:45.237 line:85%
Am I part of groups on Facebook?

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.973 line:91%
I am, but that was like
the first week of Facebook.

00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:49.275 size:75% position:38% line:85%
You don't know anything.

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:50.676 line:91%
Literally, I'd say
I've never looked at them.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:51.911 align:start position:0% line:85%
I've never gone back-

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.179 size:78% position:39% line:91%
What if you found out
I was the president

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:54.413 size:75% position:38% line:85%
of a local Aurora thing?

00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:56.816 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Where I'm like what's haps
with Dan Soder?

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:58.617 size:75% position:38% line:85%
You see me doing videos.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.686 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Hi, what's up guys,
this week in Aurora

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:02.521 size:78% position:39% line:91%
at America's Bar
and Grill on Iliff,

00:12:02.554 --> 00:12:05.024 size:81% position:41% line:91%
you can get chicken wings
again for five cents.

00:12:05.057 --> 00:12:07.393 align:start position:0% line:91%
Shout out to all the alumni
from the Rusty Wolf High School

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:08.694 align:start position:0% line:85%
that you went to.

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:09.895 align:start position:0% line:85%
Smokey Hill.

00:12:09.928 --> 00:12:11.130 line:85%
Yeah, Rusty ... what did I say?

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:12.431 align:start position:0% line:85%
Go Buffs.

00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:13.666 align:start position:0% line:85%
Rusty Hook?

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:15.034 align:start position:0% line:85%
Smokey Hill.

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:16.702 align:start position:0% line:85%
Rusty Wolf.

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:19.939 line:91%
Hey, man. Dude, it was right
outside the dildo bike factory.

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:21.574 align:start position:0% line:85%
That's my hard living.

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:23.142 size:75% position:38% line:91%
You come out of work
and then go over

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:25.511 line:91%
and help your old man build
dildo bikes til he retired.

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:27.179 line:91%
I had to help him put the cocks
on the seats.

00:12:27.212 --> 00:12:28.413 align:start position:0% line:85%
He'd hand you a-

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:30.416 line:91%
That's like putting a star
on a Christmas tree every day.

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:32.318 size:78% position:39% line:91%
He'd hand you a wrench
in your left hand,

00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:33.753 size:78% position:39% line:91%
take a hot piss
in your right hand.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:37.890 line:91%
He said, "Son, right the bike.
Does it fit real tight?"

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:41.894 align:start position:0% line:85%
I was a daddy's boy.

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:46.999 align:end size:88% position:88% line:91%
You're loose like your mom,
you're not a good gage.

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:50.069 size:72% position:36% line:91%
I'm trying to calibrate
this thing.

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:53.305 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I'm making it for people
who aren't size queens.

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.444 size:69% position:34% line:91%
Your dad calling you
a size queen

00:12:58.477 --> 00:13:00.746 size:81% position:41% line:91%
has to be one of the most
emasculating things.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.414 align:start position:0% line:91%
If I had a kid
and I got into a fight with him,

00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:03.682 line:85%
if I had like a 13 year old son-

00:13:03.715 --> 00:13:06.051 line:91%
Damn, son, you're butt hole's
chewing that thing right up.

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:08.621 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Oh, nom, nom, nom.
I'm sorry PAC-Man.

00:13:10.756 --> 00:13:12.691 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Jesus Christ, what are you?
A python?

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:16.595 line:91%
What was going on?
Why were you buying a Jetta?

00:13:16.628 --> 00:13:18.998 line:91%
Were you gonna drive a 14 year
old girl to get an abortion?

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.833 align:start position:0% line:91%
Are you following
Dave Matthews Band on the road?

00:13:20.866 --> 00:13:22.568 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:27.306 line:91%
Oh, it's got good gas mileage
and a boy's dream.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.376 align:end size:78% position:78% line:91%
Oh, the price was right,
was low mileage,

00:13:30.409 --> 00:13:33.112 size:78% position:39% line:91%
it still smells like girl
in a boy's dream.

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:36.448 size:78% position:39% line:91%
And rear and side sensors
and dual airbags.

00:13:36.481 --> 00:13:37.750 align:start position:0% line:85%
Not a chance.

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:38.951 align:start position:0% line:85%
And a boy's dream.

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:40.352 line:85%
Probably got roll down windows.

00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:41.654 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.689 line:91%
Facebook scam. What did it say?
What year was it, Lou?

00:13:43.722 --> 00:13:44.890 align:start position:0% line:85%
2008.

00:13:44.923 --> 00:13:46.125 align:start position:0% line:85%
Your 2008 Jetta.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.359 align:start position:0% line:85%
It's 11 years old.

00:13:47.392 --> 00:13:49.528 size:78% position:39% line:85%
So you see it in a group.

00:13:49.561 --> 00:13:51.931 align:start position:0% line:85%
And somebody posted,

00:13:51.964 --> 00:13:54.033 line:91%
"This is for my sister,
she doesn't have Facebook.

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:56.202 size:69% position:34% line:91%
Give her an email."
Which I did.

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.870 size:78% position:39% line:91%
She said, you gotta
buy it off of eBay

00:13:57.903 --> 00:13:59.471 size:84% position:42% line:85%
if you want it off from me.

00:13:59.504 --> 00:14:01.407 size:78% position:39% line:91%
You can only pay
in eBay gift cards.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.242 size:84% position:42% line:91%
That's weird.
That's suspect as shit.

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:04.910 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Well, the whole thing
was just a gay check

00:14:04.943 --> 00:14:07.546 size:88% position:44% line:91%
to see what guys were gonna
respond to buy the Jetta.

00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:10.683 line:91%
Also, you gotta go on Amazon and
pick your favorite lip gloss.

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:14.286 line:91%
He's like, it was a whole thing
I had to do.

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:16.822 line:91%
Then I had to go say
my favorite pattern of dress.

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:18.991 align:start position:0% line:85%
I had to-

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:20.226 size:81% position:41% line:85%
My favorite bracelet link.

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:23.495 line:91%
I had to email her a seductive
dance video of me

00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:26.498 size:84% position:42% line:91%
doing some late 90s
to early 2000s R and B.

00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:29.468 size:84% position:42% line:85%
I had to write a soliloquy.

00:14:30.636 --> 00:14:32.705 line:85%
A lot of hoops for this Jetta.

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:35.007 line:91%
Did you ... when did you know
you were being scammed?

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.242 align:start position:0% line:85%
Did you give her money?

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:38.811 align:end size:84% position:84% line:91%
No, but I gave her my info
and my phone number.

00:14:38.844 --> 00:14:40.546 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Andy told him
he was being scammed.

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:41.780 align:start position:0% line:85%
That's when I stopped.

00:14:41.813 --> 00:14:43.215 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Mark face Andy said,
"You're being scammed."

00:14:43.248 --> 00:14:44.450 align:start position:0% line:85%
He had to tell him.

00:14:44.483 --> 00:14:46.085 line:91%
Yeah. He's like, "Dude, stop,
don't call them."

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.654 align:end size:72% position:72% line:91%
I just want you to buy
my Jetta, BB.

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:50.389 align:start position:0% line:85%
BB, it's me Bunny.

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:53.993 line:91%
It's Bunny,
why can't you buy BB, Bunny?

00:14:54.026 --> 00:14:56.662 align:end size:81% position:81% line:91%
I need it. He's like, oh,
I'll be your hero.

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:59.732 size:84% position:42% line:91%
This Jetta was once
owned by Mike McCready.

00:14:59.765 --> 00:15:01.734 size:78% position:39% line:91%
He's like, hold on, what?
What the fuck?

00:15:01.767 --> 00:15:04.069 align:end size:88% position:88% line:91%
It's the advertising thing,
they know him so well.

If I was to Google,
Mike McCready drove this Jetta.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.341 size:75% position:38% line:91%
What the fuck
did you just say?

00:15:09.374 --> 00:15:12.711 line:91%
And it's up here in my local
Facebook group from New Jersey?

00:15:12.744 --> 00:15:14.613 line:85%
From near Teaneck, New Jersey?

00:15:14.646 --> 00:15:16.615 size:88% position:44% line:91%
He goes, this car was kicked
in the rims

00:15:16.648 --> 00:15:19.218 size:84% position:42% line:91%
by an angry Eddie Vedder
when the turn was made

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:20.619 line:85%
while the walk signal was going.

00:15:20.652 --> 00:15:22.721 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Hey, man, I'm crossing
the street here.

00:15:22.754 --> 00:15:25.224 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Hey, man, pedestrians
in the road too, kayak.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:27.192 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I'm drinking my wine
across the street.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.862 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Trying to get to
ukulele practice.

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:33.999 line:91%
Lou, how much was she
asking for in eBay credit?

00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:35.634 align:start position:0% line:85%
One grand.

00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:35.634 line:92%
1000.

00:15:35.667 --> 00:15:36.869 align:start position:0% line:85%
For a car?

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.537 line:91%
I know. It seems like too good
to be true, eh?

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.738 align:start position:0% line:85%
Well, it is.

00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:41.473 line:91%
It is.
It was too good to be true.

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:43.409 line:91%
I know you bought
eBay gift cards for somebody.

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:45.311 line:91%
I was going to. I was on my way
to the store.

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.545 size:78% position:39% line:85%
No, you were ... come on.

00:15:46.578 --> 00:15:47.813 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh, my fucking god.

00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:49.548 line:85%
To investigate, to investigate.

00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:51.083 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Well, this is-
If eBay gift cards exist?

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:52.384 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah, they do.

00:15:52.417 --> 00:15:54.253 line:91%
Are you gonna walk to the store
and not buy them?

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:56.188 line:91%
All right, I'll see if these
things exist, I'll buy them.

00:15:56.221 --> 00:15:57.423 align:start position:0% line:85%
But I don't know.

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:59.391 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Can I speak to the manager
of this CVS?

00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:01.293 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Are these real?
Are these things real?

00:16:01.326 --> 00:16:02.494 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Right now,
I just wanna make sure.

00:16:02.527 --> 00:16:03.896 size:78% position:39% line:91%
'Cause a girl told me
she'd give me a car

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:05.130 size:81% position:41% line:85%
if I bought these for her.

00:16:05.163 --> 00:16:06.365 line:85%
He goes, $1000. The guy goes,

00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:07.599 size:81% position:41% line:91%
"For a Jetta?
That's a good deal."

00:16:07.632 --> 00:16:08.801 size:72% position:36% line:91%
That's a good deal.
I'd say do it.

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:09.668 align:start position:0% line:85%
I say, there you go.

00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:10.903 size:69% position:34% line:91%
Where'd you see this
on Facebook?

00:16:10.936 --> 00:16:12.204 size:84% position:42% line:91%
He goes-
In your hometown group?

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:14.540 line:91%
You go on your hometown group?
On Facebook?

00:16:14.573 --> 00:16:17.276 line:91%
He's unlocking the case
with them and he goes, "What?"

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.244 size:84% position:42% line:91%
All right.
That's a little weird.

00:16:19.277 --> 00:16:20.512 size:72% position:36% line:91%
I don't think I can
sell you this.

00:16:20.545 --> 00:16:22.247 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Son, are you
on methamphetamines?

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.951 line:85%
So where do you stand right now?

00:16:25.984 --> 00:16:27.252 size:84% position:42% line:85%
I blocked and reported her.

00:16:27.285 --> 00:16:28.487 size:56% position:28% line:91%
You reported her?
Nice.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.922 line:85%
No, I just blocked her and I-

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:31.223 size:81% position:41% line:91%
You reported her
to the actual group.

00:16:31.256 --> 00:16:32.624 align:start position:0% line:85%
Hey, group.

00:16:32.657 --> 00:16:35.427 line:91%
Hey, everybody outside Teaneck,
this girls such a bitch.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.129 size:78% position:39% line:85%
Hey, it's Lou, the pearl.

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:40.366 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Why don't you try
to fight the guy ...

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.068 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Who posted it?
The guy who posted it?

00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:44.303 size:84% position:42% line:85%
Do you know where he lives?

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:45.504 align:start position:0% line:85%
It's a woman and-

00:16:45.537 --> 00:16:46.739 align:start position:0% line:85%
It was for her sister?

00:16:46.772 --> 00:16:48.374 line:91%
She had a few mutual friends,
yeah.

00:16:48.407 --> 00:16:49.775 size:81% position:41% line:91%
But her sister
wasn't on there, but-

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:51.443 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Why don't you do
some investigation now

00:16:51.476 --> 00:16:53.345 line:91%
and find out who this mother
fucker was trying to scam you?

00:16:53.378 --> 00:16:54.713 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Yeah, let's exploit.
Let's go to the top.

00:16:54.746 --> 00:16:55.981 line:85%
Could kick her in the snatch.

00:16:56.014 --> 00:16:57.483 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Why don't we do a
Bonfire investigation?

00:16:57.516 --> 00:16:58.684 size:81% position:41% line:85%
Take down this whole ring?

00:16:58.717 --> 00:16:59.952 align:start position:0% line:85%
Justice. All right.

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:02.988 line:91%
While she sleeps, we'll release
cockroaches into her ear.

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:06.191 line:91%
With earwax.
Have them coated in earwax.

00:17:06.224 --> 00:17:08.260 align:end size:72% position:72% line:91%
Yeah, we'll shove them
in pre-waxed.

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:10.829 align:start position:0% line:91%
Here's what we'll do.
We'll get all our earwax pulled

00:17:10.862 --> 00:17:12.331 size:88% position:44% line:91%
and then slather
these roaches in earwax.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.999 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Jake, we're gonna have to
keep that at your house.

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:15.534 line:91%
Yeah. We're gonna have to put
that and your refrigerator.

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:16.802 size:81% position:41% line:91%
We're gonna have to keep
that in your fridge.

00:17:16.835 --> 00:17:17.669 align:start position:0% line:85%
Cockroaches-

00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:18.503 size:75% position:38% line:91%
I don't have fridge room
right now.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:19.738 size:69% position:34% line:91%
You know I'm doing
a meal plan.

00:17:19.771 --> 00:17:22.975 line:91%
Come on. You know I got
my quinoa and lamb portions.

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:25.277 size:84% position:42% line:85%
You know I got my portions.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.812 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I have my portion control.

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:28.614 size:81% position:41% line:91%
So then yeah,
we'll take her down.

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:30.582 align:start position:0% line:85%
I love it.

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:30.582 line:92%
Okay.

00:17:30.615 --> 00:17:31.850 align:start position:0% line:85%
I love the idea.

00:17:31.883 --> 00:17:33.052 size:75% position:38% line:85%
Do you still want to ...

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:34.520 size:69% position:34% line:91%
are you still looking
for a Jetta?

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.821 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Was it a Jetta
'cause it was $1000?

00:17:35.854 --> 00:17:39.024 size:81% position:41% line:85%
Or were you like, finally?

00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:41.026 line:85%
I don't know a lot about cars.

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:42.294 size:75% position:38% line:85%
You're like, oh, my god,

00:17:42.327 --> 00:17:44.430 size:78% position:39% line:91%
do I get to keep
the pink sunglasses

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:46.165 size:69% position:34% line:91%
hanging from the rear
view mirror?

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.101 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Can I keep the class
of 2008 forever?

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:53.672 size:81% position:41% line:91%
The scrunchie on
the steering column.

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:56.141 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Do I have to wash off
the soap that says RIP

00:17:56.174 --> 00:17:58.043 align:start position:0% line:85%
Carmine, forever young?

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:01.080 size:75% position:38% line:85%
Did I mention that part?

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:03.015 size:88% position:44% line:91%
The car is so cheap
because her husband died.

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.216 align:start position:0% line:85%
In it?

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.451 align:start position:0% line:85%
Wow.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.451 line:92%
Not in it.

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:06.952 size:69% position:34% line:91%
Oh, that'd be great.
Cooked alive.

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.187 align:start position:0% line:85%
He OD'd in the back.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.755 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Yeah, so his ghost
is gonna bother you.

00:18:09.788 --> 00:18:11.156 size:81% position:41% line:91%
His ghost is gonna
back seat drive you.

00:18:11.189 --> 00:18:12.491 line:91%
'Cause now if you're wondering
why this

00:18:12.524 --> 00:18:13.759 size:81% position:41% line:91%
is too good
of a deal to be true,

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:16.795 line:91%
he goes, it is slightly haunted
by my dead husband.

00:18:17.796 --> 00:18:20.032 size:81% position:41% line:91%
How are you in the market
for a haunted Jetta?

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:22.134 size:84% position:42% line:91%
He changes the channels
to the music he likes.

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:23.869 size:75% position:38% line:85%
He was into country pop.

00:18:23.902 --> 00:18:25.838 size:72% position:36% line:91%
The fluid will be blood
sometimes.

00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:28.407 size:81% position:41% line:91%
That is him
manipulating the car.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.808 size:72% position:36% line:91%
It will break
on the highway.

00:18:29.841 --> 00:18:31.643 line:91%
You'll put your air conditioner
on, it'll come out hot.

00:18:31.676 --> 00:18:32.845 size:84% position:42% line:91%
It is.
Every once in a while.

00:18:32.878 --> 00:18:34.379 size:69% position:34% line:91%
Sometimes the screams
of the damned

00:18:34.412 --> 00:18:35.613 size:72% position:36% line:91%
will come through
your speakers.

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:38.083 line:91%
He goes, once in a while,
you're gonna push the button,

00:18:38.116 --> 00:18:39.618 size:78% position:39% line:91%
you're gonna push
the lever to squirt

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:41.653 line:91%
up the windshield washer fluid
and bees are gonna shoot out.

00:18:41.686 --> 00:18:42.855 size:81% position:41% line:85%
He goes, if bees or blood,

00:18:42.888 --> 00:18:44.790 size:69% position:34% line:91%
that's what we have
in the fluid.

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:47.893 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Also know that the car
will pin in gas,

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:50.362 size:84% position:42% line:91%
sometimes on a highway
while you're by a cop.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:51.964 line:85%
Good new though, if it kills,

00:18:51.997 --> 00:18:53.565 size:88% position:44% line:91%
it's gonna seek out
your particular enemies.

00:18:53.598 --> 00:18:54.867 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah, so it does-

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.336 line:91%
You saw somebody in Christine,
the funny, the Stephen King car.

00:18:57.369 --> 00:18:58.637 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:01.206 line:91%
Here's the thing, it is gonna
run down your enemies.

00:19:01.239 --> 00:19:03.075 size:81% position:41% line:91%
So that's cool.
So that is a benefit.

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:04.576 size:75% position:38% line:85%
Also, great gas mileage.

00:19:04.609 --> 00:19:06.678 align:start position:0% line:91%
You don't have to be there.
You don't even have to be there.

00:19:06.711 --> 00:19:07.880 size:88% position:44% line:85%
The car will leave at night.

00:19:07.913 --> 00:19:10.048 line:91%
You're sleeping,
it's eliminating your foes.

00:19:10.081 --> 00:19:11.383 size:88% position:44% line:85%
What was that you're saying?

00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:13.252 size:75% position:38% line:91%
What happens if it gets
into an accident?

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:14.486 align:start position:0% line:85%
It fixes itself.

00:19:14.519 --> 00:19:17.089 line:91%
Yeah, by the way, there is flesh
underneath the ...

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:21.093 size:84% position:42% line:91%
oh, god no, this car is ...
the car does bleed.

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:24.229 line:91%
The car does bleed. He goes,
there is a ribcage underneath.

00:19:24.262 --> 00:19:25.464 size:78% position:39% line:85%
There's a lot to explain.

00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:26.832 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Basically, if you buy,
you're buying as is.

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:28.066 align:start position:0% line:85%
If you-

00:19:28.099 --> 00:19:29.334 line:85%
No one's gonna work on this car.

00:19:29.367 --> 00:19:33.205 line:91%
If you nap in the car, you will
be woken up by heartbeat.

00:19:33.238 --> 00:19:34.540 align:start position:0% line:85%
It is terrifying.

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:35.974 size:84% position:42% line:91%
He goes, if anything
happens to the engine,

00:19:36.007 --> 00:19:37.309 size:75% position:38% line:91%
you are gonna have to go
to some sort of

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:40.379 size:88% position:44% line:91%
a warlock mechanic combo,
which I have yet to see.

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:43.081 line:91%
Good luck. They have one at
