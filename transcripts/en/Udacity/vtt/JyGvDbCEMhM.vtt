00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.475
Congratulations. You've made it to the end of lesson one.

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:04.555
&gt;&gt; Believe it or not, you've learned a lot already.

00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:07.890
&gt;&gt; You've learned about the tools that you use to write programs, and you've

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.855
written your first program.

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:12.160
&gt;&gt; You've also learned how to structure your thoughts. So you can write pseudocode

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.800
and algorithms that a computer can understand. You now speak the basics of the

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.504
secret language.

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:20.400
&gt;&gt; In the next lesson you'll learn how to write interesting programs with

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.350
pictures, text and dates.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.019
&gt;&gt; Not those kinds of dates. We look forward to seeing you there.
