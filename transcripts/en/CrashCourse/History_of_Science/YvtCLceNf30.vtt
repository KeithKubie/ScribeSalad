00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.380
Hello, and welcome to our new series—Crash
Course: History of Science.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.520
My name is Hank Green, and I’ve wanted to
produce this course for years.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.279
I’m obsessed with how people throughout
the ages have uncovered truths about the universe

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.999
and converted these into a wealth of technological
wonders.

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:26.569
This process has decreased the suffering of
millions of humans—even as it’s sparked

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.140
entirely new problems.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.369
Regardless of the outcomes of scientific inquiry,
the process itself is fascinating.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.940
The world you inhabit today is full of gadgets
that once belonged to science fiction.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.609
We can model what the earth looked like millions
of years ago, or zoom in and observe the atoms

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.190
that make up our own bodies.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.660
We are going to tell that inspiring story:
we’ll be thinking about thinking with Aristotle,

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.379
digging canals in Song Dynasty China,

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.989
listening to robot musicians in medieval Turkey,

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.890
fighting an electrical war in New York City,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.579
and discovering the shape of DNA in Cold War
England.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.179
But the history of science is not only a story
of humanity’s collective movement from ignorance

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.420
to knowledge, for two different reasons.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.390
First, as much as scientists today may not
like to admit it, we are still pretty ignorant…

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.229
And we don’t agree on what it would mean
to reach the ultimate Truth, capital T.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.880
Take a big question that we've been asking for a long time like “what is stuff”:

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.580
While modern physicists will tell you that

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.660
stuff is made of atoms, and atoms are made
of quarks and leptons, we still don’t know

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.560
why quarks exist.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.869
Or why there appears to be far more matter
in the universe than we can account for.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.840
Even something as basic as “stuff” needs
a lot more sciencing!

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.079
Second, and more importantly for historians,
“science” isn’t a stable or single idea.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.590
That’s why, in this episode, we’re going
to be thinking about some ways to answer a deceptively

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.200
simple question:

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.600
what is the history of science the history
of?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.480
[intro music plays]

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.829
Today, “science” can mean both our body
of knowledge about the world as well as the

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.230
methods we use to create that knowledge, or
how we know the stuff that we know.

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:13.140
Within that “how,” there are two main
practices—things that we do—that systematically

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.660
generate knowledge:

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.580
One: observe some specific aspect of the world.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.670
For example, Darwin spent decades obsessively
observing the subtle variations in different

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.200
kinds of barnacles, orchids, turtles, birds,
and other living things.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.070
This led him to theorize how they had changed
over time.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.170
My dude loved barnacles!

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.240
Two: conduct an experiment to answer some
question about the world.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.130
Did Galileo drop two metal balls of different
masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, to

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.430
show that they fall at the same rate and disprove
Aristotle’s theory of gravity?

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.430
Probably not.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.000
But Dutch thinkers Simon Stevin and Jan Cornets
de Groot did conduct that experiment soon after.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.640
Today, we have much bigger “towers” for
testing theories in physics: the Large Hadron

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.630
Collider is seventeen miles long!

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.980
Finally, when I said systematically, I meant
that there are rules about observing or experimenting—rules

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.250
that anyone can follow.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.690
That notion of anyone being able to be a scientist
is super important.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.940
In fact, a lot of contemporary scientists
have three Latin words tattooed on their arms:

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.540
“NULLIUS IN VERBA”—“on no one’s
word…”

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.360
Let’s explore this phrase because it's important.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.380
In this series, The Thoughtbubble is going
to bring to life different wonders from the

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.550
history of science.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.750
Today, our wonder is pretty abstract: the
wonder of the reproducible experiment.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.850
“NULLIUS IN VERBA” is the motto of the
Royal Society.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.290
This group of knowledge-makers was founded
in 1660 as a “College for the Promoting

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:42.090
of Physico-Mathematical Experimental Learning”
and re-founded in 1663 as “the Royal Society

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.810
of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge.”

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.430
And it’s still around today!

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.540
The Society was started as a place to debate
new ideas about nature.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.150
Its members demonstrated experiments in front
of each other—“witnessing” the proofs

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.870
behind their theories.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.400
They wrote up these theories in the Society’s
Philosophical Transactions, one of the world’s

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.620
oldest peer-reviewed scientific journals.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.250
Influenced by Francis Bacon’s ideas, which
would eventually become associated with the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.670
“scientific method,” the founding members
of the Royal Society chose a motto with an

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.130
unambiguous meaning:

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.180
don’t believe something just because someone
tells you it’s true.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.459
Test out each new hypothesis, or educated
guess, yourself.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.439
In other words: your individual proof of how
some natural phenomenon works should be something

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.180
that anyone can reproduce.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.849
This idea had an enormous impact on the history
of science.

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.620
Later members of the Royal Society included
stars such as Ike Newton, Ben Franklin, Mike

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.759
Faraday, Chuck Darwin, and even Big Al Einstein,
who was about as British as sauerkraut.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:45.900
In fact—plot twist!—the early scientists
who adopted the creed “NULLIUS IN VERBA”

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.960
were not actually “scientists.”

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.200
They were well-off alchemists and medical doctors,

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.800
and they called themselves Natural Philosophers.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.320
Or, "People who loved truths concerning the world around them."

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.920
Natural philosophy in seventeenth-century
England was sort of like the contemporary

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.090
natural sciences mashed up with medicine,
mathematics, some philosophy–philosophy,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.370
and a whiff of religion.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.439
The word “scientist” was only coined recently,
in historical terms, in the 1830s, and caught

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.780
on around 1840.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.379
It was made up by an English scientist named
William Whewell who was also a historian of

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:19.379
science and a priest.

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.900
So if we only cared about the history of people
called “scientists,” our job would be

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.789
easy: there aren’t any until around 1840!

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.569
And most people called scientists, or natural
philosophers, looked suspiciously similar

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:32.569
to one another.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.539
Take the Royal Society: its members have been,
until recently, almost exclusively rich English

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:38.539
men.

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.449
Even though their ranks have included many
incredibly clever scientists, they haven’t

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.050
represented anything like all knowledge makers.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.699
The sixty-second President of the Royal Society,
biophysicist Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, is

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.750
the group’s first non-white leader.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.919
And there has never been a female President.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.560
But the history of systematically knowing
stuff goes back much further than the Royal

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.909
Society and includes more types of people
than English blokes.

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:06.879
Thus “science” is a historical and social
concept—not one that’s existed forever,

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:08.889
in the same way for all people.

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:12.939
Because the history of science includes many
systems of understanding the world, we have

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:16.020
to consider these systems on their own terms.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.819
It may seem simpler to focus on the “winners”
of history.

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:25.159
But hearing only the big Euroamerican names—Plato,
Einstein—doesn’t teach us as much about

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.319
our global system of science today.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.710
Taking the time to highlight different knowledge
worlds will help us see our own as relatively

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.909
recent, not entirely unified, and evolving.

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:41.340
For example, we’ll learn about the Greco-Latin-Jewish-Arabic
medicine of the medieval Mediterranean world,

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.150
millennia of ayurvedic knowledge across the

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.370
Subcontinent, traditional Chinese medicine,
and Incan “talking knots” and engineering—just

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.849
to name a few.

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.430
Each of these systems has its own social norms
about what count as valid ways to make and

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.500
share knowledge.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.860
We’ll look at modern scientific norms in
a later episode.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.180
And each of these can help us see the “otherness”
of these past or different cultures as not

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.759
so other, after all.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:11.779
We can see natural philosophers and other
proto-scientists as smart people making sense

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:14.599
of their world, not as “bad” scientists.

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.740
They understood the world around them in the
smartest way they could.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.400
For example, according to medieval Mediterranean
medicine, the organ in my head was for venting

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.449
waste heat, not thinking.

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:27.620
People in the past weren’t stupid: they
knew that if your head was chopped off, that

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.810
was curtains for you.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.570
They just weren’t sure what all this weird
gray stuff did.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:36.240
Even today—though we can see a neuron fire
in high-resolution—we struggle to understand

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.249
what really goes on when it fires, that is,
the role a single neuron plays in thinking…

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:44.449
much less answer the question, what is consciousness.

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:49.190
The history of science really gets even juicier
when incremental, nagging questions about

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.569
the natural world add up and cause a scientific
discipline, or an entire society, to change

00:07:54.569 --> 00:07:56.479
in a “revolutionary” way.

00:07:56.479 --> 00:08:00.099
Later in the series, we’ll look at moments
of revolution within the sciences alongside

00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:05.629
philosophers such as Thomas Kuhn and Michel
Foucault, who... did not always agree.

00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:11.099
They show that science isn’t only historical
and social, but constructs entire worlds of

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:14.509
knowledge in which we all find ourselves trapped.

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:16.580
But don’t worry about that just yet.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.629
By learning the history of science, we will
automatically start to think about our own

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:23.940
knowledge world as historical—not finished,
not capital-E enlightened.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.020
Around the world, humans are still actively
working to understand our universe… but

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.129
they don’t all agree on how to do it.

00:08:30.129 --> 00:08:34.890
We may be able to make more accurate models
of natural phenomena… but we may never find

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.680
the ultimate answers we seek.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:42.150
At its limit, the history of science touches
on the study of religion: the diverse and

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.690
changing nature of the never-ending human
search for Truth, capital T.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:51.220
Our path through past knowledge worlds is
going to be a beautiful and powerful one.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.820
There are many, many marvelous insights to
celebrate.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.010
To help us keep our footing as we jump across
centuries and continents, we’re going to

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.100
keep our eyes on five big questions.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.970
Questions that, to this day, we do not have
complete answers to.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.070
First: what is stuff?

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.760
From atoms to dark matter to spacetime: what
are things made of?

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.450
“Things,” by the way, includes air, fire,
and outer space:

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.120
if you think I’m going to sit here and not
celebrate the death of phlogiston with you,

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.590
you’re sorely mistaken!

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.660
Number two: what is Life?

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.390
What’s the simplest way to define living
things?

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.400
Are viruses alive?

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.780
Is the earth alive?

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.460
Where did life come from?

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.550
Where did current organisms come from?

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.580
How do we understand their interactions with
each other and their world?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.490
Three: where are we?

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.170
What is this place, the earth?

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.700
What is its place in the cosmos?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.410
Is this the only universe?

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.890
Four: when are we?

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.960
More questions of scale: how long have we
been around?

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960
What about living things?

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.200
What about the whole universe?

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.890
What came before that?

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.680
And five: how can we agree on what we know?

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.210
And how can I convince more people that the
stuff I know is accurate?

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:05.320
For example, how can I show anti-vaccers that
vaccines are necessary!?

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.100
Regarding technology, how should we talk about
what to do what our knowledge?

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.790
All of these questions have been considered
by people as far back as records exist.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.300
They also remain active areas of study today.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:22.000
But the last theme is so important that it
gets its the final section.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.040
Humans have always tried to describe the world,
for lots of reasons: in part because it’s

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.310
fascinating (“magnets—how do they work!?”),
and in part to control it.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.460
Knowledge, as they told us in grade school,
really is power!

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.960
The power that knowing stuff gives the knower
is exactly why we should study the history

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.960
of science.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:46.960
Thus one goal of this course is to highlight how the values (beliefs about  right and wrong) and ethics (acceptable behaviors)

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.240
of scientists and engineers shape our world.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.680
And how, conversely, sciences and technologies are shaped by the societies that produce them.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.840
We have a responsibility as citizens to understand

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.120
and to act accordingly.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.110
Our world today looks radically dissimilar
to that of three hundred years ago.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:08.040
To quote Andy Weir, we’ve “scienced”
the heck out of it.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.270
We learned about stuff, made new technologies,
and are currently scrambling to learn new

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.440
stuff to solve the problems that our old technologies
created.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.390
Facing an utterly unprecedented total ecological
catastrophe, we may need to “science”

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.630
it even more, in one way or another.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.220
We’ll talk more about this in future episodes.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.580
Learning the history of science can help shine
a light on this dark future.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.990
Next time—pack your spanakopita: we’re
heading to ancient Greece to invent natural

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.150
philosophy with the Presocratics.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:41.070
Until then, this has been—“on no one’s
word”—Crash Course: History of Science!

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:45.040
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney Studio in Missoula,

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.800
MT and It’s made with the help of all of
these nice people.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.890
And our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.810
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.800

with us, check out some of our other channels

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.010
like Sexplanations, How To Adult, and Healthcare
Triage.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:04.120
