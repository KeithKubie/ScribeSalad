CLAUDIO CHERBINO:
Hello everyone.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.070
MALE SPEAKER: Hi everybody.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.090
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: Hi, today
this is really informal.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.700
We are doing these Google
Developers Live, live from a

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.560
hackathon we're just running.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.050
So nothing has been
prepared today.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.390
And this is going to be--

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.840
well, hopefully it's
going to work.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.190
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.290
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And, yeah,
we're going to have people

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.730
around here.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:47.820
So what's going on
[? Nicolas? ?]

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.180
MALE SPEAKER: So today we're
running a little hackathon.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.380
So a bunch of people came
yesterday, and to basically

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.110
learn about Google Drive and
start hacking on Google Drive,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.510
basically, building apps that
are going to use Google Drive.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.160
And we have a bunch of prizes
to give to the best teams.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.720
So today at the end of this
afternoon, like 3:00 PM,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.723
basically, we will decide on
who's the best team, who has

00:01:14.723 --> 00:01:17.120
built the best Google Drive
integration with their app.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.890
And we'll have a bunch
of prizes--

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.900
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Should we
tell them about the prizes?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.500
And then people at home will
just be angry at us.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.080
OK so we have three
Chromebook Pixels.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.520
So you know the new
Chromebook, if

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.590
you heard about it.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.620
It's probably a bit expensive,
but it's an amazing

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.300
Chromebook.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.420
You should probably check it
out as soon as you can.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.510
Yeah, it's just beautiful.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.010
So three lucky people
here will get one.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.220
And then we added on
a special prize.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.500
I'm pretty sure many of you
tried to register for Google

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.520
I/O yesterday.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.990
And I know some of
you succeeded.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.250
But I also know that many of you
probably didn't succeed.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.220
So we decided to add an extra
prize for people here today.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.510
And sorry about you
guys at home.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.890
So for the best app,
we will decide.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.290
So it's going to be a special
prize for one of the apps.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.849
And that special prize
is going to be

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.820
a Google I/O ticket.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:11.655
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, so
if you didn't win

00:02:11.655 --> 00:02:14.142
the click-fest yesterday.

00:02:14.142 --> 00:02:15.980
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: It's
called registration.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.770
MALE SPEAKER: The registration
process, sorry.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.510
You might still have
a chance to win--

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.650
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Well,
if you were here now

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.720
MALE SPEAKER: If you are here,
or if you're coming very soon.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.560
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: So you
still have two hours.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.530
You might want to come here
in the next two hours.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.080
We're on the Google campus.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.380
You should just go back in time
to yesterday, register,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.490
fill the form, and write an app
that uses Google Drive.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.500
And that's the easy part.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.650
Writing an app for Google Drive
only takes 10 minutes?

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.200
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.000
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: And then
write the best app actually.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.170
And then win.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.750
Impress us.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:46.350
Win.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.900
And then you will get a ticket
to Google I/O. Easy, right?

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.380
So if you can stay here for a
couple of minutes and tell a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.830
couple of jokes, I will go
around and grab some of the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.930
participants and
have them here.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.420
And then we'll talk about their
plans to dominate the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.340
world and win [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.026
Just give me a second.

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:06.920
MALE SPEAKER: So he is going
around to grab a couple of

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.570
people who are going to
basically pitch their idea,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.100
what they're building.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.258
And I'm almost out of ideas,
so here we go.

00:03:20.258 --> 00:03:22.590
Hello.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.865
Could you tell us your name?

00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:27.142
MALE SPEAKER: My name
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:27.142 --> 00:03:28.080
Oh, there it is.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.090
MALE SPEAKER: You can see
yourself here, on the camera.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.390
And so you're today at the
Google Drive hackathon.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.840
So what apps are you building?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.010
What app are you building?

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.260
Something nice.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.410
MALE SPEAKER: I've been
interested in

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.770
privacy for a long time.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.710
I used to work at HP and
Snapfish and [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.120
for a long time.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.820
And over the years I've become
interested in privacy issues.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.756
So Google Drive is a
good place for such

00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:00.360
applications I think.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.930
So the thing I'm prototyping at
this hackathon is a way to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.360
share files securely
on Google Drive.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.086
Which puts the control of the
sharing in the hands of the

00:04:11.086 --> 00:04:13.813
user rather than exclusively
relying on

00:04:13.813 --> 00:04:15.520
Google Drive itself.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.230
So for example you want to
share, say, it's tax time

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.290
coming up and you want to share
bank statements with

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.270
your accountant, you might not
want Google or connected apps

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.950
to index those apps necessarily
and then identify

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.180
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.660
So what happens to an app
that's installed on

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.730
[INAUDIBLE], and they
use [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.430
So the keys are attached
with the device.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.390
And so the files are always
connected with the other

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.800
person's [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.840
So it's secure, and it doesn't
rely on any third

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.520
party to do the work.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.290
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Are
you going to win?

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.150
MALE SPEAKER: Are you
going to win today?

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.300
MALE SPEAKER: It sounds
very tempting.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.020
I think the I/O ticket is the
most tempting prize of all,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.420
even more than the
Chromebook is.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.547
MALE SPEAKER: Despite the
monetary value being less than

00:04:56.547 --> 00:04:56.870
the Chromebook.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.420
MALE SPEAKER: This is true.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.500
But I think the desirability
is more

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.890
MALE SPEAKER: OK, OK.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.420
MALE SPEAKER: Well I think I'd
be happy just to be here.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.120
It's a great opportunity.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.720
It's great to meet you.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.840
MALE SPEAKER: We're
happy to have you.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.690
About your team, are you
coding alone today?

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.790
MALE SPEAKER: I'm unfortunately
coding alone.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.310
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: There is just
one Google I/O ticket.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.560
MALE SPEAKER: I think
that's a good match.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.960
OK, thank you very much.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.210
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you I think
Claudio has another

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.460
participant.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.405
Hello.

00:05:30.405 --> 00:05:34.450
Could you please tell us your
name then, and maybe tell us a

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.780
bit about yourself, and about
your project that you're

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.760
building here.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.142
Anything you want to tell
to the world you

00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:43.720
can do it as well.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.180
JAY: Hello.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.920
My name's Jay.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.030
I'm building what amounts to
a standardized place for

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.710
everyone to start putting their

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.510
tickets with Google Drive.

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.450
And additionally, I'm going
to eventually try

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.020
to open source the--

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.470
the biggest issue I see nowadays
is I sign up for a

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.140
lot of events and go to a lot of
these sorts of things, and

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.870
I never have the authentication
to actually get

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.550
through to some of
these things.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.430
And I know a good deal of
conference organizers that are

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.880
trying to put one on
later in the year.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.630
And they cost $25,000 to
actually mail out all of these

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.570
conference attendee badges,
where you could just drop it

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.410
all into everyone's drive
in a unified place.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.380
And not only do you have
a way for people to

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.000
print them out again.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.020
But you can easily create an
authenticated, easy way of

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.810
knowing who you're
giving things to.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.320
That and trying to suggest a
cool new way of offering

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.126
tickets to things.

00:06:52.126 --> 00:06:55.502
CLAUDIO CHERUBINO: Is your app
better than the previous one?

00:06:55.502 --> 00:06:57.381
MALE SPEAKER: How is your
app better than

00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:58.631
all the other people?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.340
So today the demos are going
to start out at 1:00 PM.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.860
All these great people are going
to come and show us what

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.090
they've built in just basically
24 hours, how

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.150
they're integrating
with Google Drive.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.120
And there's a small jury made
of the Google Drive team.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.810
We'll pick a winner and
distribute the prizes.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.190
And about your team,
you're alone also?

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.900
JAY: I'm alone, yeah.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.370
MALE SPEAKER: So you're going
for the Google I/O ticket,

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.240
basically or--

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.190
JAY: Hopefully.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.606
It's a really cool conference.

00:07:37.606 --> 00:07:40.502
And there's always advancements
on HTML 5.

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:44.550
And Google Glasses are
likely going to have

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.861
another update there.

00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:52.570
And that's all you developers
out there putting Drive and

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.690
Glass together is probably
going to be huge

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.620
market in the future.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:00.590
So hopefully we can all see
what's coming up there.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.070
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.700
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: Thank
you, and good luck.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.440
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you for coming.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.670
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: And
we have another one.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.490
And that's it and then
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.240
just keep coming up.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.786
MALE SPEAKER: A third team.

00:08:09.786 --> 00:08:11.060
DAN: Well, a team of one.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.140
MALE SPEAKER: A team
of one again.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.010
Sorry.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:14.600
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.245
MALE SPEAKER: --get any bigger
team to come to this Google

00:08:18.245 --> 00:08:19.660
Developer Live.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:24.140
So could you tell
us your name?

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.000
Tell us about yourself,
and tell us about

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.160
your project as well.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.950
DAN: I'm Dan [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.390
I'm a computer engineer here
in Silicon Valley.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.020
I live here in Mountain View.

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.280
Mainly I came here just because
I wasn't really

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.179
familiar with the Google
Drive API.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.710
So I just wanted to learn a
little bit more about it.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.230
The app I have is a
pretty simple one.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.250
I've got a friend who sells
real estate down in the

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.630
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.980
Valley of California.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.360
And I've been updating
her web page.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.125
So I wanted to put a Google Map
up there that she could

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:50.420
highlight properties on.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.723
And so I figured, well if I can
do that through Drive so

00:08:52.723 --> 00:08:54.550
she can work with something
that's easy for her work with.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.320
There's a form in
Google Drive.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.920
And then I could pull out what
I need to populate the info

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:00.870
bubbles on the map.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.230
Then that would be pretty cool,
and something that might

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.690
be doable in a short
period of time.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.260
So that's what I've been
messing around with.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.820
We'll see if I get
there or not.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.000
MALE SPEAKER: You basically
pull lines inside a Google

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.280
spreadsheet and draw
that on a map.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.890
DAN: And, yeah, do
the geolocation.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.440
And then post the pin and the
info bubble with it to say

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.720
this the address, and how many
bedrooms and bathrooms it has,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.450
and the list price and
all that stuff.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.800
And you can see, I'm wearing
the Google I/O shirt.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.990
So I was ready.

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.760
MALE SPEAKER: Over
confidence maybe?

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.660
DAN: It doesn't really matter.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.590
But it's just good to be here
and find out some more about

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.960
the API with the people
who know.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.530
Thanks.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.830
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
for joining us.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:42.920
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: We
asked for a team.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.800
MALE SPEAKER: So since somehow
we only picked teams of one,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.350
there is a real theme today.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.800
Just to show you that
we also have teams.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.240
So again could you just tell
us your name, a bit about

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.912
yourself, and your project.

00:10:01.912 --> 00:10:03.710
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I'm [? Otto. ?]

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.430
I'm a [INAUDIBLE], which is
a platform for social

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.900
[? note-taking, ?]

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.430
leveraging Google Docs,
and lets students

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:14.410
collaborate on documents.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:20.960
So we are here to build a site
application for online

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.070
students to take notes while
watching videos.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:29.560
So our main idea was to embed
the video and [INAUDIBLE] and

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.330
install all the information
on Google Drive.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:33.720
That's why we are here.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.700
And last night we worked on the
synchronization between

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:40.950
video and notes.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.340
So I met two of the guys who
work with me now, which is

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.190
really cool.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.510
And one of the guys
has the same idea.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.450
So it started on the
mobile application.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.030
So I--

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.432
MALE SPEAKER: So
you teamed up.

00:10:56.432 --> 00:10:58.200
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.720
So we will have a web
application and a mobile

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.930
application this afternoon.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:03.940
MALE SPEAKER: That'd
be awesome.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.415
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: What if you
win the Google I/O ticket?

00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:07.965
Are you going to
fight over it?

00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:08.766
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:11:08.766 --> 00:11:10.780
It'll be a really hard fight.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.810
MALE SPEAKER: Would you
take the Pixel or

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:12.930
the Google I/O ticket?

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.075
MALE SPEAKER: I don't
know for the moment.

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:17.250
We have to talk about it.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.860
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:19.950
Thanks for joining us.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.960
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
for inviting us.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.640
MALE SPEAKER: Back to Claudio.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.480
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: And I'm
also part of a team.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.405
It's called the Google Drive
developer relations team.

00:11:28.405 --> 00:11:30.210
But we're not competing
unfortunately.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.190
MALE SPEAKER: No, too bad.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.660
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: Yeah, we're
not getting these Pixels.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.610
MALE SPEAKER: Well no.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.010
I would like a Pixel though.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.970
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: Yeah, well
maybe we can get one.

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.910
OK, so people are coding here.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.610
They still have a couple of
hours, and then they will have

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.030
to present what they
have built.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.570
And then we'll have to decide.

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.430
So are we part of the jury?

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.860
MALE SPEAKER: I am part of
the jury definitely.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.820
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: Oh, you are
more important than me.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.320
OK.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:56.900
I see.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.400
So we'll have to decide.

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.620
And then we'll assign prizes.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.740
And I guess tomorrow or next
week we'll write a blog post

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:11.300
to talk about this event, how it
went and who won, and what

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:11.900
was the app.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.040
And maybe some of the apps will
be open source, and we

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.860
will share the links with you.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.420
So I think we should
go back to coding.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.110
And thanks to all of you
for joining live.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:26.210
This was fun.

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.380
We've never done this before.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.330
And it's like going live and no
studio, no infrastructure.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.410
MALE SPEAKER: The little
studio is my laptop.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:34.130
CLAUDIO CHERBINO: Just
don't say it.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.760
Just say this is a professional
studio, and we

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.080
have perfect microphones.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.280
And everything else is
working and lighting.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.230
OK with that, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:45.590
I'm Claudio.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:46.290
This is [? Nicolas. ?]

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.940
We are in the Drive developer
relations team.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.960
See you next time.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.260
MALE SPEAKER: See you.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.510
Bye bye.
