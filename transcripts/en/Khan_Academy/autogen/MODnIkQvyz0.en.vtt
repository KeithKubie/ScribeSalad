00:00:00.214 --> 00:00:01.827
 A while passed as we talked 

00:00:01.827 --> 00:00:05.927
 About proteins and their many roles 

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:07.122
 In dynamic systems, 

00:00:07.122 --> 00:00:10.454
 We have given many examples of these roles, including hormones and antibodies, 

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:13.218
 Maintain cellular structure and signal, 

00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:15.690
 And others. And actually, the ability of proteins to do 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.989
 With all these things 

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:21.133
 Is a by-product of its structure. 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.220
 So, the idea we will discuss in this video 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.480
 It is a structure 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.280
 Protein structure, so we understand it and know its value. 

00:00:29.286 --> 00:00:32.722
 Here, for example, we have a hemoglobin molecule, 

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:33.918
 Here it is 

00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:35.625
 This molecule 

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:39.027
 Consists of 4 polypeptide chains. 

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.592
 Two of them are made up of 141 amino acids, 

00:00:41.592 --> 00:00:44.623
 The other two chains consist of 146 amino acids, 

00:00:44.623 --> 00:00:49.049
 Thus, the molecule is composed of a total 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.899
 Amino Acid. 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.154
 But as you can see, their order is never random, 

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.670
 On the contrary, it is properly organized 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.883
 For the appropriate function, that is 

00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:02.119
 In this case the oxygen transfer, 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.356
 Transferring oxygen through red blood cells. 

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:08.481
 Accordingly, we ask a question which is 

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:10.118
 How the structure of hemoglobin, 

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:11.918
 Or other proteins 

00:01:11.918 --> 00:01:13.787
 Which owns different functions? 

00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:15.226
 The answer is short 

00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:18.547
 We have different layers or different grades 

00:01:18.547 --> 00:01:20.718
 The structure of proteins. 

00:01:20.718 --> 00:01:22.912
 The first degree is 

00:01:22.912 --> 00:01:24.851
 Primary structure. 

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:28.090
 The initial structure that is actually just arranged 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.692
 amino acids. 

00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:31.747
 Do you remember when we talked about 

00:01:31.747 --> 00:01:35.254
 Transfer RNA messenger nuclear code to the ribosome, 

00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:37.854
 Where the transporter RNA then comes with amino acids, 

00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:39.189
 She puts them one by one and ties them together? 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.954
 All these things occur in the translation step, 

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:43.253
 Is actually the step of building the initial structure of proteins. 

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:45.726
 In other words, DNA synthesis 

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:46.887
 Are determined 

00:01:46.887 --> 00:01:50.393
 Order of amino acids 

00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:52.088
 Which in turn form the primary structure. 

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:53.760
 Arrangement 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.641
 Arrangement 

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:58.220
 Acids 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.260
 amino acids. 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.460
 Let us now move on to the second level of structure, 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.615
 An answer to the next question as long as the initial structure 

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:07.286
 Are just ordering amino acids, 

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:09.457
 What makes this polypeptide take different forms 

00:02:09.457 --> 00:02:10.860
 Allow him to do the necessary jobs? 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.848
 the level 

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:14.890
 The second level of structure, 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.746
 Known as the secondary structure of protein, 

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:18.988
 Secondary structure, 

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:22.820
 Is the result of infrastructure interactions. 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.127
 Result of interactions 

00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:30.618
 Infrastructure Interactions 

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:33.420
 For protein, 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.194
 As a result of protein infrastructure interactions, 

00:02:36.194 --> 00:02:38.888
 I will give you more than an example. 

00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:42.127
 I have some examples here. 

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:44.391
 As you can see, we have a series here 

00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:46.609
 Polypeptide Series, 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.756
 Amino acids linked to each other 

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:50.591
 Through peptide links. 

00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:51.984
 Here, 

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:54.724
 Here we have a link with Pptidi 

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:56.315
 Link Pptidi, 

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:58.927
 Between carbonyl carbon and nitrogen, 

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:01.121
 This is also a second link between carbonyl carbon 

00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.828
 Nitrogen, this is a third link. 

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:04.650
 This series, 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.483
 The polypeptide series, you can imagine 

00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:08.528
 They are complementary to the bottom, 

00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:12.030
 Or spin and then return for example. 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.043
 But despite the detour, 

00:03:14.043 --> 00:03:16.086
 Note that polypeptide linkages themselves are repeated 

00:03:16.086 --> 00:03:19.581
 Nitrogen-carbonyl carbon, peptide bond, 

00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:22.286
 Nitrogen-carbonyl carbon, 

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:23.923
 Link Pptidi, 

00:03:23.923 --> 00:03:25.351
 But the extra thing that appears with us, 

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:27.987
 Is the interactions between the same protein infrastructure. 

00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:30.425
 On the idea, I did not elaborate in the drawing of side strings, 

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:33.989
 I just wanted to symbolize it with a letter R, because it's important to have interactions 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.009
 Between the two sides of the infrastructure is clear. 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.086
 As you can see, we have nitrogen here, 

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:40.885
 We know that it is electrically negative. 

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:43.788
 Thus, it will emit electrons from hydrogen, 

00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:47.155
 Hydrogen becomes a partial positive charge. 

00:03:47.155 --> 00:03:49.024
 Since oxygen is also electrically negative, 

00:03:49.024 --> 00:03:51.485
 Will have a partial negative charge, 

00:03:51.485 --> 00:03:54.121
 After it takes electrons from the carbon. 

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:55.688
 As a result, oxygen and hydrogen 

00:03:55.688 --> 00:03:57.255
 They will be attracted to some, 

00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:58.416
 They form the hydrogen bond 

00:03:58.416 --> 00:04:00.251
 Which we know. 

00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:02.422
 The same idea will be repeated here, 

00:04:02.422 --> 00:04:04.488
 Here and here. 

00:04:04.488 --> 00:04:06.822
 In the end, these two chains 

00:04:06.822 --> 00:04:08.784
 Will be a form 

00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:10.084
 Known 

00:04:10.084 --> 00:04:13.289
 A form known as a beta plate. 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.817
 plate, 

00:04:16.817 --> 00:04:19.349
 Beta plate. 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.950
 If we go here, you will see that we have another beta plate, 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.318
 But if you focus, you will notice a difference between them. 

00:04:24.318 --> 00:04:28.424
 In this case, the link is between nitrogen and alpha carbon, 

00:04:28.428 --> 00:04:30.158
 Which we see here, 

00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:32.886
 Alpha carbon is associated with carbonyl carbon, 

00:04:32.886 --> 00:04:35.591
 So we have nitrogen, carbon alpha, carbonyl carbon, 

00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:37.728
 Here again we have the same sequence, nitrogen, 

00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:40.526
 Carbon alpha, carbon carbon, nitrogen, 

00:04:40.526 --> 00:04:42.685
 Carbon carbon, carbon carbon. 

00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:45.890
 Therefore, this plate is known as a parallel beta plate, 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.814
 Because, as you have seen, it is made up of the two infrastructure series 

00:04:49.814 --> 00:04:52.519
 They are interacting with each other 

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.922
 By forming links in the same direction, 

00:04:54.922 --> 00:04:56.722
 Hence its name 

00:04:56.722 --> 00:05:00.785
 Parallel plate. 

00:05:00.785 --> 00:05:04.299
 This was the parallel situation, but when we look at this situation, 

00:05:04.299 --> 00:05:07.322
 We note that the order is 

00:05:07.322 --> 00:05:10.154
 Nitrogen, carbon alpha, carbonyl carbon, 

00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:11.443
 From the left, 

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:14.218
 On the right, the order is Carbon Carbon, 

00:05:14.218 --> 00:05:16.087
 Alpha carbon, nitrogen. 

00:05:16.087 --> 00:05:19.024
 Carbon carbonate, alpha carbon, nitrogen. 

00:05:19.024 --> 00:05:20.255
 Thus we are going in the opposite direction. 

00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:21.323
 And actually, what I've done is 

00:05:21.323 --> 00:05:23.459
 I copied the first structure and its heart, 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:26.524
 So you notice that it is reversed. 

00:05:26.524 --> 00:05:28.219
 But even so, 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.855
 Hydrogen bonds are still between 

00:05:30.855 --> 00:05:34.593
 Partially positive limb 

00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:37.391
 Of the nitrogen-hydrogen bond 

00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.692
 Specifically hydrogen 

00:05:38.692 --> 00:05:40.956
 And partially oxidized oxygen. 

00:05:40.956 --> 00:05:42.024
 still 

00:05:42.024 --> 00:05:44.090
 Hydrogen bonds are still present, 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.121
 The two basic structures are still parallel, 

00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:49.222
 But the difference is that they are going in the opposite direction. 

00:05:49.222 --> 00:05:51.879
 Therefore, you know this structure 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.690
 With an inverse parallel beta plate. 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.722
 plate 

00:05:56.722 --> 00:05:59.415
 Parallel reverse beta plate 

00:05:59.415 --> 00:06:02.353
 Another type of protein structure. 

00:06:02.353 --> 00:06:04.187
 Here we have a third type, 

00:06:04.187 --> 00:06:07.728
 Note that the infrastructure in it 

00:06:07.728 --> 00:06:10.584
 Come in the form of a screw, 

00:06:10.584 --> 00:06:13.707
 Where we have hydrogen bonds 

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:16.691
 Between different classes, 

00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:20.975
 For the same pulp. 

00:06:20.975 --> 00:06:24.354
 As we have said before, we have oxygen here with a charge 

00:06:24.354 --> 00:06:25.422
 Partially negative, 

00:06:25.422 --> 00:06:27.221
 This hydrogen has a partially positive charge, 

00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:28.684
 Thus forming a hydrotherapy bond. 

00:06:28.684 --> 00:06:30.925
 We can also have a link here, 

00:06:30.925 --> 00:06:33.293
 Until we are formed in the end, 

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.687
 Spiral structure, 

00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:36.916
 Known as 

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:39.412
 Alpha Screw. 

00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:42.593
 Thus we conclude that all these 

00:06:42.593 --> 00:06:46.338
 The interactions that you get inside 

00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:48.421
 The structure of the protein 

00:06:48.421 --> 00:06:50.557
 Is what constitutes the secondary structure. 

00:06:50.557 --> 00:06:52.775
 But we have not finished yet, 

00:06:52.775 --> 00:06:54.992
 Because there are still side strings. 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.558
 Some of these chains are afraid of water, 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.700
 Thus, if it is present in aqueous solution, 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.073
 They are trying to escape from it and confront it. 

00:07:04.073 --> 00:07:06.928
 Therefore, it is possible to form these side chains 

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:08.518
 Hydrogen bonds with other chains. 

00:07:08.518 --> 00:07:10.283
 In short, you'll get some reactions in one way or another. 

00:07:10.283 --> 00:07:12.454
 This method may be forming links 

00:07:12.454 --> 00:07:13.754
 Sulfur dioxide, 

00:07:13.754 --> 00:07:17.318
 Or covalent bonds with second side chains. 

00:07:17.318 --> 00:07:19.337
 We will go into all these details 

00:07:19.337 --> 00:07:21.161
 Later, God willing, 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.855
 But now our goal is 

00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:26.421
 To know that the triangular structure 

00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:27.953
 For protein 

00:07:27.953 --> 00:07:31.680
 Is the result of side-chain interactions. 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.322
 Result of interactions 

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:40.620
 Result of side chain interactions. 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.058
 Result of side chain interactions. 

00:07:43.058 --> 00:07:45.589
 If we imagine, for example, 

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:48.990
 This basic structure I draw here, 

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.788
 We can have 

00:07:51.788 --> 00:07:54.459
 Set of side chains, 

00:07:54.459 --> 00:07:55.457
 Symbolized by letter R, 

00:07:55.457 --> 00:07:57.025
 Afraid of water, 

00:07:57.025 --> 00:08:00.055
 As mentioned above, if we have water in the vicinity of protein, 

00:08:00.055 --> 00:08:02.156
 We have to imagine the three dimensions, 

00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:05.256
 How can these chains form proteins in a way that allows them to hide from water. 

00:08:05.256 --> 00:08:08.251
 In contrast, if these strings are polarity 

00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:10.957
 And loving water, we will imagine that it will form protein 

00:08:10.957 --> 00:08:12.454
 In a way that allows it to be in the face of water. 

00:08:12.454 --> 00:08:15.194
 Or we can have two chains, 

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.725
 We will mark the first R1, 

00:08:17.725 --> 00:08:20.384
 R2, 

00:08:20.384 --> 00:08:22.857
 May be combined by a hydrogen bond, 

00:08:22.857 --> 00:08:25.794
 Or ionic association, for example. 

00:08:25.794 --> 00:08:27.745
 We have different types of links 

00:08:27.745 --> 00:08:30.113
 Possible between the two chains, 

00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:32.493
 We will separate this in a subsequent video, God willing. 

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:36.522
 Let's go back to the big picture now, a protein made up of a single polypeptide 

00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:38.820
 It will have elementary structure, secondary structure, 

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.190
 And triangular structure. 

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.025
 But some proteins are more than polypeptides, 

00:08:42.025 --> 00:08:44.788
 Such as the hemoglobin we talked about at the beginning of the video, 

00:08:44.788 --> 00:08:48.747
 In this case, we have an additional structure, the quaternary structure. 

00:08:48.747 --> 00:08:52.126
 When we speak of the quartet, 

00:08:52.126 --> 00:08:57.443
 The quartet, 

00:08:57.443 --> 00:08:59.858
 The quartet, 

00:08:59.858 --> 00:09:02.842
 We are talking about the way they are gathered 

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.523
 Different polypeptide chains 

00:09:05.523 --> 00:09:07.892
 To form the largest vessel. 

00:09:07.892 --> 00:09:09.889
 In short, 

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:12.989
 Multiple interactions 

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:16.089
 Between multiple strings 

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:18.120
 Interactions 

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.451
 Multiple interactions 

00:09:22.451 --> 00:09:25.260
 Between multiple strings 

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.450
 Which numbered four in the case of hemoglobin. 

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.820
 I hope this video has helped you more 

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.027
 In knowing the value of protein structure 

00:09:33.027 --> 00:09:35.918
 Which is really a wonderful area of ​​study. 

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:37.788
 The more we understand the more many ways 

00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:40.493
 In which protein can be synthesized, 

00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:43.647
 The more we can understand the more 

00:09:43.647 --> 00:09:45.659
 DNA Translation Process 

00:09:45.659 --> 00:09:47.691
 For primary structure, 

00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:49.723
 And to discover more how these proteins work, 

00:09:49.723 --> 00:09:51.615
 How can it be reformed, 

00:09:51.615 --> 00:09:53.891
 And even make use of them in different roles from their main roles. 

00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:56.637
 This area is indeed a vast and fascinating area for studies and research.
