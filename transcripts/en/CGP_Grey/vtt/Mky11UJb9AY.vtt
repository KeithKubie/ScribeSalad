00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.570
Queen Lion of the Animal Kingdom is giving
more democracy to her citizens by adding a

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.799
legislative branch to the government.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.730
The citizens each get one vote and are divided
into ranges. Each range will elect one representative

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.370
to send to the newly created Jungle Council.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.571
To best understand how this system works,
lets look at a small colony where there are

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:20.860
just two political parties: Buffalo &amp; Jackalope.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.910
This colony is divided into four ranges. In
the first election Jackalope candidates win

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.789
two of them and buffalo candidates win the
rest.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.770
All is well for several election cycles until
the Animal Kingdom Census taker comes round

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.649
and shows that the population has both moved
and grown.

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.260
To better represent the larger population
a new seat is added to the Jungle council

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.489
so the ranges' boundaries must be re-drawn.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.829
This is where the trouble begins. Re-drawing
electoral boundaries is a huge political problem.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.769
To help them, the representatives of the Jungle
Council hire a weaselly consultant to figure

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.010
out where the new boundaries should go.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.350
If Weasel draws rectangular boundaries everything
is OK because the jungle council will, as

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.569
close as possible, reflect how the citizens
vote.

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.330
However, Weasel doesn't do this. Instead he
tells the Buffalo Party that, for a price,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.471
he can turn their slim majority into a landslide
victory in the election.

00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:11.670
With a super-majority on the Jungle Council
the Buffalo wouldn't have to listen to those

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.229
pesky Jackalope filibusters anymore, so the
Buffalo gladly pay up.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.170
How can Weasel deliver on his promise? It's
depressingly simple: by packing together as

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.289
many jackalope voters into one range as possible
and spreading the rest of them out, The Buffalo

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.030
Party can win an additional seat without any
voters switching allegiance.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.509
What Weasel and the Buffalo have done is called
'gerrymandering'. The intensional changing

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.369
of electoral boundaries for their benefit.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.210
Several election cycles later the under-represented
and disgruntled Jackalope party approaches

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.100
Weasel and asks if he can manipulate the ranges
to be in their favor instead of the Buffalos'.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.990
Indeed he can. Using the same trick, Weasel
packs Buffalo voters into a few ranges and

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.740
spreads the rest among the Jackalope supporters.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.170
After the election the Jackalopes, who represent
a minority of the voters are now, nonetheless,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.450
the majority party on the Jungle Council.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.829
This is the terrible power of Gerrymandering:
Weasel can take the exact same voters and

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.200
get either party to win the election.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.190
Unsurprisingly, Weasel's business grows and
eventually every colony in the Animal Kingdom

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.570
pays him to gerrymander their ranges.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.280
With so many clients, Weasel now uses his
computer test hundreds of thousands of range

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.260
combinations with elaborate statistical models
of voter behavior to get the results he needs.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.850
Queen Lion has seen what Weasel is up to and
banishes him from her kingdom. But, the census

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.800
taker reminds her that ranges still need to
be re-drawn as the population changes. So

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.880
how is it going to be decided?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.460
Queen Lion suggests the obvious solution:
a bi-partisan committee must agree on all

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.180
new range boundaries.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.770
This seems like a good idea. After all, if
both parties have to agree on the ranges,

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.820
then they must end up being fair to everyone.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.280
But, after a few election cycles using this
solution, Queen Lion notices that she always

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.450
sees the same faces on the Jungle Council.
Representatives almost never get defeated

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.050
in their elections.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.490
It turns out that the interests of the representatives
and the interests of the citizens are not

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.450
the same. Citizens want elections where the
candidates have to earn their vote. These

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.120
are close elections where either candidate
has a chance of winning.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.600
But, representatives don't want close elections,
they want safe elections. Elections where

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.680
they run in a range that is filled with supporters.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.810
Because the representatives are in change
of the boundaries they make the safest ranges

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.810
possible.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.380
So, bi-partisan committees are not enough.
To truly fix gerrymandering there are three

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.380
options:

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.120
The first is to set up a politically independent
commission of appointed experts or judges

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.620
to draw the boundaries.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.060
Independent commissions are much better than
bi-partisan committees, but still not ideal

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.490
because they usually group similar areas together
so the elections are uncompetitive.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.971
And there is always the possibility that the
independent commission is not as independent

00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:37.150
as it appears.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.660
The second option is to let math decide the
boundaries. There are a number of ways to

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.800
mathematically divide an area into equally
populous ranges.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.500
The simplest example of this is called the
'shortest split-line method'. Find the shortest

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.320
line that splits the voters in twain and repeat
as necessary until all the ranges are made.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.100
This is much better than an 'independent'
commission, but it does have the problem of

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.800
occasionally producing skewed election results
just through pure bad luck of where the boundaries

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.260
are drawn.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.400
But by publishing the algorithm used, all
citizens can check the results and be confident

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.180
that there is no intensional bias in the system.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.190
The last solution is an unexpected one: hire
back the weasel and embrace gerrymandering.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.030
But this time, pay him make the winners most
closely match the voters as a whole.

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.209
While it seems unsavory, this is actually
the best way to avoid disproportionate representation

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.800
which is, by far, the the worst problem of
gerrymandering.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.980
But, considering these three solutions leaves
Queen Lion grumpy.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.880
The first two are improvements, but still
may result in uncompetitive elections or disproportionate

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.280
results while the third just feels wrong.
Gerrymandering to avoid the problems of gerrymandering

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.660
is... odd.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.320
Remembering what she learned about voting
before, she realizes all this gerrymandering

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.300
is really just a symptom of a more fundamental
problem: the method by which each citizen

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.460
gets only one vote and elects only one representative.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.110
There are ways to eliminate gerrymandering
and restore competitive elections to make

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.360
her citizens happy, but to do that Queen Lion
is going to have to make some big, fundamental

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.190
changes to her democracy.
