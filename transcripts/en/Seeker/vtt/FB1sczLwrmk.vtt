00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
Beards.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.550
You have them, he has them, she has them -- I...
sort of have them.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.730
But now that everyone has a beard, EVOLUTION
says, "BEARDS ARE SO OVER."

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:18.330
Howdy folks, thanks for tuning in for DNews,
I'm Trace Dominguez!

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:25.320
Studies have shown beards equate to age, masculinity
and dominance and they are so hot right now,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.320
or are they?

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.900
A new study in the Royal Society journal Biology
Letters will affect men from Brooklyn to San

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.900
Francisco...

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.720
Portland to Austin... the more beards there
are, the less attractive beards are.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.320
A study in Biology Letters found once the
number of beards peak, clean-shaven faces

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.390
become more attractive to the ladies!

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.850
The study showed women pictures of men with
and without facial hair, and when a clean-shaven

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.060
man was shown amongst lots of stubbly and
beardy peeps, their freshly shorn skin was

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.540
aglow with attractiveness.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.940
Conversely, in a sea of babyfaces, the bearded
man was king.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.469
Are the ladies picky?

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:01.960
Or is there something else at work...

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.150
The researchers determined a famous bearded
gent was to blame -- Darwin's theories of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.420
evolutionary sexual selection says females
choose those males with the most desirable

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.310
features -- physique, intelligence, whatever.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.530
But they're not sure HOW they decide.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.481
Obviously, we want the best genes to perpetuate,
and the crap ones left out, but how do people

00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.780
know which are the good genes?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.500
Scarcity, my friends.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.689
This study FINALLY revealed, those who roll
outside the mainstream, who are rare or unique

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.000
are thought to have a genetic edge!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Example: People with blonde hair in populations
of brunettes, fatter people in skinny populations,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.740
tall people amongst shorties, visa versa and
so on.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.950
Scarcity equates to attractiveness!

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.220
The researchers use the example of guppies
-- which is such a good hipster comparison.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.350
In guppies, the fish with the most unusual
color patterns have the most mating success.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.189
Do they have the "BEST" genes?

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.390
Maybe, the lady-fish don't know, but they
know they're different, and different is cool.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.060
You could also think of the "closing time"
effect.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.670
A study in the journal Basic and Applied Social
Psychology, found at the end of a night out,

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.390
people take stock of their patrons and assess
attractiveness based on who's LEFT.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.580
We determine attractiveness by WHO'S AROUND,
not just by genes and uniqueness alone.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.739
Remember that week-long high school trip to
Seattle where you bunked in with Jessie because

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.500
Jessie was the hottest on the bus?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.890
What happened when you got back home?

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.900
Bye, Jessie.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.990
There are other hotties around.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.200
So to bring it back to beards -- we're hitting
a QUOTE "beard peak" where the novelty of

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.200
a man with facial hair has lost it's unusual
quality.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.810
However, it's important to mention, there
are different LEVELS of beardyness.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.190
The researchers in Biology Letters used four
distinct levels -- clean-shaven, light stubble

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.320
*wink*, heavy stubble, and full beard.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.260
I think they are missing ludicrous beard...
but maybe that's just me.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.830
A lumberjack of Brooklyn would be unique in
the bushier Portland -- and thus, perhaps

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.370
they'd be unique... scarce... hotttttttt.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.010
Overall though, a lot of the news is claiming
those men who shave are going to get the attention

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.450
-- for now.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.160
The struggle is real, y'all.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.610
Are beards OVER!?

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.310
Tell us down below, but if you decide you're
going to shave, it might be time to check

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.450
out Harry's.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.050
Harry's was started by two guys who thought
paying a crap-ton for crap blades was a horrible

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.050
experience.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.170
They bought a German razor factory, and made
the experience of getting your razors cheaper,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.170
and classier.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.069
I love the packaging, and the blades are affordable
and sweet.

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.450
