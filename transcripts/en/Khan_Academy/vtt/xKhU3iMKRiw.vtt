00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:04.370
- [Voiceover] Carly tried to
solve an equation step by step.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.042
And they tell us, they see, we see

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:07.667
how she tried to solve the equation.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.082
They say find Carly's mistake.

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:11.289
So let's see what Carly did.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:15.817
She started with 7a = 28.

00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:19.578
Then on the left hand
side she divides it by a

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:23.201
and on the right hand
side she divides by 7.

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.663
Well this seems strange.

00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:25.824
When you're manipulating an equation

00:00:25.824 --> 00:00:27.589
whatever you do to one
side, you have to do

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:28.727
to the other side.

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:31.722
Over here she decides to
divide the left side by a,

00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:35.042
on the right side she
should divide by a as well.

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.527
Or if she wants to divide
the right side by 7,

00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:40.104
she should divide the
left side by 7 as well,

00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:42.542
but she's dividing both sides
by two different things.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:46.211
So step 1 is where she makes the mistake.

00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:47.302
The right thing for her to do,

00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:49.392
or I guess maybe the
most reasonable thing,

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:52.758
if she wants to solve for
a, divide both sides by 7.

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:54.848
Then she would have
been left with just an a

00:00:54.848 --> 00:00:56.682
on the left hand side,
because it would have been

00:00:56.682 --> 00:00:58.679
7a/7 and a 4 over there.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.978
She would have said, oh,
a must be equal to 4.

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:02.232
So let's keep going.

00:01:02.232 --> 00:01:05.181
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.781
Trent tried to solve an
equation step by step.

00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:09.592
All right. Find Trent's mistake.

00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:11.101
So a lot of mistakes happening

00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:12.913
in algebra problems right now.

00:01:12.913 --> 00:01:16.511
So g/3 = 4/3.

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:17.997
Now let's see. The first step.

00:01:17.997 --> 00:01:22.223
g/3 x 3, so he's multiplying
the left hand side times 3

00:01:22.223 --> 00:01:27.006
and on the right hand side,
he's multiplying by 1/3.

00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:29.398
So once again, he's doing
two different things

00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:30.930
to the left and the right hand side

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.324
even though you're supposed
to do the same thing.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:34.669
If you do two different
things, the equality

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:37.548
will not hold anymore.

00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:38.918
Notice, if these two things are...

00:01:38.918 --> 00:01:42.586
If g/3 = 4, if you multiply this times 3

00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:45.628
and you only multiply this times 1/3,

00:01:45.628 --> 00:01:47.184
well then this thing is
going to become larger,

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:49.134
because is you multiply by
3 that's going to be larger

00:01:49.134 --> 00:01:51.920
if you take the same thing
and multiply it by 1/3.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.219
Then the equality won't hold true anymore.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:55.635
In order for it to hold true,
if you're going to multiply

00:01:55.635 --> 00:01:58.608
the left by 3 you have to
multiply the right by 3.

00:01:58.608 --> 00:02:01.835
So he made a mistake on step 1.

00:02:01.835 --> 00:02:02.532
All right.

00:02:02.532 --> 00:02:04.993
Ling tried to solve an
equation step by step.

00:02:04.993 --> 00:02:07.013
All right. Find Ling's mistake.

00:02:07.013 --> 00:02:10.496
Let's see 12 = p + 6.2.

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:12.794
All right. So now it looks like,

00:02:12.794 --> 00:02:17.554
on the left hand side Ling adds 6.2

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:19.644
and on the right hand side, so there was

00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:21.594
p + 6.2 is the old right hand side,

00:02:21.594 --> 00:02:26.192
but it looks they then
try to subtract 6.2.

00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:28.606
So it's the same number, but over here

00:02:28.606 --> 00:02:32.391
they're adding it and over
here they're subtracting it.

00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:34.852
So they're not doing the
same thing to both sides.

00:02:34.852 --> 00:02:36.687
If you want to add 6.2
to the left hand side

00:02:36.687 --> 00:02:38.846
you need to add 6.2 to
the right hand side.

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:40.982
If you want to subtract 6.2
from the right hand side

00:02:40.982 --> 00:02:44.651
you have to subtract 6.2
from the left hand side.

00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:47.646
So a lot of mistakes going on in step 1.

00:02:47.646 --> 00:02:51.361
Let me see one where there's
not a mistake in step 1.

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:52.034
All right.

00:02:52.034 --> 00:02:54.472
Alanna tried to solve an
equation step by step.

00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:59.472
4c = 12, divides the left hand side by 4

00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:02.529
and then multiplies the
right hand side by 4.

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.619
No if you're going to divide
the left hand side by 4

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.987
you have to divide the right
hand side by 4 as well.

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:08.427
You don't multiply it by 4.

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:11.260
So a mistake in step 1.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.489
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.411
All right. n + 12 = 18.3.

00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:20.431
So over here you had n + 12

00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:23.705
and then Rico subtracts 12.

00:03:23.705 --> 00:03:25.493
So if he subtracts 12
from the left hand side

00:03:25.493 --> 00:03:27.931
he needs to subtract 12
from the right hand side.

00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:28.929
It looks like he does that.

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:30.996
He had 18.3 and he subtracts 12.

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:33.736
So he subtracts 12 from both sides.

00:03:33.736 --> 00:03:37.846
So the left side is now
n + 12 - 12, was just n,

00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:39.471
which is why he subtracted 12,

00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:41.770
so you're just left with
an n on the left hand side,

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.762
and on the right hand
side, let's see, 18.3 -12.

00:03:46.762 --> 00:03:51.336
Well 18 - 12 is 6, so this should be 6.3.

00:03:51.336 --> 00:03:53.542
So he made a little bit
of an arithmetic mistake

00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:58.542
in step, he made an arithmetic mistake

00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:03.673
and I think we are all done.
