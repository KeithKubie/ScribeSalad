00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.490
Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Hippocrates. I'm a natural

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.140
philosopher from over 2400 years ago,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.210
and I've studied the mechanisms of inheritance.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.150
&gt;&gt; Okay, well lay it on us.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.330
&gt;&gt; It's called Blended Inheritance.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.730
&gt;&gt; Well, what's Blended Inheritance?

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.370
&gt;&gt; Blended Inheritance is the idea that

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.350
one particular trait in an offspring came

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.810
from one of the parents directly or is a mix of the parents traits.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.330
&gt;&gt; But how do you think that works, exactly? I'm not exactly sure,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.650
but I've seen this fluid that comes from the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.990
male reproductive organ, and I think females probably have something

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.780
similiar. My theory is that it's a mix based

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.440
on the battle of fluids between the male and female.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
&gt;&gt; Hm, well I'm pretty sure you're right about the male reproductive fluid.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.100
&gt;&gt; But I think you're a little behind the times on the female fluid.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.930
&gt;&gt; My theory is that these fluids are actually an

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.580
amalgamation of fluids from throughout the whole body. Each responsible

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.940
for forming that particular part. The fluid from the toes

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.670
is responsible for forming the toes, and the fluid from

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.650
the eyes is responsible for forming more eyes, and so

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.550
on. At conception, a battle of fluid takes place, and the

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.950
child will resemble aspects of whichever fluid wins that battle;

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.650
one or the other parents, or a mix of both. Ok.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.210
I mean, even though we know a lot more about

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.730
how reproduction works now, your idea of blended inheritance does sound

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.400
kind of reasonable.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.800
&gt;&gt; But, I can think of an example that breaks the rule of inheritance. Which

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.910
of the following scenarios do you think shows

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.440
that Hippocrates's blending model doesn't explain every trait?
