LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.170
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.060
worked on every single day.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.940
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.260
what it'd be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.750
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.340
And just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.420
and why they do it.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.360
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:24.300
LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to Coffee with a Googler.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.383
I'm Laurence Moroney and
I'm here in New York City

00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:27.940
to meet with Roman Nurik.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.140
And Roman Nurik is one of
our material design gurus

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.890
here at Google.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.887
So material design, tell
me what's it all about.

00:00:34.887 --> 00:00:35.970
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, Laurence.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.412
What is material design?

00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:40.620
It's kind of hard to explain.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.240
There's actually a video with a
bunch of the original designers

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.920
that created material
design and they

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.770
get asked the same
question and they

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.480
don't know how to answer it.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.530
It is a complex kind of thing.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.890
There's a lot of
things going on.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.700
I guess is the most basic
level, it's a design language.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.040
It's a design system.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.120
It covers visual interaction
and motion design.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.630
I feel like most design
systems, design languages,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.500
are treated as just
visual languages.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.090
Like here are the colors
you should use, and so on.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.600
But material is
much more than that.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.690
It really kind of
covers the model,

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.520
the underlying physical
model, of the UI.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.230
So it basically
tries to establish

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.850
this physical environment within
which your apps should live.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.800
On a phone, on a
tablet, on a computer,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.330
basically any sort of screen.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.860
And then it
basically establishes

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.318
this physical
environment and a set

00:01:34.318 --> 00:01:37.470
of basic rules and principles.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.260
And I like to think of it along
these kind of four basic axes,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.340
or four basic principles.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.350
And that's tangible surfaces.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.980
Work on the material metaphor.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.130
We can talk about what
material is at some point.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010
Also bold graphic design.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.220
This idea that we should take
some of the best design ideas

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.030
from the print world and see
how they can help us make really

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.380
great apps on digital devices.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.870
And the third is
meaningful motion.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.190
Basically how all these
things, how these surfaces,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.830
and the ink on that surface,
the graphic design stuff,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.860
how that all moves in a
consistent way to help

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.187
communicate what's going on.

00:02:20.187 --> 00:02:22.770
And the fourth thing, which is
to me one of the most important

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.860
things, is adaptive design.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.120
Which is how can we take
all these first three things

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.790
and make sure that
they work consistently

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.495
and coherently across different
devices, phones and tablets,

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:34.590
and everything else.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.506
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now
you have a video, right,

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:39.180
of some really good examples
of material design being used.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.620
So should we roll that?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.850
ROMAN NURIK: Let's roll it.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:03:29.774
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:32.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: So some
pretty excellent examples there,

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.300
but it's like, "How does
somebody reach that level?"

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.530
And for someone like
me, I'm a developer

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.600
and my design skills
are nonexistent.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.760
So if I want to
become somebody who

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.500
can build apps with
those kind of design,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.370
how do I get started?

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.710
How do I learn this stuff?

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.960
ROMAN NURIK: That's
a great question.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.876
I think first of all, I
just want to, I guess,

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:53.740
recognize some of those apps
they're doing amazing jobs.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.230
And they have large
teams, some of them

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.930
actually have very small teams.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.790
Some of those apps are
created by one person.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.960
So you can absolutely
reach that level of quality

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.540
from these amazing showcase apps
regardless of your team size.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.410
But I'd say for the
developers and designers

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.076
out there that are
just getting started,

00:04:12.076 --> 00:04:14.650
there are a lot of great
resources out there.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.709
There's a great Udacity course
that me, Nick Butcher, also

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.230
from Google team here, and
James Williams from Udacity

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.650
put together.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.914
And that's available
at udacity.com/google.

00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:31.190
And there's also a bunch
of amazing resources

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.580
on design.google.com
which will tell you

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.670
about how to come
to Android if you're

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.580
doing iOS stuff, for example.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.120
Or how to get
started understanding

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.010
what material design is.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.250
Obviously the entire material
design guidelines are there.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.190
So I'd say that's the
first thing the Udacity

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.834
course is probably the best
first step in getting started.

00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:56.750
But there's a whole lot
of resources out there

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.580
and we link to others
from the Udacity course.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.020
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And Udacity courses,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.394
if you're not
familiar with them,

00:05:01.394 --> 00:05:03.450
they're very Socratic
in how they teach.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.687
It's short videos
and then challenging

00:05:05.687 --> 00:05:06.520
you to do something.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.020
And then a short video and then
getting you to do something.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.230
And it's a good way to
someone can incrementally

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.342
learn rather than be thrown
into a huge design doc

00:05:14.342 --> 00:05:15.372
or something like that.

00:05:15.372 --> 00:05:16.830
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah
it's definitely--

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.600
there's a very
clear progression.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.000
We specifically
designed that course

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.250
so that you can kind of start
with some of the basics.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.340
The most elementary basic
things about a screen,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.720
like what is a pixel, what is
a density independent pixel.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.780
And then you ramp
all the way up to how

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.114
do I make everything work on
phones, tablets, and so on.

00:05:34.114 --> 00:05:36.613
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I have
to assume that design course is

00:05:36.613 --> 00:05:37.380
well designed.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.410
ROMAN NURIK: We have
some very nice color

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.056
choices in our slides or our
tablet drawings, so hopefully.

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:46.180
LAURENCE MORONEY: So back
to material design again.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.500
Why material?

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.370
ROMAN NURIK: So material goes
back to that first principle.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.210
So this idea of
tangible surfaces.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.150
This idea that everything on
your screen and your device

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.190
exists on a surface.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.470
We like to think of
them as pieces of paper.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.310
So basically you can think of
basically a sheet of material

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.480
or the word material
representing

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.180
one of those pieces of paper.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.680
And the reason we
don't just call it

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.930
paper is because it actually
is a lot more than just paper.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.340
In the real world paper,
once you rip it up

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.370
you can't really just
put it back together.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.030
And paper can't go from
being a circle to a square

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.550
to a rectangle.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.900
And so we like to think of our
digital pieces of material,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.470
or sheets of material, as
kind of a smarter paper.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.390
Still a constrained paper,
you can just do anything.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.400
It can't just do all
sorts of crazy things,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.440
but it is a physical
thing that exists inside

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.240
of this kind of
environment, this kind

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.550
of like faux environment.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.200
But it is something that has
a lot of thought put into it.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.080
And so the word
material to me really

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.410
means, the sheets of paper
that everything in this world

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.540
exists on.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.690
But for me is the main
thing to think about,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.620
the reason that motion is so
important in material design

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.130
is that motion should
always have meaning.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.910
Try not to just do it
like a flip of a button,

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.017
or like a double rotation,
or something just

00:07:18.017 --> 00:07:19.100
to kind of draw attention.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.305
Every time something moves
it attracts our attention

00:07:22.305 --> 00:07:23.930
and so it needs to
be really thoughtful

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.300
and really carefully
planned out.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.310
And so in material, we use
motion just enough motion

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.800
to convey the change
in some object's state

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.670
or try to get a little
bit of attention.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.090
But just enough motion not
too little, not too much.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:41.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
understand Android Studio has

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.180
some templates to
allow developers

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.337
to at least get
started with building

00:07:45.337 --> 00:07:46.420
material design into apps.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.419
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:50.790
So one of my philosophies
for a long time has been,

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.760
we can write about
a material design,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.800
we can write about a thing.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.110
We can make suggestions
about that thing.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:00.000
We can try to teach
people about the thing.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.720
But one of the best ways to get
the thing into people's hands,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.470
in this case material design,
is to actually just build it

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:09.290
into the tools.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.350
Just make sure that as a
developer that's just getting

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.060
started, even just
on Android, if I just

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.190
go to File, New
Project or new app

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.300
I should be able to get
the latest and greatest.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.860
And so in Android
Studio, now we're

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.020
actually seeing new templates
for material design.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.230
So you could do file new project
and then your default activity

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.909
templates are going to come
with material design in them.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.380
So it's going to use
the material theme.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.690
It's going to use some
of the latest support

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.260
libraries for material design,
so things like the Android

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.150
Design Support Library,
things like AppCompat,

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.970
So you're just gonna get a lot
of great stuff for free right

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.612
off the bat.

00:08:48.612 --> 00:08:50.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
for someone like me,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.410
I'm a coder not a designer.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.500
But I could use Android
Studio, get the effectively

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.310
the scaffolding done for
me in these templates.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.966
And then learn from something
like the Udacity course.

00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:01.840
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.190
I definitely suggest, even
before you do the Udacity

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:07.150
course, file new project.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.410
Just look around the code.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.870
See what you get.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.620
I think that's a great
way to get started.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.910
I always valued as
a kid growing up

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.270
learning programming and stuff
I always valued experimentation.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.200
So definitely
experiment with that.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:27.192
But as soon as if you hit
an obstacle or something,

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:29.400
obviously take a look at
the guide and the reference,

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:29.941
and all that.

00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:32.070
But the Udacity course
is a great way to say,

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.740
"You know what, let me just
kind of see what Google thinks

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.620
is the right way to kind
of approach understanding

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.237
this system."

00:09:38.237 --> 00:09:39.320
LAURENCE MORONEY: Awesome.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.261
Well thanks, Roman.

00:09:40.261 --> 00:09:42.760
This has been a whole lot of
fun and I've learned more about

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.470
material design in the last five
minutes than I'd had in a year

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.790
before so thank you so much .

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.904
ROMAN NURIK: I can always
talk about this stuff.

00:09:50.904 --> 00:09:52.820
LAURENCE MORONEY: They
told me that about you.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.990
This is my favorite
thing to talk about.

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.830
ROMAN NURIK: It's been
awesome, Laurence.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.240
Thanks.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: I'm going to
check out that Udacity course

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.730
and I recommend
that you do so too.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.146
And if you're an
Android developer

00:10:01.146 --> 00:10:02.438
take a look at those templates.

00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:04.896
If you have any questions for
me about this, or if you have

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:06.840
any questions for Roman
about material design,

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.970
or other aspects of building
for material design,

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.755
just please drop us a line
in the comments below.

00:10:12.755 --> 00:10:14.630
