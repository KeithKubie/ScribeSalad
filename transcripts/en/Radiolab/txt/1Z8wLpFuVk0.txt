Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm Jad Abumrad are you asleep? Hey. Hi. Do I even know where you are right now? Did you see like one day with my leg? Why I kicked myself awake? Did you see that? I heard it. I'm Jab, boom, rod. Oh, I'm Robert Krulwich and our next falling feature is falling asleep, but with a little kick. This is Radiolab. Let's do it. Well, tell me your name first and just tell me how you would like to be identified on here. You can call me Fred. I like it the best. Okay. My full title is Professor Frederick l Coolidge, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. So just so we get our definitions right. What is a hypnic jerk? It appears to be this, what seems to be a reflex. Everybody's experienced it. It's, it's you're still semi-conscious. Then you start to feel kind of dreamy. You start to feel this loosening of your thoughts, loosening of, of your reality.

Speaker 1:          00:55          But just as you're about to go under, he says, just the first onset of sleep, Bam, one big jerk. Then you're awake. Usually you wake up with this feeling of like, oh my God. Oh my God, Oh my God. Oh, all right. And you know, wait, how did you start studying this? I was working at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Can I say it on the air for a dollar, for a dollar an hour. And I just thought, man, I still can't eat coleslaw to this day cause I would do a hundred pounds of Coleslaw a day. So, um, I saw this ad on campus and it said somebody to work in a sleep lab. So I went and applied and I ended up in the beginning cleaning toilets. But I just got into all asleep. I thought it was fascinating and I got fascinated by these giant jerks at the beginning of sleep.

Speaker 1:          01:43          And I said, what is that? You know? And they said, oh, that's a hypnic jerk. And I said, what is that? And they said, that's a hypnic. In other words, no one could really explain to him why these things happen. That's right. So he started poking around and there were some theories, you know, having to do with like physiological changes in your body, you know, a lowering of oxygen content or something like this. And you put that kind of explanation didn't really satisfy. It really doesn't say, well why, what was its function? And, um, as I started to look at the literature, I saw that we had a very long history sleeping in trees. If we go back to Australopithecus afarensis this is Lucy. 3 million years ago, Lucy was by pedal. I mean walking on two legs. Lucy lived in the trees. But unlike the other prime itch, she would sometimes go down to the ground. But on the ground you've got big bird, you've got snakes, tigers, and rough times. That ground life was stressful. But night she crawled up the tree for safety. She climbed up in that tree, drops food there for her baby and she's going to drop off to sleep. Her muscles loosen her hands on curl. She starts to have that relaxation. Pretty soon she can't feel the tree

Speaker 2:          03:01          under her back or que the noises down below. Just stay with me. [inaudible] okay. That she feels like she's floating

Speaker 1:          03:11          or falling, falling, falling. That means I'd be a real good idea to wake up from that. Sleep was such a dangerous proposition for so many millions of years that something like the hypnic jerk, if some of those primates had that behavior, they may have been just slightly more likely over millions of years to to adapt and survive and we haven't gotten rid of it yet is what he's saying. So that's my jerk is just basically so I don't get eaten by a lion all these many years. Yeah, that's what he's saying. Sort of like a Lucy Echo. Do we know this or we just a mad no. How are we going to know this? This is just a story, but there is at least one a tantalizing, a bit of evidence to support this idea. You ask college students, what are the most common dreams that you have and falling to is number one or number two most common theme. And if you go on a college campus, you know thanks to OSHA, right? You have no chance of falling off anything. They'll make sure that your fullest drop is like a flutter, six inches. Even then at big yellow and red signs all over it, but they dream of falling. What, and by the way, the next most common dream after falling, it's being chased by an alien in a blue dress. Nobody is gonna stay

Speaker 3:          05:24          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          06:04          [inaudible] I'm wondering what happened

Speaker 5:          06:05          been falling.

Speaker 4:          06:06          Why is it that elderly people fall down a lot? If you go into any hospital ward, you'll see lots and lots of elderly people who are in there with broken hips and things like that because they've, they've fallen. So I started asking my clinician friends and they say, wow, they have a poor sense of balance, muscle weakness. And I said, could it have anything to do with timing? What do you mean? Well, one of the things I study is how the brain sends out signals to the whole body and how these signals come back. Because the strange part is the brain is situated all the way at one end of the body all the way at the top end. And it's controlling this huge amount of machinery you have to send signals all the way out to the toes and all the way back. And they're surprisingly slow in the brain. It's about 300,000 times slower than singles move around in a computer. So it would be like if you were a NASA operator controlling the Mars rover, there's a delay between when you send the [inaudible] seven signals and when you get the feedback, when you get feedback. And so what happens is the brain is very, it puts a lot of effort into making sure that it knows exactly the timing of sending signals out and when it's getting signals back, and that's how you walk. For example,

Speaker 1:          07:13          do you want the camera? Can I take it? The camera? Oh, this is like what toddlers learn in reversed. Aren't they learning the timings to get the left foot out in front of the right. That's exactly what they're doing. They're calibrating the timing of their whole nervous system. That's interesting. Cause that my kid's 10 months old and I think he's in this calibrating periods stand up. So what's happening with him now is he's standing, but then it looks like he's about to take a step. But then right, it's about, oh, that was a little spill. Yes, it's good. So basically you're saying his little brain is trying to figure out the timing on, let me see it. Oh, electricity racing from brain to foot and foot back to brain. Yes. Mission control is going right.

Speaker 4:          07:52          Okay. Sending that message to the feet, we expect it back in 300 milliseconds.

Speaker 5:          07:58          So

Speaker 1:          07:59          the fall take three. Okay, we're going to try now. Two 80 milliseconds. Okay. Two 80

Speaker 4:          08:04          ran down to Ooh, tumble fall. That's exactly right. A lot of trial and error until you get the timing right, but get it right. Now you're a walker, right?

Speaker 1:          08:15          How many?

Speaker 4:          08:18          Now something that happens in let's say multiple sclerosis and maybe also when you get old says David, is that the timing starts to change because there's damage to the Xi thing around the nerves and that slows down certain signals. So then the brain says, oh, I thought my foot should have hit the ground by now, but it hasn't. So I'm going to send out a corrective motor command. And then finally the signal does come back and you've set out this corrective motor command and you'll stumble with each step. You fall forward slightly. And then catch yourself

Speaker 5:          08:55          from falling.

Speaker 6:          08:59          Now we are going to fall far from home. We're going to have to travel a good many late years off the planet to fall in this particularly special and gruesome way. Our father is Neil degrasse Tyson. He's a astronomical physicist. Is that what he is? Here he is at the Herbst theater. I like saying that [inaudible] theater in San Francisco in front of an audience talking about

Speaker 7:          09:20          falling apart. Um, my name, my own business on the airplane and someone looks and sees what I'm doing. They find out I do astrophysics, the outcome, the questions. When will life end? Will the asteroid com, will the Aztec calendar destroy the earth? There's all, there's, it goes on and on. So I figured people like death in mayhem, so I might as well title the book with that because there's a whole chapter on how to die as you fall into a black hole, which I personally think it's a kind of kind of cool way to die because what happens is the gravity of the black hole is extreme. As you can imagine, light doesn't even escape. Its gravity is so extreme light traveling at the speed of light. All right? So if light doesn't come out, nothing's coming out. It's black. You fall in, you're not coming out.

Speaker 7:          10:09          It's a one way trip. Okay, so you don't just die cause you disappear. You die long before you disappear. As you fall in, the gravity at your feet becomes rapidly greater than the gravity at your head. So your feet start falling faster than your head does. That's a bad situation to be in. You don't really know initially you kind of feel good, you know, cause it's every you, we all stretch. When you wake up in the morning. Initially it feels like a stretch. But what happens is that stretch continues beyond comfort levels and you reach a point where, and they're called the tidal forces, tides on your body. Basically the tidal force comes so great that they exceed the intermolecular forces that bind your flesh. And so the point comes where you snap into two pieces likely to happen at the base of your spine.

Speaker 7:          11:10          Now you are two pieces. No. Now, I know you didn't ask about this, but it turns out you will survive that snap because below your waist, while there are the important organs, there are no vital organs below your waist. So your torso will stay alive for a little while, okay? Until you bleed to death. But this all happens much faster than it would take to bleed to death. So these two pieces then feel tidal forces and then they snap into two pieces and then they snap again into eight and then 16 and then you're bifurcating your way down. And so eventually it's your head and multiple other parts. And so that will continue until you are a stream of Adams descending toward the abyss. And it turns out that's not the worst of it. Okay? The worst, it turns out the fabric of space and time funnels down towards a black hole. So the space that you occupy up here is larger than a space you occupied down here. So in fact, you're getting, while you're getting stretched, you getting screened, extruded through the fabric of space like toothpaste.

Speaker 3:          12:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          12:45          well, we're, we're about to fall away. I think we can it. Yeah. Okay. Nice. One Nice one. [inaudible] before we do though. Uh, no, that we have podcasts. It's a radio lab.org and Gen ed. Boom. Rod. I remember.
