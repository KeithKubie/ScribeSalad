so the main idea the main way that we

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430
so the main idea the main way that we
 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.970
so the main idea the main way that we
did this study was we image people in

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980
did this study was we image people in
 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.549
did this study was we image people in
the scanner before and after 48 hours of

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
the scanner before and after 48 hours of
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.040
the scanner before and after 48 hours of
sleep deprivation and one of the primary

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050
sleep deprivation and one of the primary
 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.750
sleep deprivation and one of the primary
tasks we use was the one that I just

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760
tasks we use was the one that I just
 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.010
tasks we use was the one that I just
described

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
described
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.859
described
I'll say it again people saw one three

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
I'll say it again people saw one three
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.249
I'll say it again people saw one three
or six letters for a few seconds they

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259
or six letters for a few seconds they
 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.080
or six letters for a few seconds they
waited seven seconds a probe letter came

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
waited seven seconds a probe letter came
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.499
waited seven seconds a probe letter came
up and they had to decide whether that

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509
up and they had to decide whether that
 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.269
up and they had to decide whether that
was one of the letters that had been

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
was one of the letters that had been
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.339
was one of the letters that had been
presented to them so we gave them the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
presented to them so we gave them the
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.280
presented to them so we gave them the
exact same task pre and post and what we

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
exact same task pre and post and what we
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020
exact same task pre and post and what we
found behaviorally was that people were

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
found behaviorally was that people were
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.139
found behaviorally was that people were
slower and sometimes maybe 20% of the

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
slower and sometimes maybe 20% of the
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.810
slower and sometimes maybe 20% of the
time they didn't respond within the time

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
time they didn't respond within the time
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.479
time they didn't respond within the time
limit and then we image them with fMRI

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
limit and then we image them with fMRI
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.430
limit and then we image them with fMRI
while they were doing that and we could

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
while they were doing that and we could
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.319
while they were doing that and we could
look during the stimulus phase or the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329
look during the stimulus phase or the
 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.750
look during the stimulus phase or the
retention phase or the probe phase when

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
retention phase or the probe phase when
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.919
retention phase or the probe phase when
they saw the letters while they were

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929
they saw the letters while they were
 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:53.389
they saw the letters while they were
retaining the letters or when we asked

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399
retaining the letters or when we asked
 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.090
retaining the letters or when we asked
them is that one that you saw what was

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
them is that one that you saw what was
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.669
them is that one that you saw what was
going on in their brain the way that we

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679
going on in their brain the way that we
 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.619
going on in their brain the way that we
approach looking at these data is a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
approach looking at these data is a
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.599
approach looking at these data is a
little different than other labs so what

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609
little different than other labs so what
 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.220
little different than other labs so what
we do is first of all we're interested

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230
we do is first of all we're interested
 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.720
we do is first of all we're interested
in what changes from pre to post sleep

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730
in what changes from pre to post sleep
 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.330
in what changes from pre to post sleep
deprivation and we look at the brain as

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
deprivation and we look at the brain as
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.859
deprivation and we look at the brain as
a whole rather than looking at one

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
a whole rather than looking at one
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.230
a whole rather than looking at one
particular area of the brain we try to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
particular area of the brain we try to
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.850
particular area of the brain we try to
sign a set of brain areas that are

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
sign a set of brain areas that are
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.370
sign a set of brain areas that are
working together uh-uh

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
working together uh-uh
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.609
working together uh-uh
and we call that a network it's not a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
and we call that a network it's not a
 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.120
and we call that a network it's not a
network like like a neuro physiologist

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
network like like a neuro physiologist
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.190
network like like a neuro physiologist
would have one neuron wired to another

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
would have one neuron wired to another
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.139
would have one neuron wired to another
to another but but because it's a set of

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149
to another but but because it's a set of
 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.700
to another but but because it's a set of
areas that work together we call it a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
areas that work together we call it a
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.560
areas that work together we call it a
network so we're looking for a brain

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
network so we're looking for a brain
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.639
network so we're looking for a brain
network that reduced its activity from

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649
network that reduced its activity from
 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.980
network that reduced its activity from
pre to post sleep deprivation and the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
pre to post sleep deprivation and the
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.270
pre to post sleep deprivation and the
other thing we're interested in is could

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
other thing we're interested in is could
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850
other thing we're interested in is could
we find a network that that where that

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860
we find a network that that where that
 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.340
we find a network that that where that
happened in every single person and the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350
happened in every single person and the
 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.600
happened in every single person and the
thing that we were hoping for is if we

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
thing that we were hoping for is if we
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.760
thing that we were hoping for is if we
found such a network that the people who

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770
found such a network that the people who
 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.440
found such a network that the people who
did worse after sleep deprivation we

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
did worse after sleep deprivation we
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420
did worse after sleep deprivation we
show more of a loss in the use of that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
show more of a loss in the use of that
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.830
show more of a loss in the use of that
network than the others and that's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
network than the others and that's
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.660
network than the others and that's
that's what we identified to identify

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
that's what we identified to identify
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.940
that's what we identified to identify
this brain network so some of the areas

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
this brain network so some of the areas
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.880
this brain network so some of the areas
that were the areas that showed reduced

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
that were the areas that showed reduced
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.800
that were the areas that showed reduced
activation we're in the back of the head

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
activation we're in the back of the head
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.810
activation we're in the back of the head
some occipital areas and some parietal

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820
some occipital areas and some parietal
 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.789
some occipital areas and some parietal
areas some of the areas that sort of

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
areas some of the areas that sort of
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.620
areas some of the areas that sort of
maintained activation or sometimes

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
maintained activation or sometimes
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.480
maintained activation or sometimes
increased with sleep deprivation because

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490
increased with sleep deprivation because
 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.510
increased with sleep deprivation because
sort of like a fulcrum this network way

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
sort of like a fulcrum this network way
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.950
sort of like a fulcrum this network way
towards the front of the head and so we

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960
towards the front of the head and so we
 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.140
towards the front of the head and so we
identify this network that the more it

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
identify this network that the more it
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.030
identify this network that the more it
reduced its activation for pre to post

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
reduced its activation for pre to post
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.920
reduced its activation for pre to post
sleep deprivation those people who

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
sleep deprivation those people who
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.320
sleep deprivation those people who
showed more of a reduction we're the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
showed more of a reduction we're the
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.730
showed more of a reduction we're the
ones who did the worse so in a sense we

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740
ones who did the worse so in a sense we
 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.260
ones who did the worse so in a sense we
solved the first problem we found

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270
solved the first problem we found
 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.910
solved the first problem we found
something in the brain that was going on

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920
something in the brain that was going on
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.080
something in the brain that was going on
in the brain that was associated with

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
in the brain that was associated with
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.090
in the brain that was associated with
differential susceptibility to sleep

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100
differential susceptibility to sleep
 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.430
differential susceptibility to sleep
deprivation that that was already quite

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
deprivation that that was already quite
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.310
deprivation that that was already quite
in advance no one had really had a

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320
in advance no one had really had a
 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.310
in advance no one had really had a
handle on that the truth is that it's

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320
handle on that the truth is that it's
 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.560
handle on that the truth is that it's
very hard if you just look at someone or

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570
very hard if you just look at someone or
 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.120
very hard if you just look at someone or
talk to them to predict whether they can

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130
talk to them to predict whether they can
 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.980
talk to them to predict whether they can
handle sleep deprivation well or not no

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990
handle sleep deprivation well or not no
 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.400
handle sleep deprivation well or not no
matter what they tell you then what we

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410
matter what they tell you then what we
 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.060
matter what they tell you then what we
try to do is say ok it are we just

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070
try to do is say ok it are we just
 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.340
try to do is say ok it are we just
seeing something on imaging or is it

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350
seeing something on imaging or is it
 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.990
seeing something on imaging or is it
something that really has to do with

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
something that really has to do with
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.210
something that really has to do with
people's behavior and that's where we

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
people's behavior and that's where we
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.410
people's behavior and that's where we
use the transcranial magnetic

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420
use the transcranial magnetic
 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.370
use the transcranial magnetic
stimulation so the idea was that with

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
stimulation so the idea was that with
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.560
stimulation so the idea was that with
TMS depending on the what you're doing

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570
TMS depending on the what you're doing
 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.510
TMS depending on the what you're doing
is giving these pulses of magnetism

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520
is giving these pulses of magnetism
 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.810
is giving these pulses of magnetism
pretty intense you can focus what area

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820
pretty intense you can focus what area
 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.150
pretty intense you can focus what area
of the brain that you put it on and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160
of the brain that you put it on and
 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.710
of the brain that you put it on and
depending on the frequency you can

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720
depending on the frequency you can
 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.990
depending on the frequency you can
either stimulate that area or inhibit

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000
either stimulate that area or inhibit
 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.330
either stimulate that area or inhibit
function in that area so we picked an

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
function in that area so we picked an
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.370
function in that area so we picked an
area that showed reduction post sleep

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
area that showed reduction post sleep
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.320
area that showed reduction post sleep
deprivation and we tried to stimulate it

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330
deprivation and we tried to stimulate it
 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.510
deprivation and we tried to stimulate it
and our hope was that if we stimulated

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520
and our hope was that if we stimulated
 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.010
and our hope was that if we stimulated
that area we can improve people's

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020
that area we can improve people's
 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.580
that area we can improve people's
performance and we focused on those the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590
performance and we focused on those the
 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.560
performance and we focused on those the
occipital and the occipital and the

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570
occipital and the occipital and the
 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.870
occipital and the occipital and the
parietal areas that were that seemed to

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880
parietal areas that were that seemed to
 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.140
parietal areas that were that seemed to
show the most reduction and what we

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150
show the most reduction and what we
 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.090
show the most reduction and what we
found which was surprising to me is that

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100
found which was surprising to me is that
 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.640
found which was surprising to me is that
first of all the stimulation to the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650
first of all the stimulation to the
 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.640
first of all the stimulation to the
occipital area did help people respond a

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
occipital area did help people respond a
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.300
occipital area did help people respond a
little faster compared to some other

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310
little faster compared to some other
 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.920
little faster compared to some other
area that had nothing to do with the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930
area that had nothing to do with the
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.170
area that had nothing to do with the
network and the people who benefited

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180
network and the people who benefited
 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.690
network and the people who benefited
most from that stimulation were the

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700
most from that stimulation were the
 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.100
most from that stimulation were the
people who would show the most reduction

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110
people who would show the most reduction
 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.890
people who would show the most reduction
in the network which which is another

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900
in the network which which is another
 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.270
in the network which which is another
confirmation that we were finding

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280
confirmation that we were finding
 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.910
confirmation that we were finding
something interesting so I found that

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920
something interesting so I found that
 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.590
something interesting so I found that
quite surprising now it's not it's not a

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600
quite surprising now it's not it's not a
 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.570
quite surprising now it's not it's not a
cure for sleep deprivation it was only

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580
cure for sleep deprivation it was only
 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.539
cure for sleep deprivation it was only
while we were stimulating and while they

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549
while we were stimulating and while they
 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.960
while we were stimulating and while they
were performing that task you know so to

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970
were performing that task you know so to
 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.970
were performing that task you know so to
imagine let's say you could really bring

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980
imagine let's say you could really bring
 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.800
imagine let's say you could really bring
that into real life you know you'd have

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810
that into real life you know you'd have
 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.450
that into real life you know you'd have
to imagine like a truck driver who's

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460
to imagine like a truck driver who's
 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.390
to imagine like a truck driver who's
very sleepy having a magnetic stimulator

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400
very sleepy having a magnetic stimulator
 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.020
very sleepy having a magnetic stimulator
on there

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030
on there
 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.100
on there
so I don't think it's really very

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110
so I don't think it's really very
 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.610
so I don't think it's really very
practical but it was an idea of showing

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620
practical but it was an idea of showing
 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.400
practical but it was an idea of showing
that we have this brain network maybe we

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410
that we have this brain network maybe we
 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.020
that we have this brain network maybe we
could intervene in other ways kind of

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030
could intervene in other ways kind of
 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.510
could intervene in other ways kind of
things that we thought about if we were

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520
things that we thought about if we were
 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.520
things that we thought about if we were
to continue that line of research would

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530
to continue that line of research would
 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.620
to continue that line of research would
be maybe we could train people using

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630
be maybe we could train people using
 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.360
be maybe we could train people using
feedback to actually but using the kind

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370
feedback to actually but using the kind
 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.700
feedback to actually but using the kind
of neuro biofeedback to actually use

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710
of neuro biofeedback to actually use
 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.320
of neuro biofeedback to actually use
that network more effectively so if they

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330
that network more effectively so if they
 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.970
that network more effectively so if they
were feeling tired maybe they could

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980
were feeling tired maybe they could
 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.010
were feeling tired maybe they could
actually by themselves up regulate that

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020
actually by themselves up regulate that
 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.160
actually by themselves up regulate that
Network the final experiment that we did

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170
Network the final experiment that we did
 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.030
Network the final experiment that we did
was even more dramatic what we did is we

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040
was even more dramatic what we did is we
 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.680
was even more dramatic what we did is we
did the exact same thing we we

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690
did the exact same thing we we
 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.960
did the exact same thing we we
sleep-deprived people for 48 hours but

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970
sleep-deprived people for 48 hours but
 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.640
sleep-deprived people for 48 hours but
twice a day during the two days of sleep

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650
twice a day during the two days of sleep

deprivation they did this memory task

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810
deprivation they did this memory task
 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.320
deprivation they did this memory task
that I described and they got

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330
that I described and they got
 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.880
that I described and they got
stimulation to that brain area while

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890
stimulation to that brain area while
 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.690
stimulation to that brain area while
they were doing the memory task and some

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700
they were doing the memory task and some
 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.159
they were doing the memory task and some
people got that stimulation and some

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169
people got that stimulation and some
 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.870
people got that stimulation and some
were in a like a placebo group they

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880
were in a like a placebo group they
 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.140
were in a like a placebo group they
didn't get it and we're overall we

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150
didn't get it and we're overall we
 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.120
didn't get it and we're overall we
didn't see a huge difference between

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130
didn't see a huge difference between
 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.890
didn't see a huge difference between
this TMS treat it was like a drug study

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900
this TMS treat it was like a drug study
 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.200
this TMS treat it was like a drug study
really but using TMS we didn't see a

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210
really but using TMS we didn't see a
 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.780
really but using TMS we didn't see a
huge differences between the the treated

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790
huge differences between the the treated
 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.790
huge differences between the the treated
group and the untreated group but on

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800
group and the untreated group but on
 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.250
group and the untreated group but on
some very specific measures we did see

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260
some very specific measures we did see
 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.370
some very specific measures we did see
some differential improvement in the TMS

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380
some differential improvement in the TMS
 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.380
some differential improvement in the TMS
group and why that's interesting is that

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:45.390
group and why that's interesting is that
 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.409
group and why that's interesting is that
we were the post testing wasn't done

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419
we were the post testing wasn't done
 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.200
we were the post testing wasn't done
while they were getting TMS so there was

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210
while they were getting TMS so there was
 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.570
while they were getting TMS so there was
a more long-term relationship

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580
a more long-term relationship
 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.240
a more long-term relationship
so perhaps getting that for sessions of

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250
so perhaps getting that for sessions of
 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.980
so perhaps getting that for sessions of
stimulation actually help these people

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990
stimulation actually help these people
 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.060
stimulation actually help these people
regulate this network a little better
