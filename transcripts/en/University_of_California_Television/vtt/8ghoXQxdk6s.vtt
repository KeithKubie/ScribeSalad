00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.263
(bright music)

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.090
- Welcome to A Conversation With History,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.330
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.330
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.763
Our guest today is Noam Chomsky.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.950
Noam, welcome to Berkley.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.920
Where were you born and raised?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.920
- I was born in Philadelphia, 1928.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.230
Stayed there til I went
through undergraduate school,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.420
University of Pennsylvania,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.340
then went off to Harvard
for a couple of years

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.090
in a research fellowship,
and then graduate school.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.880
When I was done with
that, went over to MIT,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.080
and I've been in Boston ever since.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.160
Around Boston since about 1950.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.760
- Your parents both
were Hebrew grammarians

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.970
and taught Hebrew school?

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.840
- My father was professionally
a Hebrew scholar,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.970
and his main work was Hebrew grammar,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.313
and my mother was a Hebrew teacher.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.580
My father sort of ran
the Hebrew school system

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.790
in the city of Philadelphia.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.090
My mother taught in it.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.310
He taught in Hebrew college later.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.040
There's a university of Jewish studies,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.000
graduate university of Jewish studies,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.350
that's the college which he taught in.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.320
But they were all part of what amounted

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.943
to a kind of Hebrew ghetto, Jewish ghetto,

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:52.730
in Philadelphia.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.350
Not physical ghetto, it was
scattered around the city,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.380
but cultural ghetto.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.810
- And was Hebrew the
language spoken at home?

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.643
- No.
- No?

00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:01.290
- Second.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.550
It was in the background.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.933
So for example, by the
time I was eight or nine,

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:11.140
say Friday evening, my
father and I would read

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.633
Hebrew literature together.

00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:16.800
- [Harry] And looking back,
how do you think your parents

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.073
shaped your perspectives on the world?

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.430
- Well, those are always very
hard questions to answer,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.720
because it's a combination
of influence and resistance,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.230
which is difficult to sort out.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.020
I mean, undoubtedly, the background

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.010
has shaped the kinds of interests

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.010
and tendencies and
directions that I've pursued,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.090
but it was...

00:02:44.242 --> 00:02:46.580
It was independent.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.710
I mean I think more direct influences

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.910
actually came from other
parts of the family.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.490
- [Harry] Mhm, please, go ahead.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.220
- Well, my parents were immigrants

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.800
and they happened to
end up in Philadelphia,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.820
but my mother from New York,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.940
and my father from Baltimore.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.740
When he came over in
1913 for whatever reason,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.190
his family went to Baltimore

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.810
and my mother's family,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.810
from another part of
the Pale of Settlement,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.540
came to New York.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.270
And there were two different families,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.760
there was the New York family
and the Baltimore family,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.160
and we were in the middle in Philadelphia.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.753
So we naturally went out
the back, but close by.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.900
The families were totally different.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.980
Now, the Baltimore family
were ultra-Orthodox.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.710
In fact, my father told me

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.900
that they had become more
Orthodox when they got here

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.250
than they even were in the shtetl,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.240
the little town in Ukraine
where they came from.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.130
In general there was a tendency

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.230
among some sectors of immigrants

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.230
to intensify the cultural tradition,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.540
probably as a way of
identifying themselves

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.320
in a strange environment, I suppose.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.970
So that was that family.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.160
The other part of the family, my mother's,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.120
was mainly Jewish working class.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.783
Very radical, the Jewish
element had disappeared.

00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:15.880
This was the 1930s, so they
were part of the ferment

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.880
of radical activism that
was going on in the 30s

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.400
in all sorts of ways.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.740
And of all of them,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.040
the one who actually did
influence me a great deal

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.020
was an uncle by marriage,

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.580
who was an extremely interesting person.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.580
He came into the family when
I was about seven or eight,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.320
and became a big influence.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.920
Married my aunt.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.880
He was brought up in New York,

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.440
also from an immigrant family,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.288
but he'd grown up in a
poor area of New York.

00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:55.560
In fact, he himself never
went past fourth grade.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.973
It was, you're on the streets, you know?

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.830
This criminal background,
all sorts of stuff.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.830
What's going on in the under
class ghettos in New York.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.690
He happened to have a physical deformity,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.570
so he was able to get a newsstand

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.930
under a compensation program
that was run in the 1930s

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.400
for people with disabilities.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.300
He had a newsstand on
72nd street in New York.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.410
Lived nearby in a little apartment.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.650
And I spent a lot of time there.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.090
That newsstand became
an intellectual center

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.380
for emigres from Europe,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.550
lots of German and other
emigres who were coming,

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.860
and he was a very educated person.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.810
Like I said, never went past fourth grade,

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.330
but maybe the most educated
person I've ever met,

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.120
self-educated.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.950
Without going through the whole story,

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.910
he ended up being a lay analyst

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.977
on a riverside apartment in New York,

00:06:00.977 --> 00:06:04.400
but the newsstand itself was a very lively

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.940
intellectual center with
professors of this and that

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.020
arguing all night,

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.730
and working at the
newsstand was a lot of fun.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.440
- So newspapers and events of the world

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.720
were mixed up with ideas,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.900
almost like a coffee
house without the coffee?

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.320
- Yeah, the newspapers were
kind of like an artifact,

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.210
so for example I went for years

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.773
thinking that there was a
newspaper called Newsinmira.

00:06:27.847 --> 00:06:30.520
The reason is that as people
came out of the subway station

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.061
and raced past the newsstand, they'd say,

00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:34.036
"Newsinmira."

00:06:34.036 --> 00:06:35.390
Well, I heard it that way,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.750
and I gave them two tabloids,

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.426
which I later discovered
are the News and the Mirror.

00:06:40.426 --> 00:06:41.410
(laughs)

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.090
I noticed that as they
picked up the Newsinmira

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.680
the first thing they opened
to was the sports page.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.750
- I see, I see. (laughs)

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.790
This is an eight year
old picture of the world.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.900
But yeah, there were newspapers there,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.240
but that was kind of like the background

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.050
of the discussions that were going on.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.390
And then through him and
through other influences,

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.230
I kind of got myself involved

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.550
in the ongoing 30s radicalism.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.500
And that was very much
part of the Hebrew based,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.570
Zionist oriented, this
is Palestine, pre-Israel,

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.904
Palestine-oriented life.

00:07:19.904 --> 00:07:21.390
And that was a good part of my life.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.980
I became a Hebrew teacher, myself,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.813
for Zionist youth, later,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:32.250
combining it with the radical
activism in various ways.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.913
Actually, that's the way
I got into linguistics.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.293
- One of the formative influences,

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.960
as I understand it, in
this period for you,

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.903
was reading George Orwell.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.950
And also in terms of events,

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.030
really in addition to the Depression,

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.680
the Spanish Civil War.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.603
Tell us a little about that mix.

00:07:55.603 --> 00:07:57.600
- It came the other way.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.420
Orwell's great book, in my
opinion, his greatest book,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.653
Homage to Catalonia,

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.250
I think it was first published 1937,

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.980
but it was suppressed.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.210
A couple hundred copies published.

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.490
Both in England and the United States,

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.650
it was essentially suppressed.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.210
The reason was it was very anti-communist,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.640
and in those days that didn't sell.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.850
During the second World War
it was totally suppressed,

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.690
because you couldn't be, you
know, there was Uncle Joe.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.631
So it didn't sell, what he was doing.

00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:31.553
I think his book finally
reached the public,

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.670
this is from memory so
maybe the dates are wrong,

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.830
but I think it was around 1947 or '48,

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.800
with an introduction by Lionel Trilling,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.650
and it was presented as a Cold
War document at that time.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.500
I mean Orwell, who had died
already, would have hated it.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.030
And that's when I found
Homage to Catalonia,

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.720
but I'd been interested
in the Spanish Civil War

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.230
long before.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.500
- And you actually wrote,

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.079
your first essay was as a ten year old

00:08:57.079 --> 00:08:58.167
on the Spanish Civil War.

00:08:58.167 --> 00:08:59.680
What did you say then,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.950
and what do you think now

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:04.200
about how that event and your
response to it influenced you?

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.831
- Well, the article, like you
said, I was ten years old.

00:09:07.831 --> 00:09:09.069
(laughs)

00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:10.450
I'm sure I would not
want to read it today.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:14.200
But I remember what it was about,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.090
because I remember what struck me.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.670
This was right after
the fall of Barcelona.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.010
The fascist forces had
conquered Barcelona,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.130
that was essentially the end
of the Spanish Civil War.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.170
The article was about the
spread of fascism around Europe.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.690
So it started off by talking about Munich,

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.690
and Barcelona and the spread
of the Nazi fascist power,

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.260
which was extremely frightening.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.620
And then just to add a little
word of personal background,

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.080
we happened to be, for
most of my childhood,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.960
the only Jewish family in
a mostly Irish and German

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.463
Catholic neighborhood.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.930
Sort of a lower middle class neighborhood,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.930
which was very anti-Semitic,
and quite pro-Nazi.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.530
I mean it's obvious
why the Irish would be,

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.950
you know, they hated the British,

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.040
not surprising the Germans were.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.540
But I can remember beer
parties when Paris fell,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.540
and the sense of the
threat of this black cloud

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.080
spreading over Europe
was very frightening.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.010
I could pick up my mother's
attitudes, particularly,

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.808
she was terrified by it.

00:10:32.808 --> 00:10:34.560
And it was also in my personal life,

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.400
'cause I saw the streets.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.670
Interesting, for some reason,

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.180
which I do not understand to this day,

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.090
my brother and I never talked
to our parents about it.

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.410
I don't think they knew

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.160
that we were living in an
anti-Semitic neighborhood.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.420
But on the streets, you know,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.240
you go out and play ball with the kids

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.690
or try to walk to the bus or something,

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.740
it was a constant threat.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.920
And it was just the kind of thing

00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.287
you didn't talk to your parents about.

00:10:58.287 --> 00:11:01.420
You knew, for some reason,
you didn't talk to them.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.450
To the day of their death,

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.000
they didn't know.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.850
But there was this
combination of the knowing

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.720
that this cloud was
spreading over the world,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.050
and picking up, particularly,

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.830
my mother's attitudes,
very upset about it,

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.740
my father too, but more constrained,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.440
and knowing from the uncles and aunts,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.130
some of the background,

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.100
and living it in the streets
in my own daily life,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.290
that made it very real.

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.720
Anyhow, by the late 30s I
did become quite interested

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.830
in Spanish anarchism and
the Spanish Civil War

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.490
where all this was being
fought out at the time.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.670
It was right before the
World War broke out,

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.803
but a kind of microcosm,
what was going on in Spain.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.410
By the time I was old enough
to get on a train by myself,

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:56.410
around 10 or 11, I would go
to New York for a weekend,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.880
stay with my aunts and uncles

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.230
and hang around at anarchist bookstores

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.460
down around Union Square
and Fourth Avenue.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.363
There were little bookstores from emigres.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.540
Really interesting people,

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.510
to my mind they looked about 90,

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.448
they were maybe in the 40s or something.

00:12:17.448 --> 00:12:18.500
(laughs)

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.840
These people who were very
interested in young people,

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.450
they wanted young people to come along.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.860
I spent a lot of attention
talking to these people,

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.020
this real education.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.340
And then out of that,
when I wrote the article,

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:33.610
it was with that background.

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.460
It was long before I heard of Orwell.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.560
- These experiences we've described,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.200
you were saying that it
led you into linguistics

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.360
but it also led you into
your view of politics

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.460
and of the world,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.250
and you know, you're a
libertarian anarchist,

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.460
and when one hears that

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.660
in the way issues are
framed in this country,

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.140
and you know why there's
often so many misperceptions,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.640
because of things that you've written.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.850
Help us understand what that means,

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.390
in other words, it doesn't
mean that you favor chaos

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.920
or no government, necessarily.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.280
- Well remember, the United States

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.273
is sort of out of the
world, on this topic.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.070
Britain is to a limited extent,

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:15.630
but the United States is like, on Mars.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.600
So here, the term libertarian
means the opposite

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.150
of what it always meant in history.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.020
Libertarian, throughout
modern European history,

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.090
meant socialist anarchist.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:30.277
It meant the socialist
movement, the worker's movement,

00:13:30.277 --> 00:13:32.130
and the socialist movement

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.880
sort of broke into two branches, roughly.

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.440
One statist, one anti-statist.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.710
The statist branch led to Bolshevism

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.200
and Lenin and Trotsky, and so on.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.010
The anti-statist branch,
which included Marxists,

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:52.820
left Marxists, Pannekoek,
Rosa Luxemburg, others,

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.350
to kind of merge, more or less,

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.910
into an amalgam with a
big strain of anarchism,

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.740
into what was called
libertarian socialism.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.110
So libertarian in Europe,
always meant socialist.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.210
Here it means ultra, you know, Ayn Rand,

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.960
or Cato Institute or something like that.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.540
But that's a special US usage,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.770
having to do with a lot of things

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.300
quite special about the way
the United States developed,

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.810
and this is part of it.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:25.940
There it meant, and always meant, to me,

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:30.820
socialist, and the anti-state
branch of socialism,

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.600
which meant highly organized society,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.310
completely organized,
nothing to do with chaos.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.240
But based on a democracy
all the way through.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.690
That means democratic
control of communities,

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:49.620
of workplaces, of federal structures,

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.910
built on systems of voluntary association

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.130
spreading internationally.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.310
That's traditional anarchism.

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.510
At least, anybody can have
the word if they like,

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.440
but it's a mainstream,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.240
probably the mainstream
of traditional anarchism,

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.710
and it has roots, you know,

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.620
coming back to the United States,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.150
it has very strong roots

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.910
in the American working class movement.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.260
So if you go back to, say, the 1850s,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.100
the beginnings of the
Industrial Revolution,

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.350
this was right around
the area where I live,

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.470
in eastern Massachusetts
textile plants and so on,

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:27.930
the people working in those plants

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:32.930
were in part, young women
coming off the farms.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.510
They were called factory girls.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.530
So the women come to the farms,
work in the textile plant.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.190
Some of them were Irish
immigrants in Boston

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:45.480
and that group of people.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.270
They had an extremely rich
and interesting culture.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:53.370
So kind of like my uncle who
never went past fourth grade,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.730
very educated, reading modern literature.

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:00.610
They didn't bother with
European radicalism,

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:01.810
that had no effect on them,

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.170
but the general literary culture

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.510
they were very much a part of,

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.540
and they developed their own conceptions

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.730
of how the world ought to be organized.

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:11.170
They had their own newspapers.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.470
In fact, the period of the
freest press in the United States

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.250
was probably around the 1850s.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.490
In the 1850s the scale
of the popular press,

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.210
meaning run by factory
girls in Lowell and so on,

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.430
was scale of the commercial
press or even greater.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.950
And these were independent newspapers,

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.810
a lot of interesting scholarship on them,

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:32.860
you can read 'em now.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.300
Just spontaneously,
without any background,

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.260
never heard of Marx or
Bakunin or anyone else.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.970
Now, they developed the same ideas.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.953
They thought that, from
their point of view,

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.820
what they called wage-slavery,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.350
renting yourself to an owner,

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.793
was not very different
from chattel slavery,

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.390
that they were fighting
the Civil War about,

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.900
and you have to recall that
in the mid-19th century,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.450
that was a common view
in the United States.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:09.180
For example, it was the position
of the Republican party.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.120
It was Abraham Lincoln's position.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.770
It was not an odd view,

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.160
that there isn't much difference

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.320
between selling yourself
and renting yourself.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.700
So the idea of renting yourself,

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.513
meaning working for wages, was degrading.

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:25.143
It was just an attack on
your personal integrity.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.190
And they despised the industrial
system that was developing,

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:32.970
that was destroying their culture,

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.050
destroying their independence,
their individuality,

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.213
constraining them to be
subordinate to masters.

00:17:42.125 --> 00:17:44.650
There was a tradition of
what was called Republicanism

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.650
in the United States, we're free people.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.910
The first free people in the world.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.150
This was destroying and
undermining that freedom.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.720
This was the core of the
labor movement all over,

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.210
and included in it was the assumption,

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.767
just taken for granted, I'm quoting,

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:04.210
"Those who work in the
mills should run them."

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:09.070
In fact, one of their main
slogans, I'll just quote it, was,

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:13.577
they condemned what they called
the new spirit of the age.

00:18:13.577 --> 00:18:16.798
"Gain wealth, forgetting all but self."

00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:17.631
(laughs)

00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:20.440
That idea, the new spirit,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.350
that you should only be interested

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.100
in gaining wealth and
forgetting about your relations

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:24.933
to other people.

00:18:24.933 --> 00:18:28.410
They regarded it as just a violation

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.610
of fundamental human nature,

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:32.430
and a degrading idea.

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:34.870
Well that grew into,

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.010
that was a strong, rich, American culture,

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.780
which was crushed by violence.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.040
The United States has a
very violent labor history.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.710
Much more so than Europe.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.860
Now, it was wiped out over a long period,

00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.720
but with extreme violence.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.800
By the time it picked
up again in the 1930s

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.410
that's when I sort of personally

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:59.940
came into the tail end of it.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.330
Right after the second World
War it was just crushed.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.840
So by now it's forgotten.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.710
But it's very real, and see,

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.130
I don't really think it's forgotten,

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.150
I think it's just below the surface

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.140
in people's consciousness.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.050
- And this is a continuing problem,

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:17.070
and it's something that emerges
your scientific work also,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.380
mainly the extent to which histories

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.010
and traditions are forgotten,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.350
and actually to really
define a new position

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.253
often means going back and
finding those older traditions.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.970
- Things like this, they're forgotten

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.220
in the intellectual culture,

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.790
but my feeling is they're probably alive

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.670
in the popular culture,

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.150
in people's sentiments and attitudes

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.740
and understanding and so on.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.750
I mean, I know when I talk to, say,

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.360
working classes audiences today,

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.630
and I talk about these ideas,

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.690
they seem very natural to them.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.650
I mean, it's true,
nobody talks about them,

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.860
but when you bring it up, I mean,

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.350
the idea that you have to
rent yourself to somebody

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.050
and follow their orders

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.920
and that they own, and you work there,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.970
and you built it but you don't own it,

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.790
it's a highly unnatural notion,

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.850
and you don't have to study
any complicated theories

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.410
to see that this is just
an attack on human dignity.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.540
- So coming out of this tradition,

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:17.370
being influenced by it, and
continue to believe in it,

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.420
what is your notion of legitimate power?

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.920
Under what circumstances
is power legitimate?

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.680
- Well, the core of the
anarchist tradition,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.490
as I understand it,

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.180
is that power is always illegitimate

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.810
unless it proves itself to be legitimate.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.360
So the burden of proof is always on those

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.140
who claim that some authoritarian,

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.080
hierarchic relation is legitimate.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.640
If they can't prove it, then
it should be dismantled.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.310
Can you ever prove it?

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.480
Well, it's a heavy
burden of proof to bear,

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.120
but I think sometimes you can bear it.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.650
So to take a homely example,

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.660
if I'm walking down the street

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:02.170
with my four year old granddaughter,

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.410
and she starts to run into the street

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.920
and I grab her arm and pull her back

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.740
that's an exercise of power and authority

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.630
but I think I can give
a justification for it.

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.420
Obvious what the justification would be.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.900
And maybe there are other cases

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.600
where you can justify it,

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.980
but the question that
always should be asked,

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.700
for most, in our mind, is
"Why should I accept it?"

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:28.000
It's the responsibility of
those who exercise power

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.320
to show that somehow it's legitimate.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.310
It's not the responsibility of anyone else

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.060
to show that it's illegitimate.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.510
It's illegitimate by assumption.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:40.520
If it's a relation of
authority among human beings

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.420
which places some above others,

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.580
then that's illegitimate by assumption.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.470
Unless you can give a strong argument

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:50.010
to show that it's right, you've lost.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.300
It's kind of like the use of violence,

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.230
say, in international affairs.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.950
There's a very heavy
burden of proof to be borne

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.740
by anyone who calls for violence.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.760
Maybe it can be sometimes justified,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.630
personally I'm not a committed pacifist,

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.820
so I think that yes, it
can sometimes be justified.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.610
So I thought, in fact
in that article I wrote,

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.790
in fourth grade,

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.260
I thought the West should be using force

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.550
to try to stop fascism,
and I still think so.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.730
But now I know a lot more about it,

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:26.130
I know that the West was
actually supporting fascism,

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.640
supporting Franco, supporting
Mussolini and so on,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.480
and even Hitler.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.990
I didn't know that at the time,

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:35.530
but I thought then, and I think now,

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.060
that the use of force to stop that plague

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.330
would have been legitimate,

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.530
and finally, was legitimate.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.043
But an argument has to be given for it.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.370
- Is there less of a burden of proof

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:54.343
when you're looking at
weaker power entities,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.030
looking at the powerless, basically,

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.810
is the burden of proof less for them?

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.300
- No, same.
- Same.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:05.030
- I mean, take, say, people living

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.710
under a military occupation,

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.541
or under racist regimes and so on.

00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:11.840
Now, they have a right to resist,

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.110
actually everyone in the world

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.770
except the United States and Israel

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.780
believes they have a right to exist.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.610
If you look at the UN resolutions.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.140
- Talking about Palestine now, yeah.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.966
- Palestine or South Africa,

00:23:22.966 --> 00:23:24.890
I mean, if you take a
look at the major UN,

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.660
there are major UN
resolutions on terrorism.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.370
One in 1987 denouncing the plague

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.810
of international terrorism,

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.250
calling on everyone to
do something to stop it,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.410
it passed with two negative votes,

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:39.160
the United States and Israel.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.570
The reason was exactly
this, they explained it.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.267
It said said "Nothing in this resolution

00:23:45.267 --> 00:23:48.507
"will prejudice the right of people

00:23:48.507 --> 00:23:51.177
"to struggle for
independence against racist

00:23:51.177 --> 00:23:55.120
"and colonialist regimes and
foreign military occupation."

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.290
That referred to South Africa and Israel.

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.700
So therefore the United States objected,

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.120
because it opposed, it
does not grant the right

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.610
of people to struggle against
racist and colonialist regimes

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:08.690
and foreign occupation.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.420
The US and Israel are alone in that.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.330
When the US votes against a resolution,

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.690
it's out of history, so
you don't read about it,

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.860
but it's there.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.660
The war against terrorism,
isn't new, it's old,

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.763
the US is alone in opposing it.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.330
Now, grant, I believe that
the world right on this

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.470
and that the US is wrong.

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.910
There is a right to resist
racist and colonialist regimes

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.810
and foreign military occupation,

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:35.735
but then comes your question.

00:24:35.735 --> 00:24:38.960
Is there a right to use
violence to do that?

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.650
Well, no, I think the burden of proof

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.100
is on those who say there
is a right to use violence

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.170
and that's a hard burden to meet,

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:48.950
both morally and tactically,

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:52.899
and frankly I think it
can very rarely be met.

00:24:52.899 --> 00:24:56.650
- I'm curious, I think
I've read interviews

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.870
where you have tried to separate

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:04.340
your approach in science to
your approach in politics,

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.670
but I'm curious as to whether,

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.070
I'll ask the question again,

00:25:11.872 --> 00:25:12.705
let me ask you this,

00:25:12.705 --> 00:25:15.200
how does your approach to
the world as a scientist

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.113
affect and influence the
way you approach politics?

00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:24.920
- See, I think studying science

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.730
is a good way to get
into fields like history.

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:29.563
- Okay.

00:25:29.563 --> 00:25:32.360
- The reason is you learn
what an argument means.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.870
You learn what evidence is.

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:39.543
You learn what makes sense
to postulate and when.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.450
What's going to be convincing.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:47.050
You sort of internalize the
modes of rational inquiry,

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:49.450
which happen to be much more advanced

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:51.310
in the sciences than anywhere else.

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:52.780
On the other hand, you know,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.730
applying relativity theory to history

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.563
isn't going to get you anywhere.

00:25:57.563 --> 00:25:58.930
- No, no, yeah. (laughs)

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.560
- It's a mode of thinking,

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.070
and I try at least,

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.350
with what success others have to judge,

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.370
to use the mode of thinking

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:11.991
that you would use in the
sciences to human affairs,

00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:13.891
and I think it's a good idea to do so.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.050
As to other connections,

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.493
there may be some but
they're pretty remote.

00:26:20.724 --> 00:26:22.410
If you think about the core notions

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.430
of what I was calling anarchism,

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.570
which as I say, is just deeply rooted

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.340
in popular traditions everywhere,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:31.950
for good reasons, I think,

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.120
it's based on a certain conception of,

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.140
if you sort of try to take it apart,

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.280
it's based on some kind of conception

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.250
of what Bakunin once called
an instinct for freedom.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.010
That people have an instinctive drive

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.910
for freedom from domination and control,

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:49.570
and I think that's, you can't prove it,

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:50.893
but it's probably true.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.990
The core of the work

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.220
that I've been interested in in language,

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.470
is also interested in a
kind of human freedom.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:04.470
The cognitive capacity
to create indefinitely

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.130
and its roots in our nature.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.220
Now, historically, people
have drawn a connection

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.510
between this.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.240
So if you look at the, say,

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.260
18th century Enlightenment
and the Romantic period,

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.410
this connection was explicitly drawn.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:23.540
So if you read Rousseau, or
Wilhelm von Humboldt and others,

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.570
the connection between human freedom

00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:31.030
as in the social and political realm,

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.460
and human freedom in the creative use

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.970
of cognitive capacities,
particularly language,

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.690
they did try to establish a connection.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:42.523
Now if you ask,

00:27:42.523 --> 00:27:45.740
"Can this be connected
at the level of science?"

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.150
The answer is no.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:50.490
It's just a sort of a parallel intuition

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.050
which doesn't link up empirically,

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.750
but maybe could someday if we knew enough.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.640
- You said somewhere, I
think in this new book,

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:04.707
on power, "You can lie
or distort the story

00:28:04.707 --> 00:28:07.007
"of the French Revolution
as long as you like,

00:28:07.007 --> 00:28:08.237
"and nothing will happen.

00:28:08.237 --> 00:28:10.567
"Propose a false theory in chemistry,

00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:12.343
"and it will be refuted tomorrow."

00:28:12.343 --> 00:28:14.460
- Yeah, that's the kind of thing I mean.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.330
Nature's tough.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:18.510
You can't fiddle with mother Nature,

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.460
she's a hard task mistress.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:25.440
So you're forced to be honest
in the natural sciences.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.610
In the soft fields, you're
not forced to be honest.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.970
Nobody's gonna undermine, I mean,

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:35.270
there are standards, of course.

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:37.650
On the other hand, they're very weak,

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:42.320
and if what you propose is
ideologically acceptable,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.950
that is, supportive of power systems,

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.123
you can get away with a huge amount.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:52.610
In fact the difference
between the conditions

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:55.520
that are imposed on dissident opinion

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:59.060
and on mainstream opinion
are radically different.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.290
I might give you concrete
examples, if you like.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:02.123
- [Harry] Yeah, do.

00:29:02.123 --> 00:29:04.830
- Okay, so for example, if
I write about terrorism,

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.820
say I've written about terrorism

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:09.730
and I think you can show
without much difficulty

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.580
that terrorism pretty
much corresponds to power.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:15.270
I don't think that's very surprising.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.110
But the more powerful states

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.090
are involved in more
terrorism by and large,

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.390
and the United States
is the most powerful,

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.690
so it's involved in massive terrorism

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.830
by its own definition of terrorism.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.820
Well, if I want to establish that,

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.930
I'm required to give a
huge amount of evidence

00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:34.410
and I think that's a good thing,

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:35.700
I don't object to that.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.500
I think anyone who makes that claim

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.190
should be held to very high standards,

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:42.870
through extensive documentation

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:44.770
from the internal secret record,

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.650
from historical record, and so on,

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.760
and if you ever find a comma misplaced,

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.210
somebody ought to criticize you for it.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.350
So I think those standards are fine.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:57.280
Now, let's suppose that you
play the mainstream game.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:59.880
So, for example, Yale University Press

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.913
just came out with a volume
called the Age of Terror.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.820
The contributors are leading historians,

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.670
many of them Yale, the
top people in the field.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.380
You read the book the Age of Terror,

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.430
the first thing you notice is
there isn't a single footnote.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.140
There isn't a single reference.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.193
They're just off the top
of your head statements.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:24.270
Some of the statements are
tenable, some are untenable,

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.500
but there are no criteria,

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:28.700
there are no intellectual
criteria imposed.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.920
The reviews of the book are very favorable

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.250
and laudatory, and maybe
it's right, maybe it's wrong,

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.920
I mean, I think a lot of it's wrong,

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.120
and demonstrably wrong,

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.680
but it doesn't really matter.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.060
You can say anything you want,

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.440
because you're supporting power

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.330
and nobody expects you
to justify anything.

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:45.993
For example, if I was, say,

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.430
in the unimaginable circumstance

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.300
that I was on, say, Nightline,

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:57.300
and I was asked, say, "Do you
think Gaddafi is a terrorist?"

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.610
I could say, "Yeah,
Gaddafi's a terrorist."

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:02.170
I don't need any evidence.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:06.020
Suppose I said George Bush is a terrorist.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.231
Well then I would be
expected to provide evidence.

00:31:09.231 --> 00:31:10.690
"No, you can't say that."

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:12.543
- So you aren't cut off, right then.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.960
- See, and in fact the structure

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.120
of the news production system

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.650
is you can't produce evidence.

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:22.210
In fact, there's even a name for it.

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.870
I learned it from the
producer of Nightline,

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.750
Jeff Greenfield, it's called concision.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.470
He was asked in an interview somewhere

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:32.870
why they didn't have me on Nightline,

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.460
and his answer was, two answers,

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.293
first of all, he says,

00:31:36.293 --> 00:31:38.460
"Well he talks Turkish,
nobody understands it."

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:39.527
But the other answer was,

00:31:39.527 --> 00:31:41.410
"He lacks concision."

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.123
Which is correct, I agree with him.

00:31:43.123 --> 00:31:45.970
Now, the kinds of things that
I would say on Nightline,

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.063
you can't say in one sentence,

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:53.450
because they depart
from standard religion.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.290
If you want to repeat the religion

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.270
you can get away with it

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.860
between two commercials.

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.270
If you wanna say something
that questions the religion,

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.240
you're expected to give evidence,

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.110
and that you can't do
between two commercials,

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.590
so therefore you lack concision

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.070
so therefore you can't talk.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.800
I think that's a terrific
technique of propaganda.

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.230
To impose concision is a way
of virtually guaranteeing

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.080
that the party line gets
repeated over and over again

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.790
and that nothing else is heard.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:23.300
- And this is why so much of your work

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.500
in the area of politics

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.560
has really been focused

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.393
on what you call the
manufacturing of consent.

00:32:28.393 --> 00:32:30.810
Mainly, the framing of issues,

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:35.810
the way topics are put off
the table for discussion,

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:43.290
and so in the end what your work suggests

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.680
is that in focusing on that

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.400
and coming to understand that

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.720
then there's hope for really understanding

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.180
the problems we confront.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.290
- Oh yeah, actually, I should say,

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.260
the term manufacturing
of consent is not mine,

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.270
I took it from Walter Lippmann,

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:02.080
the leading public
intellectual and leading media

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.830
figure of the 20th century,

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:05.440
who thought it was a great idea.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.857
He said, "We should manufacture consent.

00:33:07.857 --> 00:33:10.207
"That's the way democracy should work.

00:33:10.207 --> 00:33:13.287
"There should be a small
group of powerful people,

00:33:13.287 --> 00:33:16.467
"and the rest of the
population should be spectators

00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:18.777
"and you should force them to consent

00:33:18.777 --> 00:33:21.460
"by regimenting their minds."

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.500
That's the leading idea
of democratic theorists,

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.900
and the public relations
industry, and so on.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:32.260
So I'm not making it up, I'm
just borrowing their conception

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:35.310
and telling other people what they think.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.810
But yeah, that's very important,

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:37.780
and yes, there is hope.

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.470
I think ordinary common sense suffices,

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.433
no special training, like my uncle,

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:48.760
to unravel this and see
what's really happening.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.170
I don't think it's hard to discover

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.010
that the US is a leading terrorist state,

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:53.173
I think it's obvious.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.480
- And when one reads your arguments,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.043
really, what you're laying
out is fairly simple.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:04.780
Namely, if I can paraphrase,

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:07.610
that if you're suddenly calling Iraq

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:09.520
a rogue state in the 90s,

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.860
well, what were you calling it in the 80s?

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.640
And were they doing the same thing?

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.750
And at that time, were
you helping them do it?

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.970
And this is your critique
of US foreign policy.

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:19.910
- Well, you know, I think,

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:22.980
I mean, if George Bush tells
us, like he did last week,

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.770
and Tony Blair tells us, in this case,

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:29.190
that we can't let Saddam Hussein survive

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.340
because he's the most evil man in history,

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.180
he even used chemical weapons
against his own people,

00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.140
I agree that far.

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:41.210
But it gives hypocrisy a
bad name to stop there.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:44.687
You have to add, "Yes,
he used chemical weapons

00:34:44.687 --> 00:34:45.727
"against his own people,

00:34:45.727 --> 00:34:47.827
"with the support of Daddy Bush,

00:34:47.827 --> 00:34:50.417
"who continued to support
him right past that,

00:34:50.417 --> 00:34:51.857
"knowing what he was doing,

00:34:51.857 --> 00:34:55.407
"helped him develop weapons
of mass destruction,

00:34:55.407 --> 00:34:57.447
"welcomed him as a friend and ally,

00:34:57.447 --> 00:35:01.010
"gave him lavish aid
after all these crimes."

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:04.090
Unless you add that, it's just,

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.710
like I said, giving hypocrisy a bad name.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:08.400
Well, nobody does that.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.200
You can read the commentary

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.270
and the learned opinion,
and leading figures,

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.167
and they just stop,

00:35:14.167 --> 00:35:16.710
"used chemical weapons
against his own people."

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:18.470
Now, this is not difficult to understand.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.670
I think you can explain this

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:22.070
to children in school, you know?

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:24.340
And it takes major effort

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:26.290
for the educated classes

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.550
to prevent people from
knowing these things,

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.950
and that takes dedication.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:32.940
It would be a lot easier
to tell the truth.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.130
Now, this is one example,
it's a characteristic example.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:40.090
So, take, say, by the late 1990s,

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:41.270
the last few years,

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:46.010
there was a huge chorus of
self-adulation in the West,

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.500
about how we're entering
a new age of history

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.550
in which the enlightened states

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:56.620
bring humanitarian ideals to the world

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.930
for the first time in history,

00:35:57.930 --> 00:35:59.670
following principles and values,

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:02.053
and the proof of it is
we're bombing Serbia.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.420
Well, at the very same moment,

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.430
the same people were actively supporting

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:12.210
terrorist atrocities which went way beyond

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:15.140
anything charged to Milosevic in Kosovo.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.670
In fact, I just happened to come back

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:19.390
from the site of one of
them, southeastern Turkey,

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:21.290
where massive atrocities were going on.

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:22.700
- Where the Turkish government

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.720
is committing atrocities
against the Kurdish people.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.600
- Yes, that's true, but
the way I would put it

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.328
is the US government is
committing atrocities.

00:36:30.328 --> 00:36:31.510
- [Harry] By providing aide.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:34.390
- By providing virtually 80% of the arms,

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:37.820
and in an increasing flow
as the atrocities increased,

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.600
providing support, blocking criticism.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.580
The press is helping by not reporting it,

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.140
and in fact, even more amazingly,

00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:51.140
Turkey is praised here, as a
model for opposing terrorism,

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.680
namely by carrying out

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.390
some of the worst terrorist atrocities

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:58.480
of the late 1990s with our assistance.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.770
Well, you know, that's an
impressive contribution

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:02.540
of the educated culture.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.480
It wouldn't be easy.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.470
It takes effort to do this sort of thing,

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:07.060
and it's not hard to explain.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.550
I can explain it in two minutes.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.830
I can even give you the
documentation, if you want.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:13.610
- Now, if we were at the
Council on Foreign Relations,

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:14.443
which we're not,

00:37:14.443 --> 00:37:15.637
the argument would be made,

00:37:15.637 --> 00:37:19.430
"Well, Turkey has to fit
into a larger strategic...

00:37:22.346 --> 00:37:23.557
"view of the world,

00:37:23.557 --> 00:37:28.410
"in which they are a modernizing
secular Islamic state."

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:29.243
Or not an Islamic state,

00:37:29.243 --> 00:37:33.110
they are a state that has
Islam within its population.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:33.943
What would your answer be to that?

00:37:33.943 --> 00:37:35.810
- So therefore we should help them

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:39.300
drive two to three million
people out of their homes,

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.770
destroy thousands of villages.

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:42.170
- No, don't go there.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.003
- Well, that's the question.

00:37:43.003 --> 00:37:46.710
In fact, I think we're
harming Turkey by doing this.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:51.710
We're supporting the most
reactionary strains in Turkey.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.740
Like I said, I was just there.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.900
I was there talking about these things,

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:00.900
and popular support for
opposing the military run regime

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.600
is overwhelming.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.720
We're supporting the military run regime,

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:08.550
we're supporting, we're
preventing its modernization

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.550
and development.

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:11.750
In fact, that's happening
throughout much of the world.

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.230
But even if it were true

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.310
that we were helping modernization,

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.610
that in no sense justifies

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:20.470
participation in some of
the worst acts of terror,

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:24.120
or worse, I don't know
if it's worse, parallel,

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.040
praising them as a model
for countering terror

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.110
by carrying out massive terror.

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:30.953
And you can generalize this.

00:38:30.953 --> 00:38:33.700
You know, take, say, let's
go somewhere else, Indonesia.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:38.700
When Indonesia was following
an independent path

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.410
in the 1950s and early 60s,

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.930
US was strongly opposed,

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:46.140
actually tried to break
up Indonesia in 1958.

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.220
Finally, a military coup took place

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:51.720
with the assistance of
the United States in 1965.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:56.660
The coup massacred maybe a
million people, nobody noticed.

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.660
Mostly landless peasants.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.370
It was greeted here with
complete, unconstrained euphoria.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:04.770
It was described accurately.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:07.950
So, New York Times, it was
a staggering bloodbath,

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:10.910
Time magazine, you
know, boiling bloodbath,

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:11.743
and praise.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:14.270
It was praised because,

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.170
what they called the Indonesian moderates,

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.020
namely the ones who
carried out the massacre,

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.950
were turning the country
into a US client state.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:26.650
Well, from then, 65 til 98,

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.970
in that the Indonesian
leader, one of the worst,

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:30.290
kind of like Saddam Hussein,

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.680
one of the worst criminals
of the modern age,

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.260
was lavishly praised and supported

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.870
as a wonderful person,

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.220
the Clinton administration
called him our kind of guy,

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.680
because he was serving US interests

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.970
while carrying out huge massacres

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.440
and compiling one of the worst records

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.980
of atrocities in the world.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.840
What happened to that in history?

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.320
Well, you know, it's history,

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.740
but it's not what you teach
people in high school,

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.760
as you should in a free country.

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:01.003
That's the task of the intellectuals.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.500
Be careful to be sure

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:05.623
that nobody understands what's going on.

00:40:06.998 --> 00:40:08.510
It's a major task.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:09.600
- You actually believe

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.130
that there are two kinds of intellectuals.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:17.070
One, the kind that serves,
say, power, and are rewarded,

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:20.740
and the other, those who stand outside,

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.163
who basically call a spade a spade.

00:40:23.163 --> 00:40:25.120
- I mean, we all agree with that

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.950
when we're talking about enemies.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:29.350
So when we're talking
about the Soviet Union,

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.240
we all agree that there was a difference

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.087
between the commissars and the dissidents.

00:40:34.087 --> 00:40:35.850
Now the commissars were the guys inside

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.750
who were propagating state propaganda,

00:40:39.596 --> 00:40:42.810
and the dissidents are a very
small group on the fringe

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:44.650
who were trying to call a spade a spade.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.030
And we honor the dissidents,

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.140
and we condemn the commissars.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.260
- Because they were doing
that in our adversaries.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.300
- And when we turn around
at home, it's the opposite.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:57.740
We honor the commissars and
we condemn the dissidents,

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:59.070
and furthermore, this goes right through

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.270
back through history.

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:04.310
You know, go back to classical
Greece, and the Bible.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:07.860
So who drank the hemlock
in classical Greece?

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.904
Was it a commissar or a dissident?

00:41:09.904 --> 00:41:10.930
(laughs)

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.507
When you go to, say, the Bible,

00:41:13.507 --> 00:41:15.490
you know, you read the Biblical record,

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:16.880
there are people called prophets,

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.260
prophets just means intellectuals,

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.680
they were people giving
geo-political analysis,

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.290
moral lessons, that sort of thing.

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:25.940
We call them intellectuals today.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.500
There were the people
we honor as prophets,

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.450
there were the people we
condemn as false prophets.

00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:34.150
But if you look at the Biblical record,

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:36.760
at the time it was the other way around.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.310
The flatterers at the court of King Ahab

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.380
were the ones who were honored,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:42.640
and the ones we call prophets

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.120
were driven into the
desert and imprisoned.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.420
You know, that's the way
it's been throughout history,

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.740
and understandably.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.373
Power does not like to be undermined.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.070
- There's an important point here

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:55.270
that I want to bring out,

00:41:55.270 --> 00:42:00.040
which is if you're comparing
our acting against Serbia

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:02.810
at a time when we're not doing anything

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.040
about East Timor or Indonesia,

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:08.450
or a number of other places.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.390
- It's not that we're not doing it--

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.720
- Well, no that we're
doing the wrong thing.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:13.840
- We're intensifying the atrocity.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.830
- But I guess the really
interesting thing,

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.380
is that as part of the self deception

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.500
that is created by the media,

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.140
we forget we're doing in one place

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.210
and set it where it would be very easy

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.450
to do something about it,

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:29.530
namely, stopping the military aide.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:32.330
Whereas in other areas,
for example Serbia,

00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:33.840
well, if you start bombing,

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.220
you know, what are the
consequences for innocent people?

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.520
- That's another question.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.465
To which it is independent

00:42:38.465 --> 00:42:40.603
of what we should have done in Kosovo.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.690
Maybe we can guess at on its own,

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.930
but what it does show
is that whatever we did

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.100
it's not humanitarian.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.590
Just take a look at everything
else that's going on,

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:50.510
you see that.

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:52.220
So what should we have done in Kosovo?

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:53.680
Well, here you have to look at the record,

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.490
and the record is interesting,

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.750
and it's suppressed by the intellectuals.

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.950
So there's a massive literature about it,

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:02.080
and if you look through that literature

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.960
you'll notice that something
is systematically omitted,

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.000
namely the actual record
of what was happening.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
And we have a voluminous record,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.470
from the state department, from
the British defense system,

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:17.750
from NATO, from the UN.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:20.300
As far as I'm aware, there's
only one book in print

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.000
that reviews that record, mine.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.183
And of course the book is condemned,

00:43:24.183 --> 00:43:26.110
because it reviews the record.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.100
What the record shows is unequivocal.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.500
Right up to shortly before the bombing

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.860
the British were the most hawkish element

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.020
of the coalition.

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.300
Internally, now it's released,

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:39.840
then it was internal,

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.140
regarded the guerrillas as
the main source of atrocities.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.960
This is after the Racak Massacre.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.580
- This would be the Albanian guerrillas.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.890
- Yes, they said they are the
main source of the atrocities.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:51.210
What they're trying to do is to elicit

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:54.140
a disproportionate Serbian response,

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.530
which they did, which would
then bring in the West.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.540
Now, I don't personally believe that,

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.320
but that's the British.

00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:03.180
We know that right up until the bombing,

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.600
nothing much changed.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.600
It was an ugly place, I mean, you know,

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.210
these are not nice guys.

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.360
The Serbian occupiers
were doing vicious things,

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.010
and not on the level of what we were doing

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:15.773
in other places, but bad enough.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.063
But nothing changed up until the bombing.

00:44:20.519 --> 00:44:22.457
When the bombing was undertaken,

00:44:22.457 --> 00:44:25.730
it was on the expectation that
it would elicit atrocities.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.120
Not surprising, you start
bombing people, they react.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.870
And it did, I mean, you
look at the Milosevic trial,

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:35.270
it's for crimes committed
after the bombing,

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:37.970
given one exception, but--

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:40.030
- The bombing made by NATO.

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.630
- After the bombing,
with an invasion threat,

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.520
exactly as anticipated.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.010
Atrocities mounted, and they started

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.343
expelling the population.

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:51.420
Now, those are crimes, undoubtedly,

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.480
this guy's a major criminal,

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.300
but the crimes happened to be provoked

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:59.638
by the NATO bombing.

00:44:59.638 --> 00:45:00.740
Now, what you read is,

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.480
well, we had to bomb to return
the Albanians to their homes.

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:06.540
Yeah, except that they were
driven out of their homes

00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:07.513
after the bombing.

00:45:07.513 --> 00:45:09.490
Now, there were some displaced before,

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:13.800
but the huge expulsion
was after the bombing.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.613
Before that, the West saw it as kind of,

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:20.630
guerrillas trying to elicit
atrocities and responses,

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:22.430
and responses.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:23.740
That's the description.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:24.860
Well, if you don't tell the truth,

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.900
well, you may still decide
it was the right thing

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:28.090
or the wrong thing,

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.900
but unless you at least look at the facts,

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.080
you're not even in the real world.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.540
I mean, for example, it's a fact,

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.070
which we should look at,

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.060
we can ask, was there an alternative?

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.060
It was a bad place, no doubt.

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.618
Was there an alternative to violence?

00:45:43.618 --> 00:45:45.940
Were there diplomatic alternatives?

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.950
Well, you can look back, and you see,

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.920
in fact, I wrote at the time,

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.210
it looks like there are
diplomatic alternatives.

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:55.270
I mean, Serbia had a
position, NATO had a position,

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:57.260
if you actually look at the result

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:59.600
after 78 days of bombing

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.970
it's a compromise between
those two positions.

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:04.880
NATO gave up its most extreme demands,

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.100
Serbs gave up their most extreme demands,

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.710
and there was a kind of compromise.

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:11.430
Could that have been
reached without the bombing

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:12.860
and the atrocities?

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.560
Well, there's a good case that can be made

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.393
that it was.

00:46:15.393 --> 00:46:17.980
But remember, the burden
of proof is on those

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:19.890
who say you have to bomb.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.350
They try to put the
burden of proof on others.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.350
They can't.

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:25.380
It's the ones who use violence

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:27.090
that have the burden of proof.

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.900
- Not everyone is Noam Chomsky,

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:32.980
and can't produce the extraordinary opus

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.740
of works on these issues.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:39.540
So what is your advice for people

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:41.270
who have the same concerns,

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:43.530
who identify with the tradition

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.890
that you come out of,

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:49.890
and who want to be active
in opposing these policies?

00:46:50.503 --> 00:46:54.590
What is it they need to be doing

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:56.250
that would be productive?

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:58.080
- The same as the factory girls

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.220
in the Lowell textile plant 150 years ago.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.130
They joined with others.

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:05.790
To do these things
alone is extremely hard,

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.470
especially when you're
working 50 hours a week

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:10.230
to put put food on the table.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:13.050
Join with others, you
can do a lot of things.

00:47:13.050 --> 00:47:15.320
It's got a big multiplier effect.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:17.660
I mean, that's why unions have always been

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:22.130
in the lead of development of
social and economic progress.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:25.330
They bring together poor
people, working people,

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:27.830
enable them to learn from one another,

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:30.700
to have their own sources of information

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.640
and to act collectively.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.900
That's how everything has changed.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.230
Civil rights movement,
the feminist movement,

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:40.960
the solidarity movement,
the workers' movements.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.650
The reason we don't live in a dungeon

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:47.410
is because people have joined
together to change things,

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:50.060
and there's nothing
different now from before.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.930
In fact, just the last 40 years

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.350
have seen remarkable
changes in this respect.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.820
- And in that sense,

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.550
in addition to ending the war in Vietnam,

00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:01.740
the protest movement of the 60s

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.988
really did change our consciousness.

00:48:03.988 --> 00:48:04.877
- Totally changed the country.

00:48:04.877 --> 00:48:08.260
- And it changed the
behavior of governments,

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:10.880
what they had to do to
get what they wanted.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.630
- Yeah, I mean, this is a
good time to talk about it.

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:17.170
This month, March 2002, happens
to be the 40th anniversary

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:23.000
of the public announcement
by the Kennedy administration

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.320
that they were sending US
pilots to bomb South Vietnam.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.340
That's a US bombing of South Vietnam.

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:32.970
That was the initiation
of chemical warfare

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:35.010
to destroy food crops,

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:39.400
driving huge numbers of people
into concentration camps.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.937
Nobody was there except the US

00:48:40.937 --> 00:48:42.640
and the south Vietnamese,

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.000
and that was a US war
against South Vietnam,

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.500
publicly announced, not a peep of protest.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.830
Now, the war went on for years
before protest developed,

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:54.670
but by the time it did,

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.050
not just the anti-war movement,

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.140
the civil rights movement
and other rising movements,

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.610
it changed the popular consciousness.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.440
The country just became
a lot more civilized.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.740
No American president could possibly dream

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.240
of doing that today.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.700
And the same is true in many other areas.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.785
Go back to 62, there was
no feminist movement,

00:49:13.785 --> 00:49:16.340
there was a very limited
human rights movement,

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:17.780
extremely limited,

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.520
there was no environmental movement,

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.990
meaning rights of our grandchildren,

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.510
there were no third-world
solidarity movements,

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:26.050
there was no anti-apartheid movement,

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:28.063
there was no anti-sweatshop movement,

00:49:28.063 --> 00:49:31.290
I mean, all of the things that
we kind of take for granted

00:49:31.290 --> 00:49:32.470
just weren't there.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.090
How'd they get there?

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:36.090
Was it a gift from an angel?

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:38.770
No, they got there by struggle,

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:43.520
common struggle by people
who dedicated themselves,

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:45.830
with others, 'cause you can't do it alone,

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:49.500
and made it a much more civilized country.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.435
There's a long way to go,

00:49:51.435 --> 00:49:53.535
and that's not the first time it happened,

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:55.973
and it'll continue.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.100
- I gather it's your belief
that when we focus on heroes

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.160
in the movement, that's a mistake,

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.880
'cause it's really the unsung heroes

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:10.060
the unsung seamstresses or
whatever in this movement

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.509
who actually make a difference.

00:50:11.509 --> 00:50:12.342
- They're the ones that do things.

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:14.060
I mean, take, say, the
civil rights movement.

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.560
You think of the civil rights movement,

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:18.120
the first thing you think
of is Martin Luther King.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.910
King was an important figure,

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:21.900
but he would have been
the first to tell you,

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.583
I'm sure, that he was
riding the wave of activism.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.150
The people who were doing the work,

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:30.310
who were in the lead in
the civil rights movement,

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:33.390
were young SNCC workers, freedom riders,

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:35.170
you know, people out there
in the streets every day,

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:37.880
getting beaten, sometimes killed,

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.120
working constantly.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.760
And they created the circumstances

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.610
in which Martin Luther King could come in

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:46.610
and be a leader.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:48.163
And his role was extremely important,

00:50:48.163 --> 00:50:49.840
and I'm not denigrating it,

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.120
it's very important to have done that,

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.940
but the people who were really important

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.060
are the ones whose names are forgotten,

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.670
and that's true of every movement

00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:59.803
that ever existed.

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.003
- If students were to watch this tape,

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:06.140
how would you advise them

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:09.680
to prepare for the future

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.929
if they identify with the goals

00:51:11.929 --> 00:51:14.650
that you're putting on the table?

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:19.650
- Be honest, critical, accept
elementary moral principles.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:21.270
For example, the principle

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:25.280
that if something is wrong
for others, it's wrong for us.

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.203
Things like that.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.060
Understand the importance

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.610
of the fundamental anarchist principle,

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:37.610
namely, prior illegitimacy
of power and violence,

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:40.290
unless you can justify it,

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:41.880
which is not easy.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.590
It's their burden of proof, not yours.

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:46.450
That's true whether
it's personal relations

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:51.060
between a family or whether
it's international affairs,

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.870
and beyond that, try to join with others

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:56.520
who share your interests

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:00.180
to learn more and to act responsibly

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:05.140
to improve the many very
serious problems in the world,

00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.236
which can be done.

00:52:06.236 --> 00:52:09.060
- There's an important element of courage

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:10.920
in this kind of work, is there not?

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.550
And what is involved in that courage?

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:17.440
- Oh, you know, in a country
like the United States,

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.510
the level of courage that's involved

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:21.890
is extremely low.

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:24.700
I mean, if you're a poor,
black organizer in the slums,

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:27.320
yeah, that takes courage,
because you could get killed.

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:32.320
If you're a relatively well
off, educated white person,

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.340
the level of courage is minuscule.

00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:38.530
Just see what other people face elsewhere.

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:40.910
Like I say, I just came back from Turkey.

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:43.350
I mean, the people in the southeast,

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:46.073
living a dungeon, millions of them.

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:51.540
They show real courage when
they wear Kurdish colors,

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.730
let's say, or speak openly, let's say,

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:54.760
Kurdish as a language.

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.330
They can end up in a
Turkish prison or worse,

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:58.790
and that's not fun.

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:00.550
But let's even go to Istanbul,

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:02.570
you know, sort of more Western.

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:04.780
I actually went there
for a political trial.

00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:07.140
The government was putting
on trial a publisher

00:53:07.140 --> 00:53:09.610
who had published a couple
of sentences of mine

00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:11.370
on the repression of the Kurds.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:16.370
Well, in Istanbul, the
writers, leading writers,

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:20.060
journalists, artists,
intellectuals, and others,

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:23.910
they are constantly carrying
out civil disobedience.

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:24.890
Like when I was there,

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:28.990
they purposely co-published
The Book of Banned Writings,

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:31.800
writings of people in
jail, which are banned,

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.100
co-published it, went to the prosecutor,

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:37.560
I went with them,
demanding to be prosecuted.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:38.870
That's no joke.

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:40.330
Some of them have been in jail,

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:43.690
some will go back to jail,
they face repression.

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.210
But they're not making
a big fuss about it,

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:48.940
they just do it in their normal behavior,

00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.047
not waving flags and saying,

00:53:51.047 --> 00:53:52.750
"Look how courageous I am."

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.380
That's just life.

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:55.980
That takes courage.

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.470
As compared with what they face every day,

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:03.770
what we face is so pathetically small

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:05.670
that we shouldn't even
be talking about it.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.540
Yes, unpleasant things can happen,

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:12.026
but not in comparison with
what goes on in the world.

00:54:12.026 --> 00:54:14.760
- Coming out of science,

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:18.920
and the level of complexity in that field

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.613
that you can comprehend
the field of linguistics,

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:27.250
I'm curious as to whether this accounts

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:31.790
for what I think I detect is a moderate

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:35.740
or almost conservative view, on your part,

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:40.530
of how much things can
change in the short term.

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:43.950
I don't know if that's
a fair comment on you,

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:48.320
but is that the case, that in some sense,

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.250
by seeing so much, you understand

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:55.410
that very little sometimes
can be accomplished

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.940
but that may be very important?

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.320
- Very important, and what's more,

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.790
I don't think we should
give up long term visions.

00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:05.130
So I agree with the factory
girls in Lowell in 1850.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:10.130
I think wage slavery is an attack

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:12.300
on fundamental human rights.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.920
I think those who work in
the plants should own them.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.570
I think we should struggle against

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:20.357
what was then the new spirit of the age.

00:55:20.357 --> 00:55:23.390
"Gain wealth, forgetting
everybody but yourself."

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:26.060
Yeah, that's all
degrading and destructive,

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:29.000
and in the long term,
I don't know how long,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.410
it should be dismantled.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:31.640
But the way you proceed,

00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.680
right now there are serious
problems to deal with,

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.560
like three million Americans

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.940
who don't have enough to eat,

00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:41.710
or people elsewhere in the
world who are far worse off,

00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:43.830
and who are, in fact, under our boot.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:46.130
You know, we're grinding
them into the dust.

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:49.000
Those are short term things
that can be dealt with.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.430
Now, there's nothing wrong
with making small gains.

00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:54.750
Like the gains that I
was talking about before,

00:55:54.750 --> 00:55:57.190
from the 60s til today,

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:59.563
they're extremely
important for human lives.

00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:02.720
Doesn't mean that there are not a lot

00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:05.940
of mountain peaks to climb, there are,

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.060
but you do what's within range.

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.730
Same in the sciences.

00:56:09.730 --> 00:56:11.770
You might like to solve the problems

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:15.190
of what causes human action or something,

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:16.490
but the problems you work on

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:18.100
are the ones that are right at the edge

00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:19.160
of your understanding.

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.270
Actually, there's a famous joke

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:24.130
about a drunk under a lamppost,

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.260
and somebody comes up and asks him,

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.093
he's looking at the ground,

00:56:27.093 --> 00:56:28.605
"What are you looking for?"

00:56:28.605 --> 00:56:31.890
He goes, "I'm looking for
a pencil that I dropped."

00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:33.240
They say, "Well, where did you drop it?"

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.849
He said, "Oh, I dropped
it across the street."

00:56:35.849 --> 00:56:37.047
"So, why are you looking here?"

00:56:37.047 --> 00:56:39.190
"Well, this is where the light is."

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:41.080
You know, that's the
way the sciences work.

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.920
I mean, maybe the problem
you'd like to solve

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.350
is across the street,

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:46.350
but you have to work where the light is,

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:48.300
then you try to move it a little further,

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.860
and maybe ultimately you'll
get across the street.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.650
And the same is true in human affairs.

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.002
I mean, I think the same is
true in personal relations,

00:56:56.002 --> 00:56:57.030
when you have a problem with your kids,

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:59.070
that's the way you have to deal with it.

00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:03.460
- One final question, and I understand

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:06.710
your unwillingness to focus on heroes

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:08.400
or to be made into a hero,

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:13.400
but if an activist is
watching this interview

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:17.270
what lesson might they draw from your life

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:20.320
about what they can do in their life,

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.810
with regard to the issues
that are of concern to them?

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:25.290
- Last night, for example,

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:29.750
I gave a talk in Berkeley
to a big mob of people

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:32.670
about the US and the Middle East

00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:36.680
and Israel and Palestine,
Turkey, these things.

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.760
Who is responsible for that talk?

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.330
Not me, you know, I flew in from Boston,

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:43.947
came over, and gave a talk.

00:57:43.947 --> 00:57:45.500
The people responsible for that

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.280
are the people working on it.

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:49.820
The people working day after day

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:52.160
to create the organizational structures,

00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.670
the support systems,

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:57.180
to go up and back to work with
oppressed people over there,

00:57:57.180 --> 00:58:00.920
and maybe their names
won't enter some record,

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:03.580
but they are the ones who
are leading everything.

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.430
I come in and it's a privilege for me

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:07.850
to be able to join 'em for an hour,

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:10.120
but that's easy.

00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.940
Get up and give a talk, it's no big deal.

00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:15.010
But working on it day
after day, all the time,

00:58:15.010 --> 00:58:17.200
that's hard, and that's important,

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.400
and that's what changes the world.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.450
Not somebody coming in and giving a talk.

00:58:22.550 --> 00:58:25.060
- Noam, thank you very
much for joining us today

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:26.530
for this fascinating discussion

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:30.900
of at least some aspects
of your life and your work.

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:31.733
Thank you.

00:58:31.733 --> 00:58:32.566
- Thank you.

00:58:32.566 --> 00:58:33.399
- And thank you very much

00:58:33.399 --> 00:58:35.893
for joining us for this
conversation with history.

00:58:37.155 --> 00:58:39.822
(bright music)
