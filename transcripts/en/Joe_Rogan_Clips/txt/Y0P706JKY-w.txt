Speaker 1:          00:00          Your Willow Walker says the rest of the country music is just biding rap and, and acting like they are so, well, I think it was a little bit of that, but I think at one point in time it was a little that a lot of rappers would look at guys like Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash and old school gangster country guys, outlaw country is way different from, yeah, I love outlaw country. You can't tell me Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash aren't kicking it. Like that's what the fuck is that right. But, but that's, that's not the same as you allocate and Annelie be through your songs and talking about cowboy boots and said air force ones. No, not the same. There's something about the almond brothers midnight rider and you know, whipping post that's radically different than you just sing it about your Ford and, and you know, and rafting on Saturday.

Speaker 1:          00:42          Yeah. I don't think people even understand tied to the whipping posts. You can't fake that song. Quit when they came at me about the NRA interview. Um, last year, every day I smoked a joint, woke up and laughed and listened to that record like every single day. I just wanted you guys to know. It didn't bother me any. My wife just told me to shut up talking to you all. We went shooting a lot more and we play almond brothers whipping posts every morning because I had to remind myself that this is normal, that you are being done like this publicly because you are disagreeing with the system that people have agreed to that you don't agree to and it's okay not to agree. So the Harmon brothers really got me through that segment has stopped me from punching a lot of bourgeoisie black people in the face. Well you're a proponent of your, your right to carry a gun.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Yeah. And I'm a lover of the U s nine states constitution as a whole of of, of all our rights and amendments. But in particular, you know, the first and second amendment rights matter to me as an African American, as an and as an American, first and foremost, as an African American, I've only been free 55 years. My parents were born in apartheid. And as an American, we are, we are a country that broke off from what we felt like with the tyranny of the monarchy. And we did that because farmers in guns [inaudible] wage guerrilla warfare against at that time when the largest armies and navies in the world. So I honor that by continuing to be in the spirit of those farmers, you know, in the, in the continuance of Crispus addicts, the first person who died American revolution was a black man. You know. So for me, I would dishonor those patriots who started this country at Christmas attics.

Speaker 1:          02:17          I, with dishonor. The lineage is an African American who's only 55 years in a freedom by giving government and my gun pet. That's not something I believe in. Um, government is people pro. Part of the problem with given government anything is that they're just people. They're not something special. Absolutely not flawless. Absolutely. Give People Power over you and theirs they'll, they will, I mean, this is not saying we should stockpile guns and point them at the government. Know if people have guns, it's way harder to just take over since the absolute, that shit happens all the time in other countries and it does happen. Absolutely. People get occupied and governments turn on them at government's changed the rules and put places that were democracies are no longer so absolutely that's real. And we're never far from it. Is it safe as you feel? You're never far from it.

Speaker 1:          03:02          But I think what we need more of is people like you that are, uh, that are reasonable, very educated in the matter of or articulate person who comes from a place where they don't expect that argument come from. Yeah, I understand. You know, like think about left wing people are Democratic People, progressive people. You always think, you know, you think about democratic people overwhelmingly being appreciated by the black community and you always associate them with being anti gun. Yeah. That's a common thing. So when a guy like you steps out and says, no, no, I think it's a disservice to take this right away. Absolutely. If I didn't support it and fight for it. I've been, I've been an African American 40 40,000 years now. Right. I have no democrats. Primarily my entire life. I'm from the south in particular the southeast Alabama, Georgia, Florida. I have never known a black male Democrat that was working class at, did not own a weapon.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Mm. Not that. So I'm going to follow the examples of my grandfather. I'm not going to listen to the National Party in their rhetoric about DRM in the population. I think obviously we can agree that we would all love it if we never needed guns. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Right. Of course. Who wouldn't? I'd rather not need it than be prepared though. They're not be prepared. Sure. Read right. Better to have it, not to need it to needed not to have it. And the part of the country I'm from and what you do often. Like I'm from a party country. I grew up fishing, hunting and growing food. My sister, girls who don't get to hunter's regularly now still fish, occasionally shouts out to Greg Street when our biggest t J's down there. So great fishermen. Right? But this is this normal in my part of the country as not having straws and being able to smoke in public and in places like La is it just, it's not that big of a deal.

Speaker 1:          04:43          You know, you, you, you know in my, in my mind state a household should have five guns, right? You should have a revolver, shove a semi automatic for fueling your wife carrying out, you know, in public he used to have a shotgun and just cause there's a great all around going to have, whether it's burglars are vermin, you know, you should have bolt action rifles, some course case cash got to kill your meat. You should have a semiautomatic rifle, you know, defending against here and there just to fuck off on Sundays and show your homeboys was dick bigger. But what should, what you should not do is give up your right to own with. Yeah. Or use them on people. That's the thing about using them on people is that it's so rare, but so horrific and so, so common for something that's so horrific and everybody's against it.

Speaker 1:          05:22          But I don't, I don't understand how you would ever buy taking guns. I mean, you'd have to take all the guns away to stop that from home. But how are you going to do, how are you going to do that? Criminals are going to give up of course. Huh? So there's no way the regular people should probably not do that. That's, that's where it gets squirrely. It's like, how are you going to get those guns from the criminals? You're not, you're not going to, you're not going to joke. Well we can do though. And I will say as an owner, you get lazy. Sometimes you don't train enough. We should try and more. And that doesn't mean, you know, he'll try to be the quickest draw and you practice it, you know? But what you want to do is make sure you know what you're doing with your weapon.

Speaker 1:          05:57          Make sure you know how to clean your weapon, makes you not a store you weapon. And I took my son and my nephew, yeah, shooting. I'm about to start taking my 11 year old girl Michael shooting because I want them to know what they do if they see a gun. So we've already went through, what do you do if you're somewhere and you see a gun, how do, how do you get out of that situation and get other kids out of that situation and let an adult know all that comes with it. You know? And you know, the strange thing to me is that my mother, when she was in high school, was actually taught how to shoot a rifle, right? Because the NRA, which is now vilified and hate it for four reasons, some deservedly so. So I'm not, they used to have big programs in public schools to make sure that children new firearm safety.

Speaker 1:          06:37          So my mother school and other schools benefited from that. I don't care if it was just that sheet of paper that told you gun safety before you went and arrange. That was just a piece of propaganda they did that was better for the overall public. So I tend to say as Americans, we've gotten away from stuff like trades in school. We've gotten away from different options beside funneling our kids into college debt. And we've also gotten away from basic training such as balancing a checkbook, basic home economics. So how do you make a Lasagna at home by herself and stuff like gun gun, gun shooting and archery. I think that if those things return to public school, you get a safer and more confident student body. You get a reduction on things like bullying and bullshit, and you get an increase on itself. Propel interest of children, and you start to me to grow at scholars that excel. But do you do, do you really, how was it going to stop bullying? Just by knowing that more kids know how to use guns. Guns don't stop bullying. No. Boxing class stops bullying pimps. He said that no one wants to fight. Somebody going to fight back.
