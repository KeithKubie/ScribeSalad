00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.258
As you factor more and more problems you want to look back at your work. Loot

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:08.757
for patterns. If the product of the first coefficient and the constant term is

00:00:08.757 --> 00:00:12.651
positive, then both of the factors will have to be positive or they'll both have

00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:16.632
to be negative. If the product of the first coefficient and the last coefficient

00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:20.298
is negative, then we know one of these factors must be negative. We also see

00:00:20.298 --> 00:00:25.190
this in our factored form. Both of these are positive, where as here, one of

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.563
them is negative.
