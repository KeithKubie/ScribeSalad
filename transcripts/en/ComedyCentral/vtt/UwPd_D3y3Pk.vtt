SCARY.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.964 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU BILLED ME ON YOUR WEBSITE AS
A COMEDIAN.

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:33.299 align:start position:0% line:85%

EXPECTATIONS I'M GOING TO BE

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.470 align:start position:0% line:85%
FUNNY.

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:39.806 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND I'M A POLITICIAN.

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.609 align:start position:0% line:91%
AS YOU KNOW, POLITICIANS ARE
REALLY VERY FUNNY, SO-- .

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:46.446 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU NEED NOT WORRY.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:49.248 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO
BE FUNNY FOR 17 YEARS.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.283 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:51.417 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND THAT DIDN'T WORK
OUT EITHER.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.219 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO I THINK YOU'RE FINE.

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:54.554 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT IT.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.689 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE GUY THAT IS TAKING
OVER YOUR SHOW, WHEN YOU

SADLY DEPART THE SHOW,  IS FIRST
OF ALL COMING TO EDINBURGH

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.961 align:start position:0% line:85%

&gt;&gt; Jon: THE FRIDGE FESTIVAL.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:06.165 line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND I JUST WANT EVERYBODY TO
KNOW -- THE FRIDGE FESTIVAL.

00:01:06.198 --> 00:01:07.700 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  ONE OF THE GREATEST
FESTIVALS.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:12.438 line:91%
&gt;&gt; JON GAVE A COMMITTMENT EARLY
ON BEFORE THE SHOW THAT NEXT

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.974 line:91%
YEAR HE'S COMING TO EDINBURGH
NEXT YEAR TO TAKE PART IN THE

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:16.142 align:start position:0% line:85%
FRINGE.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.277 align:start position:0% line:85%
(APPLAUSE)

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.881 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW
LIKE A POLITICIAN, I WILL MOST

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:25.718 line:85%
LIKELY NOT FULFILL THAT PROMISE.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.920 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'M NOT THAT TYPE OF
POLITICIAN. 

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.889 line:91%
I KEEP MY PROMISES, JON, SO I
WANT YOU TO MODEL YOURSELF ON

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:30.990 align:start position:0% line:85%
ME.

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:33.593 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THAT'S WHAT IS SO
INTERESTING, HERE IS WHAT I

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:34.760 align:start position:0% line:85%
FIND SO INTERESTING.

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:38.030 size:81% position:41% line:91%
SO YOU HAVE PLEDGED, AND
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:40.933 size:81% position:41% line:91%
WHY, FIRST OF ALL, THE SMP
WON 56 OUT OF 59 SEATS OF

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.668 line:85%
PARLIMENT, IT WAS UNPRECEDENTED.

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.337 align:start position:0% line:85%
SWEPT AWAY.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.340 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN AN
INQURY ON HOW COME WE DIDN'T WIN

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.475 align:start position:0% line:85%
THOSE OTHER THREE.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.777 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU THINK ARE YOU
SADDAM HUSSEIN, YOU GET 99%.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.446 size:88% position:44% line:85%
56 OUT OF 59 IS PRETTY GOOD.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.351 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS AIM
FOR MORE. 

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:02.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: SO IT IS AN AMAZING
TRIBUTE TO YOU BUT HERE IS WHERE

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:03.422 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU LINE UP.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:04.957 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS THE PROBLEM.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.228 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO YOU HAVE PLEDGED, FOR
SCOTLAND, GREATER

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:12.598 size:84% position:42% line:91%
SELF-DETERMINATION, MORE
FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE, BUT

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:16.669 size:88% position:44% line:91%
NOW AFTER THE ELECTION, THAT
HAS CRASHED HEAD ON WITH THE

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.938 size:75% position:38% line:91%
REALITY THAT WESTMINSTER
STILL CONTROLS THE PURSE

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:24.610 size:81% position:41% line:91%
STRINGS, STILL BELIEVES IN
AUSTERITY AS RECEIPTS, CAN

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:26.445 align:start position:0% line:91%
DWINDLE FOR THE GDP OF
SCOTLAND.

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:30.883 align:start position:0% line:91%
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS THIS,
FIRST MINISTER.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:34.854 size:88% position:44% line:85%
WHAT IS HAGIS, WHAT IS THAT?

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:37.190 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHY --

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:39.125 align:start position:0% line:85%
(APPLAUSE)

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:40.693 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHY WOULD ANYONE --

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:42.695 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HAGIS IS DELICIOUS.

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:45.531 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU HAVE TASTED HAGIS?

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:49.001 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THROUGH A HAZING,
YES.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:53.306 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S WONDERFUL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S SPICY, IT'S TASTY, IT'S

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.408 align:start position:0% line:91%
ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND YOU
GET VEGETARIAN HAGIS AS

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.543 align:start position:0% line:85%
WELL.

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:58.844 align:start position:0% line:91%
ANOTHER REASON TO COME TO
EDINBURGH.

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:00.913 align:start position:0% line:91%
SCOTLAND HAS SO MUCH TO
OFFER, WE'VE GOT SCOTCH

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:03.749 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHISKEY, WE'VE GOT HAGIS, WE'VE
GOT GREAT SCENERY.

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:07.420 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'VE GOT WONDERFUL CITIES,
WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT COMEDIANS

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:10.990 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF OUR OWN, BUT WE CAN ALWAYS
HAVE ANOTHER ONE IN THE

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:12.258 align:start position:0% line:85%
EDINGBURGH FRIDGE, SO--

00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:13.459 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M HAPPY TO GO
THERE.

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:14.760 line:91%
YOU KNOW, STOP PITCHING ME ON
SCOTLAND, LET ME PITCH YOU ON 

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:15.561 align:start position:0% line:85%
AMERICA.

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:16.629 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I LOVE AMERICA.

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:18.297 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE A LITTLE
BIT OF A JONES FOR GETTING

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.165 align:start position:0% line:91%
OUT OF THIS WHOLE UNITED
KINGDOM.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:22.668 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE WENT THROUGH A VERY
SIMILAR PROCESS.

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:24.370 size:84% position:42% line:85%
LET ME TALK YOU THROUGH IT.

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:25.404 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BEEN MORE
SUCCESSFUL.

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:28.808 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK WE'LL
TRY TO DO IT YOUR WAY.

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:29.976 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
THEY HATE.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.478 size:84% position:42% line:91%
THEY HATE WHEN YOU THROW
THEIR STUFF INTO THE WATER.

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:35.281 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE WE WENT
WRONG.

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:36.082 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE TRIED THAT?

00:03:36.115 --> 00:03:37.750 align:start position:0% line:85%
(APPLAUSE)

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:40.052 align:start position:0% line:85%
COME AND JOIN US.

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:40.987 align:start position:0% line:85%
COME AND JOIN US.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.789 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE CAN OFFER YOU A
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT.

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.424 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WHAT ARE THEY GIVING YOU.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:47.226 align:start position:0% line:91%
U.K., WHAT IS THE HEALTH
PLAN, WHAT ARE THEY THROWING

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.661 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU GUYS.

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:49.428 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE CUTTING OUR
BUDGET.

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:50.763 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE TAKING THINGS AWAY
FROM US.

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.665 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE THEY REALLY
CUTTING YOUR BUDGET.

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:56.035 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YOU HAVE SAID SCOTLAND
IS OKAY WITH THAT.

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:59.038 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT YOU CAN BECOME
FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT, IS

00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:00.039 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT --

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.374 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE WE CAN
BE FINANCIALLY INDEPENDENT.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.609 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I GUESS IF WE CAST OUR MINDS
BACK, ANY OF CAN REMEMBER IT

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:06.245 size:81% position:41% line:91%
WHEN AMERICA WAS TRYING TO
BECOME INDEPENDENT OF THE

00:04:06.278 --> 00:04:09.382 line:91%
U.K. THERE WAS ALL SORTS OF
SCARY STORIES OF HOW IT WOULD

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:10.383 align:start position:0% line:85%
 NEVER, EVER WORK.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:12.685 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK AMERICA'S DONE OK
ACTUALLY, ON BALANCE.

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU HAVE BECOME QUITE A
SUCCESSFUL, INDEPENDENT

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:15.921 align:start position:0% line:85%
COUNTRY.

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:19.325 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO YES, SCOTLAND COULD BE A
SUCCESSFUL, PROSPEROUS,

00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:21.394 size:88% position:44% line:85%
DYNAMIC INDEPENDENT COUNTRY.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:25.097 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I MEAN SCOTLAND IS ALMOST
INVENTED THE MODERN WORLD.

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
TELEVISIONS, TELEPHONES,
PENECILIN.

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:29.201 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: LET'S NOT GET NUTS
HERE.

00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:31.971 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ALL OF THESE THINGS WERE
INVENTED IN SCOTLAND.

00:04:32.004 --> 00:04:33.239 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO OF COURSE, WE CAN STAND ON
OUR OWN TWO FEET.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.876 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt; Jon: ANY LOOK AT WORLD
HISTORY, SCOTLAND IS USUALLY

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.678 align:start position:0% line:85%
FIRST MENTIONED.

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:40.713 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; INDEED.

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.915 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT GOES THAT, AND
THEN, YES.

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:44.650 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.952 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT IS SO-- IF YOU WERE
GOING TO MAKE UP THAT MONEY,

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:48.921 size:81% position:41% line:91%
AS AN INDEPENDENT SCOTLAND
THAT WANTS TO BE NUCLEAR

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:51.791 line:91%
FREE, SO YOU'RE GOING TO  TAKE
AWAY THE TRIDENT, THE NUCLEAR

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:55.261 align:start position:0% line:91%
SUBS, WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING
TO COME FROM?

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:57.963 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT A BRILLIANT
ECONOMY SO WE ARE AN

00:04:57.996 --> 00:05:01.200 align:start position:0% line:91%
OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRYMENT WE
HAVE RENEWABLE ENERGY.

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:02.935 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: GO BACK TO THE FIRST
ONE.

00:05:02.968 --> 00:05:04.737 line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ABOUT TO TELL ME
THAT THE OIL PRICES GOT A BIT

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.871 align:start position:0% line:85%
LOWER -- 

00:05:05.904 --> 00:05:06.939 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M TO THE ABOUT TO
TELL YOU THAT AT ALL.

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:07.907 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT WE'VE GOT  RENEWABLE
ENERGY. 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.911 align:start position:0% line:91%
WIND, WAVE, TIDAL. WE EXPORT
FOOD AND DRINK.

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:14.380 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: GO BACK TO THE OIL.

00:05:14.413 --> 00:05:16.115 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YES, I WAS MOVING AWAY
FROM THE OIL.

00:05:16.148 --> 00:05:17.083 size:78% position:39% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: BUT YOU HAVE OIL.

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:17.783 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:20.686 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: MAY WE INVADE YOU?

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:25.257 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU DON'T USUALLY ASK
PERMISSION.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.526 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: HOW MUCH CAN I SAY
THIS WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:32.131 size:81% position:41% line:91%
THE SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCE,
AND THE NATIONALISTS, NOT

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:37.269 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE UNIONISTS, HOW MUCH OIL
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:40.272 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NOT WORTH YOUR WHILE,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:05:40.305 --> 00:05:42.274 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT'S ALL WORTH OUR
WHILE.

00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:46.612 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS PROGRESS
BECAUSE PRESUMABLY ON BEHALF

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:50.182 align:start position:0% line:91%
