00:00:01.102 --> 00:00:02.648
- [Voiceover] Each
small square on the grid

00:00:02.648 --> 00:00:05.375
has an area of one square unit.

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:08.993
So, each of these small
squares is one square unit.

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:10.740
This square is one square unit,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.038
and this square is one
square unit, and so on.

00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:17.413
And now we're asked to draw a rectangle

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:20.080
with an area of 10 square units.

00:00:22.047 --> 00:00:24.240
Well, this word "area" here

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.323
is talking about how much
space our shape covers.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.123
So, our shape in this case is a rectangle,

00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:33.911
so we're being asked to draw a rectangle

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:36.244
that covers 10 square units,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.066
and we know that each of
these is one square unit,

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:45.233
so we want a rectangle that
covers 10 of the square units.

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.634
We could try just drawing a rectangle

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.543
right across this top row

00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:53.064
until we get 10 square units,

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:54.368
but the problem there is there's only

00:00:54.368 --> 00:00:57.618
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:02.174
square units going across the top.

00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:06.118
So we can't just do one
long row of 10 square units.

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:07.828
We can't do one long column either,

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:11.245
because one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:13.158
Only six square units,

00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:16.532
so we can't draw a rectangle
going down like that either

00:01:16.532 --> 00:01:19.579
because we need 10 square units.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.308
So that means we're gonna
have to break up our 10

00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:25.064
into equal groups.

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:26.976
Since it can't all fit on one row,

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:29.989
we're gonna have to break up
the unit squares into groups.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:34.072
So, we can break up a 10
into two groups of five,

00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:37.466
or five groups of two.

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:39.818
Either one of those will work.

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:40.651
So let's do that.

00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:43.848
Let's draw ourselves a rectangle,

00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:46.170
and we'll start up here.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719
Here's a rectangle.

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.969
And let's see, that's five.

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.733
And we can space and make sure

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.391
that covers the whole square unit.

00:01:57.391 --> 00:01:58.900
There we go.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.817
So here's our rectangle,

00:02:00.817 --> 00:02:03.257
and this rectangle covers

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:05.590
one, two, three, four, five,

00:02:07.157 --> 00:02:08.906
there's the first row of five.

00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:11.508
And the second row of
five has unit squares

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:14.258
six, seven, eight, nine, and ten.

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:18.059
So, here's one perfect answer,

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.664
a rectangle that has two rows

00:02:20.664 --> 00:02:22.538
of five square units,

00:02:22.538 --> 00:02:25.139
and we could've drawn this rectangle

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.889
anywhere on the grid.

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:27.722
It doesn't matter.

00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:30.104
We could've drawn it down here

00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:32.056
with two rows of five,

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:34.785
or right here with two rows of five.

00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:37.272
Any rectangle covering two rows of five

00:02:37.272 --> 00:02:39.774
has an area of 10 unit squares.

00:02:39.774 --> 00:02:43.941
Similarly, any rectangle
covering five rows of two,

00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:49.278
let's look and see if
we can try to show that.

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:50.786
Here we go.

00:02:50.786 --> 00:02:52.369
Here's a rectangle.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:55.799
And this one will cover

00:02:58.453 --> 00:03:00.811
one, two, so we have rows of two,

00:03:00.811 --> 00:03:01.826
and there's five rows.

00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:04.909
So, one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:03:06.183 --> 00:03:08.100
seven, eight, nine, 10.

00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:12.817
So again, this rectangle
covers 10 square units.

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:15.414
So any rectangle you can draw on the grid

00:03:15.414 --> 00:03:19.414
that either covers two
rows of five square units

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:23.027
or five rows of two square units

00:03:23.027 --> 00:03:27.027
is a rectangle with an
area of 10 square units.
