00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.430
So let's see if we can
classify some faults.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.910
If we have a phone and we get it wet and
we try to operate it in that state and

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.115
it heats up and finally explodes.

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:15.170
So the phone getting wet is
what kind of fault by duration?

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.859
And what kind of fault by cause?

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.190
Also, let's say that the phone was
supposed to prevent itself from

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.250
operating when wet.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.500
It has a wetness sensor, and
it's supposed to not allow itself to be

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.680
turned on, so that you can just dry
it and then operate it normally.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.360
In that case heating up

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.510
when it got wet is a result of
what kind of fault by duration?

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.350
And what kind of fault by cause?
