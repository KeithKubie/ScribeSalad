00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I now what to quiz you about dynamic programming.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Consider the following 3 x 3 world with a goal state in the corner over here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Say the value of the goal state is defined to be zero.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The cost of motion is 1.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Quickly fill in the values for all the other cells over here,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
assuming you can either move straight or diagonally.

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
In both cases the cost of motion is 1.
