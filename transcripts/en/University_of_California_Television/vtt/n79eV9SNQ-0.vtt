bipedal, naked large-brained. Lone the

master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

We shape the future from our shared

- [Kay] So I would like to start with
acknowledgments. So the work I'm going to

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.170
present is actually the work of many, many
people who are involved in sequencing

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.650
these two genomes I'm going to talk about
and helped analyzing them. I will give

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.830
some more credit during the talk. So let
me start by just introducing the samples

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.420
that were used to generate these
sequences. So, both of these samples were

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.490
found in the Denisova Cave in the Altai
Mountains in Russia. And one was actually

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.370
a small finger bone that you see here on
top, yeah. And another one was a small toe

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.860
bone that you see on the bottom. And the
reason that we are actually having two

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.450
genomes from the same place has to do with
the fact that the Denisova Cave actually

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.430
preserves the DNA in these bones
particularly well. It's one of those

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.040
exceptional place where most of the DNA
that we get out of these very old bones

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.650
really comes from the individual that died
and are not from bacterial or microbial

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.750
contamination. So what this allows us also
to do is to not just sequence these

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.080
genomes to a low coverage, meaning just a
couple of sequences from the nuclear

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.080
genome, but we can actually sequence them
many times over. And how this looks like,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.270
then, is that you have small sequences
stacking up like this that are distributed

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.590
randomly over the entire genome, and you
always have several of those for each

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:37.390
position. And so taken together, you have
34 coverage meaning on an average position

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.300
in a genome, you will have 30 different
fragments for the finger bone, and for the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.490
toe bone you have 50 fragments. So using
these genomes, then, to actually

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.850
understand how they're related, you see
that one of those two genomes that we

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.090
produced from this cave falls together
with other Neandertals that we have

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.140
sequenced before to lower coverage. And we
call this the Altai Neandertal. And the

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.970
second individual, the nuclear genome is
from a sister group of Neandertals that we

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.550
call the Denisovan because they fall
outside of the variation that we observe

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:19.540
of Neandertals. So they are more closely
related to Neandertals but they are not

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.800
looking close enough related to deserve to
be just called a Neandertal and we rather

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.720
call them Denisovan. So one of the
questions that you might ask yourself is,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.108
"Why are we actually bothering with
sequencing these genome so deeply? Why do

00:04:36.108 --> 00:04:40.888
we sequence them 30 or even 50 times
over?" And the reason for this is the fact

00:04:40.888 --> 00:04:48.315
that we are diploid organism. So we are
actually having each chromosome twice. One

00:04:48.315 --> 00:04:53.747
complete set is inherited from the mother,
and another complete set of chromosomes is

00:04:53.747 --> 00:04:58.577
inherited from the father. And so, one of
the things that you can do when you have

00:04:58.577 --> 00:05:04.730
so many fragments and so many sequences is
you can call confidently the differences

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.676
between these two copies that you have
from the mother and the father. And this

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:11.958
is really the reason why we are sequencing
it so deeply so that we can call the

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:20.139
differences between these chromosomes. And
one of the most easy analysis that you can

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.232
actually do once we have sequenced so
deeply and called these differences

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.924
between the chromosomes is to just asks
how different are they on average. So this

00:05:28.924 --> 00:05:34.617
is called heterozygosity. And you can
actually put this into perspective by also

00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:39.727
showing, as in this plot, the level of
heterozygosity, so the level of

00:05:39.727 --> 00:05:44.136
differences between the chromosomes in
modern humans, in present-day modern

00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:48.667
humans. And we have some individuals from
Africa here and some individuals from

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:53.904
outside of Africa and what you can see is
that Africans have about 1 in 1,000

00:05:53.904 --> 00:05:57.521
differences between the chromosomes that
they inherited from the mother and the

00:05:57.521 --> 00:06:04.240
father, while non-Africans have between
the 6 and 8 in 10,000. And the archaics

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.870
are much reduced compared to both of these
present-day human populations, or

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.490
present-day human regions. And they are at
a level of 2 to 3 in 10,000. And there's

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.040
even a quite significant difference
between the two archaics and that the

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.530
Denisovan is higher than the Neandertals.
So the Neandertal is further reduced. So

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.020
one can actually look into this in more
detail by looking over the chromosomes. So

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.600
just going in a small window over the
chromosomes and just counting the

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.170
differences that you observed. And we have
done this here for a French individual,

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:46.590
the Denisovan and the Altai Neandertal.
And what you can see is that the level of

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.930
heterozygosity, so the differences between
the chromosomes, varies over the genome.

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.540
But there's one thing that is very special
and that is that the Altai Neandertal has

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.200
this very long stretch, here for instance
on chromosome 21, there are other

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.790
stretches like this on the other
chromosomes, where there is hardly any

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:09.000
difference between the two parental
copies. And so now, what one can do is one

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.010
can actually take the size of these
stretches and how much of the genome is

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:18.120
actually residing in those stretches to
calculate back how closely related the

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.100
parents would have to be to generate
stretches like this. And this is an

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.770
analysis that Flora Fief [SP] in Monty
Slatkin's lab in Berkeley was carrying out

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:33.340
for the analysis of the Altai Neandertal
genome. And what she found is that there

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.180
are several different relationships
between the parents possible that would

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:44.350
actually generate exactly the patterns
that we see. And so I guess one easy way

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.850
to say this is that the parents of this
individual would have to be at least

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.070
related on the level of whole siblings to
generate these patterns. So they were

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:58.040
closely related. And then you can take a
step further and you just take your

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.330
prediction of how much you would actually
expect in terms of long stretches that are

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:07.700
looking like this, almost identical, and
you just ask if I would subtract now,

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.080
based on what I understood the family
relationship of the parents would be, if I

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.600
subtract this away, is there actually
anything left? And this is in fact the

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.380
case, so for the Altai Neandertal you
still see an excess over the stretches

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.610
that you see in the Denisovan and in
modern humans. And this actually means

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.950
that this is not just a singular event
that just once happened, that just by

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:33.500
chance the parents were closely related,
but also further back in the past there

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:40.270
were probably closely related ancestors.
So another topic that I would like to talk

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:45.620
about is Archaic Admixture. And so we
already heard about archaic admixture from

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.970
Neandertals and Denisovans into modern
humans. What I would like to talk about is

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:55.290
really archaic admixture between both
archaics. But before I get to this, I

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.280
would actually like to go a little bit
deeper into how we actually know what

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:06.710
signal we have to look for to understand
that there's really admixture. And so, as

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:12.220
a very simple way of depicting this, just
imagine that you have a certain individual

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.310
and of course, as I already explained,
every chromosome has two copies so this

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:21.800
individual has these two copies of a
certain chromosome, an arbitrary one. Of

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.020
course, you can go back to its parents and
one of those copies will come from the

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:31.870
father and the other one will come from
the mother. So I can paint them now blue

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:37.320
and red. But I can also go a step further
and actually paint them according to

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.420
whether they come from the grandparents or
from which grandparent they come. And what

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.030
you see in this picture now is that there
is actually a process called recombination

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.990
that is actually mixing up these different
chromosomes in the parents of the

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:54.280
individual. So now you have kind of these
random stretches from all the grandparents

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.470
that are painting these chromosomes. And
of course, you can take another step,

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.250
another step, another step. And so
essentially what this means is that you're

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:08.060
breaking up the ancestry...when you go
through the ancestors, you kind of jump

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.020
between different ancestries when you go
over the chromosome. So you change which

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:19.160
ancestors' genome you look at. And so when
you repeat this process for a very long

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:25.560
time and let's say you have ancestry from
one population for most of the genome, but

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.730
you have a couple of ancestors from a
different human group hiding among your

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.060
ancestors, then what's the most common
outcome will be is that you will have

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.350
these short stretches where one of the
chromosomes actually shows this ancestry

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:44.630
of this other human group while the other
chromosome is actually looking like the

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.390
chromosome of the majority of the groups,
because these stretches will be randomly

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:55.280
replaced on your two chromosomes. And now
we can actually use the Altai Neandertal

00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:01.040
and the Denisovan to find out whether
there is any Neandertal ancestry in the

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.900
Denisovan, or whether there is any
Denisovan ancestry in the Neandertal

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.140
individual that we sequenced. And so in
one direction, just showing so if

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.130
Neandertals would contribute to the
Denisovan what we would expect is that

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.700
there are some stretches where the
Denisovan looks very much like a

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.910
Neandertal but on the other chromosome, we
would expect that it actually looks like a

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:26.000
normal Denisovan. That means that the two
chromosomes are actually very different.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.080
And so the prediction that this makes is
that if you go to regions where, that's

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.870
shown here on the left-hand side, so the
X-scale is giving you how closely related

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.540
you can make any particular window that
you look through, how closely related you

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:46.000
can actually make that to the other
archaic. So when you have windows where

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.310
the Altai Neandertal is very closely
related to the Denisovan, shown here in

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.169
blue, you actually see no effect but if
you look in the same for the Denisovans

00:11:55.169 --> 00:12:00.450
when the Denisovan can be made very
closely related, or it looks actually very

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.970
closely related to the Altai Neandertal,
you see that the two chromosomes are very

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:10.110
different, and this is shown here in red
at this position. So this is a hallmarks

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:16.800
sign that there is actually among the
ancestors of the Denisovan some Neandertal

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:21.410
ancestry. The last signal I want to talk
about is actually the one of unknown

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:26.220
archaic material that we found in the
Denisovan. And so the first signal that we

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.430
saw for that is really just when you look
for divergence to Africa, so that's

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.950
nothing else than just looking for how
many differences we observe. We actually

00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:39.680
see when we take larger windows and we
just compare to an African that the

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.290
Denisovan is always a little bit more
different than the Altai Neandertal. So

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.540
these two distributions that you see here,
the one of the Denisovan in blue is

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:52.680
slightly shifted to the right. And you can
look even deeper into this by actually

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:59.690
looking at different allele frequencies
and divide up your comparison by how many

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:04.360
Africans actually carry a certain derived
variant, meaning a new variant that

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.580
occurred sometime after the split from
chimpanzee. And when all Africans are the

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.770
same, you actually see that the signal is
the strongest. So you see the most

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:21.080
differences. And in an analysis that also
Monty Slatkin's lab carried out in

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:28.600
Berkeley with Fernando Racimo, what they
did was essentially taking the signals

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.630
that I just described and they tried three
different models to actually compare how

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:40.850
this could come about. And so the first
model assumes that there was gene flow

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:46.630
from Neandertals into the common ancestor
of all modern humans. The second model is

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:51.270
assuming that all modern humans actually
gave some material to the Neandertals. And

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:58.020
so these first two models are essentially
trying to explain how you could make the

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.850
Neandertals and the modern humans more
closely related. And the last model is one

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:05.970
where you have some lineage that we
haven't observed, so we don't know what it

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:10.490
is, that contributed to the Denisovans and
that would make the Denisovan more

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:16.530
distantly related to modern humans. And so
in most...comparison model three was

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.440
actually the best explanation that we
could find for the data. And so we believe

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:25.460
that there is this super archaic admixture
of some very deeply divergent lineage into

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:30.960
the Denisovan. So, what I would like to
say in the end is...or what I would like

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.670
to show in the end is really just a
general overview of the different gene

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:39.500
flows that we have now observed. And this
picture is not quite complete yet. So what

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:49.840
you can see is that we have the ancestry,
this deeply divergent ancestor that

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.080
contributed to Denisovans. We have the
Neandertal admixture into the modern

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:59.560
humans. We have contributions from
Denisovan to modern humans. And the

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:05.200
Neandertal admixture into the Denisovans
that I just talked about. And it seems

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.130
that there is, by now, there are also
other publications that say that there are

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.700
contributions to Africans and so on and so
on. And so, I think what this all means

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.590
when you sum it up is that these different
types of admixtures are actually something

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:22.590
that is quite common. So it actually
happens quite a lot in the past and it is

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.700
something that is really a transition in
our thinking because originally, I think

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:29.900
we were all very skeptical that there was
actually any admixture between these

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:35.170
archaic groups. And with this I would like
to end and say thank you for your

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.421
attention.
