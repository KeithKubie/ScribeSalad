00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.530
They say there’s no use crying over spilled
milk but it turns out tears can have a use

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.479
after all; generating electricity.

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:14.299
Well more accurately an enzyme in tears, lysozyme,
can be used to generate a tiny amount of electricity.

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.480
Lysozyme is also found in saliva, mucus, egg
whites, and milk, so spilled milk seems to

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.560
be an untapped energy gold mine.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.800
Researchers have been studying lysozyme for
decades.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.570
Back in 1965 it was the second protein structure
and first enzyme shape that was ever mapped

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.570
out.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.280
But only recently was its electrical property
discovered when researchers placed a film

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.590
of lysozyme crystals between two plates of
glass and squeezed.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.040
Yep, that’s all it took.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.670
Electricity from a squeeze.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.270
It’s known as Piezoelectricity, and it’s
much more common than you might realize.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.210
The phenomenon was discovered in 1880 by Pierre
and Paul-Jacques Curie.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.019
Yes, as in the husband and brother-in-law
of double Nobel Prize winner Marie Curie.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.600
Apparently 90% of science back then was done
by somebody with the last name Curie.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.870
Today inkjet printers, earbud speakers, and
acoustic-electric guitars use piezoelectricity

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.500
by deforming a crystal and creating voltage.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.610
Not all crystals can generate electricity
though.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.480
Piezoelectric crystals work because their
basic repeating building block that makes

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.360
them up is asymmetrical.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.310
Normally the electrical charges of the atoms
in the building block are balanced out by

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.700
other nearby atoms, but when the crystal is
deformed, some atoms are pushed close together

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.250
while others are moved farther apart, upsetting
the balance.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.030
The net effect is a positive charge on one
side of the crystal and a negative charge

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.030
on the other.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.660
Quartz is a commonly used piezoelectric material
and according to the researchers, lysozyme

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.580
rivals it in efficiency.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.020
But unlike quartz, lysozyme is a biological
material, meaning it’s non-toxic so it can

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.760
have use for medical applications.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.250
Well, non-toxic to us, the enzyme helps break
down bacterial cell walls.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.950
So researchers imagine this protein could
be used to coat medical implants to make them

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.840
electroactive AND anti-microbial.An implant
like this could use your own heartbeat to

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.020
generate power for a pacemaker, getting rid
of the need for batteries what will eventually

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.850
run flat and need to be replaced.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.420
So the next time you’re crying over spilled
milk, maybe it’ll cheer you up to know that

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.220
one day your tears could power a medical breakthrough.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.750

people cry tears of joy, you need to get it
