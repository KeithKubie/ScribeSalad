00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Which of the following could be simplified or removed without changing the result?]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So you may already have a good intuition for these sorts of optimizations.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let me give you a chance to show that off.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So here I've written a function in JavaScript called Plato's Republic.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's a function of 2 variables: A and B.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A gets A times 1, B gets B + 0, A gets A + B,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
B gets B + 2, and then finally we return A.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There are 5 possible statements here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Which of them can be simplified or removed

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
without changing the result?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And here I really want you to mostly focus on removing,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and note that this is a little trickier than it looks.

00:00:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So give it some thought.
