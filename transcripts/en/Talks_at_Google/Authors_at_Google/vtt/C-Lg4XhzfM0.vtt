[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:09.380
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.820
So hi, everybody.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.430
And excited to be here today.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.950
We're here in Mountain View
with Michelle Gale, who's

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.740
joined us to talk about
the mindful parenting

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.160
life in a messy world, with her
latest book that just came out.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.510
So we're very excited
to have Michelle.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.270
A little bit about
Michelle before we get

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.061
started, and then she'll
be able to tell us

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:33.590
all about her messy world, and
also take questions for us.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.480
And hello out there
on the live stream.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.420
Michelle is a mindfulness
teacher and executive coach

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.900
specializing in working with
women, leaders, parents,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.230
and organizations interested
in awareness-based practices.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.530
She was previously the head
of learning and leadership

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.320
development at Twitter,
and spent her career

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.720
working in high-growth startups.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.840
Michelle serves on the board of
the holistic life foundation,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.170
and is an advisor to the Wisdom
2.0 Conference and the Mindful

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.400
Schools.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.200
She has studied
mindfulness education

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.140
with Mark Holman, Jack
Kornfield, Tara Brach,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.030
and the Search Inside
Yourself Leadership Institute.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.477
So thank you very
much, Michelle.

00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:12.560
And without further ado,
I'll hand it over to you.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.711
MICHELLE GALE: Thank you.

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:15.298
Al right.

00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:16.756
SPEAKER 1: Give it
up for Michelle.

00:01:16.756 --> 00:01:18.094
MICHELLE GALE: Woo hoo!

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:20.330
We're here.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.110
Hi, everyone.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.840
And hello to the people on
the live stream, as well.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.510
The last 24 hours of my
life have been really messy.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.300
And I'm assuming we have a
room full of parents, or mostly

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.230
parents.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.670
And so you did it.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.660
You're here.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.790
You can congratulate
me, as well.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.670
It was amazing that I got here.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.240
And it's a lot as a
parent just to kind of get

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.510
to where you need to go.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.094
So I'm giving you a deep bow
just for being in this room.

00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:52.010
And being that this,
we're going to be talking

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.990
about mindfulness,
why don't we just take

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.340
JUST a moment of pause.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.819
I love we have the
gPause sign up here.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.360
So you don't have
to change anything.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.250
You don't have to do anything,
eyes open, eyes closed.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.666
Just kind of
following your breath

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:08.889
a couple of times-- breathing
in, and breathing out,

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:15.800
and breathing in, breathing out.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.075
And one more time--

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:21.650
breathing in and breathing out.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.895
Now we're here just
a little bit more.

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:29.360
I am, too.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.040
So I hear all
great presentations

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.000
start with a story.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.090
That's what people tell me.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.930
So that's what I'm
going to start with.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.070
So this is a picture.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.190
My son Brody is the
one in the hoodie.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.780
He's 11.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.160
This picture wasn't
taken that long ago.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.970
And he had a few
friends at our house.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.220
And one of the boys,
one of the other boys,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.410
started talking about a tragedy
that happened in his family

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.950
many, many years ago.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.700
But it was a pretty
intense tragedy.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.170
And the other two boys listened
intently-- really listened.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.280
They were asking some questions.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.890
And there was a real gravitas to
what was going on in the room.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.030
And I was just in
the kitchen kind

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.720
of hanging back, just
observing and watching

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.760
and kind of taking it all in.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.490
And all at once, Brody,
my little guy, said,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.370
I know what we need to do.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.550
We need to have a
compassion circle.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.304
And so he took them, and
one of the kids said,

00:03:28.304 --> 00:03:29.720
well, I've never
done this before.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.094
Brody said, don't
worry about it.

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:33.554
I'll tell you what to do.

00:03:33.554 --> 00:03:34.790
He knows the deal.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.750
I'm feeling very proud.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.360
Now, every parent-- I'm going
to tell you these two stories

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.920
about my kids--

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.780
these are like the best ones.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.330
Just so you know, this
isn't like life every day.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.690
Let's make that clear right now.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.760
But this was a good one.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.730
So he walked them
through all sharing

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.770
about what was just said,
and sending good wishes

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.930
to this past place.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.810
And they were in the circle
for a couple of minutes,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.300
and then they went
on their evening.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.680
They unlocked hands.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.980
And they were going on a
night walk with flashlights,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.800
and off they went.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.020
But I was, of
course, as the mom,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.529
I mean I was a little teary
eyed and a little stunned.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.290
I mean, he's done things
similar to this, but not quite.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.080
You know, he knew what to do.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.950
In that moment, he'd
had the practices in him

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.020
enough through me--
and I didn't teach him

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.480
to go do compassion circles.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:39.390
He just had the sense to pause
and to stop and to check in.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.200
So one more story.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.360
This is my son Tyler.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.330
Again, not taken that long ago.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.040
And he's an athlete.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.580
He is extremely active.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.010
He has two speeds--

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.440
full speed and no speed.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.580
And he's had a lot of injuries
in his very short life.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.120
And he was subbing
in a basketball game

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.170
with a friend of his.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.730
He wasn't even supposed
to be playing in the game.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.440
He actually was
there just to watch.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.107
And they were short a player,
because it was winter break,

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:08.940
and so they asked him
to play, which he did.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.773
I wasn't even there.

00:05:09.773 --> 00:05:12.090
I had no idea he was
playing basketball.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.620
And I get a phone call that he
had gotten pushed and shoved

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.470
and fell, and his
best friend kicked

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.450
him, broke his collarbone
trying to keep the ball in.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.830
40 seconds left to the game.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.870
So he was in an
incredible amount of pain.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.820
The paramedics came and got him.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.160
We ended up in the
hospital, of course.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.870
On one side of us
in the hospital

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.140
was a meth addict
who's had an infection,

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.010
and was not very present.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.710
And on the other side was a
man who'd been brought in--

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.360
and very rare, apparently,
I found out later,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.520
in the emergency room.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.460
The trauma unit was there
trying to keep him alive,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.940
and he did not stay
alive, right next to us.

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.580
So Tyler experienced that.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.950
And we kind of
paused together when

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.549
we realized this man had passed,
and sent him good wishes,

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:03.840
and put our hands on his heart.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.470
He was in an incredible
amount of pain.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.870
Apparently the collarbone
is only second to the spine

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.400
to break.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.870
So we got home.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.570
Very difficult to get him
in the car, to get him home,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.850
to get him slowly
down on the bed.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.740
I had to help him
go to the bathroom.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.860
I mean, he couldn't do
anything for himself.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.810
And when I finally got him
settled, here's the moment.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.980
He's like, mom, I'm getting
to have the experience of what

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.280
it's like to be disabled.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.180
I said, you are.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.680
You are.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.263
And he said, and
you're getting to see

00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:43.020
what it's like to take
care of a disabled child.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.310
I said, you're right, I am.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.920
And then-- I'll try
not to get weepy.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.840
He said, you know,
I'm going to have

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.560
a lot more compassion for
disabled people moving forward.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.620
And again, you
know, I'm stunned.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.537
And I got teary eyed with him.

00:07:02.537 --> 00:07:03.870
And he said, why are you crying?

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.369
Of course.

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:06.810
He's 14.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.340
Why are you crying?

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.940
And I tried to explain to him
in the best language I could

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.220
how remarkable it was that in
the greatest pain of his life,

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.680
for sure-- he's never
been in this kind of pain.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.530
The darkest, one of the
darkest moments of his life--

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.370
he knows he's not going to
play sports for a few months--

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:33.300
that you were able to find
the learning and the beauty

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.680
in this mess that you're in.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.020
And I told him, most adults
don't get there in a lifetime,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.210
in a lifetime--

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.090
to be in that space and
to see the potential,

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:48.440
and to see the positivity.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:58.180
So I love this image,
because we learn the most,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.040
and we have the
most opportunities

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.370
to awaken and to
find our mindfulness

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.590
and to find our compassion
in the most difficult parts

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.870
of our lives--

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.575
in the cracks, in the darkness.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.550
This is where the
opportunity is.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.250
But we don't like that.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.180
When things go wrong,
we want to push it away.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.010
We want to push
away the unpleasant,

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.590
and we want to hang
on to the pleasant.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.620
And that's normal.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.170
That's what we do
as human beings.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.080
And this is where these
beautiful practices

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.059
that I guess, I'm
assuming I'm preaching

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:38.690
to the choir in this room
and on the live stream,

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:42.809
that mindfulness and
compassion is important to you.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.930
And this is what these
practices offer us,

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.160
that we can start to hold the
pleasant and the unpleasant,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.880
the dark and the light,
the beauty and the yuck

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.910
in our lives, at the same time,
and be able to see clearly.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.730
I love this quote, I think
goes so well with what I just

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.410
shared, by Rumi.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.850
"Don't turn away.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.070
Keep your gaze on
the bandaged places.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.160
That's where the
light enters you."

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.600
And that's really just what
happened to my son Tyler

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.180
and to my son Brody
during the time

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.250
that they were
sitting in darkness.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.020
And it was in this wounded
place that the light

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.450
entered both of them.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.480
And we can all have
those experiences.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.490
And we probably
all have had them.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.320
Certainly when you
ask people, what

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.211
is the greatest
learning of your life?

00:09:37.211 --> 00:09:39.210
Tell me about the time
that you learned the most

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:39.840
about yourself.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.960
Very few people will point
to something fantastic.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.850
They weren't at Disney World.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.580
They weren't out dancing.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.130
Usually it's something heavy.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.100
It's a sickness, it's an
illness, it's a death.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.410
It's one of those
things that brings us

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:58.412
to those heavier places.

00:09:58.412 --> 00:09:59.870
So I'm not trying
to be depressing.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.850
We'll lighten up a little bit.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.860
And I love this quote,
as well, by Rumi.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.710
"The cure for the
pain, is in the pain."

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.130
So we want to dive in,
we want to go deep,

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.360
we want to be willing
to go in and dive deep.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.650
In the last 24 hours,
my youngest son,

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.850
Brody, the compassion man,
had a really hard time.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.100
He has a lot of
learning differences.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.344
School is a struggle.

00:10:23.344 --> 00:10:25.010
We've changed schools
almost every year.

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.510
He's been having a
really hard time.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.650
And he had the meltdown
of meltdowns yesterday.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.880
And it took everything
in me to sit with him

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.860
and find compassion.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.140
It was really, really hard.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.840
But I knew the cure for
the pain was in the pain.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.370
And I knew my job was to sit
with him, just like I did year

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.810
after year when
he was very young.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.020
We didn't understand why, always
having a temper tantrum, always

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.726
on the floor.

00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:53.225
We didn't understand,
we didn't know

00:10:53.225 --> 00:10:55.610
at that time what was going on.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.930
And he's a wonderful kid.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:02.480
Super creative, non-linear, but
a lot of barriers to learning.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.210
And when he was younger,
that was my practice,

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.970
to sit with him as the
temper tantrum went on,

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:09.860
and to sit with him
and to let him know,

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.339
I will hold this with you.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:14.380
And that was what I tried
to offer him yesterday,

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:16.796
and that was what my husband
tried to offer him yesterday.

00:11:16.796 --> 00:11:18.000
We will hold this with you.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.070
We are willing to sit in this
pain with you, this messiness,

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.660
and hold this with you.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.780
And there's light
in here, as well,

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.100
that you can't see right now.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.600
Mindful parenting
in a messy world--

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.500
that's why I named
the book what I did.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.716
So what gets in our way?

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:37.590
What gets in our way?

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.410
This tree is on the ground.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:44.610
What we want is to be that
redwood tree standing tall.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.250
You've probably heard
that image of the redwood.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.940
The wind comes, the storm
comes, it kind of blows over,

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.350
but then it comes back up.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.147
And I like to add that--

00:11:54.147 --> 00:11:55.980
I didn't always know
this, but redwood trees

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.240
have very not deep roots,
very shallow roots.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.630
But they're connected to
community around each other.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.550
They're connected to
family around each other.

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:08.010
And I think that's a beautiful
metaphor for the parenting

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.330
journey, is that this is what
we do at home as a family,

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.180
no matter what that
family looks like.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.810
We have shallow roots that
we're all hanging on to,

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.910
sometimes for dear life.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.610
But we're all hanging on
to those roots together.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.810
And that was what we were trying
to be with my son yesterday.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.580
And this is what I think
is the big aha for me.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.230
I've been noodling on this
statement for a while,

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.090
"Everything is fine.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.530
Until it isn't.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.090
And then it is again."

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.670
And I actually wrote
a blog post about it

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.890
not too long ago when I was
traveling over the holidays.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.680
And this is what
gets in our way.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.270
Because everything is fine, and
then it isn't, and then it is.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:55.750
And we don't like
it when it's not.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.402
When it's not, we believe
something's wrong.

00:12:59.402 --> 00:13:01.110
And if we're always
believing something's

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.940
wrong when it's
not OK, then we're

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.580
never going to have those
opportunities to find

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.520
the light in the crack.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.010
We need to be OK
with our not OK-ness.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.800
Because let's face it--
how many parents in here?

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.890
Parents, raise your hands.

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.210
So pretty much everybody,
almost everyone.

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.350
Parenting is hard.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.750
It's not easy.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.330
I've been focused
on these practices

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.090
and working on myself and
doing inquiry and sitting

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:35.510
on my cushion and going
through trainings and teaching,

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.320
and I still have a hard time.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.380
Parenting is hard.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.160
It's not easy.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.990
It's not meant to be easy.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.600
And we're meant to fall,
and then get back up.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.760
So here is what happens.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.240
The movies-- we
all have this movie

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.850
in our mind of how things
are supposed to be.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.560
We've all had this
experience, right?

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.830
We're going to go someplace
special with our family,

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.480
and we've been
thinking about it,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.250
and we have it in
our mind in the movie

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.690
and what it's going to be like.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.540
And then we get
there, and nothing

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.400
goes the way we planned.

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.322
And the movie's not
matching reality.

00:14:12.322 --> 00:14:13.030
And what happens?

00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:18.100
We go downhill.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.630
We'll sabotage-- we'll
sabotage our experience.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.260
So what mindfulness
gives us, and I'm

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:30.030
sure you've had this
experience, is to see the movie.

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.330
We see the movie playing.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.940
Yesterday, all day with
my son, I saw the movie.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.750
It's not supposed
to be this hard.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.041
That's what I'm telling myself.

00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:42.030
I'm seeing the
images of him calm

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.640
and going to school
every day and not calling

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.830
and the nurse not calling me.

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:52.360
And I have this movie of what
it's supposed to be like.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.946
But I don't buy it.

00:14:54.946 --> 00:14:55.570
I don't buy it.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.740
And when we have our
mindfulness, we don't buy it.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.060
And I love the image
of mindfulness.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.890
This is something that happens,
something that we consider

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.090
is not good in some way.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.270
And then there's our reaction.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.250
And when we don't
have our mindfulness,

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.470
these two things are
right next to each other.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:18.640
There is the bad thing, and
then there's our reaction.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.510
And when we have
our mindfulness,

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.640
and we have our compassion,
this space opens up.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.210
And we've all had that
experience of, oh, this time,

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.250
there was a little bit of space.

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.740
And I was able to make
a different choice,

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.180
and make a different decision.

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.500
And in family life, we want
to be watching those movies.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.670
What is the story?

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.830
What is the story that you tell
yourself about your children?

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.650
What's the story that
you tell yourself

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.500
about your relationship
to your children?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.700
And does it match?

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.690
It's an exploration.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.430
There's no one answer.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.800
But I encourage you to journal.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.300
Journal on those stories.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.170
What are they?

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.170
What are the stories that you
hold true about your family?

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.120
I have one about my
two boys, that they're

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.540
supposed to be super close.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.400
Aren't brothers supposed
to be super close?

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.550
My husband and I had two
kids to live vicariously

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:13.280
through siblings, because
we're both only children.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.170
So we wanted to see
what it was like.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.970
That was our first mistake, that
we had this movie in our mind,

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.050
oh, we get to see siblings.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.620
Well, they couldn't be any
more opposite in the world,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:28.040
and they don't like each
other that much, is the truth.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.420
You know, they have moments.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.810
And so I've learned to just
take those moments for what they

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:37.100
are, and just keep planting
those seeds of love

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.640
and connection between
the two of them.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.650
But the movie is not working
out the way that I planned.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:49.220
And I work on being OK
with that not being OK.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:50.610
Because it's hard.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.110
It's hard.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.980
So these are all
pictures of my family,

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.874
and we're happy, and were
smiling, and we're connected.

00:17:01.874 --> 00:17:03.415
So what do you
think-- what could you

00:17:03.415 --> 00:17:06.040
imagine all of these
pictures have in common?

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.579
We're on vacation.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.780
And the other thing that all
these pictures have in common

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.720
is that there was
fighting beforehand--

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.300
not long before, just
a little while before.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.707
There was arguing
and bickering and--

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:22.990
ugh.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.079
The day from the beach
photo that you're seeing,

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.960
that full day was what I
wrote this blog post about.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.500
And things happened, like in the
morning, I woke up, and I sat,

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.020
I did my little meditation,
we were on the water.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.360
I'm like, oh, this is
such a good moment.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.320
I love this moment.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.750
And then my older son, who's
an adolescent now, woke up

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.610
and kind of came into
the room like, ugh.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.160
You know, it was kind
of a grunt happened.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.010
And I was like, mm, that's
not such a good moment.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.390
I would have preferred
that had been different.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.180
And then my son,
my two kids were

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.490
sitting on the couch
reading, not engaged,

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.930
but somewhat close
to each other,

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.138
both reading very peacefully.

00:18:00.138 --> 00:18:02.880
And I'm like, oh,
see, this is so nice.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.900
This is a nice moment.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.982
And then it was time
to leave, and there

00:18:06.982 --> 00:18:09.190
was an argument of who was
going to sit in the front,

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:11.300
and so that big
argument happened.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.550
And I didn't like that moment.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.810
I'm like, ugh, not OK.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:15.190
This is not OK.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.000
And then we're on the way there,
and '90s hip hop is playing,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.770
and we're all
singing in the car.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.070
I'm like, oh, see, we're
a nice, normal family.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:27.580
Look at us having a good
time listening to music.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.140
And then it's time
to stop somewhere

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.870
to get some food before
we go where we're going,

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.600
and no one can
agree on the food,

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.370
and everyone's got
food allergies anyway,

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.110
and my husband storms out.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.220
We're at three
cafes to get food.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.990
I'm like, it's just lunch.

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.360
Why does it have
to be this hard?

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.110
And then there we are on
the beach not long after.

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:50.560
But that's the way of it, right?

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.120
That is the way of it.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.770
That's just parenting.

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.660
That's just family life.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:01.720
And it's very easy, and I know
you have all thought, god,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.390
this is a really rough day.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.280
This is a really rough day.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.346
But if we look at the moments,
like the moment by moment

00:19:09.346 --> 00:19:10.720
by moment, it's
kind of like when

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.490
you're sitting in meditation.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.480
And sometimes it's peaceful, and
you can kind of ease into it.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.150
And then the mind goes
wild, and you're just

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.650
kind of trying to figure out
where you're going and hang on.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.690
And then you kind
of settle again.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.660
It's up and it's down, and
that's just the way of it.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.050
So those are the
pictures you didn't see.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:38.040
You didn't-- I didn't put
those pictures on Instagram

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.360
or anywhere.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:43.410
I didn't talk about
how we were arguing.

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:46.380
I might tell my friends,
but we don't see that.

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.140
We don't see that out
in social media land.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.972
We keep that to ourselves.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.770
So all of these
emotions come through.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.040
We've got the anger.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.540
Anger comes.

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:07.110
And we're not happy, like,
we're not supposed to be angry.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.270
Anger is not OK.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.907
And the fear comes, and I
don't want to be afraid.

00:20:12.907 --> 00:20:14.490
Or we don't even
realize we're afraid.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.210
We're just reacting from afraid.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.320
And then shame comes, that
mac daddy emotion that

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.510
dysregulates everything else.

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:28.890
And there's the shame that I
snapped and I raised my voice.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:33.030
And what if you knew that,
even after all these practices,

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.770
I still raise my voice.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.040
I've been trying not
to yell for 10 years.

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.860
And I do it less,
but I still do it.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.250
And then it happens, and
immediately the shame comes.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.960
But I have to know it's there.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.010
I have to be aware of the shame.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:50.800
This is the gift.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.550
There's got to be
a little space.

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:54.480
So I see the shame.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.600
And what if you
knew, what if you

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.300
knew how mean my kids
were to each other

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.490
and how angry that
made me sometimes?

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.360
And what if you knew
I was terrified.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.944
I'm terrified that my kids won't
be friends when they grow up,

00:21:08.944 --> 00:21:11.193
that they're not going to
be close, that they're going

00:21:11.193 --> 00:21:12.450
to have two separate lives.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.560
That really scares me.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.640
But what we know is that
"awareness is like the sun.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.360
When it shines on things,
they are transformed."

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.430
The wise Thich Nhat Hanh.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:30.120
And so, just even what I
did right here with you,

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.760
the uber vulnerability, standing
in front of a room of people

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.390
and sharing.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.640
All those things are true
that I shared with you.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.200
I'm not making them up.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.320
When we shine a
light on the shame

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:50.411
and the fear and the
anger, something happens.

00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:52.160
It's like when we're
sitting in meditation

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.730
and we're thinking,
thinking, thinking,

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:54.950
and then we notice the thought.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:55.450
Right?

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:56.390
That's our practice.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.910
We notice the thought,
like the bubble--

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.387
gone.

00:22:00.387 --> 00:22:01.970
We shine the light
of awareness on it.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.260
And then we feel like this.

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.440
We're like, woo hoo!

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.120
You know, I'm aware.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.440
I'm awake.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.660
And we do that moment
by moment by moment.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.240
And we do it, and we teach
our children to do it.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.140
And we don't teach them to do
it by telling them how to do it.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.540
We-- I teach my
children to do that

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.080
by saying out loud
what's going on for me.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.980
So, say I'm in the
kitchen and everybody

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:28.890
is having a hard
time, and I'm finding

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.120
myself really irritated.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.070
I might say, I'm
really irritated.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.080
Like, I'm noticing.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.220
My jaw is tight, my stomach
feels a little sick,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.480
my heart feels a little
tight, my chest area

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.350
feels a little tight.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.160
I need a break.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.220
I'm about to say something
I don't want to say.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.547
So I'm going to go away,
and I'm going to come back.

00:22:47.547 --> 00:22:49.880
I'm going to go away, I'm
going to breathe a little bit,

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.160
I'm going to get a little space,
and I'm going to come back.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.284
I don't do that every time.

00:22:53.284 --> 00:22:57.290
Sometimes I blow it, and I say
something I wish I hadn't said.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:58.890
And then I have to repair.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.250
But the repair is just as good.

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:05.330
The repair is just as good
as catching it, sharing it,

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.040
making it explicit.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.410
If we as parents are practicing
and waking up and becoming more

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.170
conscious, and we're
saying it out loud,

00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:19.700
we're giving them this
experience to voice,

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.440
then they learn how to do it.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.390
They learn.

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.910
So how, how do we
do this as parents?

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.600
And many of you may
already practice.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.850
But I have something to offer.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.290
So here we are, right?

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:36.930
This is kind of what our
lives often look like.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:39.650
We're falling
asleep at our desk.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:41.512
We're just spent.

00:23:41.512 --> 00:23:42.470
We're completely spent.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.860
We're trying to get bills paid,
we're trying to get work done,

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.150
and it's just hard.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.620
It's hard to make it all happen.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:50.640
So how do we do it?

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.796
How do we do it in
the course of a day?

00:23:54.796 --> 00:23:56.170
Because this is
how I often feel.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:57.480
I'm like, come on.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.340
Come on, inner peace.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.750
I don't have all day.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.687
But we know that's
impossible, right?

00:24:03.687 --> 00:24:05.520
Sometimes I'm like, why
couldn't I have just

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.520
been one of those people
that was born somewhere

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:11.250
and just live in a cave, and
this just would have happened?

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:14.000
That's just not-- it's not
the lives we're living, right?

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.600
We-- everyone here
in this room--

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.880
we're all working
parents, and we

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.210
have to weave in to what
we're already doing.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.430
And this is good news.

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.650
"To experience peace does not
mean that your life is always

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:27.670
blissful.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.800
It means that you are
capable of tapping

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.450
into a blissful state of
mind, amidst the normal chaos

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.040
of a hectic life."

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.010
And Jill Bolte Taylor wrote
the book "Stroke of Genius."

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:41.750
If you've never read that,
it's a wonderful book.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.760
And I love this quote.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.710
I'm like, oh, whew.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.160
You know, we just have to
be able to tap into it,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.620
and just touch, touch, touch.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.120
We can have hard days.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.080
We will have hard days.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.250
I don't think you
could be a parent

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.916
and not have a hard day, whether
you have one, or two, or three.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.550
So we can play.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.980
I love these images,
because for me they all

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.280
point to things that
I try to do in my day.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.229
I took on a practice
not long ago.

00:25:10.229 --> 00:25:12.020
How many times have we
heard our kids like,

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.070
will you play with me?

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.270
Will you play with me?

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.960
And what's often the answer?

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.480
I can't.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.770
Oh, I'm busy.

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:19.100
Or, I'm making dinner.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.290
And I was hearing that.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.840
My mindfulness practice helped
me hear, like, oh my gosh,

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.070
I say that so many times.

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.210
And so I committed to saying
yes for one week, just

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.380
to see how it would go--

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.250
every time.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.280
Now, this was not
when they were three,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.130
so that might be a
little different.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.170
So you might have to say,
like, I'll give myself

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.217
10 times or something.

00:25:40.217 --> 00:25:42.050
This happened when they
were a little older.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.010
So it wasn't happening
like 10 times a day.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.150
But I said yes.

00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:49.770
I started saying yes.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.730
And it was the best
little research study

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.950
I ever did inside of my family.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.380
We had the sweetest week.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.235
So I kept it going.

00:25:59.235 --> 00:26:00.360
And I can't always say yes.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.190
Sometimes I have to say no.

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.460
But I've learned to say
yes more than I say no.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.140
Yes, I'll jump on
the trampoline.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.240
I mean, jumping on the
trampoline's super fun.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.010
There are some really fun games
you can play on the trampoline.

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:15.690
You know, yes to the card game.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.550
Yes to the sword fight.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.660
Yes.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.050
And it might be that we're
just walking down a busy road.

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:24.520
That's a great
time to practice--

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.970
walking from here to your next
meeting, or back to your desk.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.280
What if it was just
a mindful walk.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.610
What if you were just really
paying attention to your feet

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.740
hitting the ground,
and that was it.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.860
Or just following your
breath, or just even

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.860
like feeling your
hands swing from here

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:44.690
to wherever you're going next.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.910
And when our kids are
having a hard time,

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.580
can we really just pause?

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.660
Can we just stop?

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.240
Can we listen?

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.120
And dinnertime is
such a good one.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.200
You know dinnertime-- we
don't eat dinner together

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.540
every night by any stretch
of the imagination,

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.620
although I would love to.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.350
But it feels almost
impossible at my house.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:09.090
But when we do, and we do as
often as we can, we hold hands.

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:12.030
And we do this little hand
squeeze that goes around.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.000
And it's this sweet
moment of connection.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.500
Or we can be thankful
for how the food got

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.430
to us, the farmer
that planted it,

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.556
and the person that tended
it, and the truck driver that

00:27:27.556 --> 00:27:29.680
came and picked it up and
brought it to the grocery

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.230
store, and the grocery
store person who took it out

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:35.080
of the truck, and the person
who put it so beautifully out

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.500
in the grocery store or
at the farmers market,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.320
and mom or dad who went and
got it and brought it home

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.570
and cooked it, and wow--

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.340
we can be grateful.

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.459
We have a gratitude
jar in our kitchen.

00:27:48.459 --> 00:27:49.750
It's actually a little too big.

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.610
I need to get a little
bit of a smaller one.

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.290
But it's a big
gratitude jar, and it

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:54.520
says Gratitude Jar on it.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.210
And I keep paper and
pen right next to it.

00:27:58.210 --> 00:28:02.290
And we'll just go through
practices of, every morning,

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:05.290
or at night, or if we have
friends over, just writing

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.690
a gratitude and putting it in--

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.910
that pause, just that moment.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.960
So we build it into what
we're already doing.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:16.730
We pause.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.780
Just press the pause
button throughout the day.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:24.050
And so the dedicated practice
that you're seeing more

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.890
in these images are important.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.220
And research tells us
that retreat practice

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.720
and regular
dedicated practice is

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:35.400
very supportive for our
well-being and for our brains.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.330
And, as parents we all know
that dedicated practice--

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:42.180
where we stop for 20 minutes,
30 minutes, go away for a day,

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:43.740
go away for a few days--

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.900
is not always possible.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.230
When I started practicing
about 10 years ago regularly--

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.970
I was introduced
in college when I

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.410
was having a really hard time.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.430
I went to a unity church
and sat every Sunday there.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.670
And so that was my introduction
to guided meditation.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:02.460
But I didn't start
practicing regularly

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.210
until I had a four-year-old
and a six-month-old.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.530
That was when I
entered practice.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.600
So I had to be really
creative of how I practiced.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.234
And I remember one
of my teachers--

00:29:15.234 --> 00:29:16.900
I was complaining to
one of my teachers,

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.608
I can never go to my
meditation practice,

00:29:18.608 --> 00:29:20.330
and it just never happens.

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.580
And I was all grumpy about it.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.127
And she said, well, tell me
a little bit about your day.

00:29:24.127 --> 00:29:25.460
So I'm telling her about my day.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.000
And I get to the end of the day.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.710
And I'm like, and they always
make me stay in their room

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:35.370
at night, and I have to stay
there until they fall asleep.

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.580
And then I'm too
tired to practice.

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.110
And you know what's coming next.

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.455
She's like, why don't you
just sit in their room?

00:29:41.455 --> 00:29:45.020
I was like, huh, why don't
I just sit in their room?

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.880
So I put a cushion
in their room,

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:49.460
and we made this agreement
that as they were falling

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.602
asleep at night I would stay
in their room, I would sit

00:29:52.602 --> 00:29:53.810
and I would do my meditation.

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.019
I'd cuddle with them first
and do our little rituals,

00:29:56.019 --> 00:29:56.893
and then I would sit.

00:29:56.893 --> 00:29:59.450
And I'd say, I'm not leaving
until way after you're asleep.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.250
I'm doing my practice in here.

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:05.190
And I did that for years
when they were really little.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:09.050
So what are the things that
you're already doing that you

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.930
can weave integrated practice
that we're talking about--

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:16.090
walking to the office, or
walking down the street--

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:17.780
or dedicated practice
that you can even

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.436
do in one of your kid's
rooms, if they're super young

00:30:20.436 --> 00:30:21.060
and let you in.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.104
If they're teenagers they
might not let you in.

00:30:24.104 --> 00:30:25.520
I'm no longer
allowed in at night.

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:32.910
We start where we
are-- wherever we are.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.370
Wherever we are, we can
have a moment of practice.

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:39.270
And you all saw, as soon as we
came in, we took a few breaths,

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.770
everything shifts.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.520
Everything shifts.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.640
No matter how busy we are,
or busy our mind goes,

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:49.739
just a few breaths
brings us back.

00:30:49.739 --> 00:30:51.280
So I'm just going
to run through some

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.750
of my favorite ways of
weaving it into my day,

00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:58.570
or things I like to share.

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:00.850
Mornings are so wonderful.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.650
And you don't have
to get out of bed.

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:05.110
I've done a lot of practice
with Jon Kabat-Zinn,

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.040
and he always says, lay
there, Savasana pose.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.954
Just open your eyes so
you're not too sleepy.

00:31:10.954 --> 00:31:13.120
If you can close your eyes
and not fall back asleep,

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:13.690
that's fine.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:15.190
But when you wake
up in the morning,

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:18.010
just lay there and
follow your breath.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.187
Do a body scan.

00:31:19.187 --> 00:31:20.770
You don't even have
to get out of bed.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:26.500
I will often also get up and
sit on my pillow with my husband

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.030
there, and I'll just sit and
close my eyes until someone

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:32.320
comes to bother me.

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.330
And I practice not
being annoyed that I got

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:37.470
interrupted from my meditation.

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.960
My bell didn't go off yet.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.260
I'm not done.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.670
Oh, I'm done.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:43.930
It's over.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:46.030
I'm definitely done.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.437
The shower.

00:31:48.437 --> 00:31:50.020
I've done a lot of
executive coaching.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.230
I can't tell you how many
times you've heard this--

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.200
I have the best
ideas in the shower.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.630
Why do we have the best
ideas in the shower?

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.280
We've paused.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.620
We're in sensation when
we're in the shower.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.670
The mind quiets.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.640
So what if we did
that intentionally

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.650
when we got in the
shower, and we just

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:11.550
felt the hot water on our body,
and we just allowed ourselves

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:15.275
to be there in the shower?

00:32:15.275 --> 00:32:16.150
One of my favorites--

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:18.070
I love my cup of
tea in the morning.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:20.200
I'm a big fan of Earl Gray tea.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.600
And usually it gets pushed
off, and gets pushed off.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.770
I boil the water,
and my husband's

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:24.770
like, the water's boiling again.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:26.690
I'm like, I know, but I
still haven't made my tea.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.110
I'm dying to make my tea, but
I keep getting interrupted.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.300
And then there's that moment.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.900
To me it's one of the magical
moments of my day, that I stop,

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.330
and I just put my
hands on the cup.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.730
And I smell it, and
I just give myself

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.540
30 seconds or a minute to just
enjoy the heat of the water.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.760
I love this image.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.200
When I saw this
image, I thought, wow,

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.330
what a great practice.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.710
So I tried it.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.650
And it sounds a little
hokey, but it works.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:03.080
Every time-- for one day I tried
it, and then I continued it.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.030
Every day, every time I
caught a glimpse of myself

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:07.990
in the mirror, or
in my computer,

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.170
I would say something
kind to myself.

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.320
I would send myself
some kindness.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.660
Like, depending on the
day, it might have been,

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.810
you're doing the best you can.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:19.680
I love you.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.520
Whatever it might be, I'd
send myself some kindness.

00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.814
And mindful listening.

00:33:25.814 --> 00:33:27.730
I kind of mentioned that
a little bit earlier.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.580
But if you practice
mindful listening,

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.610
it's just that
stopping and noticing

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.120
any thoughts that are in your
mind when someone's talking.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.277
Are you trying to respond, or
are you really, really gifting

00:33:39.277 --> 00:33:39.860
your presence?

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.240
And with our children,
particularly any older--

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.310
besides me, teenagers in here?

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.240
A few, a few teenagers.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.490
Mindful listening, for all
of you that are on your way

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:51.510
to teenage-hood,
it's so critical.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.060
In the car-- they
get out of school,

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.430
they get in the car,
what do most of us do,

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.638
from the time they're little?

00:33:55.638 --> 00:33:56.420
How was your day?

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.250
What happened?

00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.790
How was your test?

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.450
We start pummeling them
with all these questions,

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:02.200
and they, what?

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.270
Often, they shut down.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:05.220
Even little ones will.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.720
Sometimes the little ones still
want to tell you everything.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.560
But certainly as they
get older, that's it.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.710
So I've learned-- shh.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:17.620
I pick them up, and I
just-- shh, nothing.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.750
Just say, I'm happy to see you.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.460
I'm so happy to see you.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.460
That's it.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:27.150
And almost always the
conversation will come.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:32.750
And it's on his terms, not
my terms, and so it arises.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:33.870
The car, use the car.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:36.210
And, by the way, when
they come to be teenagers,

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:37.949
they sit in the back
with their friends.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.185
And for some reason,
you're not there,

00:34:40.185 --> 00:34:42.884
so you get all kinds
of good information

00:34:42.884 --> 00:34:44.864
that you wouldn't have gotten.

00:34:44.864 --> 00:34:47.620
Like, how do you not know
that I'm sitting right here?

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.806
Yeah.

00:34:49.806 --> 00:34:50.389
It's so great.

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:51.030
And just-- mm.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:55.360
Just shh-- don't say anything.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.840
And I love this image, too.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.089
Sitting in the car--
also drop-offs, pickups.

00:34:59.089 --> 00:35:01.130
Anybody have to drop the
kids off or pick them up

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.030
at an activity?

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.690
Anybody?

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.310
Yeah, lots of activities.

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:08.570
In the car, beautiful place
for dedicated practice.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:11.840
I'd drop my kids off to
jujitsu or baseball or wherever

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.540
they were going, and I'd
sit in the car for five, 10,

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.490
15 minutes.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.720
Or a pick up--

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.030
just sit in the car for
five, 10, 15 minutes.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.410
Use your Insight
Timer, Simple Habit.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:25.020
On Simple Habit, I did a
seven-day series for parents

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.200
for just five minutes a day.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.400
So if that's supportive--

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.775
I'm not sure if
it's free or not.

00:35:29.775 --> 00:35:32.160
But it is on Simple Habit.

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:38.060
Headspace-- just put your
ear buds in, sit in silence,

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:42.734
get a guided meditation,
just sit in the car.

00:35:42.734 --> 00:35:43.234
Oh.

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.340
And the smile, the smiles--

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.760
we can really take in
the smiles, the joy.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.030
We can bring the
joy in more fully.

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.835
So I really encourage
you all to make a list.

00:35:58.835 --> 00:36:00.520
It doesn't have to be right now.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.695
But remember to
make a list of what

00:36:02.695 --> 00:36:05.320
you do from the time you wake up
in the morning to the time you

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.130
go to bed at night.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.755
I'll do this with
parents in workshops.

00:36:07.755 --> 00:36:09.970
And I'm doing a
workshop here next week.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.680
Maybe we'll do that.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.670
Make that list,
and look and see.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:17.920
Where can you weave in
a moment of mindfulness?

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.570
I mean, be really specific--

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:24.670
wake up, walk to the bathroom,
take my shower, make my tea,

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:26.115
make lunch for my kids.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:33.580
Where can you weave in
a moment of mindfulness?

00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:35.110
Because it really is--

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.180
we've heard this phrase--

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:39.030
it's like exercise.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.320
It's like building a muscle.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.210
We have to build that
muscle, and so we

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:45.752
have to practice over
and over and over again.

00:36:45.752 --> 00:36:47.710
One of my teachers gave
me a centering practice

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:51.410
that I did 50, 60,
70, 80 times a day.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:54.190
Depending on what my day was
like, I would do it more.

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:57.280
When my kids were very young, I
couldn't get away to a retreat.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.580
In fact, I thought I was
the biggest fraud meditation

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:03.040
person, because I'd
never been on a retreat.

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:06.040
And I was bemoaning this
to one of my teachers,

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.980
and they really
stopped me in my tracks

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.490
and said, no, Michelle,
this is the gift.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.530
This is what you're
going to get to share.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:18.160
And this is what we all need
to learn as parents, that just

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.760
those moments, again
and again and again,

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.024
cultivates an awakened life.

00:37:24.024 --> 00:37:25.190
And that's what we all want.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.929
We want to live awake.

00:37:26.929 --> 00:37:27.845
We want to be mindful.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.032
We can feel the joys.

00:37:36.032 --> 00:37:37.490
It's not just about,
I like to say,

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:40.000
it's not just about the sadness,
and it's not just about, like,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.770
dealing with the
frustration and the pain

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.560
and the anxiety, which
it's so wonderful for.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.100
That's what brought
me to practice.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.620
I have a lot of natural anxiety.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.870
I have it right now, and
it's not because I'm nervous.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:51.000
I have it most of the time.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.610
My chest is tight, my
belly is a little tight.

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:57.190
I always kind of feel like I
can't breathe in all the way.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.532
I was just born that way.

00:37:58.532 --> 00:38:00.990
And that was one of the things
that brought me to practice.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:03.700
So it's wonderful
for those things.

00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:08.490
And we can experience
the joys even more.

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:12.490
We can really smell the
scent of our baby's hair

00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:15.550
when they first get out of
the bath in the morning.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.460
We can watch them
play and see them

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:23.320
learning new things as they
get older, and just be in awe.

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:26.800
We want more moments of awe,
and practice brings us to awe.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:33.520
And it brings us
to a fierce heart.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.700
And here is what I think is
one of the most magical parts

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:42.140
of practice for anyone, but
particularly for parents.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.110
Because our heart is going
to get broken over and over

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:45.920
and over again.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.710
We're going to find
our lives and our heart

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:50.270
on the floor in
a million pieces.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:52.180
And from those movies--

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.500
those movies that
weren't working out.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.940
And we're going to
pick it up, and we're

00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.380
going to put it back together.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.560
And each time we put it back
together it gets stronger.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.480
And the question we
all have for ourselves

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:09.520
is, can my heart remain
open when things are hard?

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.370
Can I have that
fierce, open heart?

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.000
And it's OK that it's cracked.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.360
And it's OK that
it's not perfect.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.250
We're not trying to
perfect ourselves.

00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:29.500
We're trying to
perfect our love.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.990
And I have a story
I'll read you.

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:32.156
I think we have enough time.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.070
I love this story.

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:40.700
The first time I heard
it was from Tara Brach.

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.080
And it is from--

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.090
it's written by Richard Selzer.

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.150
It's from "Stories for the
Heart," compiled by Alice Gray.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:49.276
And it's called "The Kiss."

00:39:49.276 --> 00:39:52.340
"I stand by the bed
where a young woman lies,

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:56.090
her face postoperative,
her mouth twisted in palsy,

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:57.770
clownish.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:00.080
A tiny twig of the
facial nerve, the one

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.200
to the muscles of her
mouth, has been severed.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.440
She will be thus from now on.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.340
Nevertheless, to remove
the tumor from her cheek,

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.660
I had to cut the little nerve.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.120
Her young husband
is in the room.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.400
He stands on the
opposite side of the bed,

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.390
and together they seem to
dwell in the evening lamplight,

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.570
isolated from me, private.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:23.410
Who are they?

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:27.760
I ask myself, he and this
wry mouth I have made,

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:33.720
who gaze at each other and
touch each other so generously.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.650
'Will my mouth always
be like this?' she asks.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:38.630
'Yes,' I say. 'It will be.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:40.820
It is because the
nerve was cut.'

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:44.960
She nods and is silent,
but the young man smiles.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.640
'I like it,' he says.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.930
'It's kind of cute.'

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.390
All at once, I know who he is.

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:54.240
I understand, and
I lower my gaze.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.620
One is not bold in an
encounter with God.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.580
Unmindful, he bends to
kiss her crooked mouth,

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.380
and I am so close I
can see how he twists

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.310
his own lips to accommodate
her, to show her

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:11.940
that their kiss still works."

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.040
So can we show
ourselves, and can we

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.710
show our children
and our families over

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:22.460
and over again, each
time we take a downturn,

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.820
can we show them that
it all still works?

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:30.110
So when the anger appears,
can we do that U-turn?

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.320
Can we notice the
anger, have that pause?

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.990
Can we do the U-turn,
and come in and explore?

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.130
Can we get curious?

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.020
What is this anger?

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.020
Where is it coming from?

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.100
What's it about?

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.140
As soon-- you know curiosity
kills anger in a second.

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:48.657
The second we get curious
about it, there's some space.

00:41:48.657 --> 00:41:50.240
And then we have the
opportunity to do

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.906
something a little
more creative than we

00:41:51.906 --> 00:41:55.660
might have done otherwise.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:58.290
And when the fear
comes, we notice it,

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:01.970
it arises, can we
stop, do the U-turn,

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:06.130
and come in and
notice, ah, this fear.

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:09.630
John Kabat-Zinn often
says, and this, too.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.260
And this, too.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.030
I can include all of this.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.640
And we get curious.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.810
And then the shame--

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:25.000
can we do the U-turn and see
what is this about, this shame?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.860
Can I explore it?

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.237
Can I understand it better?

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.210
And then we give ourselves
some self-compassion.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:35.080
I'm a student of
Kristin Neff's work,

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.890
if you haven't studied her.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:40.360
She was one of the original,
really the original researcher

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.640
on self-compassion.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.690
And she shares that
what we need to do,

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:50.440
when we're in these states of
really being hard on ourselves,

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:55.000
is to be mindful, to bring up
our mindfulness, to realize

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.822
that common humanity.

00:42:57.822 --> 00:42:58.780
We all go through this.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.530
Everyone in this room,
if you look around,

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:04.550
we're all going through this
together, that it can be hard,

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:06.850
and it can be beautiful,
and it can be miserable,

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:09.930
and it can be fun.

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:13.230
Common humanity-- this is
your tribe in this room.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:16.890
We're all connected
by being parents.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.360
And then being
kind to ourselves.

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:20.250
And from the research
she says, always

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.570
put your hand on your heart.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:23.700
So when I was doing that
little mirror exercise

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.830
I tried, if I wasn't in
too strange of a place,

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.710
to say something nice to
myself, put it on my heart,

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:31.920
or just anywhere on my
body, just to touch myself.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.430
Let myself know, hm, a
little bit of kindness.

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:42.090
This is reality for most
people in this room,

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:44.960
for most people who are
listening on the live stream.

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.580
This is the reality.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.925
This is how it's going to be.

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.550
It's going to be up,
down, everything's

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:52.370
fine, until it isn't,
then it is again.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:54.260
Mindful parenting
in a messy world--

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.060
that's what we're living.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:01.820
And we can respond
more skillfully.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.800
That's what you hear
over and over again when

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.180
you learn about mindfulness.

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.100
It's all in the choice--

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.840
moving from that, we
live this autopilot life,

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.490
to get to choose, what
is my response going

00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:14.540
to be in this moment?

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:21.840
So we can choose to go
down those dark places.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.880
And sometimes we are going
down the dark places.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.980
Last night, I was
kind of pooped.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:29.290
I'd been with my son for hours.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.320
And the compassion
just wasn't coming.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.680
And my husband brought the
light for a little while.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.590
I didn't have any
more light to give.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.270
And that's OK.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:40.500
That's OK.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.390
And we're blessed
if we have a partner

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:44.880
that we can share that with--

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:46.840
not everyone does.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.850
But we can go to
that side, or we

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:53.910
can shine the light of awareness
on the fear, on the shame,

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.850
on whatever is going on for us.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:59.290
And I don't always get it right.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:02.910
But these guys and these
faces keep me very motivated.

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:05.040
And I'm sure you have your
own faces in your phone.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.840
I wish I could see all of them.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.810
But this is why we practice.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.606
We practice for ourselves,
we practice for the world,

00:45:12.606 --> 00:45:13.980
and we practice
for our families.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:18.600
And they are-- they will
bring us to our knees

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.790
in spiritual practice--
our children.

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:26.170
They will trigger every
undealt-with issue

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:28.500
from childhood we have.

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.140
And that's also
their gift to us,

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.790
because they point
us to our freedom.

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.820
They point us to where
the work needs to happen.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:38.730
And I am very grateful to be
on this path with all of you

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.270
in this room and
everyone listening.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.770
Thank you.

00:45:44.303 --> 00:45:45.594
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Michelle.

00:45:45.594 --> 00:45:47.810
So we'll take questions.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.550
Anyone have a
question in the room?

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.820
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
[INAUDIBLE] from Brazil.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:46:00.710
I'm very glad that I'm here,
just to get your talk here--

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:01.830
MICHELLE GALE: Thank you.

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.550
AUDIENCE: --at the same moment.

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.580
So my point is about emotions.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:10.500
How you call or you teach
somehow about emotions

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:11.650
for your children?

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:13.230
MICHELLE GALE: How do you
teach them about emotions?

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
emotional intelligence.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.381
But not this kind of approach--
a more natural approach

00:46:18.381 --> 00:46:18.880
for this.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.713
MICHELLE GALE: Yeah.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.340
Well, one idea that I share with
my kids is naming the emotion.

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:28.350
And there's some wonderful
research on this.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.790
Matthew Lieberman, I think, in
2014 talked about just naming

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.730
the emotion, how that clears
the prefrontal cortex,

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:37.240
calms the amygdala.

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.380
So you teach them
just to name it.

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:42.360
And I think that's in a lot of
the parenting literature now.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.740
Oh, you're angry.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.030
Oh, you feel sad.

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:47.880
And it might seem a
little hokey to do that.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.310
We do it more often
when they're young.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.280
But we can also inquire with
them when they're older,

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.940
like, what is the emotion?

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.030
And if you can,
depending on your child--

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:59.310
my kids are kind
of used to it now.

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:00.890
Where is it in your body?

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:01.860
Locate it.

00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.540
Is there a color?

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.890
What does it feel like?

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.670
So what we want is for them
to get to know their emotions,

00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:10.800
and the body is where they live.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.740
We experience them in
the body long before they

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.750
come into cognition.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.120
And another little trick
with emotions that I also

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.960
like to share is time them.

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.705
So when they were really little
and they'd say, I'm so angry,

00:47:24.705 --> 00:47:27.870
I'm like, wow,
you're really angry.

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:29.460
Let's see how long it lasts.

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:31.840
How long can you be angry?

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.330
And put on the timer.

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:34.830
Let's see how long
you can be angry.

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:35.954
And now it's a game, right?

00:47:35.954 --> 00:47:38.097
So now it'll pass quickly.

00:47:38.097 --> 00:47:40.180
Because now they want to
see how long it can pass.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:44.430
But within 60 seconds
or a minute, it's gone.

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.990
And so they see, oh.

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:50.140
So what we're teaching them
is, it comes, and it goes.

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:51.570
It begins, and it ends.

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:53.673
Have you ever been
angry all day?

00:47:53.673 --> 00:47:54.540
I'll ask them.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.130
Well, no, not really.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:57.840
It's usually not that way.

00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.075
It's usually not that way.

00:47:59.075 --> 00:48:01.086
Is that helpful?

00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:02.260
Anybody else?

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:03.510
SPEAKER 1: Hold on one second.

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:04.442
Let me get the mic.

00:48:07.697 --> 00:48:08.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.140
Thank you for being here
and sharing your stories.

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.160
So quick question--
like you mentioned,

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.657
there is this
structured practice

00:48:14.657 --> 00:48:16.240
that you sit and
meditate, and there's

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.909
being mindful during
the day, and then

00:48:17.909 --> 00:48:19.450
you mentioned a lot
of different ways

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:21.400
how to teach the latter one.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.480
Have you tried to do like a
structured practice, meaning,

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.070
let's sit down together
and have a meditation

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.150
session with your kids?

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.750
MICHELLE GALE: With my kids.

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:29.333
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:29.333 --> 00:48:32.260
MICHELLE GALE: Well, the way
I came to teaching meditation

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.350
was actually, I went through
the Mindful Schools program,

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.780
because I wanted to teach
it to my kids at home.

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.452
And I ended up teaching
in their school.

00:48:40.452 --> 00:48:42.910
So I taught in their school as
a volunteer for three years.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.040
So they got it from me there.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.010
And I found, at least
for me, anyway, at home,

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:53.650
to actually try to explicitly
teach it, most kids won't.

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:54.640
Most kids won't.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.290
But I let them see me.

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:58.720
So if they come in my
room and I'm sitting--

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.850
I love, Jon Kabat-Zinn
tells this story

00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:03.960
of his son Will Kabat-Zinn
is a mindfulness teacher

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:06.860
in his own right at Spirit
Rock and all around.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.550
And he would say
he'd be sitting--

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.620
Jon got up very early to
sit, 4:00 in the morning

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:12.280
all the time.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.680
You know, did his whole
yoga and meditation

00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.182
and he says he never ever asked
his kids to sit in meditation.

00:49:18.182 --> 00:49:20.140
But they'd come in, and
they'd see him sitting.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:21.723
And he'd have a
blanket around, and he

00:49:21.723 --> 00:49:24.696
said he'd open the blanket,
and they'd come in,

00:49:24.696 --> 00:49:25.820
and he'd close the blanket.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.480
And that image to
me is so beautiful.

00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:31.480
And then they'd just sit
there with him in meditation.

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.900
So depending on your child,
some kids will eat it up.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.634
Books are a really great way.

00:49:36.634 --> 00:49:37.300
There's so many.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.340
"Moody Cow Meditates"
I think it's called.

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:41.830
And I mean, there's
a whole bunch

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.470
of beautiful children's books.

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.990
And so reading-- we
did a lot of reading.

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.900
But explicit teaching, I
think it's the weaving in.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.100
I think it's in the pausing.

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.935
Before my kids used to go to
school when they were younger,

00:49:53.935 --> 00:49:55.060
they started walking alone.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.143
And I was all freaked out.

00:49:56.143 --> 00:49:58.990
I'm like, it's so weird,
they're leaving without me

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:01.460
and I don't like it.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.460
And so for me, this was
a me-practice, I'm like,

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.490
would you guys be willing
to just hold hands?

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:07.150
You know, do our little
circle like we do at dinner,

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:09.400
and do a little hand
squeeze and take one breath?

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.210
Like, OK.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.100
You know, they were
willing to do it.

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:14.380
And then, if I forgot,
they would ask for it.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:16.480
So that probably went on
for three or four months.

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.090
Every morning before they
left for school, one breath.

00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:21.280
So my encouragement
is to weave it in.

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.100
And if you have a child that
is really excited to learn,

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.540
then go for it.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.314
Yeah.

00:50:26.314 --> 00:50:27.480
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.313
MICHELLE GALE: Yeah.

00:50:28.313 --> 00:50:31.267
AUDIENCE: So tantrums--
what's the mindful response?

00:50:31.267 --> 00:50:33.100
What would be a best
practice if you've just

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.737
got someone who's tantruming
a lot, or big time?

00:50:36.737 --> 00:50:37.570
MICHELLE GALE: Yeah.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:39.550
Well, I think there's
a few layers to that.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:41.466
There's always like,
what's under the tantrum?

00:50:41.466 --> 00:50:43.960
So that's always where, from
a mindfulness perspective,

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.620
where--

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.450
it's never the behavior.

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:48.796
It's always there's
some emotional reaction.

00:50:48.796 --> 00:50:50.170
And what is the
emotion, and what

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:53.350
is-- nonviolent communication,
very nonviolent communication.

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.360
What's the need
that's not being met?

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.820
And I love-- I think
Dan Segal does HALT--

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:03.510
hungry, HALT angry,
lonely, tired.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:07.020
You know, you can ask yourself--
hungry, angry, lonely, tired?

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.180
So to know what's under
it, what's causing it.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:11.120
And if you can get them
to share, wonderful.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.119
Sometimes in the middle
of a tantrum not always.

00:51:13.119 --> 00:51:15.870
But then it's being able, like I
was saying earlier, to hold it,

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.710
so they know I can
hold this with you.

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:20.310
You're not alone in this.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:21.900
We can be in this together.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:23.610
And just that alone--

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:26.567
trying to stop it is,
unless, you know, sometimes

00:51:26.567 --> 00:51:27.900
you're in the middle of a store.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:30.500
And you're like, how
about a Twizzler?

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.125
And that works.

00:51:31.125 --> 00:51:33.480
And that's just-- sometimes
it's just survival.

00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:36.794
But if you've got space
and time, hold it.

00:51:36.794 --> 00:51:37.460
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:38.544
Well, thank you so much.

00:51:38.544 --> 00:51:39.460
I think we're at time.

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.730
Thank you so much, Michelle.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.580
MICHELLE GALE: Thank you.
