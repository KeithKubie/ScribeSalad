00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.570
&gt;&gt; Okay, Michael. So you think you know everything, so here's a

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.970
quiz. So, here are two matrices, matrix prisoner's dilemma and matrix bunch of

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.290
numbers that look vaguely symmetric but

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.080
aren't quite. So here's what I'm going to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.770
ask you do do. In each of these cases find the Nash equilibrium.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.580
&gt;&gt; Rut-roh. So do, you told me what it was but you

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.780
didn't tell me how to find them so that seems kind of rude.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.250
&gt;&gt; It was implicit. It's intuitively

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.240
obvious even to the most casual observer.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.010
&gt;&gt; Oh, well then, okay. So, and just to remind me now, each row

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.250
and column is a choice for one of the players or the other player.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.708
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:41.050
&gt;&gt; And the first number in the pair is the row player,

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.820
or A's pay off and the second number is B's pay off.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.510
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.450
&gt;&gt; And we might need probability distributions, or we

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.261
might not, depending on what it takes to be a

00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:51.408
Nash equilibrium.

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:52.230
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.790
&gt;&gt; okay, I don't [LAUGH] I'm not, it's not like I see the answer yet but it,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.820
but I either will be able to find it,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.370
or I won't. At least I understand the question.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.940
&gt;&gt; Okay. And by the way, just to make it

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.319
easier for you there are pure Nash equilibria here, okay?

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.820
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.240
&gt;&gt; Alright, so you ready?

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.730
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.800
&gt;&gt; Just circle the one or underline it or whatever it is Pushcar

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.858
does to make it so that you can answer this quiz. You ready?

00:01:15.858 --> 00:01:16.998
&gt;&gt; Totally.

00:01:16.998 --> 00:01:17.328
&gt;&gt; Go.
