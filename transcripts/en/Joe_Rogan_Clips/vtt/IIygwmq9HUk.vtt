WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.510
I guess we just found that patently ridiculous.
Well,
we use,

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580
we like,
um,
you know,
we,

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.220
we grew up,
I grew up hearing the word a lot from my,
my dad.

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.980
What does your dad like?
He's not like much anymore.

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.780
He's dead.
Thanks.
[inaudible] he died in [inaudible] 79,
sorry.
1979.

6
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.650
Okay.
Um,
but,
uh,
no,
as I always say,
he was mad.

7
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:32.070
There are no better parents than dead.
Parents know they can fuck you up.

8
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.130
What's right.
But my dad was a real,

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.930
really fond of that word and the English full Canadian,

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.530
you full Canadian.
But being Canadian is kind of like being English,

11
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.960
a little bit of English people in your money's still.
Yes.

12
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.100
And we get all the English movies on English,
TV show.
We,
we,
we,
uh,

13
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.380
pledge allegiance to the Queen in school.
You know,

14
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.980
still it's still going on possibly.
Yeah.
And in our sleep,

15
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.790
so many good things about Canada,
yet so many preposterous things.
True.

16
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:03.360
It's the fact,
well,
the fact that a monarchy still exists at all is preposterous.

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.840
Is Great on paper.
Yeah.
Well,

18
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.580
the monarchy even itself has become Kardashian.
Refied well,
yeah.

19
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
Right.
But didn't they,
weren't they always,

20
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.440
I guess they were prince died days and,
yeah.

21
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.180
Or even just back to Henry the eighth I'm sure.
What,
what maintained the,

22
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.110
the monarchy other than the fact that people wanted celebrities and that was the

23
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:29.550
only celebrities they had.
Right.

24
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.950
And the priests and I think Henry the eighth also had asked implants if I'm,

25
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.330
he did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
Good for him.
Progressive.
Yep.

26
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.540
So ahead of his time.
Yeah.
That is an interesting thing.

27
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.670
It's like the Prince Charles Lady,

28
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:49.671
Di's saga was essentially one of our first reality things to enjoy.

29
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.840
Yeah.
Yes.
That was madness when it happened.
It was so huge.
And then someone said,

30
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:59.841
well what if we just make housewives in orange county royalty and a,

31
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.230
and you don't have to pay them as much as the king and Queen and you can cancel

32
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:07.340
them.
Yeah.
Those shows are wonderful through,

33
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.430
I've never seen an episode of any of their fascinating,
the Beverly Hills one is,

34
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.120
there was,
well there's different versions of them,
right?
In different versions.

35
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:19.110
You get to see the geographical creepiness of like Atlanta does its own thing.

36
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.750
Yeah.
Atlanta's not a bad one.
The worst one was Jersey there.

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.820
They're fucking savage people.
Yeah.
That's my ancestors.

38
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.420
Those fucking savage monkey folk that live in the worst.

39
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:34.290
Anything Jersey version,
the worst of anything.
The worst.

40
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:36.860
The worst penicillin is the Jersey penicillin.
You know,

41
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.560
CSI Jersey was terrible by the way.
Now that doesn't exist.

42
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.400
Yeah.
Um,
the Beverly Hills,
one of the,
all of them were fascinating.
You'll take,

43
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:48.240
take people,

44
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:51.300
forced them in these situations where they're going to have his artificial

45
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:52.021
disputes.
Well,

46
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:57.021
it was crazy to me is watching people succumb to the pressure of all of that

47
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:57.751
attention.

48
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:01.480
Would it leave never experienced before and then you're gonna just thrust them

49
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:06.010
into this massively popular,
you know,
for lack of a better word,

50
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.590
confessed.
Yeah.
Right.
Well,

51
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:13.350
if you take your tests yet,
I need divorce it up.

52
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.340
Any supporting,
sort of supporting under,
you know,
solid structure.
Yeah.

53
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:22.600
Island or that support [inaudible] offer.
Yeah.
Nothing to offer.
No offering.

54
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.340
There's no painting,
no sculptor.
He's still singing.
They only take,
yes.

55
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.290
Give cause fame will destroy if you're a brilliant artists,

56
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.000
fame will destroy you.
Yes,
yes,
yes.
Fifth.
There's nothing underneath the fame.

57
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.220
It's just there's nothing to hold it up.

58
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.420
While I remember watching Kelsey Grammer's wife,
I had met her before,

59
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.230
she seemed like a very nice lady,
Camille,
Camille.
And then she,
uh,

60
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.290
I forgot her name.
Thank you.
With that,

61
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.510
I didn't want to just say I want to contact owner.
He is a huge Camille thing.

62
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.200
Giant.
I,
I have a tattoo.
I was gonna say,
do you have a tattoo?

63
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.200
But she decided to play the heel and a,
the,

64
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.770
it was so obvious at the pressure was just overwhelming.

65
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.020
The hatred that was coming her way.

66
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.890
She had decided she was going to be the boss bitch on the show and just let

67
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:11.260
everybody know,
you know,
this is how it is and I'm,

68
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:16.090
I'm here to run things and just swamp of evil.

69
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.870
That came her way and then she's like,
God,
quit done.
Fuck this show.

70
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.060
She bailed out of it.
Good for her.
Yeah.
Well,

71
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.830
it's even caused that role or double or was it like a producer and said,

72
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.600
here's your,
well according to Kelsey he told her like,
Hey,
okay,

73
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:33.250
this is what you've always wanted here.

74
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.210
Like cause that's like what led to their divorce or what was happening during

75
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.990
them getting divorced.
You know,
he essentially said,
you know,

76
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:45.010
this is what you've always wanted.
Like I don't think you understand this.

77
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.980
So good luck.
Good luck with it.
And then you know,
she,

78
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.580
she just kind of vanished afterwards.
Like fuck all this.

79
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.870
Which is why it's on her part.
She,
she,
she recognized what it is.

80
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.300
But they're like those,
those people that are on it.

81
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.550
Like I know some people who know some folks that are on that show and it's,

82
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.830
they just go crazy.
They started popping pills and losing their mind.

83
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.100
They're in therapy every day and it's just madness.
Yeah.

84
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.220
That desire for fame with nothing more to it than other than a desire to be

85
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:18.370
famous can only drive you insane.
Yeah.
Cause I think fame,
fame as a,

86
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:22.510
as an emergent property of doing something right is bearable.
True.

87
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.490
But it's fine products,
but so strange and so difficult to truly manage.

88
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.790
But you can at least say,
I don't define myself by the fame.

89
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:34.330
I defined myself by the work that created the thing.
Yes,
yes.

90
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.240
Whereas if there's no work underneath it,
it's you know,

91
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.080
you only exist in so much as people are aware of you.

92
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.130
You exist in those moments when you walk into a room and everyone's staring at

93
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:47.440
you.
That's what you look for.
And that's that.

94
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.740
I have that anyway because of my body.

95
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.680
So I guess I know real famous.
Yeah.

96
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.310
And your and the horrible allergy have to pay.
That's true.

97
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.660
I can't wear pants and yeah,
every time I walk into a room,
why I say like that,

98
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.190
that uh,
that fame is a property of the beholder,
not the beheld.

99
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.330
And that that fame only exists so long as somebody in the room knows who you
are.

100
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.780
And the minute you're in a room where no one knows you,
your fame evaporates.

101
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.200
That is one of the weirdest interrogations I've ever gotten is when people go,

102
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.680
Woo,
why did these people know you?
What do you do?
Who are you?

103
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.090
Who are you should I know I take a photo with you,
the where somebody,

104
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:27.410
but I don't know who the weird thing is,

105
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:31.290
they're almost defended that other people know you and they dumped.
Yeah.

106
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.500
Like why you're playing a game with me.
Why?
Why don't I know you?

107
00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.200
They get angry.
Yeah.
Well that also,

108
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:41.570
there's the other thing about famous that people feel like they could just start

109
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:46.490
talking to you.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
They can sit next to you.
I know that.

110
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.060
Oh yeah.
You could be in the middle of an intense conversation with the,

111
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.610
your favorite person on the planet.
They don't give a fuck now.

112
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.040
Why hadn't I didn't know you that you've been in their house.

113
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.280
I had a living room.
I had a guy come to me in the street and just go,
Hey Dave,

114
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.950
how you doing?
And I thought,
oh,
I must know him.
So I said,
oh,
I'm good.

115
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:05.450
How are you doing man?
And his next line was a,
you don't even know me.

116
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:09.500
A fucking phony,
David.
That was me.
That was you.

117
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.990
I wish I was better at faces.
Was this in Canada?
This was in downtown La real.

118
00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:16.910
It's amazing.
I don't even know me.
You fucking funny.
I'm just trying to be nice,

119
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:21.430
sir.
Yes.
Was he a drunk?
No,
it was just a,
he was the guy who just,
uh,
okay.

120
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.570
I'm going to go pretend I know them.
Just watch this.
Wow.

121
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.330
Was that the end of the conversation?
That was basically it.
Wow.

122
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.321
What a rude person.

123
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:32.321
That's terrible conversation guy who auditioned for news radio in 96 I've just

124
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:36.920
never gotten over it.
Yeah.
That fucking cunt.
Fuck.
Yeah,
that one.

125
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.560
I was on my way to start him.
Yeah,
and to be fair,
it was me.

126
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.450
Tripped him up.
