00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.840
luckily I grew up in a very educated community. You know,

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.540
30 minutes away from MIT, Harvard, you know, all of the Ivy Leagues in Boston.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.880
and I think that's, that speaks a lot to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.420
kids and their value, have value system, but their manners and so forth.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.580
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.860
&gt;&gt; So, I don't remember

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.740
getting teased too much. I'm sure I did, and how

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.439
much of that I have sort of put under the surface.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:32.530
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:38.090
&gt;&gt; And forgotten about but I, I don't, I have a tougher time even

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.450
today when I'm in an inner city environment where my the people surrounding

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.660
me don't have the same etiquette, and don't have the same education, the same

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.650
exposure. And that's really where I struggle more than where I grew up in

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.520
a suburb of Boston.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.060
&gt;&gt; well, to get a bit more of that, sort of, educated thought and

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.510
idea I want you to tell us you know, as a medical condition of,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.510
of dwarfism, what is, what do you know is the cause of shorter

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.320
stature and, in particular, in your case what is the what is the cause of this.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.810
&gt;&gt; Well remember there are over 200 different types of dwarfism.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.410
Achondroplasia being the most common. So if you were to

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.820
meet another little person in your life, most likely they'll have

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.500
a Achondroplasia, so I can only really speak to Achondroplasia.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.650
it is a dominant gene. It is also a mutation. So

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.250
what that means is an individual can have achondroplasia for

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.160
two reasons. One, would be their parents have it and it's

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.550
been inherited, as it was with my children. The other would

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.610
be it's a genetic mutation which is a complete unexplained event.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.060
Which is what it was for me.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.740
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.860
&gt;&gt; Are you familiar with the gene that

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.340
is actually mutated in most cases of Achondroplasia?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.300
&gt;&gt; The FR?

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.970
&gt;&gt; The FGFR3 Gene.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.900
&gt;&gt; That's it. That's what I am.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.960
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.120
&gt;&gt; There's a reason I don't teach science.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.870
I'm an English and drama teacher and Spanish teacher.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.135
&gt;&gt; LAUGH.

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:04.470
&gt;&gt; Not a science teacher. So yes very familiar I,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.500
I don't spend a whole lot of time conversing about it.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.590
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.639
&gt;&gt; what is really,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:16.566
really cool is that when the gene was discovered in 1994.

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.150
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.830
&gt;&gt; In 1992, the National Convention was in San Francisco, I

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.850
was eight months pregnant. We had both my in laws there

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.770
as well as my parents. And when we have a national

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.090
convention that Little People of America puts on, a gaggle of healthcare

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.740
providers fly in that have specialized or have an interest in dwarfism. And so,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.910
there'll be no less than 15 or 20 geneticists from around the country, sometimes

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.000
we even have international geneticists. And we

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.500
all volunteered ourselves for blood draw, when

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.850
I was eight months pregnant. And they sent me home with a vile for umbilical

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.110
blood, that I was, when I was going to give birth

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.140
a month later. So that they could get umbi, umbilical cord blood.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.970
So I like to say we had a little bit of something

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.262
that led to what the discovery of the gene two years later.

00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:20.010
&gt;&gt; Are there any advantages to having a slightly shorter structure in general.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.910
&gt;&gt; this is a very common question, and I always say to

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.885
myself I've got to write it down, because I never, you know

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:31.900
am fully prepared but, in this instance I, I did think about it some. let's

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.850
start with the disadvantages because it, that's a shorter list. The

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.920
grocery store is horrible. And I haven't quite figured out the best time to

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.920
go. If I were not little, the best time to

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.210
go clearly would be 6:30 or 7 in the morning

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.180
when I'm awake because it's not crowded. But it's a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.910
very bad time for me to go when it's not

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.670
crowded, because there aren't people in the aisles to turn to

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.520
and say can you hand me that jar up there. So

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.420
I think the compromise is more like 10 AM, you know

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.940
which fortunately because I don't work full time I can do

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.790
that and I can always pretty much count on waiting no

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.180
more than two or three minutes for somebody to show up

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.750
in the aisle. I'm not going to go to customer service every

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.410
time I need help. You get very savvy at flirting with people

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.410
&gt;&gt;

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.903
[LAUGH]

00:04:16.903 --> 00:04:22.330
&gt;&gt; to get what you need. So I will strike up a conversation instantly with the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.290
main motivation being that I need that can

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.580
of tomatoes at the top of the counter.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.610
other disadvantages it, it really depends. it's

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.190
hard to go into communities that are less

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.040
educated and less mannered because we are

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.030
so comfortable in, in our community which, granted,

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.290
has gotten to know us on so many different levels over the last 20 years. My

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.250
husband and I both are, both our careers, myself as a substitute teacher and he

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:01.480
as a an IT guy for small businesses in our immediate area, we're very well

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.320
known. only because people don't forget us. You

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.180
know, it's not a comment on our personality,

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.040
however, I've been told that we kind of

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.660
have magnanimous personalities as well. so we get

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.560
really comfortable in our environment and then when

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.410
we step out to a different environment and

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.880
the reaction is totally inappropriate. It's, it's, it's

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.360
a slap in the face. It's a reminder.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.820
&gt;&gt; Can you, I mean if you're comfortable, can you

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.185
give us an example of a negative reaction that you experienced.

00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:33.730
&gt;&gt; Actually I can have, I can give you

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.870
two. And, and, and they're a little bit different.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.420
one of them was pure ignorance. There's nothing more

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.870
upsetting to me than to be in an environment

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.990
where it's the adults that are grabbing the children

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.480
and saying look at the midget. Come here, come here

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.950
Franky, look at the midget. I cannot believe that

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.020
in this day of age that's still happening, but when

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.160
I go into inner city environments, into grocery stores.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.880
You know, grocery stores are really harsh places for me

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.610
to be. Not only because of the physical thing but

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.150
you're trapped. You know, you're in a grocery store line,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.390
and you can't go anywhere, and you've got

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.870
kids with their fingers right five feet away

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.820
from you. And you're trapped. So that is

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.660
definitely you know, hard. The other example of

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:29.460
ignorance was an educated ignorance if I dare say. The five of us were on our

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.680
bikes in San Francisco by the Palace of

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.790
Fine Arts. We have been riding our bikes around.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:43.600
And we rode in front of a tour bus, from, tourists from another country. We

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.430
can pretty much assure you that when we go by a tour bus of, a group of tourists

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.960
from other countries, those video cameras are trained

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.960
on us like snipers. And my husband has gotten

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.825
to the point, he's a very, very patient man. But he will walk right up to the

00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:05.590
camera and say, you will delete that picture. He gets very upset.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.240
&gt;&gt; I imagine.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.070
&gt;&gt; Imagine having 50 of them on your

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.520
family. You feel like there are snipers on you.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.240
&gt;&gt; Let's go back to some of the, some of, some of the advantages.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.585
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Ha!

00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:19.585
&gt;&gt;

00:07:18.585 --> 00:07:18.902
[LAUGH]

00:07:18.902 --> 00:07:22.677
&gt;&gt; Cause that's a longer list. It really is. advantages. Let's

00:07:22.677 --> 00:07:25.890
see. Well, here's a hybrid. Why don't we do the hybrid first.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.025
&gt;&gt; The spotlight is always on.

00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:30.236
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:07:30.236 --> 00:07:34.300
&gt;&gt; So you can be entertaining, and the life

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.510
of the party. And everyone wants to talk to you.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.150
&gt;&gt; You can get a a a special spot on Tales From The Genome.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.934
&gt;&gt; People remember me, that's kind of the spotlight too,

00:07:43.934 --> 00:07:47.066
but if I want to jog somebody's memory over the phone, and I'll

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:51.063
say, hey this is Jenny Foos, your little customer. Oh yes, how are you.

00:07:51.063 --> 00:07:52.063
&gt;&gt;

00:07:51.063 --> 00:07:52.847
[LAUGH]

00:07:52.847 --> 00:07:55.250
&gt;&gt; So I get the information quicker.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.400
&gt;&gt; It's an identifier.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:56.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.160
when I get tickets to a show the tickets, I

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.025
can say I need good tickets and I get good tickets.

00:08:08.025 --> 00:08:09.345
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:08:09.345 --> 00:08:15.670
&gt;&gt; so that's an advantage. we went camping recently, and I was able to stand

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.000
up in my tent, and change my clothes,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.130
where as the average sized friends could not.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.920
&gt;&gt; I definitely encountered that problem before.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.750
&gt;&gt; anything what about airplanes.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:36.799
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, airplane travel is, I would argue more comfortable

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.020
for me, but the difference is, is that my feet are dangling.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.250
Look at right now and yours are not. So mine are going

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.876
to maybe go to sleep. But, when I've gone on a long

00:08:47.876 --> 00:08:50.384
flight, if there happens to be an empty

00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:53.236
seat next to mine, I can actually lay down.

00:08:53.236 --> 00:08:54.236
&gt;&gt;

00:08:53.236 --> 00:08:54.799
[LAUGH]

00:08:54.799 --> 00:08:57.920
&gt;&gt; The flight attendants don't like it much, but I can.
