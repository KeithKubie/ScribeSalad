00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So now let's look what happens when Alice spends a bill

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to see how to solve the double spending problem.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
At the end of this protocol, Alice will have a message like this,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where each one of these identity pairs is one of those pairs of hashes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
To spend the bill, Alice sends the bill to Cathy,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and Cathy sends a challenge back to Alice.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And what the challenge is, is a list of M random bits.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
These will tell Alice which parts of the identity she needs to open.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So in order for Cathy to accept the bill,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
what Alice has to do now is, for each one of these, validate one part of the hash.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So if Cathy's challenge bit was 0,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
what Alice has to provide is the 0 part of Identity 1--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and remember what Identity 1 is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
is the hash of the 0 part of Identity 1

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
concatenated with the hash of the 1 part where the property we need

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is that these 2 values XOR to Alice.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If the challenge is 1, then it'll send the 1 part of the corresponding identity, and so on.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So now Cathy can validate these hashes.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So she's going to check that this matches the values sent by Alice.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And we'll do that for all the identities.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If they all match, Cathy accepts the bill.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
When she deposits it, she sends these I values to the bank.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So suppose Alice tries to spend the bill again.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This time she'll send it to Doug.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Doug will do the same protocol.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
He'll make a challenge, send that challenge to Alice,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
get back the I values, but they'll be the ones corresponding to his challenge.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And he'll do the same check before accepting the bill.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And now Doug can deposit the bill, sending along the same I values.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So now what does the bank have?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It has both parts of one of the I values.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
As long as one of these challenge bits is different,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the bank knows there was double spending

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
because it saw R-K value twice.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It also knows the identity of the person who obtained that bill

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because it can XOR the 0 part of Identity 1,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which it received from Cathy when she deposited the bill,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
with the 1 part of the identity, which the bank received from Doug

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
when he deposited the bill.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So now the bank can tell the police to arrest Alice for double spending a bill.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So to see that you understand all of this,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the question is, "If Alice spends a bill twice,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
"and M the number of identities included in the bill is 10,

00:02:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
"what is the probability that she gets caught?"
