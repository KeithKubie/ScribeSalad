00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
While politeness is, of course, always preferable to rudeness

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.920
There are ways of being polite, that badly miss the mark

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.620
and can leave us feeling oddly detached and dissatified

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.560
Picture the person who ends up, despite their best efforts, seeming what we can call

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.280
"coldly polite"

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.660
They may be extremely keen to please those they're seeing

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.440
They obey all the rules of etiquette, they offer their guest drinks, ask them questions about their journey,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.260
suggest they might want a little more gravy, remark on the interest of a recent prize winnig novel

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.880
And yet, they never manage to make their hospitality feel either engaging or memorable

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.860
It may be a long time, before another meeting with them is suggested

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:49.400
By contrast, there is the person we recognize as a warm, who follows the cold person in the basic principles of politeness

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.080
but manages to add a critical, emotionally comforting ingridient to their manner

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.500
They might, when we have an evening plan with them, suggest making toasted cheese sandwiches at their place

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.200
rather than going out to a restaurant

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.520
they might chat to us through the bathroom door,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.860
put on the songs they loved dancing to, when they were fourteen,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.640
plump up a cushion, and slot it behind our back,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.060
confess to feeling intimidated by mutual acquaintance,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.200
bring us a posy of daisies, or a card they made

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.620
call us up when we're down with a flu and ask how our ears are feeling

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.860
mention they like our haircut, and then when we spill something or fart by mistake exclaim

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.520
"I'm so glad you did that, it is usually me"

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.960
Beneath the difference between the warm and the cold person

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.680
lies a contrasting vision of human nature

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.260
Broadly, the cold person is operating with an implicit view that those they are attempting to please

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.900
are creatures endowed only with the highest needs

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.820
As a result, all kinds of assumptions are made about them

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.340
That they are interested exclusively in so called "serious topics",

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.180
specially art and politics

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.820
That they will appreciate a degree of formality in dining and sitting

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.420
That they will be strong, self-contained and mature enough, never to have any hunger for reassurence or cosiness

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.480
and that they will be without urgent physical vulnerabilities and drives

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.400
which might prove deeply offensive if they were mentioned

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.760
These higher beings would, the cold host believes, wins if someone suggested they curl up on the sofa with a blanket

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.180
or handed them a copy of magazine about filmstars  when they headed for the bathroom

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.040
Yet, the warmly polite person is always deeply aware that the stranger irrespective of their status or outward dignity

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.280
is a highly needy, fragile, confused, appetitive and susceptible creature

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.060
and they know this about the stranger because they never forget this about themselves

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.000
Warmly polite people have much in common with the character Kanga, the tenderly maternal kangaroo in A. A. Milne's "Winnie-the-pooh" books

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.020
In one of the stories the little animals are deeply disconcerted by the arrival

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.520
in the Hundred Acre Wood of Tigger, who's very big, very loud and bouncy and assertive

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.160
They treat him with caution and are, we might say, coldly polite

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.140
But when Tigger finally meets Kanga, she is immediately warm with him

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.580
She thinks of him in much the same terms as she does her own child Roo

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.140
Just because an animal is large, it doesn't mean he doesn't want kindness

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.200
However big Tigger seems to be, remember that he wants as much kindness as Roo, says Kanga

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.020
In what might be a definition of the essence of the philosophy of warmth

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.160
Sometimes it is deeply generous to think that another person may be more elevated than us

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.340
Colectively, we've taken this thought very much to heart

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.140
We've internalized distance and learned caution, moving on from the naivety of the small child

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.300
who wonders sweetly, when you're sad, if you might like to sniff their grimy blanket

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.720
But the warm person knows that however solid and dignified someone appears on the outside,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.120
behind the scenes there will inevitably be a struggling self

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.580
potencially awkward, easily bemused, beset by physical appetites, on the verge of loneliness and frequently in need of nothing more subtle or elevated

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.560
than a cheese sandwich, a glass of milk and a hug
