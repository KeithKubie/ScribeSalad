the answers to one could help solve the
 

00:11:58.339 --> 00:12:00.699
the answers to one could help solve the
problems of the other and so I'm going

how could we bring that out to people in
 

00:12:42.149 --> 00:12:44.660
how could we bring that out to people in
all communities so they could benefit

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:44.670
all communities so they could benefit

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:19.420
very vulnerable and from that puzzling
 

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.630
very vulnerable and from that puzzling
for several more years over why that

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:21.640
for several more years over why that
 

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.880
for several more years over why that
list was there why did those things Co

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:23.890
list was there why did those things Co
 

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.980
list was there why did those things Co
occur in people I proposed in a day of a

hoss that there was actually a vicious

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:32.710
hoss that there was actually a vicious
 

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.310
hoss that there was actually a vicious
cycle going on which was not about a

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320
cycle going on which was not about a
 

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.080
cycle going on which was not about a
disease but it actually was an

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:37.090
disease but it actually was an
 

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:39.360
disease but it actually was an
independent process and this messy

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:39.370
independent process and this messy
 

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.700
independent process and this messy
picture is all about a very vicious

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:41.710
picture is all about a very vicious
 

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.000
picture is all about a very vicious
cycle which I call the cycle of frailty

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.010
cycle which I call the cycle of frailty
 

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.000
cycle which I call the cycle of frailty

and if you go to the left people slowing
 

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:05.130
and if you go to the left people slowing
down less walking speed and then all the

a proposal that I put forward in the
late 90s after now working on this

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:37.330
late 90s after now working on this
 

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:43.500

forward a few more years and we have

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:45.910
forward a few more years and we have
 

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.090
forward a few more years and we have
been able over the course of a number of

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:48.100
been able over the course of a number of
 

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.310
been able over the course of a number of

all well and good but if it doesn't
 

00:20:56.679 --> 00:20:58.530
all well and good but if it doesn't
occur in anybody then it's somewhat

occur in anybody then it's somewhat
 

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.060

irrelevant but in fact we've
 

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.310
irrelevant but in fact we've
demonstrated that seven percent of older

having this picture above the water line
of being frail carries with it some very

of being frail carries with it some very

of being frail carries with it some very
serious worries in fact those with that

serious worries in fact those with that
 

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.480
serious worries in fact those with that

becoming more disabled and having very
 

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.230
becoming more disabled and having very
slow recovery this has many clinical

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240
slow recovery this has many clinical
 

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.000
slow recovery this has many clinical
implications which I'm not going to go

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.010
implications which I'm not going to go
 

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.190
implications which I'm not going to go
into tonight but it also raises

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200
into tonight but it also raises
 

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.980
into tonight but it also raises
questions if this is a distinct entity

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:49.990
questions if this is a distinct entity
 

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.330
questions if this is a distinct entity
how do we take go inferential e to the

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:54.340
how do we take go inferential e to the
 

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.460
how do we take go inferential e to the
next question which is is there

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:56.470
next question which is is there
 

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.410
next question which is is there
something under the water line that's

00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:58.420
something under the water line that's
 

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.490
something under the water line that's
causing it and so I've spent with my

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:02.500
causing it and so I've spent with my
 

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.850
causing it and so I've spent with my
colleagues many years since then trying

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:05.860
colleagues many years since then trying
 

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.310
colleagues many years since then trying
to understand what might be driving this

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320
to understand what might be driving this
 

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.500
to understand what might be driving this
and to present the evidence as to what's

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:10.510
and to present the evidence as to what's
 

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.840
and to present the evidence as to what's
going on and I'm going to summarize that

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:12.850
going on and I'm going to summarize that
 

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:15.660
going on and I'm going to summarize that
very quickly so I can take you to the

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:15.670
very quickly so I can take you to the
 

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.710
very quickly so I can take you to the
picture frame so this issue could be

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720
picture frame so this issue could be
 

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.200
picture frame so this issue could be
summed up in this syndrome of frailty by

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:22.210
summed up in this syndrome of frailty by
 

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.390
summed up in this syndrome of frailty by
showing you the vicious cycle at the top

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400
showing you the vicious cycle at the top
 

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.250
showing you the vicious cycle at the top
of the slide which you've already seen

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:26.260
of the slide which you've already seen
 

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.920
of the slide which you've already seen
this vicious cycle of loss of muscle

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:28.930
this vicious cycle of loss of muscle
 

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.040
this vicious cycle of loss of muscle

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.140
is much slower to rise in the people who

been a lot of research on that over the

the other part of the story and the
 

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:16.529
the other part of the story and the
challenges have to do with our

challenges have to do with our
 

00:31:16.539 --> 00:31:19.259
challenges have to do with our
experiences in our society right now as

that benefit older adults so that they

that benefit older adults so that they
can live healthy into older age and at

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120
can live healthy into older age and at
 

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.480
can live healthy into older age and at
the same time harness the societal

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:49.490
the same time harness the societal

it at that but if you take that model
then an obvious place to me to start was

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:49.490
then an obvious place to me to start was
 

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:53.619
then an obvious place to me to start was
to think about how to deploy older

00:34:53.619 --> 00:34:53.629
to think about how to deploy older
 

00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:56.230

models Evans based models to ensure the

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:01.940
models Evans based models to ensure the
 

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.170

success of our children and

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:04.180
success of our children and
 

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.340
success of our children and
simultaneously could we hide within

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:06.350
simultaneously could we hide within
 

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.740
simultaneously could we hide within
those roles because people sign up to

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:08.750
those roles because people sign up to
 

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.690
those roles because people sign up to
make a difference they often don't sign

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:10.700
make a difference they often don't sign
 

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.030
make a difference they often don't sign
up to exercise could we hide within

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040
up to exercise could we hide within
 

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.730
up to exercise could we hide within
those roles ways to help people stay

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:15.740
those roles ways to help people stay
 

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:21.790

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:27.370
the design how important it was to train
 

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:29.430
the design how important it was to train
the volunteers to do things they had not

the volunteers to do things they had not
 

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:32.220
the volunteers to do things they had not
done before to in fact stimulate new

first the reason to start with

first the reason to start with
elementary schools is twofold one you

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:19.850
elementary schools is twofold one you
 

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:22.600
elementary schools is twofold one you
have to start somewhere and the end the

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:22.610
have to start somewhere and the end the
 

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.630
have to start somewhere and the end the
and if you start somewhere then you want

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:25.640
and if you start somewhere then you want
 

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.220
and if you start somewhere then you want
to do it right so you truly make a

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:27.230
to do it right so you truly make a
 

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:28.900

and the second reason is the evidence

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280
and the second reason is the evidence
 

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.670
and the second reason is the evidence
that children have to be succeeding by
