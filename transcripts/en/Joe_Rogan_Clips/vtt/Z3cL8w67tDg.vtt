WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.511
Yeah.
They,

2
00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:04.230
he'll figure out what was the whole experience like being on this ESPN card

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.810
because it's a,
that was a historic moment,
much like,

4
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.950
like the Cain Velasquez vs junior dos Santos,
which also stopped the same way.

5
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.700
And that was controversial.
That was not controversial.

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.770
The Punch that landed also behind the ear,
same punch,
you know,
like a terminal.

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.890
Those things that you,

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.460
it just takes your feet up if you've ever fought or if you've ever been in,

9
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.030
got hit in the back of the head,
weird.
Your feet go out from underneath you,

10
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:29.670
but you're there,
like you're 100% aware of what's going on,

11
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.340
but your balance isn't there.
Then you have another grown man on top of you,

12
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:35.670
you know.
So of course things are gonna happen.
But uh,
with the ESPN,

13
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.190
it was really cool.
The whole lead up to it.
They film,

14
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.000
they came and filled my late,
they were around a lot.
They did a lot of exposure.

15
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.640
They,
um,
the stuff they put out was really cool.

16
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:48.840
And then just seeing like our commercial for a fight on national football on

17
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:50.880
ESPN or for the call it,
you know,

18
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:54.240
cause college I was going on and then you see the nationals was going on and

19
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.090
you'd see me in like three different commercials than ESPN.

20
00:00:57.091 --> 00:01:00.600
I thought that was pretty cool.
No,
it was amazing.
You know,
I mean,
it really,
uh,

21
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.710
it's cool to see.

22
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.790
It's cool to see that ESPN is embracing the sport and then it's getting into it.

23
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:08.460
And you know,
there was a lot of hype behind this and you know,

24
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:12.480
I got ESPN plus I wasn't,
yeah,
no,
I mean I'm not a sports fan.

25
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:15.150
I don't watch sport.
I don't even know what's happening.
Like where people like,

26
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:16.830
what are you doing for the Super Bowl?
I'm like,
when's that?

27
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.480
That's exactly what I did.
I don't have time for it,
man.
Um,
I'm a,

28
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.550
I'm a Raiders fan,
but I don't have time to really watch,
you know.
Um,
but yeah,

29
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:29.730
I mean it's just,
when you think of sports,
you think ESPN.
Yeah.
You really do.

30
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:33.120
I mean,
it's another level of acceptance in the sports world.

31
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.940
The only thing that kind of bummed me out,

32
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:39.240
and I should probably clarify this because I talked about this on the podcast,

33
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.370
was the hardy fight.
And not,

34
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.020
not even because I don't think the guy should be fighting or not even because I

35
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:51.000
think I,
you know,
I don't,
I don't really know what he did in terms of his past.

36
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.740
I know there's a lot of,
there's a lot shit,
right?
I mean,

37
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.630
he was in trouble for something.

38
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.840
There was an appeal and he got off of it somehow.
I don't know,

39
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.920
but I'm only talking about it from a fighting perspective.

40
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.110
You're watching the highest level fights.
You're watching the co main event.

41
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.940
He's just not ready for a co main event.
Like technically no,
no way.
Yeah.

42
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.080
Just see what he rushed out.
He gassed out,
you burn himself out,

43
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.560
Crowder recovered,
and it just,
it's not,

44
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.100
the way it should be is you should have the early fights or people who are

45
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:31.800
learning the sport.
And then when you get to the last couple of fights,

46
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:33.480
the Khomeini and the main,

47
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.620
you're supposed to be seeing assassins like you and Henry.
So Huda,

48
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.180
that's what you're supposed to be seeing.

49
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.580
And just crazy thing about our sport is,

50
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.640
is a lot of entertainment behind it as well too.
So if you're hyped up,

51
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:47.490
you get pushed up the ladder,
maybe you get title fight sooner than you should.

52
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.780
And that's crazy to me because now we're on ESPN now where like we're an

53
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:54.240
official,
I mean we've been an official support,
but yeah,

54
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:57.540
it should be more on the level like you're talking about of the actual skill

55
00:02:57.541 --> 00:03:00.590
level and how you're ranked.
I mean cowboy Serone and uh,

56
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.050
Alex kid should have been the a hundred percent main event.
Oh hundred percent.

57
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.230
I was stunned that it wasn't,
they imagine they were on real,

58
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:10.600
they were on ESPN though.
They wanted to kind of hype up.

59
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.300
He just cam plus it makes sense.
That makes sense for that reason.
Yeah.

60
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.040
But there's another fight they could have put in place of that.

61
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.040
There's 100% and again,
this is not a knock on Crowder or hardy.

62
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:24.370
There are guys out there doing it.
They're,
they're trying,
they did their job,

63
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.940
did their job.
They're fighting.
I mean not the ending was super unfortunate.
Yeah.

64
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.570
Again,
you don't know whether or not he did it on purpose.

65
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:34.480
Whether you had a mental,
you're getting punched in the face.

66
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.350
That stuff happens so fast.
Chaos.
Yeah.
I mean especially because he is so new,

67
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:42.190
right?
Yes.
He hasn't been fighting forever.
Like that stuff just happens like,
oh,

68
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:44.950
I got them hurt.
Boom.
You know you don't like,
there's things like,

69
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:46.780
I've even done a practice.
I'm like,
Oh shit dude,

70
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:49.690
I'm sorry I'm in practice and I did something.
I'm like,
Oh man,
that was stupid.

71
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.660
Like if it happens in a fight,
I'm losing a point.
Like I'm so sorry.

72
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.550
You know like bums me out that this rush to commercialization,
that this,

73
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:01.720
this rush to trying to get the most eyes on it.

74
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.610
The people that are watching it.

75
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.820
If you watch something where there's two guys who really aren't ready for Co

76
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:07.654
main event,

77
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.130
you're seeing sloppiness and guys getting out of gas real quick and you're

78
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.730
seeing all the things that you're supposed to learn early in your career so that

79
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:20.110
by the time you get to a call,
main event,
you know you're a fucking assassin,

80
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.500
you're,
you're locked down and a hundred percent professional.

81
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.630
You're a real elite pro fighter.

82
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.490
That's what I want to see when I'm watching ESPN.
Yeah,
that's what I want to see.

83
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.640
I want to see the best of the best.
You know,

84
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.830
I want to see world class fighters fighting with precision and power and speed

85
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:41.920
and knowing how to pace themselves.
Guys were the experience.

86
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:44.770
They've been there before.
They know how to recover from things.
They get cracked,

87
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.870
they know how to lay back.
They know how to hold on.

88
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.920
They know how to do what they need to do in order to win or fight their best

89
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.310
instead of like,
just like you're seeing things.

90
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.950
And so many people are seeing this at this point.

91
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.040
And I feel like we're getting fans now that are more knowledgeable,

92
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:01.140
like yourself and,

93
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.200
and people aren't seeing this sport and understanding technique now to where

94
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.140
before maybe it didn't matter,
you didn't know what bad technique is now,

95
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.351
you know?

96
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:11.290
But we get more knowledgeable fans to where they are going to start realizing

97
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.370
like,
what was that like?
Right.

98
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.910
And the last thing you want to see is two heavyweights gassed out.
Yes.

99
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.130
That is the fucking worst.
Yeah.
