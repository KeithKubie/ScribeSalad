1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burr and
it is time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:09,980
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and Ah,

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,570
just checking in on
motherfucker.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,440
Um, how are you, how was your
week going? Oh, that's love.

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:24,010
Don't let it get you down,
you know?

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,543
Um,

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:29,370
yeah,

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,450
I'm recording this fucking Wednesday
night. I got so much shit to do tomorrow.

9
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:37,900
I didn't even realize it. You know,
it's the usual shit. You know how many,

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,830
um, I'm just gonna do a bunch
of stuff. I was wondering,

11
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,340
is there any way that you
could handle the other stuff?

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,153
Okay.

13
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,540
Oh, good to, to do this job. Could
you do that stuff? Well, you know,

14
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,310
I was already had some stuff.

15
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,940
Honey would be a big help if you
could just do the stuff to easy to do.

16
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,380
Put the stuff that you were already
going to jail. That bullshit.

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,320
It happens
to one of those things that happens.

18
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,000
Um, you know, I don't, I don't know
what the fuck to tell you guys. Hey,

19
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm starting a Patrion page, by the
way. I don't know when it's coming out,

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,780
but it's going to be all this extra shit.
Um,

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,410
a bunch of extra shit,

22
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,850
a whole bunch of extra shit and uh,
you know,

23
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,070
get some helicopter videos and
whatnot and some other shit.

24
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,350
This is sort of a pre promotional
promotional thing here or you know,

25
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,430
if I was supposed to bring it up,

26
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:44,360
I think I'm supposed to wait until I
had more shit on the sat. You know what,

27
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:47,680
I might still be worth it
worth the two year, uh,

28
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:51,830
basically just trying to
become this little fucking,
you know, you have a go. Yeah.

29
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:55,160
A little town. This little place that
makes a little candies, you know,

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,321
and it just fucking,

31
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:01,760
they hang in there despite the fact across
the street there's a Mcdonald's are,

32
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:04,310
you know,
there's a fucking Walmart Assam Shit.

33
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,860
There's just this fucking guy
down the Hebrew payers shoes,

34
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,590
whatever the fuck he does. That's all
I'm trying to do in this business.

35
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,320
Just trying to have my little fucking shop

36
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,490
be bringing in enough fucking money on
my own. So these Steven cons out here,

37
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,383
you know,

38
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,690
I can't even tell you some of this
shit that I've done like I've really,

39
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:27,430
like a long time ago I saw
this documentary and this
fucking musician said you

40
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:32,431
are better to own something 100% and
sell 20,000 copies then did not own it at

41
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,620
all and sell 20 million.

42
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,420
You actually going to make more if
you just sell 20,000 if it's your own,

43
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,230
if you own it and a,
it's one of the truest fuck it things

44
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,360
I've ever,
ever heard other than

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,420
don't stay friends with your
ex girlfriend. You know,
you break up with a girl,

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,930
you've got gotta get the fuck
away from her cause uh, you know,

47
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,930
it's just, it's, you know what, I
don't listen to me. Generally speaking,

48
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,280
some of them are cool, some of them
get it, some are happy for you.

49
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,470
The rest of them, Jay, you got to get
away from him. You know what I mean?

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,520
It's like when there's mold in the house,
you got to go, are you going to die?

51
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,780
Okay. Does that make sense? Do
I need to sing a song about it?

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,950
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.

53
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:25,951
All I know is that I am sitting here
alone in this God damn room and my fucking

54
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:34,240
chest hurts. I think I have a
bruised sternum. This fucking guy,

55
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,560
like the end of last year,

56
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:39,700
he was trying to show me what the fuck
happened on this football play and I as

57
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:42,400
he was coming towards me, I should
have been like, dude, I saw it.

58
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,750
I saw the play and he went to pick me
up any fucking compacted my fucking ribs

59
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,140
and I think it fucked up my sternum.

60
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,740
Either that or I have a to,
I don't know what it is,

61
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:02,790
but you know I'm going to
go see a doctor about it.

62
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,180
See what the deal is now that
I've fucking been here for like a,

63
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,920
why does this fucking couch scratch ups?
Do they make anything nice anymore?

64
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,020
But these fucking leather couches,

65
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,100
you stick anything on it and everything
gets all fuck that fucking hacked up.

66
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:20,940
Look at this shit.
Jesus Christ.

67
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,150
Oh, it gives a fuck. Right?
I guess that adds character,

68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,400
but will say a bunch of hack marks on it

69
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,110
anyways. Um, college
football starts this weekend.

70
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,140
A wrong song.
Yeah.

71
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,430
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Papa, Papa,

72
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,010
Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa, Papa.

73
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,240
But they're all the same fucking song.
[inaudible]

74
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,240
[inaudible]

75
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,770
you know, people or some sort of hand
gesture that they fucking throw up. Right.

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,270
Um, anyways, Mike, most beginnings
of most college football seasons,

77
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:11,630
there's not a lot of good games. Okay. So
the ones you want to look out here, uh,

78
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,210
speaking of, of, of his
University of Michigan, Yay.

79
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,440
Yale to the, there is value
yet right against a Notre Dame.

80
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,870
Uh, he was in a fucking hospital.
He was dying and he said,

81
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,140
where in one for it may cause I'm a
selfish cunt and I'm still thinking about

82
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:38,720
me. I don't even know if that even
happened when one for the gipper was that

83
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:43,580
Hollywood adding a dialogue,
some shit that was never said,

84
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,260
you know,
like you complete me.

85
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,420
MMM.

86
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,080
Anyways. Now the good ones, I LSU first
Miami. That could be a decent one.

87
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,860
Just as far as rank teams
actually each other.

88
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,680
Other than than that.
Virginia Tech,

89
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:05,030
Florida State 20 Verse 19 I love it.

90
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,650
How the fuck did they do the rankings
at the, so many people leave.

91
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:09,030
How do they figure out who's what?

92
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,310
You know you can watch number for
Wisconsin against Western Kentucky.

93
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,410
I think the spread is on that. Look
at Tcu is not ranked against southern.

94
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:23,500
You come off frogs.
What happened?

95
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,170
I don't know why I fucking,
you know, I know why because I,

96
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,940
they came to the rose bowl that one
time and everybody was dressed like a

97
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:35,200
fucking douche bag.
Everybody all living,

98
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,750
all the guys were all
dressed like jr Ewing.

99
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,920
You know that there's like
dress and classy. Right?

100
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,940
And then there's just like you just a
privileged cut and it's neither one of

101
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:51,480
those is probably true. Well actually
dressing classes too. But the second part,

102
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:52,770
they probably won't even privileged cons.

103
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:56,190
I probably just looked at them and
just judge the shit out of them.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,840
There's probably what really happened.
I bet there's nothing wrong with tasty.

105
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:02,220
You come off frogs.

106
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,213
MMM.

107
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,810
I Dunno what they just, they just, they
just look like assholes. Not the women.

108
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:14,110
Just the guys sit there. You know
what I mean? He's sitting there,

109
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:17,620
this stupid fucking loafers
in a fucking blue blazer.

110
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,410
Who wears that to a football game?
Right?

111
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,340
Why are you dressed like an usher?
I Dunno.

112
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,060
It's amazing how long ago I saw that
in the fact that it's still bugs me.

113
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,340
It doesn't bug me as much as how easily
these chairs fucking scratch evidently.

114
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,930
Oh well what are you going
to do? You know what I mean?

115
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,420
You know was funny is I got these chairs,

116
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,870
not for a lot of money
because they're like, hey,

117
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:49,210
here's some vintage fucking chairs. Right?
So you don't want these old as fuck.

118
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:51,940
First one is zillion dollars for
these vintage leather chairs, right?

119
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,450
So I've got just buy some new ones and
I'll put the fucking hack marks in them.

120
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,240
And now every hack mark that's
getting goes in and now mellow.

121
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,490
What happened, Bill was exactly what
you said you wanted in your couches.

122
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:08,050
And now that's happening. And now
you're upset about, all right.

123
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:11,940
Fair enough. Fair enough. How
about those red socks? Huh?

124
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,340
Pouring it on the offense. The
bats, the bats hanging in there,

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,540
hanging in there while our pitching
staff all goes on the fucking deal.

126
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,140
Chris sale once again is on
the 10 day disabled list.

127
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,850
David Price got hit by a line drive.
Oh,

128
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:30,850
come back or write to the mound.
X Rays were negative,

129
00:08:30,851 --> 00:08:35,490
but they're going to take more
fucking, more x rays, you know,

130
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:41,710
so we shall see. That's why I ESPN. Oh,
it's all over. Or beginning of August.

131
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,840
You never know what can happen
with all the fucking injuries.

132
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,873
MMM.

133
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,850
So anyways, I was watching that. Uh, I'll
tell you what my daughter does. You know,

134
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:55,290
it's fucking hilarious. Did I tell
you she imitates the old noises,

135
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,490
old man noises I make when I pick her
up. All right, come on sweetie. Let's go.

136
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:02,190
And I pick up,
she looks at me and she goes,

137
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,670
I don't, you know, I, maybe I already told
you that story. I'm old. I don't remember.

138
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,260
Speaking of all that went to the gym
today and after bragging about my perfect

139
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:13,621
form,

140
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:18,420
I somehow threw out my back trying to
make sure I was doing the middle of my

141
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:20,610
back chip Pz exercises.

142
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:24,930
So my fucking chest and shoulders
wouldn't pull my fucking know my chest,

143
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,760
wouldn't pull my shoulders
forward against, I wouldn't
fuck up my rotator cuffs,

144
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:34,260
my rotator cuffs, doing great. And then
I end up fucking up my back. I can't,

145
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,550
when I think I'm at that
age where I got it was, Nah,

146
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,370
I just gotta I gotta you know,
somebody finally said, I said,

147
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:45,090
why don't you get a fucking personal
trainer and just have them go over there?

148
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:46,470
All the exercises you're going to do.

149
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:49,530
They'll put together a workout plan that
tell you how to do the, the, the, the,

150
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,000
the exercise correctly. And I've always
said, Nah, Nah, Nah, fuck that. Fuck that.

151
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:59,530
I know what I'm doing. I know what I'm
doing. You know, I know what I'm doing.

152
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,540
Because in the eighties I went,

153
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,590
I went over to a friend's house and
he's going to, come on, let's work out,

154
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,870
make a friend of mine, just get your
bench to this. Nothing about grip,

155
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,150
nothing about form, nothing. Do
some curls. This is good for you.

156
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,920
Didn't fucking know. And then you'd
go to the 10, you joined a gym, right?

157
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:22,921
You joined Gold's or world gym or
whatever the fuck it was right back in the

158
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,820
day. And then you just see somebody
doing an exercise, you know,

159
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,300
they seemed approachable. You'd be like,
Hey, what's that? What does that do?

160
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,950
And if they seemed intimidating,

161
00:10:32,951 --> 00:10:35,800
you just sort of watch it out of the
corner of your eye and then you just start

162
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,460
doing it. You had no idea what are you
are doing, what the fuck it was working.

163
00:10:39,461 --> 00:10:43,000
You would basically guess what it was
doing and then you didn't work the

164
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,700
opposite muscle and you fuck yourself up.

165
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,730
It had I just gone out and got
a personal trainer from day one.

166
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,570
If they even fucking existed back
in the 80s, I don't think they did.

167
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,690
You just went to the gym.
Um,

168
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,200
I wouldn't have all of these problems
today. So there you go. There you go.

169
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:05,550
Everybody, if you're learning how to
play drums, wear ear plugs from day one,

170
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:08,490
if you're going to go to the gym,
get a fucking trainer from day one,

171
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,440
learn what the fuck the correct way to
do shit. So you don't end up like me.

172
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,750
End Up hurting yourself
trying to fix something else.

173
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,000
My fucking shoulder is doing great.

174
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:19,850
Yeah.

175
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,460
There's nothing worse than
thrown out the top of your back.

176
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,920
I don't know what it is. Lower
back up, just so used to that pain.

177
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:28,130
It's like acceptable at the
top of your back is fucking,

178
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,590
and I explain it.

179
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:32,040
Yeah.

180
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,600
Takes your breath away. So in dealing with
that off all day, you know what I mean?

181
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,650
And my Kiddo, you know, she likes
getting picked up all the time,

182
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,840
so I was making extra or band noises,

183
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,710
uh, anyways, but it's still worth
it back. Pain for a kid is the best.

184
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,710
It's no worries. You know,
I'll take any day of the week.

185
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:55,090
The kids are fucking right.

186
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,010
She's got a great sense of humor and
she likes to rough house. It's perfect.

187
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,710
It's perfect. You know? Oh, she
loves vamp arena, man. I got 10.

188
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,710
I'm getting sick of that show.

189
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,873
You know,

190
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,740
the fucking little blue
chick. She's always having
problems fitting in. I get it.

191
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:15,380
She's different.
Every fucking goddamn episode.

192
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:17,450
And then the other two people
have to fucking help her out.

193
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,390
You know what she reminds me of?
She reminds me of an addict.

194
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,360
You know where it's always about them
and you've got to fail. Oh No, no.

195
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:27,020
You're doing great. What's the
matter? What's the matter now?

196
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,363
You know,

197
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,340
I don't really mind it.
Fancy.

198
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:37,180
Nancy's the one I don't like that
one fucking chicken all. She,

199
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,960
she's just sitting there, y'all.
She's about as material things.

200
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,260
She always trying to have the nicest shit.

201
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,970
She somehow gets status and then
give friends or whatever is like,

202
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:47,940
what the fuck are we watch? I don't
want to watch this shit. You know?

203
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,870
So instead I was watching a little bit
of the red sox with my daughter before

204
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,790
she went to bed. And then, um,

205
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,110
afterwards,
uh,

206
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,420
it was funny, actually nodded off
when I was watching vamp arena.

207
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,600
And you have like that
panic when you fall asleep,

208
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:08,080
flight three seconds that you kids like
walking up to an alligator or some shit.

209
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,800
And I just opened my eyes and she
was just looking right at me and she,

210
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,570
and I opened my eyes. She just looks
at me and she just goes, hi. Like,

211
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,970
what's up buddy? Sorry. Oh,

212
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,340
fucking all freckles nodded off there.
So anyways,

213
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,050
I put her to bed and I went on Instagram
and I saw Joe Rogan was promoting a,

214
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,460
or just talking about,
well,

215
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:34,030
we just watched this documentary
about Leonard Skinner,

216
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,110
sorry for the onyx. I was like,
God, I got to check this shit out.

217
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:43,750
And I just watched, it's on showtime.
It's called if I leave here tomorrow,

218
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,810
um, and I gotta tell you, man,

219
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,840
these fucking old southern guys
that is still around. I mean,

220
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:52,210
I literally had to put on the, the, uh,

221
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,030
the closed caption so I can understand
what the fuck they were saying.

222
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,410
And Jesus Christ,
incredible documentary.

223
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:03,080
But it's also amazing at how similar,

224
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,630
you know,
so many of these bands stories are,

225
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,840
and it's just because they get into that,

226
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,250
they get into the music business where
they getting fucking ripped off and they

227
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:19,540
just put them on the wheel and the
business just gives a shit about money and

228
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,950
they don't give a fuck if they run a
band into the fucking ground because

229
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:27,580
there's always another band that
they can sign. And plus who,

230
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,290
why would you want to wrap an old band?

231
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,870
They know all the tricks and how
you're going to try to steal from them.

232
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,960
They'll probably try to get the rights
to their music pack, so fuck them,

233
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,350
you know?
Then he lucked,

234
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,350
they'll blame each other and break up
and then we'll move onto the next band.

235
00:14:41,351 --> 00:14:45,340
Like that's literally how the
music fucking business worked. Um,

236
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,610
so I'm sitting there
watching this shit and um,

237
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,050
just,
just,

238
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,741
you know,
that whole,

239
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:56,190
just the work ethic and just keeping it
simple in the beginning and then they

240
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:57,900
just get stuck in the,
uh,

241
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,800
the craziness of touring. I don't want
to ruin any of it, but definitely, uh,

242
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,160
definitely check it out and just also
how great the band sounds in the night.

243
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:12,110
Just seeing people singing live and
playing live with other human beings is

244
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,800
incredible. I don't know, man. I'm kind of
going off the rails here, dude. I'm just,

245
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,663
I'm just,

246
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,040
I can't remember the last time I
watched something from this century.

247
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,650
Yeah.

248
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,570
By the way, I've been watching that.
Peter Gunn on a me TV bed at it,

249
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,590
dude. Dude, dude. Wow. That's
where that song came from, right?

250
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,980
That is the worst lit show in the history
of anything that was ever fucking lit.

251
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,450
At first I thought it was like
a style thing. Like for you,

252
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:48,020
if you guys have in the business, they're
like, when they go to light a scene,

253
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,560
I never understood why this shadow
was like a big full gives a fuck up.

254
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:55,850
There's a shadow. Right? But it's just
like if you know, if you're in a room,

255
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,990
okay.
Like if,

256
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,190
I dunno, I don't even know how
to explain this because this,

257
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:04,310
this is really beyond my ability.

258
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,660
All I know is that's what's so fucked
up is they'll be in a dimly lit room and

259
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:12,080
one person's talking and then there's
a shadow behind him and then somebody

260
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,940
right behind them, like wrecked directly
cross talking for them. So if anything,

261
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,670
the shadow, that person should
be on the person talking.

262
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,980
But whenever they turn
around to go to that person,

263
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,840
then that person has a shadow behind them.

264
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:26,630
They literally had like one light and
they just would stick it in front of

265
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:28,760
people.
So this episode ends,

266
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,140
I'm not saying it's a bad show, it's
just a badly, poorly lit lit show.

267
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,790
This woman standing there and
because she's standing in like, uh,

268
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,290
the opening to this,
this apartment building where it,

269
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,793
uh,

270
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,500
it's not straight on the walls,
they sort of angle in towards the door.

271
00:16:47,501 --> 00:16:52,280
Her shadow was on both sides
when she standing there.

272
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,990
And that would just say,
okay,

273
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:57,930
maybe that's how they lit the building
in which she standing. All right.

274
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,930
Then she walks, it's the end of the
episode. She goes down the street.

275
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:05,700
Now we're behind her and as she's
walking away, as the camera rises up,

276
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,380
you literally see the shadow of
the camera and the fucking guy,

277
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,990
the guy's head and body
hanging off the side,

278
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,330
off going off the building in the
background that she's walking towards.

279
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,590
And it's like, how to fuck
that? Somebody missed that.

280
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,940
So,
um,

281
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,470
but you got to watch Peter
Gunn. All right, it's on me TV.

282
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,520
I still highly recommend it.
It's fucking hilarious. You,

283
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,550
you will never see a character die faster.

284
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,500
They only had fucking 22 minutes
to have somebody get killed,

285
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,890
to have Peter Gunn to
try to figure out what,

286
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:44,680
what the fuck happened to have Peter
get the living shit kicked out of him.

287
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,080
And then for him to
solve the fucking murder,

288
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,390
they had to do all of that in 22 fucking
minutes. So it always just starts.

289
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,710
One of them started at like,
Ladies and gentlemen on piano,

290
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,950
please welcome 88 keys,
kitty or whatever the fuck his name is.

291
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,220
And the curtain comes up and the guy's
just sitting there with this weird look

292
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:06,120
on his face and they just keels over
with a knife in his back and then it just

293
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:10,490
goes, yeah, no, no, no, no,
no, no. [inaudible] Bam.

294
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,840
So another one, a guy gets on a fucking
elevator and the elevator stops.

295
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:18,150
He's pushing the button. He's
like, what the fuck's going on?

296
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:21,950
And all of a sudden the trapdoor above
it opens up and a gun with a silencer

297
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,320
come sue. Yeah. Fucking guy drops down.

298
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:29,730
Debt goes down to the first floor, opens
up, the guy reacts to the dead body.

299
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,553
Yay.

300
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,420
That was it. Then they're right
in there. And I gotta Tell You,

301
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,150
Peter Gunn,
it's sort of the precursor to that.

302
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:49,030
David do cover the
minimalist style of acting.

303
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,863
MMM.

304
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:57,550
Guy Crushes it.
And then also 77 sunset strip,

305
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:01,330
they would do foreshadowing to the
middle of the episode like you saw at the

306
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:04,060
beginning of Goodfellas in a
lot of Martin Scorsese movies.

307
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,670
Everybody always said, I always think,
oh, they're ripping off Martin Scorsese.

308
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:10,280
I'm like, [inaudible], well wait a
minute. 77 sunset strip. Did this shit.

309
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,780
Maybe he watched a few
episodes. I don't know. This is,

310
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,760
let's see what we see,
what this podcast is becoming.

311
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,800
This is becoming an old fucking man.

312
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:24,630
I gotta what are you guys watching that's
worth watching? I Dunno what it is.

313
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,770
Cause my wife dominates the TV. I love
it at death. What am I going to say? No.

314
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,390
And she's literally sitting there,

315
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,360
she's watching that Andy
Cohen show where all the,

316
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,350
the little old ladies get together with
their fucking 20 pounds of makeup and

317
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:41,610
they just start fucking saying means
shit to each other. I liked one of them.

318
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:42,660
One of them was a drunk,

319
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,870
clearly was a drunk and they would tell
her that she needed to go into Rehab.

320
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,730
She goes, I don't need to go in
and Rehab. And I'd probably say no.

321
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,270
I went into Rehab was was my cousin. And
that was because you know they, you know,

322
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,730
she didn't, she go to jail was saying
like, that's why you go to Rehab.

323
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:58,761
And they were like,
yes,

324
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:02,800
but sometimes you have to go to rehab
because you have a problem. Well,

325
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,910
I don't have a prominent guy. Am I going
to prop? That's what she does. She,

326
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,000
she did the fucking
Archie bunker fuel like fuck you guys.

327
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,150
And you could just hear in a voice,
even if she wasn't drunk,

328
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,280
just like she,

329
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:24,020
she's at that level of booze with
a bottle has like a fucking handle.

330
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,420
You know,
it's like a jug.

331
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,110
You buying that cheap shit with
like a carton of cigarettes.

332
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,780
There is something to be said
for going out like that,

333
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,360
you know,
to just give in to all of it.

334
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,000
Scherger's saw liquor,
fucking smoke.

335
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,063
I Dunno.

336
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,460
I think it's all good right up
until you get sick and then you die.

337
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,040
Then you're like, ah, you know,
I could have been fucking,

338
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,860
I should have jogged in aid apricots,

339
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,880
you know, Dan, what

340
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:07,360
I mean if it really is just a
blink of the eye, well, you know,

341
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,380
as far as how long the universe has been
here, oh Jeez. I'm going deep now. Right.

342
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,460
Deep. For me anyways, if it
really is a blink of the eye,

343
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:20,330
just the amount of time that human
beings have walked the earth, you know,

344
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,650
who gives a fuck

345
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,620
if you live to be 30?
Oh fucking a hundred.

346
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,454
Right?

347
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:30,910
Yeah.

348
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,490
Well you know, who gives a
fuck the, I guess the person

349
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,980
because for you that's a long fucking
time or really short time, right.

350
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,010
Not Saying, you know, I wouldn't
give a fuck if I was dying.

351
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,740
I'm just saying, you know
what I mean? You know,

352
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:50,220
I'm really saying is that I've been
eating like an angel and I barely been

353
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:52,320
drinking and uh,

354
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,330
trying to get my abs back here and uh,
this is one of these nights where,

355
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,830
uh, you know, I dunno,
it's kind knowing at me

356
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,930
where I used to drink booze,
like my late night snack now is,

357
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,030
is heirloom tomatoes.

358
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,340
I just cut a few of them up and I
actually fucking look forward to it.

359
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,080
I like drinking smoothies in the morning.

360
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:23,590
I fucking loved that for
breakfast with Kale and spinach,

361
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:27,220
bananas and fucking Chia
seeds and all of that shit.

362
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,260
But every fucking once in awhile,

363
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,493
you know.

364
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,610
Well, every buy once in a while,
I've kind of mean like every night.

365
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:41,590
This week I just feel like,
just like fuck, you know,

366
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,710
so I don't know. What do you do
about that? You know, I just go,

367
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,570
I'm just not gonna do it right now.
I'll go do a fucking podcast.

368
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,630
Um,
I dunno.

369
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,490
I don't know what the fuck that means.
Probably means I have issues. Right.

370
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,230
It's weird because I
haven't eaten any fucking,

371
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,960
I haven't eaten any fucking ice cream
cookies, any of that fucking shit.

372
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:12,410
And I'm not thinking
about any of that at all.

373
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,300
But booze is the one that always, it
always comes back knocking, you know,

374
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,980
like didn't Elizabeth,
Elizabeth Taylor, Mary,

375
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:26,170
like the same guy like twice or you
always hear these fuck one I one with the

376
00:23:26,171 --> 00:23:30,340
fucking record is for that.
Most Times two people got married.

377
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,970
Most Times two people

378
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,370
got remarried. What's going
on in the world by the way
of what happened this week?

379
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,130
Tennessee couple gets married a record,
110, nine times. Go Fuck Yourself.

380
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:47,420
I didn't want to hear that.
That's bullshit.

381
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:53,290
World records from marriages and divorces
after knocking for 21 how many people

382
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:54,890
in America get remarried?

383
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,940
She got title one swimming
tied the knot 23 fucking times.

384
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:03,590
Yeah.

385
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,700
Jesus Christ. Talk about a codependent
psychopathic. He can't fucking be alone.

386
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,530
Grandmother is most married woman
after tying the knot 23 times.

387
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,860
Cheese can imagine the fucking check
she was collected. Well, actually no,

388
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:19,130
that's not true, right? Because once
you're married, the next person,

389
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,540
Jesus Christ, how? How easy would
it be to fucking divorce her?

390
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,630
I'll make payments for eight months.
She'll fucking find somebody else.

391
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,750
Get married again.
American grandmother,

392
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,950
Linda Wolf has become the most
married woman in the world.

393
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:38,850
I'm surprised she's not a great
grandmother. All that cock going into her,

394
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:39,420
Huh?

395
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,130
After walking down the aisle 23 times
and is now on the lookout for number 24

396
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,200
Mrs. Wolf 68

397
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,260
is included in the Guinness Book of World
Records for the dubious honor of being

398
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:54,230
wed more times than anyone else.
Alive chew.

399
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,110
She must be the first time you're like,
hey, could you not put your shoes here?

400
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,370
I, you know what? Go Fuck Yourself.

401
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,993
Okay.

402
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,293
Linda,

403
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:11,060
she has said she's addicted to romance
to the romance of getting married.

404
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,180
Oh, she likes it. In the
beginning, born Linda Lou Taylor,

405
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:19,720
the American or the American first
married in 1957 at the age six,

406
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,610
eight to a 31 year old
called George Scott,

407
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,930
former first baseman of the
Boston red sox. I'm the union.

408
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:29,400
Lasted for seven years,

409
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:33,360
the longest and happiest if any
of her marriages since then,

410
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,240
things have tended to go
downhill. Oh, that's funny.

411
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:43,010
She got divorced at 23 for the first
time and she went on to marry 23 times.

412
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,980
Um, over the subsequent decades,
she'd married a one eyed convict,

413
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,270
a preacher, a bar. Man, it
sounds like an Irish song.

414
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,290
They're green alligators
and a one eyed conduct.

415
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,880
A fucking preacher ran a bar
man and a plumber. Uh, and uh,

416
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:04,850
and musicians, plural. Ah, Jesus.

417
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,490
Two turned out to be homosexuals
to are homeless and one beat her.

418
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,160
I mean, that's pretty good, man. You only
got beaten. You get married 23 times.

419
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,860
You only get beat once a month.
It's pretty good.

420
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,720
You figured somebody got married 23 times.
They just had bad choices in men.

421
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,160
Another put a padlock on her fridge.
Oh,

422
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,130
there's a guy that's
called marrying for looks

423
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,620
getting fat.
They're hunting.

424
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:34,290
I swear to God you have another fucking
fescue and I'm putting a padlock on that

425
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,340
fucking fridge.

426
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,630
Yeah,

427
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:38,490
watch me.
Watch me.

428
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,490
And then he fucking does it and then she
has to go fuck yourself. I'm Outta here.

429
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,030
He's too controlling.
He was counting the level,

430
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,650
the amount of pop tarts
I was eating. Um, okay.

431
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,250
One marriage lasted just 36 hours
because the love just wasn't there.

432
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,320
But Linda from Indiana once
married the same man, Jack girly,

433
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:05,321
three times she's had seven children
by or different husbands and has been a

434
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,880
stepmother too many more.
Her last marriage a decade
ago was a publicity stunt.

435
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,930
It was to
Glenn Wolf,

436
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,270
who in taking Linda as his bride meant
he was the world's most married man at 29

437
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:23,540
times,
29 times on Jesus.

438
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:28,541
He died a year later at 88 I bet God's
first fucking statement to him was,

439
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:32,820
what the fuck are you? Fuck
are you doing? What was that?

440
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,770
You are an asshole

441
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,570
after 17 times. Did you really think the
last 12 times are going to be different?

442
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,710
You fucking moron.

443
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:44,623
Okay,

444
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,280
no sense sending you to hell,
buddy. You've already been
there. Come on in. Alright,

445
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,260
consequentially,
consequently she said she was,

446
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:55,580
that she was on the lookout
for number 24 she told the son,

447
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:59,240
it's been years since I walked
down the aisle. I miss it.

448
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,480
Yeah.

449
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,370
Jesus Christ.
She's like fucking,

450
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:04,410
she's like an athlete that
doesn't know how to retire.

451
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,710
The serial bride who now
lives in a retirement home,

452
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,400
said she had never cheated on her husband.
You didn't have fucking time to.

453
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,250
She said if she had her life over again,

454
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:17,220
she would never ever marry so many men.

455
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,970
Well, let it ended. Kind of
sad. Right? So of course,

456
00:28:21,971 --> 00:28:23,710
this is all of these clickbait sites.

457
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,840
What should every architect
demand from a cloud,

458
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,570
the most dangerous species alive?

459
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,860
Donald Trump and his younger days.

460
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,100
This mom never fed or daughter carbs.

461
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,770
Which one did you guys want here?
This is like jeopardy for dumb people.

462
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,270
Volkswagen CC tests.
Wild old age.

463
00:28:48,271 --> 00:28:52,390
Stop US seeing.
Oh wild will.

464
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,160
My eyes are going here. We'll old
age. Stop us seeing our grandkids.

465
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,560
60 candid photos from the past.
A coolest new cars.

466
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,600
Final moments they never expected.
I got to go with that.

467
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,390
Oh, clickbait. Here we go. This is news.

468
00:29:11,391 --> 00:29:16,250
This is a new segment is a new
segment called clickbait. All right.

469
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:21,251
This is the last known picture of the
RMS RMS titanic on the surface of the

470
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:23,630
ocean.
Yeah,

471
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:28,160
cause we found the fucker was taken
during her maiden voyage at crosshaven

472
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,053
Ireland

473
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,430
just after the vessel departed Queenstown
where it stopped before heading

474
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:36,900
westward towards New York.

475
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:42,290
Three days after this photo was taking
1,514 people would be dead and the

476
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:46,600
titanic would be titanic would be at
the bottom of the North Atlantic after

477
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:51,130
colliding with an iceberg and one of the
deadliest peacetime maritime disasters

478
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,563
in history.

479
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,580
How the fuck did you hit
one of those goddamn things?

480
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,450
I guess it was nighttime guy didn't
have the lights on. You know,

481
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:05,440
sometimes you're driving down the street.
You had no idea. Okay, next page. Okay.

482
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:07,600
And they got three advertising.
It's in there.

483
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,470
Fur Jacket. Fucking microchip.
Alright. Andrew Mccauley, 2007 well,

484
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:18,260
this doesn't look good. This is the
last known photo of animal calling

485
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,970
Australians Sea Kayaker who
is now presumed dead Mccauley
attempted to Kayak 994

486
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:30,560
miles across the Tasman sea in February,

487
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,010
2007 was never found. And how the
fuck did they get that picture?

488
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,320
Is that between, uh, where's the Tasman?

489
00:30:40,321 --> 00:30:42,560
Is that between Tasmania in Australia?

490
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,170
Fuck all the Australians direction.
Like I'm dumb right now. Okay.

491
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:48,970
You're at the bottom of the fucking world.
I don't know.

492
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:50,020
I don't know what goes on down there.

493
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,490
Tez Man. See maybe, I guess
correctly the Tasman Sea.

494
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,370
The Tasman Sea.

495
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:01,760
Yeah.

496
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
Oh, was he trying to get all
the way over to New Zealand?

497
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,250
Jesus Christ in a fucking boat
that's like designed to tip over.

498
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,490
Yeah, I mean, you know.
Okay. All right. Well,

499
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:15,460
he definitely was trying to
protect his skin. All right.

500
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,370
Freddie Mercury 1991 oh Jesus.

501
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,830
Looks like an old peewee Herman. Freddie
Mercury was the lead singer of Queens.

502
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:26,590
He died of complications of AIDS,
really a related to AIDS.

503
00:31:26,591 --> 00:31:30,220
He was key confirmed the day before he
died that he had contracted the disease.

504
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:35,030
This is the last known photo. All right.
Why the fuck would I want to see that?

505
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,550
That's arguably the greatest
front man of all time, Amelia.

506
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,233
Okay.

507
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:45,310
45 days before she embarked on our
infamous flight that would render her both

508
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:50,311
missing and eternally famous Amelia
Earhart pose for a photo shoot here.

509
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:55,861
She seen standing in front of the model
10 electra that would carry her to her

510
00:31:56,411 --> 00:31:57,820
mysterious destiny.

511
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,170
Korean Airlines flight triple o seven 1983

513
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:15,120
airspace out. Jesus Christ. This is just
getting worse. The Ara, San Watteau.

514
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:20,190
This will be a bunch of people taking
selfies on bridges. Steve Irwin,

515
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:21,210
another Australian.

516
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:22,560
Yeah,

517
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,080
the USS Maine.
1898

518
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:26,580
okay.

519
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,890
What did it fucking
collide with Paul Revere.

520
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,130
This is the wreckage of the
American battleship Maine,

521
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:35,490
which was destroyed along with 260
members of the blah, blah, blah,

522
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,030
likely by a mine.
They had minds even back then,

523
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,250
fucking lit lit a bale of Hay on fire,

524
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:48,360
sent it out there and take out a
wooden ship. Right? All right. Uh,

525
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:52,860
this is too creepy. Let's
lighten it up with, uh,

526
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,470
last selfies

527
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,910
before death. Half of
these are fake, by the way.

528
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:04,400
Yeah,

529
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,560
yeah. There you go. 19 selfies
taken moments before disaster.

530
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:09,840
There's one with the
fucking shark coming up.

531
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,140
10 selfies. Those, yeah. These are all
fucking bullshit. I like these things.

532
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,700
I want images.
I'll come on.

533
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,480
Couple people up on
climbing up on buildings.

534
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,150
Oh. Then there's the two beautiful
girls in the fucking car. Oh, Jesus.

535
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,600
There's a lot of them up. These fucking
kids that like the free climbers,

536
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:39,250
they climb up the top of buildings.

537
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,350
There's a lot of bullshit ones.

538
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,550
That guy's in pools with bad
pictures of great white sharks.

539
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,380
All right. What am I doing here?
Talking a lot about death here. Huh?

540
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,290
Um, anyways, let's get
back. Let's talk about, uh,

541
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:04,190
I don't know what the fuck else to talk
about if I'd done a fucking half hour at

542
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:08,930
this point. You know, I think every once
in a while you should have, oh shit.

543
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:12,650
34 minutes,
34 minutes of,

544
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:16,660
I don't know what the fuck
that was. Sorry guys. I had to,

545
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,370
I had to get this thing done because I've
got all this other bullshit I have to

546
00:34:19,371 --> 00:34:21,800
end up doing tomorrow.
Do you know I,

547
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,640
I would like to think that
the woman getting married
nine Zillion fucking times.

548
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:29,810
Maybe there was a little bit of humor
in there. I have no idea. I'm sorry.

549
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,740
Did the fucking news. Nowadays, it's
just too goddamn depressing and I just,

550
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:38,060
I don't know how you guys do it.
How do you stay informed? Oh,

551
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:40,550
congratulations to Dean del Rey.
Everybody who got his first,

552
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:45,380
first Conan O'brien went over there
for the taping. He fucking killed it.

553
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,000
It was Burke. It was Mark Marin
who fucking ripped on guitar.

554
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,500
He got to find that clip after
he killed it on the couch.

555
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,010
He then went over and Jan with the band
and fucking play guitar at a whole other

556
00:34:57,561 --> 00:35:01,880
level. Um, then Bert Kreischer killed it.

557
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,100
And then Dean del Ray was fucking
unbelievable. A former officer,

558
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:11,960
Roy Oliver sentenced to 15 years in
fatal shooting of teen. Holy Shit.

559
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,870
A cop went to jail. You don't
see that often, do you? Okay.

560
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,090
Code of silence. The Blue Code. All right.

561
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:24,360
What happened to your former Texas
police officer role in, in Texas?

562
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,530
Roy Oliver was sentenced to 15 years in
prison on Wednesday for the Burger of

563
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,070
murder of a 15 year old boy who was
shot while riding in a car full of teens

564
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:34,330
leaving a house party.
Uh,

565
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,310
all Oliver 38 was convicted on Tuesday
in the fatal of the high school. Fresh

566
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:43,020
freshmen, Jordan Edwards. All
right, hang on one second.

567
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,680
Let me see something.
Jordan Edwards,

568
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,760
teen shot.
Oh,

569
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,000
hey.
I thought it was going to be a white kid.

570
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,570
So they actually sent a cop to jail
for fucking killing a black kid.

571
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,010
Although you go miracles never cease. Not
shitting on the cops. I'm just saying,

572
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:06,090
you know, there's bad comedians.
There's bad cops, you know. Um,

573
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,630
anyways, I love Jesus. They
probably just got myself,

574
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:12,060
I should probably just got myself a ticket
right then and there. I swear to God,

575
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:13,230
I'll tell you right now,

576
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:18,720
that bald record motherfucker drives a
half fucking mile over the speed limit in

577
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:19,650
my county.

578
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:26,540
How dare you suggest that, uh,
even know human beings are flawed.

579
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,480
That may be some of them
are in my own profession.

580
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:34,160
Why am I picking on southern people there?
I don't know cause I'm limited.

581
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,760
Um, all right, I'm going to
read some advertising here.
Whenever the fuck I get it.

582
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,380
I'll probably read it tomorrow morning.
Um,

583
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,970
if I leave here tomorrow,
you,

584
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,581
um,
that's another thing too.

585
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:51,750
I watch all these old shows on me TV
and everybody's drinking and smoking and

586
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,290
then I'm watching this whole thing on
Leonard Skinner and everybody's drinking

587
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:58,500
smoke or do it. Oh, this fucking shit.

588
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,300
And uh, yeah, it starts giving you ideas.

589
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:07,940
Maybe if I got to start watching a
workout shows, maybe I should do that.

590
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,730
Are their workouts shows whatever
happened in the biggest loser? You know,

591
00:37:10,731 --> 00:37:14,420
what happened is the fucking guy on there
had a goddamn heart attack figure that

592
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:18,490
one out. And the other woman, I don't
know where she went, she broke off.

593
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:21,730
She went solo and she started
doing her own exercise videos,

594
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:23,350
if I remember correctly.
All right,

595
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:25,570
I'm going to read some
advertising here for Y'all.

596
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,110
Just going to read a couple advertisements
here for y'all and then I'm gonna, uh,

597
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,200

Thursday afternoon podcast
from, I dunno, some fucking,

599
00:37:37,871 --> 00:37:41,860
I dunno when earlier this year,
maybe last year, two years ago.

600
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:46,760

604
00:37:55,511 --> 00:38:00,170

agreements and a,

605
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,520
um, some f is for family shit.
I got all his shit coming up.

606
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,640
I know when it's coming out.
The ink isn't dry yet,

607
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,170
so I can't fucking announce it.

608
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,480
I really want to tell you when
f is for families coming out,

609
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:15,100
but I'm not allowed to do so yet. I would
like to, uh, tell you about some, uh,

610
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:17,830
other shit we got going on, but
I'm not allowed to. All right,

You can get out. You can get on.

614
00:38:31,921 --> 00:38:35,980
I'll just sit here. Uh, only
a couch from hell is a right

615
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,820
or a passage. I, he too
expensive. Too heavy,

616
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:44,380
too cheap to warn. I'm going to get out.
So don't dive without the frog and AC. Oh,

617
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,480

621
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,340
slapped and fucked on the thing.

622
00:39:00,341 --> 00:39:03,160
But then after he had a bowl of
cereal on it somehow. What was yours?

00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:45,300
[inaudible]
balls.

733
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:50,170
We ended up watching something on TV,
one of the sickest stories ever.

734
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:52,340
And we're like, dude, this
has to be a fucking movie.

735
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:56,570
The mega star who was Benjamin
button than muddy balls.

736
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,390
Billy Bean is now interested in
playing none other than Jimmy Keane.

737
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,090
And uh, of course in the end they, they,

738
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:07,820
they said that they were turned into a
movie was basically about this guy, right?

739
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,390
It was this fucking show
about serial killers.

740
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,450
So of course we're going to watch it.
In 1983,

741
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,530
Jesse was a high school sophomore
devoted to home and family.

742
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,650
Jessia was really very much of a homebody.

743
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,970
So one bike right up the road
and back she was done. Um,

744
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,830
so we're watching this thing about
fucking serial killers and the whole time

745
00:47:29,831 --> 00:47:32,720
they're talking about this,
this drug dealer kid and well,

746
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:36,040
I kind of fucked is this. And they
keep showing this serial killer guy.

747
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:40,360
It's like does in the show
in the drug dealer, older,

748
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,130
you know, and not in jail and all that
shit going, what the fuck happened?

749
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,360
You know, just the way they
put it together, you was
you ribbon and you're like,

750
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:50,350
what the fuck is going on here?

751
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:55,300
So basically what happened was there
was this kid, right? He played football,

752
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,840
they called them the assassin
because every game he ever played,

753
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:01,690
he took somebody out,
right? Was it the assassin?

754
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,920
I heard they called you the assassin
in football. That was a good thing.

755
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:06,754
I take it.
Yes.

756
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:11,940
Was that Jack Tatum? Check
Tatum. Now I forget what it was.

757
00:48:11,941 --> 00:48:14,850
Something like assassin.
So

758
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:21,300
he fucking, uh, interests movie
star good looks all right.

759
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:26,280
And he's The star of the football
team. All the women loved him. I mean,

760
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,670
this guy was just like,
it was,

761
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,280
he looked like a movie star
in his life was a movie.

762
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,110
So his big Achilles heel was,

763
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:38,310
he didn't have money and he wanted
to keep up with the rich kids.

764
00:48:38,311 --> 00:48:42,810
So we started dealing drugs and he ended
up being really good at it and by the

765
00:48:42,811 --> 00:48:44,640
time he was like 20 years old,

766
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,180
this fucking guy was making
like $1 million a year

767
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,330
expanded to cocaine and
at the tender age of 17,

768
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,910
he moved to Chicago where the
business and profits exploded.

769
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,260
He was now a big fish in a bigger pond,
Lake Michigan to be exact.

770
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,560
He was his own in crowd fast cars,

771
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,350
faster women and souped up living

772
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,900
all the hot spots, all the big nightclubs,
all the owners I was in tight with.

773
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,530
Um, I would come in there and have carte
blanche in every place that I went to.

774
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,360
Where you're feeling invincible.
Yeah,

775
00:49:18,361 --> 00:49:21,390
there was a certain point where I would
say there was an invincible feeling.

776
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:27,160
It almost seemed like this American greed
type story as opposed to this serial

777
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:30,790
killer thing and they keep going back
to this serial killer fucking piece of

778
00:49:30,791 --> 00:49:33,430
shit. Who's killing these
girls? These teenage girls.

779
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:38,170
So long story short, he's laying in
bed one night and he's just thinking,

780
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:41,320
I got to get out of this life.
I'm so sick of looking over my shoulder,

781
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:44,110
I can't do this anymore.
How am I going to get out of his?

782
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:45,280
But he's addicted to the money.

783
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:47,470
He's addicted to the life and
all of that type of stuff.

784
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:51,070
And he has this rattling on the
door and I'm thinking, oh fuck,

785
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,180
it's the serial killer.
And he obviously fought the guy in one.

786
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:58,130
What the fuck happens, right?
All of a sudden the door fucking

787
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,930
boom, the whole door blew off the
hinges and come flying into the house.

788
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:04,810
And all of these DEA,

789
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,310
FBI and locals all came in and
single file line with their law.

790
00:50:08,311 --> 00:50:09,370
Automatic weapons.

791
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,110
Yeah. Was that alcohol? Tobacco farming?
I don't know. What the fuck are you?

792
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:17,210
So anyways, they fucking come from
FDA food, Drug Administration,

793
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:21,860
the uh, transit Chicago Transit
Authority. I don't what the fuck it is.

794
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:23,120
Whatever the fuck that thing is.

795
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:27,020
They come fucking blast
and through the door run,

796
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,120
you know a bunch of guys with the fucking
minor helmets on with the fucking Uzis

797
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,600
from a Steven Seagal movie.

798
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,350
Don't get on a graph. You fucking look
at me. I'll blow your fucking head off.

799
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,590
And the whole thing was over and
he just scraped his family name.

800
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,790
Did your pop know what you're doing?
Do they suspect?

801
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:46,330
He didn't suspect it until much,
much later.

802
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,780
Jimmy grew up in the shadow of his father,
big gym,

803
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,040
a giant of a man who was a cop,
fireman and hero to his son.

804
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,120
He's my best friend. He was my backbone
and pretty much everything I did.

805
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,730
And they never said it,

806
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:03,000
but I imagine they probably took his
fucking pictures down off of the high

807
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:06,120
school and all of that type of shit,
you know, did some Oj Shit, right?

808
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,880
Take all his trophies and all that
fucking shit. So it's over. Right?

809
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:12,980
So then he's sitting in jail,
um,

810
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:17,310
and they tried to get him
to flip and this is kids,

811
00:51:17,311 --> 00:51:21,570
just some fucking kid from the suburbs,
right? So I'm thinking, well, he's out.

812
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,950
He must've ratted somebody out
so he doesn't rat anybody out.

813
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,400
He's like, I'm not telling on anybody.
So then they're like, all right,

814
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,150
well fuck you. So now we're going to help
us out. We're going to fucking give you,

815
00:51:33,151 --> 00:51:36,870
you know, the full extent of the
law, we're going to prosecute you.

816
00:51:36,871 --> 00:51:40,830
So they gave him 10 years.
The guy gets 10 years

817
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,680
and in court, Beaumont
showed keen, no mercy,

818
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:48,420
he was coming at you on all fours. I
wasn't like, Oh God, here. I mean he was,

819
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:52,750
he was a bulldog. Jimmy was convicted
and slapped it with a 10 year sentence.

820
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:55,300
He's in like a minimum
security cause you know,

821
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:58,320
he didn't really have any
violent past or anything.

822
00:51:58,321 --> 00:52:01,050
He was just getting people addicted
to drugs. That's all he was doing.

823
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:08,270
So his dad is devastated and all
that shit and he goes to jail.

824
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,300
And um, meanwhile this serial killer
guys out there killing these girls.

825
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,450
So I'm thinking, what the fuck? Wait.

826
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:16,410
And they keep going and commercial mean
versus you're looking at each other

827
00:52:16,411 --> 00:52:18,840
going, how the fuck are they going
to tie this fucking thing together?

828
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:24,330
But baseball kid comes with bad
in six balls. Assembly required,

829
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:25,523
new from Ohio are.

830
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,920
Long Story Short, um, they ended
up catching the serial killer guy.

831
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,780
Uh,
I forget how we fucked up,

832
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:35,900
but they ended up catching him in one
of those things where you seem like

833
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:39,200
relieved and all of that type of shit.
And a,

834
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:42,230
but he had this thing where he
wouldn't admit to all of them.

835
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,230
And if he came at him, he would
just clam up. It wouldn't say shit.

836
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,250
He denied confessing the any killing,
including Jessie's and Trisha's.

837
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,563
What's more,

838
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:56,040
he claimed it was all a misunderstanding
about disturbing dreams he had.

839
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,120
So he ends up going to jail for like
either one or two murders for life.

840
00:53:00,121 --> 00:53:01,560
He's never fucking getting out.

841
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:05,460
So meanwhile there's all these parents
whose daughters were killed by this guy

842
00:53:05,461 --> 00:53:08,190
and they don't know where they are
and all they just want as the body,

843
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,330
they want fucking closure.

844
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:12,540
And these parents had just tortured
by this fucking thing. All right,

845
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,990
so they're trying to figure out,
because he won't talk to them,

846
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:19,470
you won't tell him anything. And he's
also in denial and he keeps going like,

847
00:53:19,471 --> 00:53:21,570
actually I didn't kill him
and blah blah blah blah blah.

848
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:24,270
And then one day and be like,
oh I did and I blacked out.

849
00:53:24,271 --> 00:53:27,780
I don't remember like the was, he's
a fucking creepy goddamn mess. Right.

850
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,770
So they ended up coming up with this idea
that they need a charismatic person to

851
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:39,720
talk to this to prefer friend.
This syrah killer gained the guys trust.

852
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:42,390
And maybe he'll tell him where like
the bodies are in that type of shit.

853
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:45,360
So they go to this fucking dude,
Captain America,

854
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,730
you know the football player,

855
00:53:47,731 --> 00:53:51,930
the movie star looking guy who fucked his
whole life up cause he got involved in

856
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:53,250
drugs.
Right.

857
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:58,590
And they approach him to go from his
minimum security to go into a maximum

858
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:02,520
security prison with his murderers,
rapists, animals, fucking maniac.

859
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:07,460
That's right. And um, you know,
to go in there and they said,

860
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:09,140
if you,
if you get this information out,

861
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:12,110
we'll take your sentence
and we'll just wipe out.

862
00:54:12,111 --> 00:54:14,810
The rest of it will set you free. He'd
already done like three, four years.

863
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,760
And he came up with an outside
the box game to get hall,

864
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:24,860
which would risk the life of that
charismatic convict via just put away for

865
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:27,680
dealing drugs.
Jimmy Kim,

866
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,340
what happens when I've gotta deal with
all these crazy killers and stuff?

867
00:54:31,341 --> 00:54:33,860
You know what if I get shanked,
what if I get killed? I mean,

868
00:54:33,861 --> 00:54:35,780
am I gonna survive this?
So

869
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:40,730
meanwhile, Captain America's Dad
had a series of strokes, you know,

870
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:45,110
and was basically gonna die and
he had to go see him. I mean,

871
00:54:45,111 --> 00:54:48,620
it's like a fucking movie. So he goes,
all right, fuck it. I'll, I'll do it.

872
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,580
We cried through the window to each
other and we talked for awhile and uh,

873
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:55,740
he didn't even know about the offer.
Nobody know about it.

874
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,920
Jimmy now realize Betty had a one time
only opportunity to fix the mess he made

875
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:04,950
for himself and get out while
his dad was still alive.

876
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:08,240
But I want it in writing
it. You're definitely going
to let me go. So they say,

877
00:55:08,241 --> 00:55:12,170
yeah. So they go out, right?
Egos. They go, here's the deal.

878
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,590
We don't want you to approach
him for at least six months

879
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:20,780
because he's very cagey in if she fucking,
you know, come at to guy the wrong way,

880
00:55:20,781 --> 00:55:24,800
he just fucking walls himself
off and that's it. All right,

881
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:28,010
so this kid comes walking, he
goes in, he goes, fine, cool.

882
00:55:28,011 --> 00:55:30,800
And he walks in and he's like, I don't
have six months. My Dad's gonna die.

883
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,200
All he wanted was to get in and out
with Trisha's location and as fast as

884
00:55:36,201 --> 00:55:37,034
possible

885
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,520
within the first two
months, two, I'm sorry,

886
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:44,440
first two hours he goes into
the fucking jail. Any fucking,

887
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:47,860
uh, on purpose, accidentally
bumps into the guy.

888
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,700
I was waiting with my tray and
I look over and there he is, 20,

889
00:55:51,701 --> 00:55:54,220
25 feet away from me sitting
there all by himself.

890
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:59,310
It felt like a magnet was compelling
me to come to him and finally act bump

891
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,820
shoulders with them on purpose.

892
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,050
And then he immediately apologizes.
He goes, I'm sorry about that buddy.

893
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,150
I didn't see a standing there.
Hey, he goes, I'm new here.

894
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:10,500
Do you know where the library is? And
the guy tells him where the library is.

895
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:14,390
And he goes, thanks man. Uh, you know,
and he said something to the effect of a,

896
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:17,310
yeah, you're a good guy and gives him a
little slap on the shoulder. That's it.

897
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,300
It goes to the fucking library.
And they set it up where his fucking,

898
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,720
his cell was right across
the hall from the other guy.

899
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,180
And he says to him, he goes, hey man,
he runs into him again. Hey, wait,

900
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,980
you stay and blah blah. He
goes, oh, that's crazy man.
You want him running across?

901
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:34,660
And he said, it's good to be with a
good guy like you, blah, blah, blah,

902
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:39,040
right across from each
other. And he goes, uh,

903
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:42,850
so then fucking the serial
killer guy one day he goes, hey,

904
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:44,890
you want to get lunch
with me and my friends?

905
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,760
And at this point me and [inaudible]
were fucking laughing our balls off going

906
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:51,970
like this kind of social
shit happens in prison. Okay,

907
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,580
y'all are some friends of mine,
uh,

908
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,100
going to have some other murderers and
serial killers. We're going to get some,

909
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:02,320
uh, maybe get some, but you know,
frapin a fucking rap or something.

910
00:57:02,321 --> 00:57:07,050
You want to come down, just kinda hang
out, I'll meet you down the coma, Sarah.

911
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,640
You always think it's all just getting
shanked and trying not to get raped.

912
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:14,320
Right. So he goes, yeah, cool.
So long story, he gains this
guy's fucking confidence.

913
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,880
And one time he actually
goes in and he sees the guy,

914
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,480
he's got a map with all these
red dots on it and all that shit.

915
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:21,340
And as I came up from behind him,

916
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,550
he had all these little
different statues lined up,

917
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,230
10 15 of them maybe. And I couldn't
tell what they were at first.

918
00:57:29,231 --> 00:57:30,250
And as I got closer,

919
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:34,480
I noticed he had a big map laid out
and he dove on that map and folded that

920
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:37,780
thing up really fast and slid it off
to the side of the table. And I go,

921
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:41,000
what are these things? Anyway, he
says, there are these little falcons,

922
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,860
he's trying to get to it and blah,
blah blah.

923
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,250
So the guy starts opening up any
finally ends up telling him this fucking

924
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:50,990
stories, um, of all the women that
he killed and all of that shit.

925
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,940
And,
uh,

926
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:59,030
in sort of kind of mentioned it gave him
like sort of enough information about

927
00:57:59,031 --> 00:58:04,031
where the bodies were and the captain
America guy kind of fucked up because once

928
00:58:04,971 --> 00:58:09,320
he got the information he thought he
had enough information to find all the

929
00:58:09,321 --> 00:58:13,060
bodies and get himself out of prison
and he just couldn't have, oh wait,

930
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:17,540
I forgot the best part. I'm sorry.
It's gonna be like a Terantin a movie.

931
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:18,680
Now we're going to jump backwards.

932
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:22,490
Another way he gained the guy's confidence
was one day they was sitting in the

933
00:58:22,491 --> 00:58:24,590
TV room watching TV.

934
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:30,430
He sit next to this guy and this big
fucking giant dude just gets up and turns

935
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:34,430
the channel
without talking to anybody.

936
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:38,120
And as he turns to channel the serial
killer who was unlike a meek little guy

937
00:58:38,990 --> 00:58:43,130
and he just kind of went, he just sorta
said out loud to nobody who's like, Hey,

938
00:58:43,131 --> 00:58:44,300
I was watching that.

939
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,370
That's not right.
I was watching that

940
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:51,460
like powerlessly really
fucking weird psycho thing.

941
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:56,500
And the fucking captain America Dude
walked up to the big dude and knocked him

942
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:59,200
out.
Just beat the guy's ass,

943
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:03,040
hit him with an upper cut fucking forearm
shiver and just sent this guy flying

944
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:07,420
through some chairs and then they stuck
them in the hall. That's what happened.

945
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:09,700
And then when he fucking comes out,
tell me he doesn't sound like a fuck.

946
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:13,420
I almost don't even believe it. So that's
when he gained the guy's conference.

947
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:17,830
That's when the dude told him and
his second, he tells him this dude,

948
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,620
Captain America couldn't hold it in
anymore. And he goes to, do you know what?

949
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:24,690
You're a sick fucking piece of shit,
Blah Blah Blah. And flipped out on him

950
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,580
full of yourself then. Yeah, I did that.

951
00:59:27,581 --> 00:59:31,000
I thought it was good for me to unload
on him and tell him what I really thought

952
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:33,820
of him and who he really
was. I said, you know,

953
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:38,020
so I'm gonna be going home tomorrow
there. I said, you're a crazy killer.

954
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:40,750
And I started calling them
everything you can think of.

955
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,970
And then the guy, the CEO kill just backed
up and he goes, he goes, who sent you?

956
00:59:44,971 --> 00:59:47,580
And he goes, so and so sent you
writing any named the prosecutor.

957
00:59:47,581 --> 00:59:50,670
And then he just fucking disappeared
and the map disappeared too.

958
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:55,590
So then it's like they didn't get the map.
So there was a thing,

959
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:58,380
we don't know where the fucking bodies
still are, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

960
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,750
But you got him to admit
to these fucking murderers.

961
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,740
So we know that the women are least dead.
The blobby basically.

962
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,960
Then he did enough where he got out.
Um,

963
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:12,450
and the whole time we were watching this
fucking thing, we would just go on like,

964
01:00:12,451 --> 01:00:13,890
this is a,
this is a fucking movie.

965
01:00:13,891 --> 01:00:15,930
And I guarantee you when
they do the fucking movie,

966
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:19,710
they don't even need to add any mustard
to it. But I guarantee you in the movie,

967
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,410
he won't flip out in the end, you know,
or free flips out. But then he somehow,

968
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,870
and then that'll be the last
little leg kick up. Like, oh no,

969
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:30,500
they didn't find the map and the movie,
he'll find the map and then

970
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:33,830
parents will actually get closure
button. Real life, you know.

971
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,343
[inaudible]

972
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:58,530
do we change
this

973
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:05,030
going on? It's built bar and it's the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

974
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:10,880
uh, August 30th, 2010. I'll look at that.

975
01:01:10,881 --> 01:01:15,620
There's 31 days in August this year.
I didn't realize that. I thought, uh,

976
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:16,551
all the,
all the,

977
01:01:16,551 --> 01:01:19,430
the rent and everything like that
was going to be due on Tuesday,

978
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:23,270
but this year I think it's every,
every nine years.

979
01:01:23,271 --> 01:01:27,800
There's 31 days in August and you can
look that up to people. That's um, a,

980
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:31,820
you know, 40 days has
November, April, September,

981
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:36,821
and remember all the rest
got 28 [inaudible] so I don't
know what you're talking

982
01:01:37,071 --> 01:01:40,880
about. Isn't that how
it goes? Um, anyways.

983
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:46,310
Fuck is 29th. I'm recording
this. Tomorrow is August 30th.

984
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:50,070
And you're listening to it right
now on August 30th. All right.

985
01:01:50,071 --> 01:01:54,750
What happened to the thumber? Where
did it go? It's, it's over, man.

986
01:01:55,110 --> 01:01:58,080
I hope you enjoyed it. Didn't I tell
you guys do enjoy it back in May.

987
01:01:58,081 --> 01:02:02,520
Did you listen to me? You didn't digit.
You thought, ah, we got plenty of time.

988
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:06,640
There's plenty of fucking time. Then

legs go and Jesus Christ. Yeah.

991
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:16,640
Your farmer's Tan from all on the
fucking long. You didn't do shit.

992
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,330
I warned you. I told you in May was
going to fly by. And what'd you do?

993
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:27,330
Did you spend one night roasting
marshmallows as they say in Boston?

994
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:33,000
Um, I'm doing this on the 29th, so
it will be ready early on the 30th.

995
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,100
And also because, uh, this week, as of
right now, when you're listening to this,

996
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:40,110
I will be onset.
Isn't that exciting?

997
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:45,140
This whole week I'm shooting my
pilot for comedy central Monday,

998
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:47,820
Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday. And uh,

999
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:51,270
unless we make a horrific piece of
shit, um, according to the deal,

1000
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:55,120
it's definitely going to air. So
a, I better make sure that, uh,

1001
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:59,220
my acting game is where it needs to be.
Um,

1002
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,690
because we start shooting tomorrow.

1003
01:03:00,691 --> 01:03:04,800
I'm actually really excited about this
show and as always, I don't name names,

1004
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,020
so, uh, you know,

1005
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:10,560
you don't even need to know names because
if it's going to be worth anything,

1006
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:11,730
you're going to know who the fuck's in it.

1007
01:03:11,731 --> 01:03:16,710
But I think it's going to be great and
I'm really excited about it and maybe

1008
01:03:16,711 --> 01:03:21,030
this'll be the one that
actually gets me to be on TV.

1009
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:22,223
Right?

1010
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:26,580
Then all of a sudden it goes to a second
season and then you notice I'm getting

1011
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:28,800
a little bloated.
You know,

1012
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:32,550
I come to your town to do stand up and
I'm just not as sharp as I used to be

1013
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:33,480
when I was hungry,

1014
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,240
when I wanted to have a show and
all of a sudden you guys like,

1015
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:40,170
you know he's not as fun as he used to be.
I like the old Bill Burr,

1016
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,420
the pre TV show bill burr.

1017
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:47,040
Why is he wearing a bathrobe and
slippers on stage as he working out of

1018
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:51,840
character for his new hit show or did
he just roll out of fucking bed to come

1019
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:55,110
down here, drink a little scotch
and collect his fucking check?

1020
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:58,470
That's exactly what I'm going
to be doing. Okay. People,

1021
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,240
when I get on television, I, if I
get my own that this TV show goes,

1022
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:07,410
my standup is going to
go do fucking south.

1023
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,130
I'm telling you right now.
I never liked stand up.

1024
01:04:11,131 --> 01:04:14,400
It was all just a tool to get me.

1025
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,580
I'm fucking with you.
I'm Archie already paranoid about that.

1026
01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:25,230
I'm already sitting there and I'm
thinking in my head, typical me,

1027
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,530
typical east coast negative guy,

1028
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:32,490
just looking for the next shoe to
drop rather than being like, oh fuck,

1029
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:36,360
I can be on a hit TV show and uh,
you know,

1030
01:04:36,361 --> 01:04:39,510
my life could be awesome. I'm
already thinking, Oh fuck.

1031
01:04:39,511 --> 01:04:40,930
What's going to happen in my stand up?

1032
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:46,160
How can I work in guest spots during the
week so I can stay so I can stay sharp?

1033
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,990
You know, I don't trust these
fuckers. Yeah, it's a hit. Oh,

1034
01:04:51,991 --> 01:04:54,810
is it? Yeah. I, I'm believing you.

1035
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,790
You guys are fucking pulled that Charlie
Brown pull the football fucking thing

1036
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:03,330
or Lucy, whatever that costs
name is from the peanuts gang.

1037
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,870
Um, too many times. So I'm not buying it.

1038
01:05:07,410 --> 01:05:11,610
I won't buy it until it goes into
syndication. What's your show about?

1039
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:15,960
What is it? Is that, is that
a comedy? Is that a drama?

1040
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,710
It's on comedy central.

1041
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:22,930
Just you and anybody who has a Nielsen
box. Whenever the fuck it comes out,

1042
01:05:22,931 --> 01:05:23,770
please sit there.

1043
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,520
Find the oldest person on your
block cause God knows they have it.

1044
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:32,521
Whoever is the oldest person on your
block or whoever's the most indeed Jesus,

1045
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:33,890
they are old g,

1046
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:38,440
they're going to be the ones
who have the Nielsen box.

1047
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:42,820
Those are the people that
determine, I guess, you know why?

1048
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:47,290
Cause they actually have
time to write letters. Um,

1049
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,120
anyways,
so that's the deal.

1050
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:52,660
I'm shooting a show this week that is
going to air on comedy central at some

1051
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:56,740
point. And uh, speaking of
something, airing on comedy central,

1052
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:59,330
just to let you know, my
standup special, let it go,

1053
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:04,130
was finally airing September
18th on comedy central and die.

1054
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:05,500
I believe it's going to be uncut.

1055
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:11,380
Hopefully it'll show up late at night
when my crowd is just stumbling in from

1056
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:15,730
whatever fucking for the lab for the last
four hours of mistakes that they made

1057
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,130
on of night of drinking.
Okay.

1058
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:21,670
And after you have it out with your
significant other and she doesn't let you

1059
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:23,980
sleep in the room or whatever,

1060
01:06:23,981 --> 01:06:28,750
he doesn't let you whatever
sloppy mess you are, just go,

1061
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:30,550
you know,
sit down and you're fucking lazy boy.

1062
01:06:30,551 --> 01:06:33,670
And watch my special September
18th. All right, there we go.

1063
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,920
I got all the hype out of the way and um,

1064
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:40,660
I had a bunch of shit to
talk about this weekend. Um,

1065
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:46,810
I know the NFL season starts on Thursday
night because the NFL is basically,

1066
01:06:46,811 --> 01:06:51,520
I think slowly trying to be seven
days a week, which I am against.

1067
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:55,690
You know, I always thought it
was really unique how it just,

1068
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,720
it all happened on fucking Sunday and
everybody was just fucking getting geared

1069
01:07:00,791 --> 01:07:02,260
up at sea anticipation.

1070
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:07,920
Leave them wanting more classic show
business theory and the NFL had it like

1071
01:07:08,261 --> 01:07:11,980
nobody else and now they're talking
half, fuck, let's add more games.

1072
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:16,210
18 weeks schedule 18 games, right?
Is that what they were trying to do?

1073
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,570
They already got the bye week so
they got an extra fucking weekend.

1074
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:23,500
They're right for more advertising now
they're trying to add two more days.

1075
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:27,040
Now this shits, you got kicking
it off on a fucking Thursday.

1076
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:32,240
They're playing in Europe. You know, I
really sound like a crabby old man. Whoa.

1077
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:36,700
Don't worry. Priorities, Sean, Derek,
everybody gathered around a TV.

1078
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,500
Um, I liked it better that way. What
the fuck is wrong with Sunday? You know,

1079
01:07:41,501 --> 01:07:44,890
you go to church. Oh Gee, you and
then you fucking, you sit down,

1080
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:49,420
you get drunk and you watch the football
games. Nobody gets hurt. Show up Monday,

1081
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:53,600
all hung over. Go and do, what the
fuck did they run it for there?

1082
01:07:54,510 --> 01:07:57,220
Oh, they should have passed it.
That's what I would've done.

1083
01:07:58,540 --> 01:08:01,850
That's what I would've done
seeing is now that I know that,

1084
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:05,500
that they shouldn't have fucking
run it in that moment. So anyways,

1085
01:08:05,501 --> 01:08:08,200
I was trying to figure out
what the schedules were and um,

1086
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:11,710
I ended up going on to see
what the Patriots have.

1087
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:15,160
We got the Bengals the first
week with Batman and Robin.

1088
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:23,750
I'm really gay anyways. Uh, so
it's checking out the schedule.

1089
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:27,110
And one of the stories,
if you can fucking believe this,

1090
01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:28,940
the story is Tom Brady,

1091
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:34,270
how he can swing the Peyton manning
debate in 2010 and this is what it says,

1092
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:35,930
the Tom Brady,

1093
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:40,730
Peyton manning debate has raged for the
past decade and will probably continue

1094
01:08:40,731 --> 01:08:45,620
to do so until the to retire every
time one seems to make their case.

1095
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:49,430
The other offers a rebuttal the next year.
All right.

1096
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:53,810
All of that's fair enough. I'll even give
you that, but this is what they say, man.

1097
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:58,811
He made his case in 2009 by carrying his
team to a Superbowl birth with an MVP

1098
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:03,500
season.
That's what they said.

1099
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:09,220
Completely ignoring the fact that the
guy had the game in his fingertips.

1100
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:14,980
Just like Tom Brady has four
fucking Superbowls and Tom
Brady has delivered four

1101
01:09:15,681 --> 01:09:18,830
fucking times.
Giant fans shut the fuck up.

1102
01:09:19,250 --> 01:09:21,500
The last time he got the ball,
he drove.

1103
01:09:21,501 --> 01:09:23,540
Actually he got the ball
with like eight seconds left.

1104
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,930
You're going to be cuts and
call them that, you know,
and count them on that one.

1105
01:09:26,931 --> 01:09:30,920
But even when we lost to the giants,
when he had time to drive down the field,

1106
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,530
that's exactly what the fuck
he did for the go ahead.

1107
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:36,020
Score for the unprecedented for time,

1108
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:40,130
fourth time and the biggest fucking
game in professional football.

1109
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,060
He's done it for fucking times.
He's got three rings.

1110
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:49,490
Peyton manning has one fucking ring
and he had the Superbowl on his fucking

1111
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:52,610
fingertips. And not only does he
not drive them for a, for a fee,

1112
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:54,200
and I know I'm going through this again,

1113
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:57,200
but I have to because people
keep forgetting this shit he had,

1114
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:00,500
he had the game winning drive
right there to go. You go ahead,

1115
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:04,490
Peyton drive down the fucking field.
Not only does he not score that touchdown,

1116
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:06,350
not only do they anemic,
not get a field goal,

1117
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:10,340
he throws a pick fucking six to
lose the game for his fucking team.

1118
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,550
And somehow I want to
know where the debate is.

1119
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,050
Where is the debate?
Indianapolis Colts fans.

1120
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:22,250
Which would you rather
have as a quarterback?

1121
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:27,430
A guy who acts absolutely annihilates
the competition in the regular season.

1122
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:30,320
Okay.

1123
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:35,320
And can only get you one championship or
would you rather have the other guy who

1124
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:39,290
wins three out of four fucking bowls?
What would you rather have?

1125
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:42,980
You want three rings. You want
one? The debate is fucking over.

1126
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,660
There is no debate
as far as I'm concerned.

1127
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:51,740
Peyton manning is still chasing old
date rape there in fucking Pittsburgh

1128
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:55,610
because as much as you wouldn't want
that son of a bitch around your daughter,

1129
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:59,120
God dammit. You got to want
them under center. Right.

1130
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,670
This is bullshit that just,

1131
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:08,690
they just put this out here
to get people all pissed off.

1132
01:11:08,691 --> 01:11:12,800
Just like that mosque at Ground Zero
that had me pissed for 48 fucking hours

1133
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:15,660
before I found out.
It's not at ground zero.

1134
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,920
It's fucking two three blocks up
the street and it's not a mosque.

1135
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:24,600
It's like a fucking wreck. Rump.
All right. I don't give a fuck.

1136
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:28,140
You want to go in there and play
Ping Pong? It talk about Mohammed.

1137
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:32,850
I don't give a shit, but what did they say
it? It's a mosque. It's at ground zero.

1138
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,140
The building a brunch statute.
Who is some had been London.

1139
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:40,890
You should have seen me frothing at
the mouth, like a dog that had gone,

1140
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,510
Matt actually got into a fucking
debate about it with somebody you know,

1141
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,410
went out when I,
when I thought it was an actual mosque,

1142
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,450
when I thought it was
being built at ground zero,

1143
01:11:51,451 --> 01:11:55,470
like I was told they're building
a mosque at ground zero,

1144
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,560
you know, so I was like, you
gotta be fucking kidding me.

1145
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,200
Not only did they not rebuild the towers,

1146
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:05,640
not only their architects still acting
like they give a fuck when the reality is

1147
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,180
that they want the contract so they can
put their fucking name on the building.

1148
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,180
Not only is that bull shit
been going on for what,

1149
01:12:12,181 --> 01:12:14,820
nine fucking years now they're
going to put a mosque down there.

1150
01:12:14,821 --> 01:12:17,340
I was literally beside myself and uh,

1151
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:21,390
I was getting into tons of arguments out
here in Hollywood about it during the

1152
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:25,890
48 hours when I actually thought they
were building a mosque at ground zero. Um,

1153
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:30,930
and they fucking, you know,
these Douche bags out here,

1154
01:12:30,931 --> 01:12:35,280
they will usually do reteaching you
thinking like, I don't realize that.

1155
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,710
Like, I realize that it was not
the religion. I realized that Shit,

1156
01:12:40,711 --> 01:12:45,450
but you know, you know, how about, how
about just having a little bit of tact,

1157
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:49,380
you know, you know what I
mean? That's all I'm saying.

1158
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,790
That's all I'm saying. I know it's not
the fucking religion. Okay. But you know,

1159
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,950
look, look at my religion.
Look at the Jesus freaks.

1160
01:12:55,951 --> 01:12:59,010
Go out there and kill fucking
abortion doctors now with 18 of them,

1161
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:02,970
flew a fucking a, you know,
assessment into an abortion clinic.

1162
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:05,220
Fucking blew the God damn place up.

1163
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:08,610
And then the next day they wanted to put
a big bronze statue of Jesus across the

1164
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:10,380
street.
And people,

1165
01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:13,920
the sons and daughters of the abortion
doctors had a fucking problem with that.

1166
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:17,850
I will be like, yeah, you know, do we, do
we really have to put it there? I mean,

1167
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:20,610
it's not us, right? We didn't do it.
It's not the whole fucking religion,

1168
01:13:20,611 --> 01:13:24,900
but really all the fucking places you
could put a big bronze statues of fucking

1169
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:28,650
hey Seuss there. Oh, Jesus. Right?
We can't just fucking, you know,

1170
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:32,790
maybe go like quarter mile, half mile
up the fucking street. That's all.

1171
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,240
That's all I'm saying. Right?
That was my fucking argument.

1172
01:13:36,241 --> 01:13:39,320
And we were going back and forth and I
realized that's not even a Goddamn mosque

1173
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,270
. It's not at ground zero. Okay.
Three blocks up the street,

1174
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:45,870
the building like a lemonade
stand or some shit. And as always,

1175
01:13:45,871 --> 01:13:49,950
I didn't really quite fucking read
up on that part of it. But um,

1176
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:54,330
yeah, so whatever. So that's the
same thing with this Tom Brady,

1177
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:59,340
Peyton manning debate. There is no
fucking debate. This is ESPN guys,

1178
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:03,110
all these sports guys, they
have this nothing left to
fucking debate. So they did,

1179
01:14:03,111 --> 01:14:04,440
they learned that with that Yankees,

1180
01:14:04,441 --> 01:14:07,080
red sox keep pitting
them against each other.

1181
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:10,920
Even when everybody's kind of over it.
You know,

1182
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,290
it's like once the curse of the
babe was broken, it's fucking over.

1183
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:17,290
Who gives a fuck? Yes. We're
going to play each other. Yes.

1184
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:21,220
The Yankees will win it again. Oh look,
the red sox won it again too. It's over.

1185
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:25,150
And they keep trying to sell it to you.
And what are the greatest rivalries?

1186
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,920
No one gives a fuck. And by no one,
I mean I don't give a fuck anymore.

1187
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:34,240
Therefore, nobody gives a fuck in
this Tom Brady, Peyton manning debate,

1188
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,150
there is no fucking debate.

1189
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:42,640
Peyton manning cannot care. He can't
hold fucking Tom Brady's jockstrap.

1190
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,060
He can't
look.

1191
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:50,920
Anybody can kick the shit out of people
during the fucking regular season,

1192
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:55,360
but when it counts, when
it counts, what do you do?

1193
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:58,120
What do you do these stand out like a man.

1194
01:14:58,121 --> 01:15:02,140
I'll fucking relax like Joe Montana and
drive your team down the fucking field

1195
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:05,850
or do you get that little bitchy tone
in your fucking voice? Okay guys,

1196
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,330
how it's going to be on tour
and you get under center. Well,

1197
01:15:09,331 --> 01:15:13,840
whatever you do gotta beat. Marsha, got
to get closer than a quarter of an inch.

1198
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:18,220
Remember that one Greg Brady striving
that fucking caprice classic or whatever

1199
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:20,440
the fuck they had whipping
it around the parking lot,

1200
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,560
making fun of how broad can't drive.

1201
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:27,130
One of my favorite fucking
episodes of the Brady bond.

1202
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:32,131
My two favorite episodes was the first
half of that Brady Bunch episode when

1203
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,430
Greg Brady was bringing the fucking
hammered down and was going,

1204
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:39,520
let me tell you three fucking
stepsister bitches, something.

1205
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:41,350
None of you broads know how to drive.

1206
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:43,990
And that includes your mother
who I'm banging by the way,

1207
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:48,040
who are banking by the way.
All right.

1208
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:52,120
With their weird ass haircut,
whenever the fucked, you know,

1209
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,770
did anybody ever have that fucking
haircut at other than her? I mean,

1210
01:15:56,771 --> 01:15:59,440
that is like,
I don't know what it was.

1211
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:04,950
She took like Mo from the three stooges
haircut and then she put a fucking sort

1212
01:16:05,111 --> 01:16:09,130
of mullet that she did a little
flipped to on the back. Anyways,

1213
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,440
let's get back to you broads,
you know, not to fucking drive.

1214
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,810
That goes for you with the
fucking speech impediment.

1215
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,830
You don't know how to fucking drive
Jan with your awful fucking Hasidic Jew

1216
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:23,030
fucking curls. I don't know what you're
trying to do, you know, and, and,

1217
01:16:23,031 --> 01:16:24,100
and Marcia who,

1218
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:27,880
I don't know why I'm not banging you some
reason I skipped over you and started

1219
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:31,780
banging your mother, right? None
of you bitches can fucking drive.

1220
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,350
And I'm watching this episode going
this, see Greg Brady says, Shit,

1221
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:39,940
Greg [inaudible] Fuck Fonzie. You know,
with his stupid fucking, you know,

1222
01:16:39,941 --> 01:16:44,500
spinning around and punching a jukebox
so plays Shaboom Shaboom I don't give a

1223
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:48,120
fuck about that. I like
Greg Brady, you know,

1224
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:52,330
for as much as Fonzie was talking shit,
he was always nice to the ladies and he,

1225
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:56,490
that's, that's seventh grade game
with the woman Greg Brady. That's,

1226
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:59,860
that's how Greg ended up fucking their
mom because he didn't give a shit.

1227
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:06,220
He didn't give a fuck Greg. Fuck
you Carol. You're not my mother.

1228
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,320
You know how to drive either.
Oh my God.

1229
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:12,360
Took him in that fucking Groovy
Adic they had started blowing up

1230
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,380
twice here.
Got All curly.

1231
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:21,080
So anyways,
that episode,

1232
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,560
he's telling these fucking broads
that they don't know how to drive.

1233
01:17:24,561 --> 01:17:27,080
And then in the end of course,
cause they always have to cater to women,

1234
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:32,870
these nerdy fucking writers, you know,
and then the end they fucking, you know,

1235
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:38,330
Marsha goes around this stupid fucking
track and they had a cone with a little

1236
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:40,580
egg on it. You guys have seen
this and she fucking, you know,

1237
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:44,750
I forget whatever Marsha chokes in the
beginning and then in the end just to

1238
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:48,200
fucking even it out so everybody's happy
and they could sell tide during the

1239
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:52,370
commercials. They have Greg fuck
up and knock the egg off. That's,

1240
01:17:52,371 --> 01:17:53,750
that's what I was trying to get to.

1241
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,140
Wasn't that what I was trying to
get to that one on so fucking long.

1242
01:17:57,141 --> 01:17:59,690
I can't even remember.
All I'm saying is

1243
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:04,670
that the guy you want,
you don't,

1244
01:18:04,671 --> 01:18:08,060
it doesn't fucking matter
how many yards you throw

1245
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:14,160
in the regular season.
It doesn't fucking matter unless you're,

1246
01:18:14,161 --> 01:18:17,090
you got 'em on your fantasy fucking team,
whatever that means.

1247
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,650
Evidently that makes you sit up a little
bit straighter in your Ikea Office

1248
01:18:21,651 --> 01:18:25,430
chair on Monday. I don't know what the
fuck it means, but at the end of the day,

1249
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:30,140
how you judge a quarterback is in
those fucking moments. Okay. All right.

1250
01:18:30,141 --> 01:18:33,080
And I understand the Barry Sanders
out there played on the lines.

1251
01:18:33,081 --> 01:18:35,600
It's a horrific franchise.
I can't judge him like that.

1252
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,640
He never had the opportunity.
So I don't,

1253
01:18:37,641 --> 01:18:41,750
but when I see a guy like Peyton manning
who is had the opportunities and he has

1254
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:44,840
not delivered for them to sit
there and try to act like this,

1255
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:47,810
fucking debate is still going on.
It isn't.

1256
01:18:48,710 --> 01:18:52,850
There is no Peyton Manning, Tom Brady
debate Peyton. Manny has to redeem.

1257
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,460
He has to redeem himself.

1258
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,970
You don't think the players on his
team of fucking questioning them.

1259
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:02,390
This is the guy,
this is the guy leading us to battle.

1260
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,220
Who's great during bootcamp,

1261
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:09,950
who's great during the war games.
We play during fucking regular season,

1262
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:14,900
but when it really comes down to live
ammunition in the fucking playoffs,

1263
01:19:14,990 --> 01:19:19,990
this fucking guy's curling up in a Fox
hole blaming the fucking radar guy.

1264
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:24,770
We had communication issues.
Fuck you.

1265
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,370
There is no debate as far as I'm
concerned. You guys can chime in.

1266
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:33,920
You guys can chime in. Go ahead.
Indianapolis. Huh? With the ISTEP team.

1267
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:38,060
They're the fucking
Baltimore colts by the way.

1268
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:43,250
That would be great if it and started,
I said the Baltimore Colts. Um.

1269
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:46,550
Anyways. All right. I enjoyed that.
I'm sure a lot of other people didn't.

1270
01:19:46,610 --> 01:19:48,370
A lot of people probably
turn that off going. I'm,

1271
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,570
so let's take a hint talking
about Peyton manning. Well,

1272
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:54,560
I'm going to react to everything that
they write on the news and I guarantee

1273
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:58,310
you're going to watch Peyton manning
again this fucking year. Just light it up.

1274
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:03,080
Light it up. Absolutely. Five,

1275
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:06,920
6,000 fucking yards.
Right.

1276
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:09,210
And always got is that little fucking,
you know,

1277
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,590
he's got one little Superbowl
ring, you know, like,

1278
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:16,850
like that fucking professional gambler
who one time took the big pot and went

1279
01:20:17,671 --> 01:20:20,370
down to the gift shop.
Got himself something fucking shiny.

1280
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:25,020
You know what about the other nine digits?
They got nothing sitting there naked.

1281
01:20:27,660 --> 01:20:32,400
Losing every fucking night. Coming
home to a sparsely furnished apartment.

1282
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,700
You know, don't you have a flat screen TV
anymore? You still get that big fucking,

1283
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,490
you know,
zenith color TV

1284
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:44,630
that's been around since before the
world series of poker. That's, that's,

1285
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:48,840
that's where Peyton manning is right now.
All right.

1286
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,970
Okay. I think I fucking pretty
much poured salt in the field.

1287
01:20:53,971 --> 01:20:55,950
Burned down the village.
Right. That's over. Okay.

1288
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,990
For those of you had to
sit there and endure that.

1289
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,580
Let's give you some pleasurable viewing.

1290
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:01,850
Why don't you guys do yourself
a favor and go over to the Mlm,

1291
01:21:01,851 --> 01:21:06,000
podcast.com where you can watch
all of these funny youtube videos.

1292
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:11,340
Um, here are the youtube videos
for the week. Everyone. Um,

1293
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:16,500
first one, number one search.
This one crazy guy sings karaoke.

1294
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:20,250
Um,
this is a fucking great one.

1295
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:24,750
I don't know if you guys want to write
a psychological breakdown to this guy.

1296
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:29,750
I would really appreciate it cause I was
trying to figure out this guy's energy

1297
01:21:31,171 --> 01:21:31,800
if,
if,

1298
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:36,800
if it's like he's so fucking amped up
cause he's always wanting to perform that

1299
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:42,840
it somehow manifested itself in this
spastic fucking look on his face.

1300
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:45,930
I'll tell you right now he's an Asian guy.

1301
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:49,050
And the second I saw this stuff,

1302
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:52,850
fucking look on his face that he
makes right before we start singing.

1303
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:54,450
And when he sings the chorus,

1304
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:58,590
it really reminded me a killer Khan
and he wrestling fans out there.

1305
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:02,130
Do you remember how killer Khan used
to when he used to come on the mic?

1306
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:05,250
They acted like he couldn't speak
fucking English for God knows.

1307
01:22:05,251 --> 01:22:08,160
He probably taught at Princeton
during the fucking week.

1308
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:13,440
He would just sit there going,
guys, no Virgilio guys him

1309
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,700
and having this crazy
fucking look at his face.

1310
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:19,800
And then Freddie Blassie
order the fucking manage them.

1311
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:24,390
The grand wizard or wrestling would
step in acting like they knew how to

1312
01:22:24,391 --> 01:22:25,470
translate his shit.

1313
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:29,490
That's who I was thinking of when you
watch this guy or he really went through a

1314
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:32,950
breakup cause he's singing a breakup song
and he's mad at some bitch. I have no,

1315
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:37,620
no idea, but it's a crazy guy. Sings
Karaoke. Please check that out.

1316
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:42,120
A youtube video number two,
Hay bailing fun.

1317
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,270
Now if you're sitting there
right now writing down,

1318
01:22:45,271 --> 01:22:46,680
all of these are trying to remember them,

1319
01:22:46,681 --> 01:22:49,890
just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com
we're going to have them all lined up for

1320
01:22:50,010 --> 01:22:54,960
your nice and fucking easy. Uh, here's
another one. Pole dance. It ruins wedding.

1321
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,750
This one was so fucked up. I thought
it was fake, but evidently not a,

1322
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:04,260
here's another one. Prank phone
call. Our calling in sick to Walmart.

1323
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,510
And, uh, the last one. This is one
for after you've gone to lunch.

1324
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:13,960
Look up fat wrapper.
Uh,

1325
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,810
this one? Yeah, this one.

1326
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:21,220
You'll have your jaw on your desk
looking at this one. Um, anyway,

1327
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:22,300
so let's go back to this way.

1328
01:23:22,301 --> 01:23:26,110
I always wait till the youtube videos in
the end because I just stopped riffing

1329
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:27,790
and I just thought of just,
you know,

1330
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:32,380
and then go check this and then
I go into fucking robot mode. Um,

1331
01:23:32,530 --> 01:23:35,500
anyways, let's, let's plow ahead
here. Let's get me going again.

1332
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:38,470
Let's get the funny going
again on this podcast. I'm, oh,

1333
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:42,520
I know I always trash women on this,
on this podcast and um,

1334
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,470
you know, so I'm always telling them the,
the, the bride's over there to fucking,

1335
01:23:47,471 --> 01:23:48,700
you know,
write some shit here,

1336
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,530
talk some shit back so we can be nice
so we can be fair and balanced like all

1337
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:56,470
those, uh, those, those are new shows,

1338
01:23:56,590 --> 01:24:00,190
those news programs that they have
that gave you screaming about mosques.

1339
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:06,500
Do you know,
they're making a bakery where they will,

1340
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:11,230
they have the fucking
biggest loser. Um, anyway.

1341
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:15,760
All right. Uh, the empire strikes back
is the name of this one. Um, this is,

1342
01:24:15,761 --> 01:24:18,940
this is women. This is this
one, a female listener.

1343
01:24:18,941 --> 01:24:23,560
I have who just really just in a,

1344
01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:26,290
just an absolutely beautiful way.
Just dissects guys here.

1345
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:27,940
So we're going to read this here,
our bill.

1346
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:32,200
I've been listening to your podcast
every week for a while now. Um,

1347
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:37,180
I'd like you to start off giving me
actually a really concise form of time and

1348
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:40,900
then you get real vague nebulous of your
podcasts every week for a while now,

1349
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:45,670
every week since 2009 everywhere for,
well,

1350
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:52,000
I will see you at five minutes
past some hour today. Okay.

1351
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:56,050
So be there. I've noticed you rag on
females, but I haven't been offended.

1352
01:24:56,051 --> 01:24:59,500
It's funny and I know it's all in good
fun. Hey, here's a cool girl. All right.

1353
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:02,560
I heard the emails of the guys
who wrote in trashing women.

1354
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:06,820
So I am answering the call to write
in and trash guys. God bless you.

1355
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:10,600
Uh, let me give you a little context
about who I am. I'm an industrial,

1356
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:15,250
seems seamstress, can't even say
it. I am an industrial seamstress.

1357
01:25:15,251 --> 01:25:19,780
Does that job still exist in
this country? That's great. Um,

1358
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,050
who gets to listen to podcasts?
Podcasts while I work?

1359
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:28,490
I'm 25 and had been married to my
husband for six years together for eight.

1360
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,730
Okay. Let's try to dissect this woman.
All right. So she met her husband at 17,

1361
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:38,590
got married at 19,
and she's an industrial seamstress.

1362
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,080
You guys want to guess
what state she's in?

1363
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:45,160
Um,

1364
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:49,840
do you work at the last factory that
hasn't been turned into a Condo in Ohio?

1365
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:57,640
This is just as like a character
on little house on the prairie.

1366
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:01,660
Does your husband have polio? Um, anyways,

1367
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:05,420
he is also a fan of you and your
comedy. Uh, we have no kids,

1368
01:26:05,421 --> 01:26:09,620
but we do have a three year old male
am staff. I don't know what that is.

1369
01:26:09,621 --> 01:26:13,280
Terrier and an hopefully we'll have a
picture of that on the [inaudible] podcast

1370
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,840
am staff a m s t,

1371
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:19,430
a f f terrier and a nine month
old blue nose American pit bull.

1372
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:20,803
God bless you.

1373
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:26,000
My mother raised me on her own and I am
the youngest of four kids because I grew

1374
01:26:26,001 --> 01:26:30,590
up without a father in my life.
I am sure that a huge part of my dislike,

1375
01:26:30,650 --> 01:26:32,660
that's a huge part of my disliking of men.

1376
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:37,220
Is there anything better than someone
who could just address the fact that they

1377
01:26:37,221 --> 01:26:41,240
fucking hate something and actually
put a little bit of little bit of it on

1378
01:26:41,241 --> 01:26:44,720
themselves? I hope I've done
that. Why do I hate women?

1379
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:50,930
Uh, I think it's because I'm a control
freak. I think that's what it is. And um,

1380
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:54,170
I don't like people running my
life or attempting to run my life.

1381
01:26:54,171 --> 01:26:58,640
I don't like people budding into my life.
And that's how I view women.

1382
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,340
And it's how I view the marital laws,

1383
01:27:01,341 --> 01:27:03,470
which I understand were
put together by men.

1384
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:08,330
But I think that it was put together
by the Illuminati to keep people like

1385
01:27:08,331 --> 01:27:12,080
myself, regular guys, salt
of the earth guys, you know,

1386
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:16,280
oh fucking just chip off the old
block kind of guys. You know,

1387
01:27:16,281 --> 01:27:20,600
the kind of guys you could pal around and
say, Gee Whiz, Gee whiz with, you know,

1388
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:26,030
they prevent us from becoming rich
by,

1389
01:27:26,031 --> 01:27:27,410
let me look at tiger woods.

1390
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:31,280
They cut that man and half

1391
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:37,840
of vagina came in like a fucking radial
arm saw that flew off it's fucking

1392
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:39,314
hinges

1393
01:27:40,670 --> 01:27:44,840
and just sliced that fucking
once in a lifetime talent,

1394
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:50,120
right. And fucking half because why? Why?

1395
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:55,121
Cause he cause he blew out
his knee because he rested
on his laurels now because

1396
01:27:56,271 --> 01:28:00,710
he got legally bound to
something that had a vagina.

1397
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:04,420
That right there. And as you can
see, you know what it really is?

1398
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:07,890
Is I always look at worst case
scenario shit. Like, look at me. I'm,

1399
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,080
I'm taping a show that could go on to
become a hit show. And what do I do first?

1400
01:28:12,081 --> 01:28:16,520
I immediately worry that my standup is
gonna suffer rather than being like, hey,

1401
01:28:16,521 --> 01:28:19,360
this could be awesome.
All right, why don't,

1402
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:22,610
why don't you just Smithville you're
a fucking psycho and you're a paranoid

1403
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:25,490
maniac and you really don't know what
the fuck you're talking about. All right.

1404
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,660
Guilty as charged, guilty as charged. Uh,

1405
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:33,140
but I do know a lot about Greg Brady.
You've got to give me that. All right,

1406
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:38,060
so here we go. Please let me share
with you the reasons why some men suck.

1407
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:41,930
Look at this. She even said some men
and what have you got married so long?

1408
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:46,310
So young. This girl is a catch here.
All right, number one. She says,

1409
01:28:46,311 --> 01:28:51,200
I don't like diesel guys. You know the
guys who drive, they're extremely lifted,

1410
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:55,550
tricked out diesel trucks and
think that they are so fast.

1411
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,890
I don't know what that
means. So cool. We mean,

1412
01:28:58,160 --> 01:29:01,190
they are always trying to get
me to race them in my evo.

1413
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:06,330
I don't know what that is
either. And when I don't, uh,

1414
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:07,740
because they're gay,

1415
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:12,750
they blow black smoke out out
their exhaust and peel away.

1416
01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:15,330
Do you worry?
Do you live in Texas?

1417
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:20,500
That just sounded like the beginning
of like urban cowboy. Anyway,

1418
01:29:20,501 --> 01:29:25,500
something about their huge truck makes
them think they have a huge dick. Ah,

1419
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:28,410
I gotta go. I gotta go with you on
that one. Yes. I don't like those guys.

1420
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:32,370
I don't like people who feel like because
of the car that they have, you know,

1421
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:34,380
especially in myself
because I drive a hybrid.

1422
01:29:34,381 --> 01:29:38,970
I always get people giving me shit and
then they start talking about their car.

1423
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,350
Like they fucking invented
it. Like they built it. It's
like, no, no, no. I'm sorry.

1424
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,310
I'm sorry. Somebody, some other
man had to build that for you.

1425
01:29:47,820 --> 01:29:50,130
Do you understand that sweetheart?
So why don't you come on,

1426
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,430
climb behind you a little shiny toy
that you don't even understand how it

1427
01:29:53,431 --> 01:29:56,430
fucking works. All right.
You can't. All right,

1428
01:29:56,431 --> 01:30:00,530
can I kind of plow ahead here and
actually stay with, uh, with, with,

1429
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:04,080
with rather than interjecting my thoughts,
let's,

1430
01:30:04,081 --> 01:30:06,540
let's let the females talk here.
A number two,

1431
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,660
my mother always taught me
that it is rude to stare.

1432
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:15,060
I guess 50% of men either weren't
taught that or they don't care.

1433
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:18,210
It is super fucking
annoying when men stare.

1434
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:22,030
I totally understand seeing
an attractive person and,

1435
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:24,900
and them getting your attention,
but it should end there.

1436
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:27,930
There are too many guys
who just keep looking.

1437
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:37,830
Ah, yeah. I, I'm only guilty of that when
I get drunk. Then I don't give a fuck.

1438
01:30:37,831 --> 01:30:41,340
I'm like, yeah, look at that and
they'll fucking titties on her. Um,

1439
01:30:41,341 --> 01:30:46,110
excuse me quite down, sweetheart. I'm
looking at you cleavage. Uh, anyway,

1440
01:30:46,111 --> 01:30:49,380
she says, get a grip
fag. Uh, like clockwork.

1441
01:30:49,381 --> 01:30:53,610
If I am walking up an accident
and accidentally make eye contact,

1442
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:59,400
um, this guy might look away for now, but
the second I pass him and turn around,

1443
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:04,260
turn around to bust him. Lo and
behold, he is fucking staring.

1444
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,650
All right. I gotta tell you
something. Staring at a woman,

1445
01:31:07,651 --> 01:31:12,180
making her feel uncomfortable
is, is definitely not cool. Uh,

1446
01:31:12,181 --> 01:31:15,960
I totally agree with you on that, but
you know, if you fucking walk by me,

1447
01:31:15,961 --> 01:31:18,720
I can turn around and check
out your ass. All right. Yes.

1448
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:21,330
If you have a problem with that,
um,

1449
01:31:21,331 --> 01:31:24,600
I feel bad for you because one
day you're going to turn around.

1450
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:30,360
I Dunno. Could be when you're
27, it could be when you're 47,

1451
01:31:30,450 --> 01:31:34,200
I don't know when, but one day you're
going to turn around and low and behold,

1452
01:31:34,201 --> 01:31:37,740
the dude is not going to be staring.
And let me tell you something.

1453
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:40,650
That is not a fun fucking day.
So enjoy those day.

1454
01:31:40,651 --> 01:31:44,750
As long as he's not running back at you,
grabbing your ass. If he's turn around,

1455
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:47,940
checking you out, there's nothing
wrong. He's not fucking staring.

1456
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:52,110
Staring is looking at when you're
facing him, that's staring,

1457
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:57,810
staring in your eyes, looking at
your titties, checking out your box.

1458
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:01,300
I'm really being disrespectful.
That's staring.

1459
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:04,150
But when you walk by looking over your
shoulder, I mean that's a fucking,

1460
01:32:05,170 --> 01:32:09,780
you know, it's a compliment. If he
continues to walk and turns around,

1461
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,070
checks you out,
that's actually a compliment.

1462
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:17,050
If he stops and he's got one hand in his
pocket and it appears that he's doing

1463
01:32:17,051 --> 01:32:21,160
half the mash potato dance like that,
that is offensive.

1464
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:26,590
Without a doubt. Cheeses, where did I pull
that out of? Um, that would be offensive.

1465
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:28,870
All right,
but he's around fucking staring at you.

1466
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:33,370
That means that you're an attractive
woman and stop being so conti and take it

1467
01:32:33,371 --> 01:32:34,780
as a compliment.
All right,

1468
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,870
I understand you walk by a
construction site and they go, Hey,

1469
01:32:37,871 --> 01:32:41,950
let me see your fucking Panties,
or whatever the hell they yell,

1470
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:48,010
you know, whistling at you and all
that type of shit. I understand that.

1471
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:50,440
Yeah, I totally get that. You know,

1472
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:54,010
you treating you the same way I would
be treated as when I first walked into a

1473
01:32:54,011 --> 01:32:55,930
prison facility holding my blanket.

1474
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,620
I totally understand that.
But you know,

1475
01:33:02,621 --> 01:33:05,920
if he continues walking in the other
direction, it turns around and checks out.

1476
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:10,000
Your ass is not wrong with that. This not
wrong. That means he liked what he saw.

1477
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,400
That means you'll look and good.
That's all that that means.

1478
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:17,310
He's not fucking staring. All right. Um,

1479
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:20,890
anyway, she goes on to say everyone
notices hot girls and guys too,

1480
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:24,670
but it is rude to stare. Okay, I'll
go with you halfway on that. You know,

1481
01:33:24,671 --> 01:33:28,370
when you're looking at me, I shouldn't
be staring at you fucking chest. Oh,

1482
01:33:28,371 --> 01:33:29,440
your hips or you,

1483
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:33,490
so you fucking who are
now your legs or whatever.

1484
01:33:34,690 --> 01:33:36,820
Um, but on the other side, you know,

1485
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:40,120
if you're really hot and you
wear something really sexy,

1486
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:44,740
I mean guys are only so like,
I dunno,

1487
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:48,250
we're only so, we only have
so much control over that.
You fucking with nature,

1488
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:53,350
they're all right. Yeah. So I kind of
blamed you in a way. So you're right now,

1489
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,200
somewhere in the middle
of that I agreed with you.

1490
01:33:56,201 --> 01:33:58,670
Just take that take you take that
home with you. All right there taught.

1491
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:01,620
All right. Number three,
uh, what is the nasty, uh,

1492
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:05,560
what is with the nasty bathroom habits?
Um,

1493
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:09,400
I don't know if some men just don't
notice or don't care that the outer rim of

1494
01:34:09,401 --> 01:34:14,140
their toilets are fucking disgusting.
Is that hard to wipe off?

1495
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:15,280
What?
Missed the target?

1496
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,840
A house with only single guys or a
men's bar bathroom is proof that some

1497
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:27,400
me have horrendous.
Some men have horrendous bathroom habits.

1498
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:28,803
Okay?

1499
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:35,080
I'm absolutely 100% agree with you
other than the public bathrooms.

1500
01:34:35,081 --> 01:34:36,460
There's nothing more disgusting.

1501
01:34:36,461 --> 01:34:40,210
The female's bathroom is actually more
disgusting because you guys hover and you

1502
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:42,790
can't see what the fuck you're aiming at.
All right.

1503
01:34:42,970 --> 01:34:46,690
I used to work in a restaurant and one
of my jobs was I had to clean the fucking

1504
01:34:46,691 --> 01:34:50,170
bathrooms and I don't know what
the fuck you guys are using all,

1505
01:34:50,171 --> 01:34:52,180
all that fucking toilet.
It's like a ticket.

1506
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:55,700
It's like somebody want
to fucking championship in
there. You know the canyon,

1507
01:34:55,701 --> 01:34:59,030
a heroes like this all ticker tape and
all kinds of shit all over the floor.

1508
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:03,800
It's fucking horrific. And you
guys piss all over the place. Uh,

1509
01:35:03,830 --> 01:35:07,580
you know. Exactly. You know
what I mean? US urinating.

1510
01:35:07,581 --> 01:35:09,470
At least we're looking at
what were urinating you guys,

1511
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:12,680
it's like a fucking trick shot and
your shit faced in high heels. Okay.

1512
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,800
And you're hovering. Need
I say more? All right.

1513
01:35:15,801 --> 01:35:19,630
But everything else that you
said is, is 100% true. Um,

1514
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,680
I lived with guys when a,

1515
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:25,340
obviously when I was fucking single
and all that type of shit and I never

1516
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,390
understood that.

1517
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:31,630
I never understood the fucking dirty
dishes piled up to the ceiling or,

1518
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:37,160
or the food that you fucking ordered nine
months ago and it has like disgusting

1519
01:35:37,161 --> 01:35:40,640
mold on the side of it and
thinking all that shit was funny,

1520
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:42,530
not mopping up the floor,

1521
01:35:42,531 --> 01:35:47,060
live in like a fucking animal slice of
pizza in the cushion or however they

1522
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:50,330
always try to make gut single guys,
you know, you're like whenever they,

1523
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:52,190
whenever they do in a Hollywood movie,

1524
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:54,980
please say you used to do
it like back in the day,

1525
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:58,250
like whenever a single guy would get up,
uh,

1526
01:35:58,280 --> 01:36:01,070
just to demonstrate that he needs
a woman in life. It was actually,

1527
01:36:01,310 --> 01:36:04,700
it was actually insulting to both sexes.
Uh,

1528
01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:09,260
it was basically saying that this guy
needs a woman in his kitchen to start

1529
01:36:09,261 --> 01:36:11,630
fucking making some food or something.

1530
01:36:11,690 --> 01:36:15,140
And it was insulting to the guy basically
saying that guys didn't know how to

1531
01:36:15,141 --> 01:36:17,240
take care of themselves.
You know?

1532
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,600
And I know that there are a lot of guys
out there. I know it's just comedy,

1533
01:36:20,601 --> 01:36:22,700
whatever it, every fucking
movie would always start off.

1534
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,490
The guy would have like chocolate milk,

1535
01:36:25,660 --> 01:36:29,660
a half a beer left and he poured on
some fruit loops and then mix the whole

1536
01:36:29,661 --> 01:36:33,560
thing together in a blender, suck it down,
and then do a spit take into the sink.

1537
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:37,880
And then that was the deal to show that
he needs a woman in his fucking life.

1538
01:36:37,881 --> 01:36:41,120
But I, I totally understand
you. It's fucking gross.

1539
01:36:41,121 --> 01:36:43,480
And there's nothing worse than,
uh,

1540
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:47,750
when I would be on the road when I was
younger and I would crash at Buddy's

1541
01:36:47,751 --> 01:36:51,020
places and you'd go to get
up, hey, can I, you know,

1542
01:36:51,021 --> 01:36:53,750
can I take a shower before I go?
They'd be like, yeah, right. And you,

1543
01:36:53,770 --> 01:36:58,460
and they'd go to give you this
fucking towel that, you know, they,

1544
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:02,720
you know, check their oil on,
wash their dog with and fucking,

1545
01:37:02,721 --> 01:37:04,580
I don't know what drove the car over it.

1546
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:06,920
It felt like a fucking
stiff piece of cardboard.

1547
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:10,520
And then you go into their shower and it
was just, you couldn't touch anything.

1548
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:16,130
Hair all over the place, fucking desk.
I never, never fucking understood that.

1549
01:37:16,131 --> 01:37:18,500
And I want to tell you, sweetheart,
I never lived like that.

1550
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,480
I've never fucking lived like that.

1551
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:23,570
And one of my biggest fucking
turnoffs ever are messy women.

1552
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,660
There's nothing worse than a messy woman.

1553
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:30,140
Cause as much as I just stuck up
for guys that were not all slobs,

1554
01:37:30,141 --> 01:37:34,310
it's like you're supposed to teach us
how not to be fucking animals, you know,

1555
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,670
the same way I'm supposed to,
you know, teach you ditzy broads,

1556
01:37:37,671 --> 01:37:40,250
how to fucking change a light bulb,
you know,

1557
01:37:40,251 --> 01:37:43,610
cause you don't want to get your nails
to have your nails melted away. Right.

1558
01:37:45,030 --> 01:37:46,740
You was supposed to teach me how not to,
you know,

1559
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:48,320
drink milk from nine months ago.

1560
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,100
So I'm actually the first girl I dated,

1561
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:57,870
she had a bedroom where she wouldn't
let me in her bedroom for like the first

1562
01:37:57,871 --> 01:38:01,440
three months we dated, you
know, so I just, you know,

1563
01:38:01,441 --> 01:38:03,210
we just sort of hook up
out in the living room,

1564
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:07,870
had to make sure her roommate wasn't
home. And I was like, no, honestly I'm, I,

1565
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:12,060
I don't, you know, three months,
I know you let me in. And I,

1566
01:38:12,061 --> 01:38:15,030
and I went in there and,
uh,

1567
01:38:15,060 --> 01:38:17,580
it was a combination storage bin.

1568
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:21,930
You don't look like you ever
see those guys in New York City.

1569
01:38:21,931 --> 01:38:25,560
Like when they're selling shit illegally
on the sidewalk and all of a sudden the

1570
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:28,290
cop comes and they just grab
it and they run like hell.

1571
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,690
Just imagine if after they ran like hell,

1572
01:38:30,691 --> 01:38:33,630
they just threw it into
somebody's bedroom. That's
what the fuck it looked like.

1573
01:38:33,930 --> 01:38:36,750
And you had to like, it was like a
hoarder. She was like a fucking hoarder,

1574
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:40,290
but her roommate didn't tolerate it.
So it was all on her God damn bedroom.

1575
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,650
And I just immediately member looking at
this woman going like, yeah, this is, no,

1576
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,990
I'm not going to live
with this girl someday.

1577
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:51,840
And then I continue to bang
her for another six months
because I was young and I

1578
01:38:51,841 --> 01:38:54,300
was like,
but what if I never get another one

1579
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:01,410
stupid. Um, anyways, let's plow
ahead a number four, trashing men.

1580
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:03,030
The empire strikes back here.

1581
01:39:03,031 --> 01:39:07,200
I absolutely hate when men honked
their horn at women on the street.

1582
01:39:07,890 --> 01:39:10,380
I have lived, you must be pretty
hot if this. They're like,

1583
01:39:10,381 --> 01:39:13,260
most of this has to do with you trying
to get down the street without getting

1584
01:39:13,261 --> 01:39:17,680
leered at uh, getting
your butt pinched. Uh,

1585
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:21,000
what's your next one going to be? I hate
when I become a secretary in the boss.

1586
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:23,700
Thinks I'm going to blow
him. Um, number four,

1587
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:26,730
I absolutely hate when men honk
their horn at women on the street.

1588
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,770
I've lived on my,
uh,

1589
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,990
I lived a lot of my life in
an urban setting and I have
walked busy side streets

1590
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:38,880
a shit ton. A shit ton. Okay. What
good does it do to honk your horn?

1591
01:39:38,881 --> 01:39:40,470
Like a faggy coward?

1592
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:45,990
You sound like one of those women
who like throw shit when you get mad.

1593
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:49,050
Like you just,
I don't know what your energy,

1594
01:39:49,051 --> 01:39:53,370
I don't know what the fuck it is
about the way you write stuff. Um,

1595
01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:57,390
you don't write stuff like typically
female where it's like God,

1596
01:39:57,391 --> 01:40:01,650
it's like throw stupid. It's
like, like a fucking fag. Um,

1597
01:40:01,651 --> 01:40:06,240
you do throw shit. Um, anyways.
Is it satisfying to them?

1598
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:09,720
Do they think they are
paying a compliment? Ooh,

1599
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:12,830
that capital letters really
makes me feel capitol.

1600
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,480
There is so special to have a dirt bag,

1601
01:40:15,481 --> 01:40:18,030
honk his fucking horn beep,

1602
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,820
usually follow his gesture up with
the bird and allowed fuck off.

1603
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:27,210
Oh, that's what you do back.
That usually makes us laugh.

1604
01:40:27,630 --> 01:40:30,360
I guess that what I guess that cat calls

1605
01:40:32,580 --> 01:40:36,750
whistles and smoochy sounds or
even I guess that, oh, cat calls,

1606
01:40:36,751 --> 01:40:39,450
whistles and smoochy
sounds are even worst.

1607
01:40:39,480 --> 01:40:43,140
What the fuck decade are you living in?
People still do that.

1608
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,760
I just do not understand what the
benefit of these actions are. Um,

1609
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:53,490
oh, ah, from my side of the street. Um,

1610
01:40:54,660 --> 01:40:57,880
all right. There's a lot of more on guys
out there. Okay. Who's getting hope?

1611
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:01,150
One of them plays quarterback for the
Pittsburgh Steelers and has one more ring

1612
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:04,840
than fucking Peyton manning.
All right. But I digress. Um,

1613
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:10,120
but then there's another
thing, there's a, I don't know,

1614
01:41:10,121 --> 01:41:11,140
for guys to get laid,

1615
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:15,610
you have to understand we have to get
over the fear of approaching women and

1616
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:20,560
getting rejected. Like, I
know you guys have your level
of rejection, but like, um,

1617
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:25,360
I dunno, it was far other than
humiliating yourself in front of a,

1618
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:28,930
an audience just for every regular guy.

1619
01:41:28,931 --> 01:41:32,800
I would think the most
humiliating thing is,

1620
01:41:32,801 --> 01:41:37,450
is to walk up to a female and,
um,

1621
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:42,510
have her shut you down just because that
whole bullshit of being a guy you're

1622
01:41:43,121 --> 01:41:45,490
just supposed to,
it's just like from day one,

1623
01:41:45,491 --> 01:41:49,120
you're supposed to know how to
do it. You're supposed to, uh,

1624
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:52,450
know how to talk to women. You supposed
to, you know, know all about sex.

1625
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:57,630
He supposed to be like worldly before
you've even seen the outskirts of your

1626
01:41:58,121 --> 01:42:02,620
fucking town. And uh, you know,

1627
01:42:02,621 --> 01:42:05,630
I don't know now with the whole
fucking emo generation, I'm sure it's,

1628
01:42:05,631 --> 01:42:09,040
it's okay to now it's just say,
hey, I don't know how to do this.

1629
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:11,890
Can you give me some advice and
reach out for help? You know,

1630
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,040
that Shit didn't exist
when I was growing up.

1631
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:19,180
Like they actually have
reality shows about that.
Remember that guy who had that,

1632
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:22,840
that the lamp shade from True
Romance on his fucking head.

1633
01:42:22,841 --> 01:42:27,820
Remember that reality show, that guy,
that guy was remember, okay, true romance.

1634
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:30,490
When Christian Slater's,
he's going in there,

1635
01:42:30,491 --> 01:42:31,810
he's talking to Gary Oldman and he's,

1636
01:42:31,811 --> 01:42:35,200
he's pushing that lamp shade
at the his fucking head.

1637
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,240
And uh,

1638
01:42:37,660 --> 01:42:41,920
this was a reality show on VH one teaching
these nerdy guys how to pick up women

1639
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:46,900
and that guy that literally had that
lampshade on his fucking head and is dumb

1640
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:51,610
as it was. If you have the balls
to wear something like that,

1641
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:55,090
some woman is going to come up to you.
I'm not saying a good looking one,

1642
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:59,230
but some woman is going to be
intrigued with the fact that you,

1643
01:42:59,231 --> 01:43:01,810
so don't give a fuck what people think,

1644
01:43:01,811 --> 01:43:04,210
that you would actually wear
that thing on your fucking head.

1645
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:08,650
That she would somehow perceive it
as some level of confidence, I guess.

1646
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:11,500
And that you're going to do
what the fuck you want in life,

1647
01:43:11,501 --> 01:43:15,700
which might translate to them
on, this is all speculation. Um,

1648
01:43:15,701 --> 01:43:20,560
you guys can all correct me next week,
but under all that I don't give a fuck.

1649
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:22,060
I do what the fuck I wanted to.

1650
01:43:22,061 --> 01:43:27,061
I think females read that as in this guy
is going to take what he wants in life.

1651
01:43:27,790 --> 01:43:29,770
This guy's not a scared little bitch.

1652
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:32,980
Therefore he's going to get what he
wants and if he gets what he wants,

1653
01:43:32,981 --> 01:43:36,790
he's going to be able to provide, which
is what I need. Because when he not,

1654
01:43:36,791 --> 01:43:41,590
when I get knocked up, I'm out of
the game. I'm on injured, reserved,

1655
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:45,550
just sitting there, you know,
with a swollen fucking belly.

1656
01:43:46,300 --> 01:43:49,270
Can you go this Sunday?
No, no sir. I cannot,

1657
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:52,040
I cannot write who the fuck's

1658
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,140
gonna team. Do you realize
how fucking scare of that is?

1659
01:43:54,141 --> 01:43:57,970
I just realized that like, uh,
just as a, you know, being a guy,

1660
01:43:57,971 --> 01:44:01,080
like you never think about
that shit as far as, you know,

1661
01:44:01,081 --> 01:44:05,010
being able to pay your rent,
how fucking bad women have it that you,

1662
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:08,940
you gotta go out there and try
it not to get a fucking loser.

1663
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:15,090
Like really just sit there and be like,

1664
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:19,760
we're going in there and trying to pick
out the person who's going to be able to

1665
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:24,320
have your back for financially, I
guess. You know, women can, you know,

1666
01:44:24,321 --> 01:44:28,970
tough it out for the first two trimesters
that you know, yeah. Mean Jesus Christ.

1667
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:31,550
Some of them right up until like now
I've given birth next week. Right.

1668
01:44:31,551 --> 01:44:36,500
Isn't that how it goes? Did
they just fucking, I don't know.

1669
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,900
They're like hockey players just get
stitched right up on the fucking bench and

1670
01:44:39,990 --> 01:44:43,020
they're right back in there.
Right. I didn't mean it like that.

1671
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:46,140
If you thought I meant like, you
know, oh, that was really disgusting.

1672
01:44:46,141 --> 01:44:48,570
I didn't mean it that way. I was
trying to compare it to hockey. Oof.

1673
01:44:49,030 --> 01:44:53,730
Really in a pit right now.
See if I can crawl out. Um,
yeah, that must be an a, uh,

1674
01:44:53,860 --> 01:44:57,160
like if I like walking into a bar,
I used to just,

1675
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:01,930
I would walk in there and I would be
thinking like a guy like a, all right,

1676
01:45:02,790 --> 01:45:07,790
who's the hottest girl in here that
would actually still consider fucking me.

1677
01:45:12,270 --> 01:45:15,270
So it was never the best looking chicks.
That's, if I could go back in time.

1678
01:45:15,271 --> 01:45:18,720
That was the one thing that I
really don't like about myself is I,

1679
01:45:18,721 --> 01:45:20,550
whenever I saw the
hottest girls in the bar,

1680
01:45:20,551 --> 01:45:22,770
I immediately just said that Jesus Christ,
you know,

1681
01:45:22,771 --> 01:45:24,480
I'll leave that to the
fucking quarterbacks.

1682
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:29,630
I was so conditioned in my head to where
I was in the fucking pecking order that

1683
01:45:29,641 --> 01:45:32,480
I didn't even, I didn't even
try it. So I went with the a,

1684
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:36,270
I went after like sevens and eights.
You know,

1685
01:45:36,271 --> 01:45:40,320
it wasn't until I got into show business
and danced around like a fucking God

1686
01:45:40,321 --> 01:45:41,720
damn monkey on stage.

1687
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:46,340
And even then the good looking ones who
came up to you are fucking crazy. Um,

1688
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:51,470
Jesus Christ, almost 45 minutes in here,
she's quit babbling. Let's a solid,

1689
01:45:51,630 --> 01:45:54,810
they'll actually right there. That was
one of the rare times on this podcast.

1690
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:58,620
I actually tried to look at it from a
female's perspective and actually gave you

1691
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:02,930
props that has to be really
difficult and fucking scary. And um,

1692
01:46:04,060 --> 01:46:07,330
I think we've had plenty of stories of
guys talking about nightmare chicks who

1693
01:46:07,331 --> 01:46:09,460
come in and take them for
everything they're fucking worth.

1694
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:13,570
How about all these women out there
with who you, you, you looked at a guy,

1695
01:46:13,571 --> 01:46:17,670
he looked like a fucking winner.
All right. And then he just,

1696
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,080
he just ended up being this fucking
loser sitting on a god damn couch playing

1697
01:46:22,081 --> 01:46:25,800
video games, eating donuts. As you're
sitting there pregnant going like, really?

1698
01:46:26,740 --> 01:46:30,810
This is, this is this guy, this is
the dude. This is how you provide.

1699
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:32,070
You know what I mean?

1700
01:46:32,070 --> 01:46:36,060
And if there's any females out there who
have any sort of inside information on

1701
01:46:36,061 --> 01:46:40,740
how to read guys, so you don't end up with
that dude, by all means, by all means,

1702
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:45,500
write in and I will read the shit or at
least attempt to and stutter over the

1703
01:46:45,880 --> 01:46:50,520
goddamn words. All right, number five.
It's not over yet. All right, number five.

1704
01:46:50,521 --> 01:46:55,050
And I do not like when some guys cannot
control themselves in stare at tits and

1705
01:46:55,051 --> 01:46:58,980
ass. Did you already say this?
Doesn't this go under staring?

1706
01:47:00,210 --> 01:47:02,100
Is this an offshoot?
Is this like a spinoff?

1707
01:47:02,101 --> 01:47:05,340
When flow got her own show off of Alice.
Um,

1708
01:47:05,341 --> 01:47:10,341
instead of respecting the
women by speaking to her
face while making eye contact

1709
01:47:11,011 --> 01:47:15,570
and just using their peripheral vision
to get a good idea of her tits and ass.

1710
01:47:15,870 --> 01:47:19,890
You know what? Go Fuck yourself on this
one. Once you put your fucking tits away,

1711
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:22,530
sweetheart. Okay? You don't want
people staring at your tits and ass.

1712
01:47:22,531 --> 01:47:27,090
Stop wearing those fucking hip hugging
jeans with your little booty crack coming

1713
01:47:27,091 --> 01:47:30,120
out. Stop wearing the shit
with the cleavage. All right?

1714
01:47:31,770 --> 01:47:34,020
Jesus Christ. Why don't you
just fucking walk in their top?

1715
01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:38,370
That's the thing I've always hated.
You know, hello, I'm up here. Well,

1716
01:47:38,371 --> 01:47:40,580
you know what? You're not as good
looking as you tit sweethearts,

1717
01:47:40,581 --> 01:47:43,950
so why don't you fucking
put him away and he's back.

1718
01:47:44,190 --> 01:47:47,520
The chauvinist to con is back. All
right, let's finish reading this. Um,

1719
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,380
I have one friend in particular
who was terrible at this.

1720
01:47:52,650 --> 01:47:57,600
He even will walk 20 feet out of his way
to be at a good angle to see down his

1721
01:47:57,601 --> 01:48:01,590
shirt or indoor skirt. All right?
That guy is a pervert and a,

1722
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:05,010
I got to admit I'm a pervert too.
I swear to God,

1723
01:48:05,011 --> 01:48:08,250
if you have a fucking skirt on that's
really short and you're about ready to

1724
01:48:08,251 --> 01:48:11,160
walk up some stairs, uh,
you know I'm going to do,

1725
01:48:11,161 --> 01:48:12,660
I'm going to do a little march in place.

1726
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:15,900
Let you get a good fucking 10 stairs
in front of me. I don't give a fuck.

1727
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:17,820
I'm not gonna look,

1728
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:21,930
I am going to look where's some pants if
you don't want it to happen or take the

1729
01:48:21,931 --> 01:48:23,430
fucking elevator.
I'm looking,

1730
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:29,850
I'm looking. You know what? You know what
the thing is too. You know what it is.

1731
01:48:29,851 --> 01:48:33,930
They want you to look. Oh yeah, they
want it. I'm fucking with you. Um,

1732
01:48:33,931 --> 01:48:36,240
what is going to anyways,
what does that gonna do for him?

1733
01:48:36,241 --> 01:48:40,950
I wonder if he has heard of the Internet.
There is way better shit on there.

1734
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:45,930
There isn't sweetheart. There's nothing
better than seeing live titties.

1735
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,130
Okay.
And you can never see enough of them.

1736
01:48:50,131 --> 01:48:52,920
So he's probably on the Internet
too and whenever he can,

1737
01:48:52,921 --> 01:48:57,780
he's just checking out titties.
Um, anyways, continuing. Um,

1738
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:59,190
it is the 21st century.

1739
01:48:59,191 --> 01:49:03,360
You can see millions of bare tits
and ass in the comfort of your home.

1740
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:04,860
I don't get to distraction.

1741
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:09,900
That's a classic fucking argument that
if you put it in the, in the right, uh,

1742
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,780
in a different situation,
you would argue the other side.

1743
01:49:12,781 --> 01:49:15,900
What if you were in a relationship with
some guy and he's looking at tits and

1744
01:49:15,901 --> 01:49:18,270
ass on the Internet? You'd be
standing there like, really?

1745
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:22,050
You'd rather look at this shit that you
can't really even interact with than I

1746
01:49:22,051 --> 01:49:26,340
got live, titties and ass right here.
Why don't you come over here, see,

1747
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:29,180
see what I did there. Um, anyways,

1748
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:32,550
initially I thought that I could
compile a huge list trashing men,

1749
01:49:32,551 --> 01:49:36,750
but I've realized that as I'm
growing up, I've calmed down. Um,

1750
01:49:36,751 --> 01:49:41,310
some with my auntie men attitude. I have
many male friends who I care for dearly.

1751
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:45,270
Uh, this is all nice. I am a
fan of many male comedians,

1752
01:49:45,271 --> 01:49:48,540
musicians and artists and
no way do I all men. Now,

1753
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:53,050
why are you taking it all away? I
liked what you wrote. All right.

1754
01:49:53,051 --> 01:49:55,460
Here's someone who just
straight up fucking hates guys.

1755
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:58,480
Let's read this real quick and if
you're bitching about it as a guy,

1756
01:49:58,481 --> 01:50:01,540
we fucking deserve it because I got
three years of podcasts, trash and women.

1757
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:02,830
Here we go.
Uh,

1758
01:50:02,831 --> 01:50:06,640
number one guys who think one good
conversation means they're in.

1759
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,220
I can't tell you how
many guys I've spoken to,

1760
01:50:09,221 --> 01:50:12,670
a grand total of ones who think that
just because they made me laugh during

1761
01:50:12,671 --> 01:50:17,560
light conversation that I will
automatically bed them. I'm sorry. No,

1762
01:50:17,620 --> 01:50:20,620
the world doesn't work like
a porno said to tell you.

1763
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:25,330
All right. Wire to wire. That's
perfect. Can't fuck with that.

1764
01:50:25,331 --> 01:50:29,410
Number two guys who use acts
as a replacement for showering.

1765
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:34,120
I hope I said that right. I'm seriously
stop it. Yeah, you smell good now.

1766
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:35,800
But as soon as you walk away,

1767
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:41,010
that second cloud of ball smell is going
to be waiting after you and no girl is

1768
01:50:41,231 --> 01:50:45,580
dying to get with that two for two.
Um,

1769
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:50,710
due to can't flirt needn't try.
Uh, this is an actual conversation.

1770
01:50:50,711 --> 01:50:55,090
I had him. What are you doing?
Me Watching Jersey shore.

1771
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:58,930
You him wondering if you'd suck Dick,

1772
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:04,090
uh, wondering if you sucked Dick. Wow.

1773
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:09,310
And then her response was, wow, just,
oh my God. All right. Number four,

1774
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,500
learn to kiss fellas.

1775
01:51:11,710 --> 01:51:16,060
I know that when you practice on your
hand and think you've got skills and think

1776
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:16,641
you've got skill,

1777
01:51:16,641 --> 01:51:20,380
but when you attempt to French kiss and
you end up basically eating my mouth,

1778
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:24,760
that's not good. A sweetheart
that works both ways. Um,

1779
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:27,340
female,
stop thinking just because you're female,

1780
01:51:27,341 --> 01:51:31,000
you're automatically sensual and you have
a nice touch and you know how to kiss

1781
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:33,640
it is a fucking skill.
Some people are born with it,

1782
01:51:33,641 --> 01:51:36,340
but not everybody that kissing things
you don't want to fuck with you on.

1783
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:40,780
All right. I believe I've told this story
before, but I'm going to tell it again.

1784
01:51:41,270 --> 01:51:45,220
All right, I'm in this, I'm
in a bar, right? I'm chatting
up this broad. Okay. Short.

1785
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:47,380
Okay. For armed to something
fucked up with their arms.

1786
01:51:47,381 --> 01:51:50,650
I can't really tell like that chick
who makes the Italian food on the food

1787
01:51:50,651 --> 01:51:53,770
network. If you ever really start looking
at our arms, she's cute as a button,

1788
01:51:53,771 --> 01:51:55,210
but the son with their fucking arms,

1789
01:51:55,570 --> 01:51:59,380
she's just not a dwarf.

1790
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:05,500
Um, anyways, so it was one of those deals.
But anyway, she was cute though, right? So

1791
01:52:09,190 --> 01:52:12,230
aside from our Jack in the box arms,
he was fucking cute. All right.

1792
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:15,510
So I go lean in, right? We're going
to make out or whatever it was.

1793
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:19,960
I was fucking in there. Right now when
you go to kiss somebody for those,

1794
01:52:19,961 --> 01:52:22,690
you don't, not a kiss, you pick
a lip. Either you're going high,

1795
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,680
they're going low or vice versa. But
with this girl would do, when I went, hi,

1796
01:52:26,681 --> 01:52:29,710
she went high, or if I went picked
the lower lip, she went lower lip.

1797
01:52:29,860 --> 01:52:33,240
She would basically do upper lip,
the upper lip, lower lip to low, low.

1798
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:36,820
That's what she kept trying to do.
And I got so frustrated. At one point,

1799
01:52:36,821 --> 01:52:39,700
I literally grabbed two handfuls of hair.

1800
01:52:39,701 --> 01:52:43,750
I was a little drunk on both
sides of her head and tried to,

1801
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:49,550
tried to help her. Needless to say, after
she kissed me at my Dick was just like,

1802
01:52:49,551 --> 01:52:51,530
all right dude, you're on your own.
You're on your own on this one.

1803
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:56,000
I don't know what you want to do, but
uh, I'm good. I'm going to bed now.

1804
01:52:56,710 --> 01:53:01,520
See in the morning, you know, I
think I told that other story,

1805
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:05,210
that girl a doggy style,
you know,

1806
01:53:06,470 --> 01:53:11,350
when I move forward, you move
back. Sounds like a rap song. Uh,

1807
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,970
is that a ludicrous sung?
Um,

1808
01:53:15,710 --> 01:53:16,491
when I move forward,

1809
01:53:16,491 --> 01:53:19,070
you move back and then we both separate
and then we come together again,

1810
01:53:19,071 --> 01:53:21,920
like fucking magnets. That's how you
do it. This girl would basically,

1811
01:53:21,921 --> 01:53:24,980
when I went forward, she went forward
and when I went back, she went back.

1812
01:53:25,130 --> 01:53:29,120
So we just sort of rocking
together. So I was, uh,

1813
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:33,310
I was inside the building,
but uh,

1814
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:36,980
there was no friction to once again,
my dick started being like, you know,

1815
01:53:36,981 --> 01:53:39,950
if this is how it's going to
be, I think, uh, you know,

1816
01:53:40,030 --> 01:53:42,470
I've got work in the morning.
So once again,

1817
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:45,350
I had to fucking grab her
by the back of the neck,

1818
01:53:45,351 --> 01:53:48,860
like some fucking
insubordinate Hell Hound.

1819
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:54,170
Now the hand on her hip and I had to hold
her still for a second as I went back

1820
01:53:54,171 --> 01:53:57,980
and then I brought her to me
and then see that. There you go.

1821
01:53:58,910 --> 01:54:02,750
There you go. All right. But I
understand this woman. You don't,

1822
01:54:02,810 --> 01:54:06,020
you don't kiss other women's. So there
you go. All right, number five guys.

1823
01:54:06,021 --> 01:54:08,150
Who by the way,
this is fucking killer lists here.

1824
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:12,830
Number five guys who insist
on a girl who's hairless.

1825
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:18,820
I don't think guys realize how much work
it takes for a woman to maintain silky

1826
01:54:18,891 --> 01:54:21,290
smooth skin all the time.
But it is a pain.

1827
01:54:21,530 --> 01:54:25,250
It wouldn't be so bad to keep
it up if the guys did the same.

1828
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:30,430
But sadly a lot of furry little men
stick their noses up at the ideas.

1829
01:54:32,690 --> 01:54:36,800
Um, how can we be forced to do it
when you're Chinchilla asked? Doesn't.

1830
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:43,040
Um, someone else made a list and was just
talking about the pedophile tendency of

1831
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:46,280
that. And I could not agree
more. I think it's creepy.

1832
01:54:46,760 --> 01:54:50,720
100% hairless is fucking creepy.
All right.

1833
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:56,510
I'd like a nice manicured lawn please.
That's all I'm asking for. Yeah.

1834
01:54:56,540 --> 01:54:57,500
That other thing.
Yeah.

1835
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:02,600
That's just know the Calvin Klein ad is,
I call it,

1836
01:55:02,630 --> 01:55:05,330
remember those creepy ads he had with
the fucking people kids down in the

1837
01:55:05,331 --> 01:55:06,290
goddamn basement.

1838
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:11,570
I'd still think that's truly one of the
few times in life when I actually get

1839
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:16,360
offended. I really, it really
bothers me when, uh, they,

1840
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:20,750
that ad campaign and when they
have like 14 year old models,

1841
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:22,521
you know,

1842
01:55:22,521 --> 01:55:26,700
sitting on a swing dress like they're
22 and they look like they just got roof

1843
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:31,520
EAD. That's really, um, I don't get it.

1844
01:55:31,730 --> 01:55:33,890
I really don't get that at all.
Uh,

1845
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:38,270
I don't know if it's cause there's a lot
of gay guys in fashion and they don't

1846
01:55:38,271 --> 01:55:43,040
realize how street p
straight guys view that.

1847
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:48,300
I don't know what, but whoever's your,
they're really missing the mark on that.

1848
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:50,430
There's just,
it's fucking unbelievably creepy.

1849
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:52,950
And it actually makes me
angry when I see it and I,

1850
01:55:52,951 --> 01:55:56,820
and I want to find the guy
who came up with it and uh,

1851
01:55:56,850 --> 01:56:01,200
and fucking punched him in
the face because it's, it's,
it's wrong fucking road.

1852
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:05,160
It's just, you know, and believe me,
for me to be saying something's wrong,

1853
01:56:05,161 --> 01:56:08,250
it has to be fucking wrong
because I really don't give
a shit about most things.

1854
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:09,960
All right.
But yeah,

1855
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:14,990
enough with the fucking sexy 14 year old
who looks like she just got drugged and

1856
01:56:15,151 --> 01:56:19,740
can't stand up on her fucking Bambi legs.
I really, that's fucked. It's fucked up.

1857
01:56:20,340 --> 01:56:23,400
Okay, number six. And lastly,

1858
01:56:23,460 --> 01:56:26,670
a man who assume oral
is always on the table.

1859
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:32,250
You are boring. A bad driver
didn't pay for my movie ticket,

1860
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:35,370
made me listen to speed metal
while we were in traffic.

1861
01:56:35,371 --> 01:56:39,060
But you think that you deserve
to be blown. You have dirty hair.

1862
01:56:39,180 --> 01:56:43,830
I can only imagine what state your
Dick is in. Ah, that she writes.

1863
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:48,360
What's that in your eye? Oh, it's
just a sparkle that, you know what?

1864
01:56:48,361 --> 01:56:52,920
That was phenomenal. Phenomenal
points. Phenomenally written. Um,

1865
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:57,120
I'm liking this. The empire strikes
back, the women coming back at us.

1866
01:56:57,121 --> 01:57:01,440
We fucking deserve it. Uh, let's
see if I think I got it. Okay.

1867
01:57:01,441 --> 01:57:03,090
Let's get to overrated.
Underrated for the week.

1868
01:57:03,091 --> 01:57:06,930
This podcast is getting a little
old here. 56, uh, overrated.

1869
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,520
I like this one here.

1870
01:57:08,521 --> 01:57:13,320
This guy writes and he says the use of
the word epic to describe everything.

1871
01:57:13,890 --> 01:57:16,290
And you know, it's funny, after I
was just like, all that's a classic,

1872
01:57:16,390 --> 01:57:17,610
I've got to put that on the podcast.

1873
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:21,060
And then I was driving down the
street and there's some, um,

1874
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:25,530
new show coming out in the
advertising billboard says,

1875
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:31,590
um, something about the
epic of epicness, you know,

1876
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:35,610
just classic people in the motion
picture or whatever. TV industry.

1877
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:39,990
They liked that.
We keep finding the word epic on Youtube.

1878
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:43,600
Let's use it in our advertising.
Um,

1879
01:57:44,430 --> 01:57:45,260
kind of like,

1880
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:47,820
remember when they were trying to
figure out grunge and they just couldn't

1881
01:57:47,821 --> 01:57:51,930
figure it out. How to advertise
to the, I don't give a fuck man.

1882
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:56,520
I'm gonna shoot myself in the face
generation, right. That I semi came up in.

1883
01:57:56,530 --> 01:57:58,950
I'm like half in grunge,
half in hair metal. Right.

1884
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:03,060
So they actually came up with that
movie called feeling Minnesota.

1885
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:08,490
I believe Keanu Reeves was in it. I think
it was a, uh, uh, Soundgarden lyric.

1886
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:13,710
Um, I dunno what I'm
anyways, overrated. Uh,

1887
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:17,730
working in a job you hate
and don't want to do anymore.

1888
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:21,540
I feel like my job is slowly killing
me and I need to find something else,

1889
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:25,440
but I'm dragging my feet thanks
to this economy. Yeah, Dude.

1890
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:28,620
Well the great thing is
you've expressed it out loud.

1891
01:58:28,621 --> 01:58:31,800
You've written it and now I've said it
out loud. So you'll get out of that. Yeah.

1892
01:58:31,801 --> 01:58:36,000
You don't like it? Just get out, get out.

1893
01:58:36,001 --> 01:58:39,870
Just find something else. Anything
fucking it. Not Anything, but you know,

1894
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:43,750
just every, you just take another
swing at the fucking tree.

1895
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:46,130
Eventually a chop it down,
uh,

1896
01:58:46,240 --> 01:58:50,980
and get the fuck out of there because
it's your life. All right. Um,

1897
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:56,350
what is this? Oh, this is
some more mentoring, trashing
a men with huge muscles.

1898
01:58:56,380 --> 01:58:59,620
I think we already do. I'm not just
talking about the steroid freaks.

1899
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:03,520
I'm including those guys whose necks are
hidden by their overdeveloped shoulder

1900
01:59:03,521 --> 01:59:08,290
muscles and who's pecs could fill
a C Cup Bra. And for Christ's sake,

1901
01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:11,320
stop talking about your workout routines.

1902
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:16,060
I don't care how many reps you did while
exercising your idiot toys or how much

1903
01:59:16,061 --> 01:59:17,110
you can bench press.

1904
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:22,060
Just mentioned the fact that the bar
you use to bench press ways by itself.

1905
01:59:22,061 --> 01:59:25,780
40 pounds. Uh, wait a minute, I just lost
the sentence here. I'm so fucking dumb.

1906
01:59:26,110 --> 01:59:30,270
Just mentioned the fact that the bar you
used to bench press ways by itself, 45,

1907
01:59:30,310 --> 01:59:33,490
45 pounds and that you
added some heavy crap on,

1908
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:38,910
on that heavy crap on that alone
impresses me and doesn't bore me to death.

1909
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,540
And that was actually a great point and
I butchered it. Number two, a shaving.

1910
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:46,050
I'm not talking about
men's shaving their faces.

1911
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:50,290
Please do it because we women hate
stubble. Okay. Honestly, we love it.

1912
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:54,160
Movies and on TV. But the beard burn
in real life is just not pleasant.

1913
01:59:55,810 --> 02:00:00,310
Uh, it's not shaving. It's
not women's shaving. Their
pubic hair that is overrated.

1914
02:00:00,311 --> 02:00:02,590
Naked pussies are, oh,
here's a woman. Naked.

1915
02:00:02,591 --> 02:00:07,591
Pussies are another product of our
culture's obsession with super thin models

1916
02:00:07,841 --> 02:00:11,020
and actresses in it is sick.
Think about it this way.

1917
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:14,950
Keira Knightley naked.
I don't know who that is.

1918
02:00:14,951 --> 02:00:19,951
Naked looks more like a 10 year old boy
than a 25 year old woman in ladies who

1919
02:00:21,161 --> 02:00:25,090
actually have sizable
breasts and shave crutches.

1920
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:28,350
Look like women on top of
little girls on the bottom. Yes.

1921
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,520
See that's just fucking gross.
This is the woman.

1922
02:00:30,521 --> 02:00:34,360
This trend makes me think that all men
are secretly pedophiles and like to

1923
02:00:34,361 --> 02:00:38,380
imagine raping children.
All right? You know. Okay.

1924
02:00:38,830 --> 02:00:41,350
I think pedophiles work.
You really took it the whole nine yards.

1925
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:45,430
So she said you're pretty predictable.
Rent defending men goes here.

1926
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:47,650
Now Sweetheart,
I'm not fucking defending your,

1927
02:00:47,870 --> 02:00:52,690
I'm so I understand your side on that one.
Um,

1928
02:00:53,470 --> 02:00:56,590
I can already hear you accusing
me of being a fat, bitter broad.

1929
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:00,070
This is how bad I am. They're
anticipating these saying this shit.

1930
02:01:00,071 --> 02:01:04,150
This is why I'm doing this segment because
I've completely lost credibility with

1931
02:01:04,151 --> 02:01:06,880
the female audience here.
Uh, she says I'm not.

1932
02:01:06,881 --> 02:01:10,000
I'm 26 and while my bathroom scale,
if I had one,

1933
02:01:10,030 --> 02:01:13,720
wouldn't would be over one 30.
Um,

1934
02:01:13,721 --> 02:01:16,660
I've been in a relationship for seven
years and dated other people before that.

1935
02:01:16,661 --> 02:01:20,050
So it's not like a few fluke that a
guy is interested in me. Ah, yeah.

1936
02:01:20,051 --> 02:01:23,470
You don't need to justify yourself. You
made great points. All right. Underrated.

1937
02:01:23,790 --> 02:01:24,940
Oh,
these are from me here.

1938
02:01:25,810 --> 02:01:28,270
I'm actually gonna contribute here so
you guys don't have to work all the

1939
02:01:28,271 --> 02:01:32,620
fucking time. He can kick back and your
cubicles and relax. Underrated drinking.

1940
02:01:32,621 --> 02:01:36,860
This is from, this is from me. This
is from my heart to you people. Uh,

1941
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:40,310
drinking a beer on your porch or
balcony at the end of the day.

1942
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,490
I did it the other day.
I got a little fucking balcony,

1943
02:01:43,491 --> 02:01:46,460
one of those one bedroom apartment
balconies and I just sat out there.

1944
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:47,630
It's impossible.

1945
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:51,980
I don't give a fuck what is going on
in your life as a man to sit on a porch

1946
02:01:52,130 --> 02:01:55,610
with a little breeze going at dusk,
right?

1947
02:01:55,940 --> 02:02:00,800
Drinking a beer with the,
it's impossible to not feel successful.

1948
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:05,420
You feel like he just fucking completed
the transcontinental railroad near the

1949
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:09,440
Gout, drove in the golden spike. Um,

1950
02:02:10,610 --> 02:02:13,550
all right. Um, here's
my next one. Underrated.

1951
02:02:13,551 --> 02:02:16,820
Actually using your car as
a place to park your car.

1952
02:02:18,770 --> 02:02:22,790
Um, I just feel it's a good sign that
you're a well adjusted human being if you

1953
02:02:22,791 --> 02:02:27,791
actually put your car in the garage
and if you have a bunch of clutter in

1954
02:02:27,921 --> 02:02:30,590
garbage in your fucking,
uh,

1955
02:02:30,591 --> 02:02:34,880
if you use your garage as storage also,
you know,

1956
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:37,370
and then I think that's, you
know, that's like the Bronx tale.

1957
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:40,490
That's just the tip of the iceberg and
you really just need to get out of that

1958
02:02:40,491 --> 02:02:45,270
fucking relationship. Um, all right. Uh,

1959
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:47,030
we're well over an hour.
Should I keep going?

1960
02:02:47,710 --> 02:02:49,580
Do you guys have something better to do?
I don't think you'd do.

1961
02:02:49,581 --> 02:02:52,370
I'm going to keep going here.
Underrated professional courtesy.

1962
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:55,190
I work for a cell cellular
provider in a call center.

1963
02:02:55,370 --> 02:03:00,080
And the sheer amount of ignorant assholes
that call me and curse at me for no

1964
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:02,300
reason is astounding.
Now,

1965
02:03:02,301 --> 02:03:05,570
what does that go back
to podcast listeners?

1966
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:09,980
This guy's getting cursed at because
people don't listen to my podcast and they

1967
02:03:09,981 --> 02:03:13,460
don't realize that you don't curse
it. That guy, after he says what he's,

1968
02:03:13,490 --> 02:03:16,940
what he's supposed to say, you
just tell him, that's unacceptable.

1969
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:19,470
I need to talk to somebody above you.
That's what you do.

1970
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:24,020
This guy's getting cursed out because
people just lacked the ability or they

1971
02:03:24,021 --> 02:03:27,760
don't have, they don't have the knowledge
to just say it's unacceptable. Um,

1972
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:32,600
all right. Number one,
underrated a sobriety. Um,

1973
02:03:32,630 --> 02:03:35,750
I don't have time to read all these
fucking things. Sobriety, I started,

1974
02:03:35,751 --> 02:03:38,420
I got to finish it. See,
even the word makes,

1975
02:03:40,990 --> 02:03:44,960
uh, is this underrated sobriety. See,
even the word makes being not fucked up.

1976
02:03:44,961 --> 02:03:47,210
Sound boring. Uh, to these people,

1977
02:03:47,660 --> 02:03:51,470
to people these days lack the intelligence
and imagination to have fun without

1978
02:03:51,471 --> 02:03:53,540
being stoned or drunk off their asses.

1979
02:03:54,010 --> 02:03:57,800
I'd never seen the appeal in having random
words come out of my mouth rubbing up

1980
02:03:57,801 --> 02:04:02,060
against a stranger then falling down and
passing out amongst people. I wouldn't,

1981
02:04:02,240 --> 02:04:04,070
I wouldn't trust to walk my dog.

1982
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:08,150
If your life sucks so much that you
would rather be silly sitting at a dirty,

1983
02:04:08,151 --> 02:04:12,500
dim lit bar or smoking pot with strange
people living in their parents' basement

1984
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:16,880
than do something to change it.
Don't become numb to your life. Rage,

1985
02:04:18,020 --> 02:04:22,490
rage against the routine, and if your
life isn't that bad, why risk your health,

1986
02:04:22,491 --> 02:04:25,130
money and sanity on recreational poisons,

1987
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:28,550
you know at that might be one of the
greatest arguments I've ever had for being

1988
02:04:28,551 --> 02:04:32,780
sober. It has an override. Righted my
sitting on the porch drinking a beer,

1989
02:04:32,781 --> 02:04:37,781
which I'm going to do right up to this
fucking podcast on number two girl geeks.

1990
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:44,540
Why are men so obsessed with the size
to party girls at fashion and fashion?

1991
02:04:47,220 --> 02:04:50,260
Niesters can we just stop
here for a second? Amen.

1992
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:52,860
Aren't you?
Don't you know why?

1993
02:04:52,861 --> 02:04:56,160
I know what a fashion Nissa
is because of my girlfriend.

1994
02:04:56,340 --> 02:04:58,260
She loves all of those blogs.

1995
02:04:58,830 --> 02:05:03,330
She goes on all of those things and she
constantly bitches about those size to

1996
02:05:03,331 --> 02:05:06,510
fucking women. And she always
says that guys are into them.

1997
02:05:07,620 --> 02:05:11,040
You guys are the one who read vogue.
You're the ones who read cosmo.

1998
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:15,150
You're the one, they don't have those
women in sports illustrated. They don't.

1999
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:19,950
And when they do the swimsuit
issue, they're not sized
to, okay, go fuck yourself.

2000
02:05:19,951 --> 02:05:24,240
They're not granted. I don't know what
a fucking size two is, but size two,

2001
02:05:24,241 --> 02:05:28,590
that's that little, uh, those lollipop
looking girls, the big fucking heads,

2002
02:05:29,220 --> 02:05:31,200
you know,
they look like raggedy Ann dolls,

2003
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:33,590
but you grabbed it by the
neck like you were gonna.

2004
02:05:33,630 --> 02:05:37,470
You just run out this stuffing through
the doll feet. That's what they look like.

2005
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:43,250
Um, so yeah, blame the people in the
fashion industry. I mean, the, the,

2006
02:05:43,251 --> 02:05:47,610
the hacky theory is that there's
a bunch of gay guys in, uh,

2007
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:53,130
in fashion and they're more
attractive to two guys.

2008
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:55,500
I don't know.
I've just always heard that.

2009
02:05:55,501 --> 02:06:00,180
So they're trying to make them
have no curves. I don't know what,

2010
02:06:00,181 --> 02:06:01,650
but yeah, no, I'm not into that.

2011
02:06:01,650 --> 02:06:04,710
I'm not into that looking like
you can barely fucking stand up.

2012
02:06:04,711 --> 02:06:09,690
I'm not into that. Um, I'll tell
you what I like. Go, go, go, go,

2013
02:06:09,691 --> 02:06:14,100
look up. Cool Hand Luke and look at the
CIC wash in the fucking car. All right,

2014
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:17,820
go look up that on youtube. We'll
actually have the clip on the MM podcasts.

2015
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:19,950
Look that up.
Um,

2016
02:06:19,951 --> 02:06:23,820
if you want to be in a relationship
where you can relax and not be nagged to

2017
02:06:23,821 --> 02:06:26,190
dress well and go do something,

2018
02:06:26,191 --> 02:06:28,620
you want a girl who is more
interested in surfing attended.

2019
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:30,030
I don't know where the
fuck to go with this.

2020
02:06:30,031 --> 02:06:31,950
I don't even know where to pick
that up. All right, I'm done.

2021
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:36,870
I'm done with the podcast. I'm well
over an hour. Um, and that's it.

2022
02:06:36,871 --> 02:06:39,540
That's the podcast for this
week. Lot of reading, by the way,

2023
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:43,190
that's why it was an hour and five
minutes because I'm not the best reader if

2024
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:46,890
you, as you've noticed. So that's a
podcast for this week. Um, this week,

2025
02:06:46,891 --> 02:06:51,720
football season starts.
Let the shit talk and begin a patriots.

2026
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:53,310
Have the Bengals next week.

2027
02:06:53,850 --> 02:06:58,740
My prediction is the patriots
come out with a big victory. Um,

2028
02:06:59,970 --> 02:07:03,840
I just think, uh, I dunno. It's been
real quiet up in New England. I like it.

2029
02:07:04,410 --> 02:07:05,550
Rex Ryan in the jets.

2030
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:10,110
I talking all this fucking
shit and I think it's great.

2031
02:07:10,111 --> 02:07:13,890
Everybody's going to be looking at them.
I feel like the Patriots are like the,

2032
02:07:13,891 --> 02:07:16,860
what the cults get every year when
nobody really focuses on them.

2033
02:07:16,861 --> 02:07:21,030
And everybody was looking
at bill Belichick and who
the fuck he was filming and

2034
02:07:21,031 --> 02:07:22,410
all the crap that was going on there.

2035
02:07:22,411 --> 02:07:25,110
Tom Brady's fucking knee or are
they going to be undefeated?

2036
02:07:25,230 --> 02:07:27,210
It's nice that Rex Ryan,

2037
02:07:27,510 --> 02:07:32,510
that insecure fat fuck is running his God
damn mouth with his chronic need to be

2038
02:07:32,611 --> 02:07:36,060
liked. Um, I, I cannot wait for

2039
02:07:36,060 --> 02:07:41,060
week two and I just want us to fucking
killed the jets to the point that Rex

2040
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:46,110
Ryan just like literally snaps that
lap band in his fucking stomach.

2041
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:50,660
Just eaten Lasagna.
If four in the fucking morning crying.

2042
02:07:50,661 --> 02:07:54,590
I knew I wasn't good enough.
That's the podcast for this week.

2043
02:07:54,591 --> 02:07:59,420
God bless all of you. Have a great
week. Uh, I'll talk to you next Monday.

2044
02:07:59,421 --> 02:08:00,670
I'll let you know how to pilot chute when.
Yeah.

2045
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:01,733
Okay.

2046
02:08:31,350 --> 02:08:35,440
[inaudible] just stay with
me.

2047
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:03,660
[inaudible] this will be the last thing.

2048
02:09:14,670 --> 02:09:14,670
Yeah.
