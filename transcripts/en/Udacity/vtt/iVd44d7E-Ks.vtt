00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.080
Just as an aside, I'd like to actually show you an interesting example of

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.360
what would be an ideal focal length for taking images or portraits.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.600
Again, I have my scene.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.100
I have my camera.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.520
I can use an 85 millimeter lens and get the whole field of view that I want.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.340
In this case, I'm using a simple example, a bust of Abraham Lincoln.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.750
I'm using this 85 millimeter lens and this is what the shot I get.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.090
I move closer.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.730
This is a 50 millimeter lens now looking at the same subject.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.530
Here's the output.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.020
It does get darker a little bit for a variety of reasons.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.160
We'll be looking at that in more detail when we

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.610
talk about the exposure triangle.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.860
But you notice that

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.810
there is a little bit of a difference between these two images.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.470
Right?

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.025
If I was to just basically say,

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:48.170
these lips here seem to be now much more smaller than this one.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.050
But actually let's go in further and see if we can move further and

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.220
see what happens.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.380
Moving the camera further in.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.490
And since I want the same field of view, I would of course, and of course I

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.870
have the same sensors, the same camera, I would have to change the focal length.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.870
This is what telephoto lenses are usually very good at.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.310
And of course, now you see a 20 millimeter lens, and this is the image we get.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.490
If you notice this face now has a little bit more distortion.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.642
It feels more curved, and much more kind of all things,

00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:23.220
the dimensions seem to be, and the dimensions have shrunk a little bit.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.900
And the nose seems a little bit more kind of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.780
projected outwards as opposed to in this case the face looks much more facelike.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.290
So here there's a lot more distortion.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.810
Now, of course, most photography is, you know, again,

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.650
what you want to do with it, but just by changing these types of things or

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.490
parameters on your camera, you can change the look and feel of an image.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.130
So traditionally, most portrait lenses that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.500
people use are 75 millimeters to 135.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.610
I actually prefer to use an 85 millimeter.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.435
This is one of my favorite lenses.

00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:57.850
because it actually gives your portrait, and

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.180
of course there are other things that are going on that we'll also look at,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.090
as, you know, issues around,.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.820
Little bit of more blurring in the background, which is less kind of visible in

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.170
these ones, but are much nicer in this kind of an image.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.930
So in the next lecture, when we look at the exposure triangle,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.990
we'll be looking at the relationship, of again details that allow us

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.220
to kind of also get more information the back and the front of an image.
