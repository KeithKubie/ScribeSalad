00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.220
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.220
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: Danielle Allen
is a Harvard James Bryant Conant

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.080
University Professor at
Harvard and the Director

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.580
of the Edmond J. Safra
Center on Ethics.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.340
She's a brilliant and
prolific political theorist,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.770 position:56%
known for her work on justice and
citizenship and her wingspan extends

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.320
from ancient Athens
to today's America.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.070
She is the author of many
books, which would take too long

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.850
to mention here, but one
of her most well-known

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.430
and award-winning is
Our Declaration,

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.180 position:56%
A Reading of the Declaration of
Independence in Defense of Equality.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.200
And her latest, Cuz, The
Life and Times of Michael A.,

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.310
is the story of her first
cousin, Michael Alexander Allen.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:09.060
Bright and promising,
Michael was arrested at 15

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.610
for an attempted carjacking
and was sentenced

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.330
as an adult to 13 years in prison.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.120
He served 11 and essentially
grew up behind bars.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.470
By 29 he was dead, a murder victim.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.280
Michael Allen fought for his
humanity in the face of unforgiving

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.330
and ravenous social
economic circumstances,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.030
including the criminal justice
system that sends children to jail,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.240
disproportionately black
and brown children.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.580
Michael had become, as Dr. Allen
writes, one of the millions gone.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.950
This is a story about family.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.590
It's a story about the Allen's, but
I would argue that it is a story

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.960
about our national family and what
can happen and what does continue

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.340
to happen to so many
of our children.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.280
Now I think Dr. Allen is
particularly special and part

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.770
of a great tradition of those

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.540
who ask what kind of
people we want to be.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.680
And in the 21st Century she
is definitely asking all

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.170
of us what kind of democracy
we want to make sure evolves.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:37.410
Hers is a critical
voice and I think,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.900
like founding father John Adams
and scholars like W.E.B. Du Bois,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.670
she's using her intellect
in the service of us all.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.350
Like James Baldwin she is a
witness and I think in the spirit

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.910
of the great Toni Morrison
she is using her career

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.430
to write a long love letter to our
humanity and to this democracy.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Danielle Allen.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:18.140
[ Applause ]

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:25.490
She'll also be signing books from
11 to noon in the Expo Line 17.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.150
She is a special sister.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.380
Thank you.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: I don't usually
start crying right at the beginning.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.510
That was an extraordinary
introduction and I am so grateful.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.280
[ Applause ]

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.320
&gt;&gt; Marcia Davis: An
extraordinary scholar.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.890
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: It's also
just, I mean at so many levels

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.520
that was special and generous,
but it's not every day even just

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.360
that you get introduced by
somebody who has read your book.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.700
And that means a lot
because I really am here

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.650
to ask people to read this story.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.670 position:56%
The book comes out on Tuesday so
this is sort of the launch actually,

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.570
as you guys are the launch.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.090
And so I think and because
actually you did such a great job

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.490
of already sharing some of the
story I think I'm just going

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.110
to read the first chapter to start
and then I'll talk about the book

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.860
and then I'll read
a few more pieces,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.550
but just to give you guys a feeling
for it and you can see Michael.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.370
Oh, he's not there anymore.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.760
He was on the screen,
so I hope you got a --

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.170 position:56%
there he is, there's my baby cousin.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.740
So the book has three parts.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.640
Part one is called
Release and Resurrection.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.260
Part two is called Inferno.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.870
And Part three is called
Unforgiving World.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.570
So Part one, Release
and Resurrection.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.260
Limits are what any of us
are inside of, Charles Olson,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.880
Chapter one, Garden
Party, July 2009.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.320
Danielle, phone call for you.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.620
It's your dad.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.670
I broke away from a conversation
with my husband's cousins,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.310 position:56%
from glancing distracted talk about
the kids who were playing yards away

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.710
in their floral sundresses under
a soft English garden party sun.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.960
Rising from the picnic
table I took the cell phone

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.390
from my husband and
walked a few steps.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.000
Hi, dad. And, yeah, it's Michael.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.400
My father's voice, the
careful clipped speech

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.760
of a retired professor, came
from across the Atlantic,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.670
from Maryland through the ether.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.790
It sounded as if it were miles
beneath the seas, crackling, wispy,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.510
as if through the first
ever transatlantic cables.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.360
He's dead.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.990
What? Dead.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.320
They found him shot in a car.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.370
What? Dead.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.250
I'm coming.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.440
Michael, my cousin, my baby cuz.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.890 position:56%
Sometimes an English spring mornings
a gauzy haze clings to the air.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.400
This, though, was July
and now afternoon.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.720
That same sort of whiteness
suddenly seemed to wrap the sky

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.400
and the surrounding willows.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.640
And I near collapsed,
staggered into my husband's arms

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.930
and said, Jim, we have to go.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.910
What? Michael is dead.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.540
What? Dead.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.410
We have to go.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.910
Straightaway go.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.830
We had to go to South Central.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.890
And so we left.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:42.590
So the book starts there
at the end of a life

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.220
and the reason it starts there is

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.070
because the life was
full of mysteries.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.540
So Michael died in 2009 and,
obviously, it was a huge impact

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.900
for our whole family and
it's taken me a long time

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.890
to understand what
happened to my baby cousin.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.720
And so I have been wrestling for
a long time with three questions.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.770
As Marcie said, Michael was
arrested in 1995 when he was 15

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.430
for an attempted carjacking in
Los Angeles, tried as an adult,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.430
sentenced as an adult,
sentenced to 13 years, served 11.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:19.030
When he got out in 2006
I was the cousin on duty,

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.620
that's a phrase I use for
it, helping with reentry.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.330
So I had been with him through the
prison experience, working with him

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.430
on correspondence courses,
taking the calls, you know,

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.510
will you accept a collect call
from the California Department

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.490
of Corrections, that's
sort of the routine of it.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.300
And at any rate so I was the one
who helped with school and job

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.330
and so forth, and we worked hard
on that, and then three years

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.800
after he was first
released he was killed

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.630
by the transgender lover he'd
fallen in love with in prison.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.550
And so, obviously, it's a
big and complicated story.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.450
And Michael, in addition,
was a very talented person.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.750
He was a brilliant writer.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.700
I'll read you a little bit
of his writing in a minute.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.230
And so we always had hoped before
he died that he would be able

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.830 position:56%
to tell his own story, that he would
be able to share his experience

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:15.920
as a young person trying to survive
in the hard context of Los Angeles.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:22.020 position:56%
And so I had always wanted to find a
way to let Michael's voice come out

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.320
and that's what this book is,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.900
the center of the book
is this beautiful essay

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.730
about Dante's Inferno that
he wrote during his college

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.830
correspondence courses.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:38.780
But as I was wrestling with this
I was invited by a colleague

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.170
at Harvard, Professor Harry
Lisgates, Jr., [Assumed Spelling]

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.600
to give a set of lectures,
the Du Bois lectures, right?

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.730
These are sort of longstanding
famous lectures named

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.030
after W.E.B. Du Bois.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.830
The point of giving these lectures
is that you're supposed to try

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.080
to say something about contemporary
African-American experience.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.760
And I'm a political
philosopher, okay,

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.010 position:56%
a really abstract analytical person,

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.910
so I kept giving Skip these
abstract titles, like I'm going

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:06.500
to give you lectures on race
and equality in the 21st Century

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.000
or political equality in the
future of race relations,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.740
and these kinds of titles.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.190
And I also kept delaying
the dates of the lectures.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.330 position:56%
As I got closer to it, I don't think
I can do it, let's postpone them.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.900
And so finally I reached a point

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.740
where I couldn't postpone
these lectures any longer

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.110
and I also just reached a point

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.120
where I realized I couldn't
honestly address the question

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.210
of African-American
experience in the 21st Century

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.890
without telling my cousin's story.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.690
So that's what I've done.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:44.370
And so the point of saying all of
that is the process of writing was

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.550
as wrestling towards trying
to tell my cousin's story

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.610
and that required me to
answer a set of why questions.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.730
Why was he dead?

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.320
Why had he been in
prison for so long?

00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.950
And, most importantly, why did
this beautiful energetic, bright,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.590
talented 15-year-old kid with a
big extended family who loved him,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.600
that had resources, end

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.450
up on a street corner holding a
gun trying to take somebody's car?

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:16.490
Why? So that's where the title
of the book comes from, Cuz,

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:21.600 position:56%
because of this, because of that,
as well as of course meaning cousin.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.890
And so the reason the book starts
with his death is because that's

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.940
where the mystery starts
in some sense.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.550
I mean the whole life is a
mystery, but the unraveling of it,

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.990
you have to sort of work your
way back, why was he dead?

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.400
And then, okay, we know he was dead
because he person he fell in love

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.770
with in prison killed him.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.610
All right, but then, okay, well,
why was he in a situation to fall

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.910
in love with somebody in prison?

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.160
Well, if you go to prison when
you're 15 and you're there

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.740 position:56%
for 11 years you are going to fall
in love with somebody, you just are.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.510
It's like no way to avoid that.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.220
And so then what does that
mean when you come out?

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:05.410
Your choice is a future where
you repudiate your loves in order

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.500
to have a new life or
you keep your loves.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.910
It's the only possible choice.

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:16.380
That is a very, very hard choice.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.400
So, yes, Michael was responsible
for all of his choices,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.400 position:56%
but you dig into Michael's story and
you begin to understand the degree

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.450
of difficulty that
comes with some choices.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.840
I don't know how many of you
watched the Olympics last year.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.280
Anybody? You guys are book readers,
do you watch the Olympics, as well?

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.740
Okay, you never know if
those things go together.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:42.010
But the gymnastics, Olympics was
obsessed with this Indian gymnast,

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.430
Deepa Cara Machar [Assumed
Spelling], something like that,

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.530
I can't exactly remember,
because she was going

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.010
to do this maneuver called the
Produnova [Assumed Spelling],

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:50.730
which is the highest
degree of difficulty

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.940
of any gymnastics maneuver.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.690
And the concern was people who
do this have a very high rate of

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.570
or risk of breaking their neck
or spinal injuries and so forth.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:01.870
She pulled it off, she did it.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:06.150
So you can do things, absolutely,
you can overcome in the face

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.530
of great degrees of difficulty,
but nonetheless most people who try

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:13.080
that maneuver are going to break
their back and that's just a fact

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.150
about the degree of
difficulty involved.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:19.670
And I think that's how we have to
think about the kinds of challenges

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.120
that face young people in difficult
circumstances in this country.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.610
That we have incredibly disparate
sets of degrees of difficulty

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:29.970
with which young people
are confronted

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.300
and they have to try to overcome.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.430
So I'll say a little bit
more about that in a minute.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.420
But let me at this point just
give you a little bit more

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:44.000
about who Michael was, a little
bit more about who I was as a kid,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.180 position:56%
and then what this experience of
dealing with incarceration was like.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:56.050
So, let's see, if I tell
you a bit about Michael,

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:02.190
jump into his childhood
which comes late in the book.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:05.350
Let's see if I've got
my page numbers here.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.070
All right.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:15.410
So they lived, so Michael
was born in Los Angeles.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.000
He was one of three kids.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.030
His mother, Karen, had
left her partner in Florida

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.340
because he was abusive and taken
the three kids to California.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.430
And she, herself, didn't
go to college,

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.730
but worked her way into nursing.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.090
Steady, hard worker, never could
make the ends meet with three kids,

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.880
either the end of time or of money.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.330
But, nonetheless, when
Michael was coming

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.900
up into kindergarten they
managed to land in Highland Park,

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.580
just outside of Pasadena, for
five years and that was sort

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.160
of the stable and best part
of their time together.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.310 position:56%
In Highland Park the rights of
passage proceeded according to plan.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.090
Michael's beautiful
kindergarten teacher,

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.760
the one with the blonde
Afro, loved him.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.390
He graduated in high style
in white cap and gown.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.370
He had gymnastics lessons
and played Little League

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.850
and went to summer camp.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.500
To raise the funds for camp he
sold peanuts, so successfully even

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.660
that he funded his brother and
sister's trips to camps, too.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.010
The trio would go for
three-week stints in the summer,

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.490
then they would come home, their
mother would do their laundry,

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.060
and then she would
send them off again.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.980
They always went together.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.240 position:56%
Michael also had a glorious bicycle,

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.950
a He-Man [Assumed Spelling]
bike that he loved.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.140
And their house was
on top of a hill.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.300
He would fly down it barefoot,
not yet able to brake,

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.990
ending up at least
once with a swollen eye

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.860 position:56%
with the bike all bent out of shape.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.620
Having terrified his
sisters, cousins,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.950
mother, anyone who was around.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.440
His sister, who was growing
into a large-bodied girl

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.570
and had already developed a
mothering instinct, would cry out,

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.320
Michael, why don't
you put no shoes on?

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.180 position:56%
We visited them often at this house,

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.180
once a month from sixth
to eighth grade.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:46.830
I would come by, so that
another aunt, Big Roz,

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:50.090
and her girlfriend
could relax my hair.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.620
The only slightly unusual ritual

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.090
in Michael's life at
the time was Alatots.

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.430
Since he couldn't have
remembered his mother's drinking,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.180
which was done by the time
he was one, his enrollment

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.950
in the program must
have seemed mysterious.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.540
Karen's spirit lightens when
she talks about their time

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.770
in Highland Park and how
amusing it was to eavesdrop

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.820
on her kids Saturday
morning Alatot meetings.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.120
The trio would gather
outside her bedroom door,

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.630
whispering like a cloud
of buzzing bees.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.130
They were whispering
about their grievances,

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.760
which she presumed
were mainly about her.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.690
They were a united front and
in a small house all four

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:27.040
of them had five years
they are glad to remember.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:36.550
And then me -- thank you.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:50.160
Where were you when you were 15?

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.720
Close your eyes and try to recall?

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:59.120
I lived in a bedroom
with a brass bed,

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.010
with a blue-and-white striped
Laura Ashley comforter.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:03.700
There were matching
valances on my windows,

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.960
and I had a window rolled top
desk with a drawer that locked

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.290
and held my secrets, including
dirty letters that I couldn't

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:13.790
at the time translate from a
German boy who had been the object

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.660
of a minor summer music
camp romance.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:21.100 position:56%
I was awkward and insecure, confused
about how to find my place in life.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.920
Often I was lonely.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.420
All of this was true despite
the fact that I was hurtling

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.200 position:56%
into my junior year of high school
as captain of my varsity track team.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.380
I was younger than most of my
classmates in Claremont High School

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.390
and my friends all had
their driver's licenses

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.810
by the start of junior year.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.050
I was not, however, allowed
to ride in their cars.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.500
The only time I ever got
grounded in high school was

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.060 position:56%
when my librarian mother caught me
sneaking a ride with a friend to get

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.160
to my French class
at the local college.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:52.980
I grew up in a college town, a
faculty brat, a nerd you can tell,

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.530
where everyone knew my mom and dad.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.990
My parents had made a critical
decision early in the lives

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:00.810
of my younger brother Mark
and me that regardless

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:04.280
of what career opportunities came
my father's way they wouldn't move

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.380
until we had graduated
from high school.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.200
I grew up in one place
where everyone knew me.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.650
I couldn't even get away with
sneaking to my college courses.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.830
Which of us does not remember
what life was like at 15.

00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:19.950
The torments of adolescence
leave indelible marks.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.740
Eight years after I got
grounded for sneaking to class

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.260
in that friend's car my 15-year-old
cousin, Michael Alexander Allen,

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.660
who also didn't yet
have a driver's license,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.070
was arrested for the first time
for an attempted carjacking.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.140
A few months later, after he
turned 16, he sat in Torrance,

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.460
California in court, the
standard swinging gates,

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.090
just inside the doors of the
courtroom, hands cuffed there

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:48.210
and in an orange suit in
December 1995 and January 1996,

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:53.190
as a judge determined that he
would be charged as an adult.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:58.670
So writing this story to answer
the why questions took working

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.940
with family members, interviews,
working through a mystery.

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.330
It took the state level
equivalent of Freedom

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.500
of Information Act
requests to California.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.560
Like I could give you a long
story about why it took that.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.150
It was very hard to get Michael's
records, the police reports,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.280
judicial records and
things like that.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.980
But so it was a matter of
piecing through a mystery,

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.650
but a part of the work of piecing
through the mystery was also

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.160
about breaking through shame.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.690
These kinds of experiences,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.380
these kinds of stories
bring shame with them.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:34.100
And the result of their shame
nobody talks to each other.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.390
So one of the most painful
things that I have to admit is

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.040
that it wasn't until I
started working on this book

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.620
that my family talked about
what happened to Michael.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.170
Literally.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:50.340
Not even his mother and siblings,
they had never talked about it.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.700
And so two things came out
of that process of talking

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.080
about it together,
two powerful things.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.670
One was that Michael in the
last, before he was arrested

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.650
when he was 15, so late 13,
early 14 he had started flirting

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.990
with gangs in Los Angeles.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.830 position:56%
Crips and Bloods, very unusual thing
to do, to be flirting with both.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.430
This was because he'd come from
outside of LA, was moving back

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:14.950
into LA, he didn't belong anywhere.

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:16.470
He was trying to figure
out where he fit.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.940
He had just -- the family had
been devastated by a bad marriage

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.300
that Karen made when Michael was
10, and he had moved five times

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.450
in five years, changing
school midyear and so forth.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.920
And he came into LA disconnected,
isolated, leaving a community

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.720 position:56%
in the early '90s when violent crime
in Los Angeles was at its peak,

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.020
gang activity was high,

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:42.330
and the criminal justice system
had become so incredibly punitive.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.500
And at any rate nobody, we didn't
know that he was doing this.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.800
His mother didn't know.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.100
We didn't figure it out till now,

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.940
till I was working on
this book, all right?

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.020
This is what I mean
about shame and silence.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.320
And what it turns out is

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.820
like everybody had a
little piece of the story.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.190
Somebody knew that Michael had
been doing a little bit of this,

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:01.430
but they thought that's all it was
and so they never said anything.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.050
And somebody else had another
little bit, a piece of the story

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.350
and so they never said anything.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:09.170
So one of the key lessons for me in
this whole experience has just been

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.510
about the importance of bringing
these stories to the surface

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:16.330
and the importance especially
for young people ages 10 to 14,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.870
of the adults in their lives,
like break through the shame,

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:21.360
break through the trouble,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.280
break through the competition,
break through the envy.

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.920
You've got to talk to each
other and it's the only way

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.470
to shepherd young people through
an incredibly difficult time.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.180
Difficult for any adolescent.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.730
I desired mobility in the same
way that Michael desired mobility.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:39.650
I was lucky, my desire for
mobility led me to do things,

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:43.740
break rules in a really
safe, low risk environment.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.220
The same desire inspired Michael.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.360
There's not that much
difference in desire that we had,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.910
but the conditions in
which we were acting

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.380
on our desires were
incredibly different.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.760
And the adults around Michael,

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.900
we all have to take
responsibility for that.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.980
By the same token the nature of the
environment which he found himself

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:05.140
in in Los Angeles was a product of
the war on drugs and the decision

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.670
by this country to take
a very common practice,

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:11.660
for example of marijuana
use, and to make it illegal

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:17.280
and to put a huge just burden
of secrecy on that world.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.670
And there's a lot more
to be said about that,

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.000
about the way in which the war on
drugs has made it harder to parent

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.800
through adolescence, has also
taken people to prison unjustly,

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.060
and more significantly though has
built-up a black market economy

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:36.700
that constitutes in some sense
a parastate that runs parallel

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:41.070
to the legal state, with incredibly
powerful mechanisms of sanction,

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.820
itself, that counteract
the mechanisms

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.350 position:56%
of sanction in the legitimate state.

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.200
And there's a war going on
between these two states

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.470
in which young people are caught
over and over and over again.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.040
So the story that I am
trying to tell is really one

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.260
about how we think
about young people,

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.380
how we think about the
opportunities we present to them,

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:03.410
how we protect them, how we make
the world safe for them and ensure

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.550
that their potential
can be developed.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.080
So let me, I know I'm running out
of time, so I want to go ahead

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.600
and just give you some
of Michael's voice

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.430
and then one little
bit more of my voice.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:20.180
And I hope I've given you a rough
picture of what's in this book.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.640
It's a little hard to describe it.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.940
I'm used to writing books that
are straightforward arguments,

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.590
and I can just say point
one, point two, point three.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.270
So this is a little different.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:35.200
Okay, let's see.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:41.690
So I'm just going to read
you the very last paragraph

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.560
of Michael's essay on the Inferno.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:50.050
The title of his essay is,
the final title was Two Hells,

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.820
In Survival, Finding One's Self.

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.910
The handwritten copy of the essay
that he sent me had the change

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:59.230
of the title, he had first written
In Suffering Finding One's Self,

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.870
and then he crossed out
Suffering and changed it

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.820
to Survival, Finding One's Self.

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.670
The last paragraph.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:10.180
And like Dante I am forced
to descend lower into hell

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.340
to achieve a full awakening.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.020
I am forced into depression,
scarred by obscenities.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.160
War after war, but each war
that I survive I'm a step closer

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.880
to a full awakening of self.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.530
My hell is no longer
demonstrating what I am capable

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.970
of doing in order to survive.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:32.460
It has become what I can tolerate
and withstand in order to live.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.980
I cannot help but to
judge those around me.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.180
I am one of them, but we
are far from the same.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.180
Like Dante I am cursed with
the spirit of discernment,

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.340
which allows us to see
the truth for what it is.

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.470
There are those whom I despise
who are truly sick beyond healing

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.510
and they should never
leave this place.

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.380
Then there are those who await
to fulfill their destiny.

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:57.510 position:56%
I see them as sincere and apologetic
heart for their illness deeds.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.990
They are the ones who will
change the world positively

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.660
or positively change
someone's world.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:05.090
Hell cannot hold the
latter of the two opposites,

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.700 position:56%
but in time will only spit them back

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.540
out into society to
do what is right.

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.830
The hell that I live
in cannot hold Dante.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:14.480
It'll contest and try one's self,

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.020
but it cannot hold Dante
and it will not hold me.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.840
And the inferno, the
dead are trapped forever.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.670
Surely the biggest and most
important difference in the inferno

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:31.280
and my hell called prison
is that I have a way out.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.280
So that's Michael.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:41.150
And then a little teeny bit more
about me, and this bit I'm going

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.090
to read about myself again
is you try to make the point

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:47.060
about how hard it is to
get these stories out.

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:48.800
When I ended up giving
these lectures,

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.750
did give his lectures
originally, I was astonished

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.950
by how many people came up to me
afterwards and said, you know,

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.870
I have a family member in prison,
too, and I've never told anybody.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.010
And this wasn't just black people,
it was white people, as well.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.960
And when you stop and think about
it it's not surprising, right?

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.390
Two million people are in
prison in this country.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:12.330
So like presuming each of them is
connected to somewhere between 10

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:16.670
and 40 other people we're talking
like 20 to 80 million people

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:22.740
who are currently being affected
by incarceration in this country.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.810
We have 5% of the world's
population,

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.900
but 25% of its incarcerated
population.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:34.790
The world has never seen a penal
system like this, ever, ever.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.730 position:56%
I'm a classicist, this is antiquity.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.030
Like I think of the whole span of
human time, nothing has been built

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.910
like this, ever, and we've
built it, we've done it.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.990
I just believe we have to get
the stories to the surface.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.200
So this, I'm just going
to read two sections

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.410
of chapters called Visiting 1.0

00:25:54.410 --> 00:26:08.500
and Visiting 2.0 and
I'll just read them.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.970
So, let's see.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:14.320
As Michael, known to the
system as K10033, wrote --

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.000
inmates went by numbers, not names,

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.850
and visiting days were
allocated to sets of numbers.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.210
Half of the evens on one Saturday,
half of the odds on Sunday,

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.990
the other halves of each
set the following week.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.000
Before you could even begin
to visit you first had

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.730
to apply for permission to enter.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.720
You had to get your
name on the list.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.600
This could take months and then the
visits, themselves, were odysseys.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.820
You generally set out at about
four or five in the morning,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.520
in half dark of predawn, and drove
straight toward the rising sun

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.820
in order to get to the prison

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.470
by six-thirty a.m. There
we would join the line

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.090
of waiting cars sneaking from
the parking lot past a row

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:52.070
of suburban baseball fields
that bordered the prison.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.100 position:56%
At seven-thirty a.m. the guards with
a parade of Kia's and Hyundai's,

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.510
Chevy's and Dodge's
into the parking lot.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:00.480
And then you would sign in
at a lectern at the front

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.550
of a canopied structure with wooden
benches that looked something

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.470
like a tent revival meeting.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.160
Hosts of mainly black and brown
women, but white women, too,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.670
and many children and
some men footed

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.820
in the shadows under the canopy.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.780
We could take in up to
$30 in quarters or singles

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.180
in plastic baggies and we
always took the maximum.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.950
The point of this was to purchase
treats for the inmates from the row

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.580
of vending machines
dispensing, as it turned out,

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.570
quite disgusting microwaveable
cheeseburgers and burritos along

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.350
with mystery meat plates.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.960
It also mattered how you dressed,
you couldn't wear blue denim

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.260
because that's what the inmates
wore, you couldn't wear beige

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:37.290
or khaki because that's
what the guards wore,

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:39.320
you couldn't wear tight clothes
or clothes that showed cleavage

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.720
or skirts shorter than two inches
above the knee or sleeves shorter

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.650
than two inches below the shoulder.

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:45.780
If you were dressed
wrong you weren't let in.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.580
You always took a backup
set of clothes just in case.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.920
If there was a focal point

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.730
of the control I suppose it was
the attempt to target desire.

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.760
And then Visiting 2.0.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.520
Time for my own confession.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.390
I wrote that last chapter
like an academic, which I am.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:08.680
The description of visiting
that I gave you wasn't about me,

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.080
it was about some disembodied you.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.660
To write that chapter I stepped

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.080
into the perspective
of an outside observer.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.750
The luxury afforded to academics

00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:20.220
when they travel the world
encountering pain and injustice.

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.740
To be an academic is
to acquire an excuse

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:25.360
for not owning the pain you see.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.950
I'll have to try again to describe
what visiting Michael meant to me.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.450
The fact that I told you the story

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.360
as an academic already tells
you everything you need to know.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:37.570
That wound of visiting
Michael in prison goes so deep,

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.360
but somehow you wouldn't
write the book.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.370
I found it hard to own
up to one simple fact,

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.810
I went to prison, I was in prison.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:51.150
No, I don't mean that I've been
arrested or convicted of a crime.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:55.090 position:56%
I have avoided that because thus far
in life I've had that combination

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:58.580
of goods that the ancient Greek
philosopher Aristotle thought was

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.930
necessary for a happy life --

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:05.960
resources, decent character
and luck.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.110
My father and mother gave
me the first two items

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.810
in that treasure chest.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.490
The Lord, my God whom I believed in
as a child and then did not believe

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.230
in and then became to believe in
again as I emerged from periods

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.780
of great pain has given
me the third.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.850
All right, so now you know more
about me than anybody other

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:28.030
than my husband, my
second husband that is.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.500
Our wedding took place barely a
month before Michael's murder.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.940
That photo that was up there
before was from the wedding.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.090
But, no, I was not in prison
as a convict and this is thanks

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:41.010
to my father, my mother and my God.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.310
Even as someone who could come

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.820
and go I felt the prison's
mark, it's branding fork.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.420
I felt it in my soul, even
though all I was there was a

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.760
day's sojourner.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.560
Thank you.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:20.080
[ Applause ]

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:26.030
I think we have 15 minutes roughly,
12 to be precise, for questions.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.330
Thank you.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:31.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi, Dr. Allen, I read the excerpt
of your book in The New Yorker.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.060
It was very, very powerful.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.360
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: Thanks.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And in that you talk a little bit
about some of the factors that led

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:41.960
to the system of laws that
would lead your cousin

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.810
to the harsh sentence that he had.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.110
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: Right.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:46.410
&gt;&gt; So young.

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.060
I wonder if in the course of your
research you had the opportunity

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.270
to speak with any of the
legislators who were responsible

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:57.770
for that tough penal system and
if any of them are now interested

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.780
in changing that or just,
you know, I know the purpose

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.660
of your book is not
explicitly advocacy,

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:08.070
but it's kind of the next logical
question is how do we change the

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.950
system that has led to Michael

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.480
and so many others
being caught up in this?

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.430
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: So
it's a great question.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:18.890
And I think I want to say
two things in response to it.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:24.400
Another feature of
writing the book has been

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:31.130
about confronting the strange
way in which capable people cease

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.720
to be capable in relationship

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.770
to their own experiences
of tragedy or trauma.

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:42.290
So my family has plenty
of professionals

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:44.720
and accomplished people
in it, and you would think

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.750
that we would have jumped right on
it and sort of been on this issue.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:52.780
And we haven't been, so partly
I have needed to explain that.

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:58.130
But so then to the second point,
so I am working in various ways

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.130
on criminal justice reform.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:04.160
And, in particular, focused on
the issue of mandatory minimums

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:09.330
and trying to roll back from that
regime, and also working on efforts

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:14.760 position:56%
to switch our approach to illegal
drugs from criminal justice paradigm

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.680
to a public health and health
and wellbeing paradigm.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.820
And there's good examples
from Portugal,

00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:22.200
other ways in which you can use
a combination of legalization

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.640
and decriminalization to really
change not just the profile

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:27.390
of drug use but also the ways

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.220
in which young people encounter
the criminal justice system.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.000
But with regard to your point about
people change their minds or views,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.250 position:56%
I mean California is changing,
California just legalized marijuana.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.020
They had a measure just
a couple of years ago

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.790
where they reduced the severity of
the three strikes you're out law.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:51.280
And then the other thing that is a
note of hope is this is, in fact,

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.710
a bipartisan view, the notion
that we've gone way too far

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.440
with the severity of our
criminal justice system, in fact,

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.470
unites people across party lines.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:03.260
So I haven't spoken to any of
the people who put the laws

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.820
through in the early '90s that did

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:10.180
so much damage, but
there is a change.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:13.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.660
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you
for writing this book.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.640
I've read part of it and
it's intensely moving

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.090
and I want to thank you.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.050
I have a question, this may
be just a tiny bit academic,

00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:26.860
which is I'm fascinated by
this idea of the parastate

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:29.020
that you have in this book.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:33.750
And I've been thinking about some
ideas that come out of some things

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.430
that have been discussed recently,

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.220
particularly there was a two-part
series on one of the cable networks

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.660
about the drug wars,
and it pushed this idea

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:47.050
that there has been throughout
this period there's been high level

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:51.260
collusion literally between
the intelligence community

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.410
and the drug barons and so forth.

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:58.150 position:56%
And that there's something, it's not
just the parastate versus the state,

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.400
that there's ties there ...

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.700
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: Right.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.700
&gt;&gt; ... that maybe helped to
enmesh people like your cousin.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.000
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: Right.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.320
&gt;&gt; And I'm wondering does this
enter into your thinking, at all,

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.230
and in what way possibly?

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.450
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: So that's a
big and complicated question.

00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:15.950
So I should first probably just
define the parastate concept

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:19.610
for folks who haven't encountered
it yet in my essay or in the book.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:23.920
So basically the argument
of the book is that over --

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.180
the end, in the end
there is an argument

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.670
because I don't not make arguments.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:34.220
But that over the course
of the '80s and '90s

00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.440
because of the way this
country fought the war

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:43.400
on drugs there was increasing
intensification of sort of state

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.230
like development of the criminal
organizations trafficking

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.520
in narcotics, by which I mean
foreign cartels for the most part,

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.710
and the ways in which they
control their distribution system

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.860
in the US constitutes the kind

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.720
of competitive state
system to US states.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.610
That's what the parastate idea is.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:05.450
And the question of the
role of US intelligence

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:09.160 position:56%
in all this has come up, so even I
think it's the Department of Justice

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:14.060
in the 1980s was obliged to
do an investigation of whether

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:19.540
or not the CIA had facilitated
exchanges of weapons for drugs

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.780
as part of the sort of contra
related stuff in Central America.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.610
And they decided in the end

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.380
that there had not been
intentional collusion,

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.530
but that there had been
overlapping forms of affiliation.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:37.870
And so it is certainly the case
that like the single biggest hole

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.680
in our foreign policy conversation

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.150
in this country is
Central and South America.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.420
And what the war on drugs
has done to those regions,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.530
the degree of instability that
they experience is deeply connected

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.890
to how this country has
fought the war on drugs.

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:56.260
And it's worth just remembering

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.550
who knows how much
Americans spend every year

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.280
on illegal drugs, anybody know?

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:07.050
A hundred billion dollars
a year for each

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.320
of the last, for the last decade.

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:15.800
It's like we're just pretending
it's not there and that's foolish.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:23.640
Oh, I'm sorry, go back to this
mike and I'll be back over here.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.940
Thank you.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.140
&gt;&gt; I appreciate your book and
I look forward to reading it,

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:31.390
as I've only read excerpts
at this point,

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:35.350
and I appreciate your
presentation today.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:41.740
But you spoke about the
prosecutorial discretion,

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.090
but what about once
a person is in prison

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:50.850
and the inhumanity,
the lack of dignity?

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:57.000
And there are people who think that
people go to prison for punishment,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.680
yes, but it appears that
they go as punishment.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.150
I mean they're punished even
worse when they're there

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:07.500
and they're treated in such an
inhumane way, and I say this

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.500
because I worked as a law
librarian in the prison and I came

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.970 position:56%
as a person who was a law librarian.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:20.320
And I was always butting
heads with the administrators

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.610
until I finally left after
three years because I refused

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:25.740
to treat people in an inhumane way.

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.370
Can you speak to that,
man's inhumanity to man?

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.670
Thank you.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:32.970
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: Thank you.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.770
So I mean I think you probably
all know the basic story

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:40.640 position:56%
that there's sort of three different
ways you can think about punishment.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.550
It's for rehabilitation, it's for
retribution or it's for deterrence.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:48.580
And this country had an orientation
for its rehabilitation in the '60s

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:53.050
and '70s that gave way and that was
pulled out of the prison system.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.190
And it was replaced, but people
usually say that it was replaced

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.730
by a retributive turn, a
sort of vindicative turn.

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:00.640
I think that's actually
wrong, it's the wrong way

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.230
of thinking about what happened.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:04.890
I think it was replaced
by a turn to deterrence.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:09.270
Now the reason that matters is
because the point of retribution is

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.330
like it's the whole
eye for an eye idea,

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.320
like there should be
proportionality.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.370
So in Michael's attempted
carjacking the good news

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:18.280
about this terrible incident
is that the only person

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.640
who was hurt was Michael.

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.750
So his victim got his gun
and shot him through the neck

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.260
and he got a sentence of 13 years,

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.670
and that in my view
is disproportionate.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:33.390
So retributive punishment would
have been call it four years,

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.220
something like that, all right?

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.520
From my point of view.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.820
The point of the deterrent
punishments was

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.360
that there was this aggregate
experience of carjackings

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.380
that the society was trying to shut
down and so it was that aggregate

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.680
that was being targeted

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.110
and so particular cases
couldn't be directly addressed.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.440
But so the first instance
we need proportionality back

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.820
in the criminal justice
system, but then we also need

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.540
to bring rehabilitation back in.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.500
Because as the focus
went to deterrence

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.410
in the '90s education got
stripped out of prisons,

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.830
and this is to the
point about humanity.

00:39:01.830 --> 00:39:04.910 position:56%
People were not given the
opportunities to develop themselves,

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:08.270
so there weren't college
courses available any longer,

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:11.030
there was not support for Pell
grants for prisoners and things

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:15.460
like that, so beyond the GED they
couldn't continue their education

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:16.820
and that's just one example.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.140
I mean prison is a
very brutal place.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:23.060
And if you want really kind of
textured sense of that, too,

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:27.390
there's a good book by a guy named
Duane Betts, who also was convicted

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:30.520
of -- in his case I think a
carjacking, an attempted one,

00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.570
when he was also I think 15.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.560
He's recently graduated
from Yale Law School,

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.680
he's now doing a Ph.D.
at Yale Law School.

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:39.730
But he -- I can't remember the
title of his book, but Duane Betts,

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.840
B-e-t-t-s, gives a great account
of what his experience was

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.420
like as an incarcerated person.

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.490
So my book is kind of
like the perspective

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:51.390
of the women visiting, okay?

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:54.850
And Duane's book is like the
perspective of the kid inside.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.250
And then you have Michael's voice
in the middle of this one as some

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.810
of the perspective
of the kid inside.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:22.090
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:22.090 --> 00:40:25.040
&gt;&gt; Professor Allen, I'd like
to thank you for all your work.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.240 position:56%
I'd especially like to thank you for
your work on mandatory sentencing,

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.430
which not only messes with
the notion of three branches

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:37.790
of Government but also
challenges the concept

00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.420
of the faculty of judgment.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.720
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: Right.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.080
&gt;&gt; For the judicial sector.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.380
Thank you for that.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:47.410
I wanted to ask you when
you all visited your cousin

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:52.030
in prison how did you go
there, who went with you,

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:58.050
and what did you all talk about on
the way there and on the way back?

00:40:58.050 --> 00:40:59.930
&gt;&gt; Danielle Allen: So I
have two minutes left,

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.460
so I'll just read you a little
bit more that will answer

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.170
that question for you, okay?

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.400
It comes right after the
section I read you where I talked

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:13.540
about my parents and my God.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:18.740
So, let's see, okay,
I've got two minutes.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.720
Okay, I think I'm going to
do it in two minutes, okay?

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.020
Here we go.

00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.320
So the short answer is --

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.200
well, anyway, it's in
here, I'll just read it.

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.900
So I said I was there
as a day's sojourner.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.090
What exactly did I feel?

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.600
The women were gloriously
flamboyant in their dress.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.570 position:56%
Not me, I'm a bookworm and more or
less dress like one, a lot of black.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:45.050
Now and then some bright color,

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:47.940 position:56%
but for these prison trips I
probably pretty much always wore all

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.550
black, black T-shirts, black
linen pants, tennis shoes.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.070
You have to do something
to lift your spirit

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.610
up when you go into the prisons.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.970
I didn't do it with clothes,
I did it with conversation.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:01.350
I understand the show, the color,
the makeup, but I wasn't there

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:05.260
to visit a boyfriend, I was there
to visit an Allen, one proud member

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.390
of a proud family come to see
another, both of us trying

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.750
to pretend that we
had not been broken.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.350
We talked about ideas,
about books and people,

00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:16.350
about freedom and politics.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.890
To explain why I was there in
that prison I could try to say

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.180
that Allen's have a fierce bond
and that we stick by our own.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.420
This would be right and
wrong at the same time.

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.490
The right part about that story
has to do with our all being sprung

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.350
from J.P. Allen, North Floridian
Island fisherman turned Baptist

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:34.340
preacher, patriarchal head
of a sprawling family,

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:37.300
half of it official, half
of it enjoyed in secret.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:40.410
For this reason J.P.'s progeny
extended to a cousinage that adds

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.300
up to an uncountable number.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.360 position:56%
There's surely not one of us from
either official or the secret branch

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.420
who does not have in our should the
sights and sounds of tall, bald,

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:52.630
lean and leonine J.P.,
thundering from a church pulpit

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:54.570
in gorgeous gospel baritone.

00:42:54.570 --> 00:43:00.090 position:56%
He is a battle ax in time of battle,
he's a battle ax in time of battle,

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.840 position:56%
he's a shelter in the time of storm.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.960
We are fighters, we Allen's, and
sometimes we fight with each other.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.620
That's where the idea of Allen's
should stick together breaks down.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.310
The whole tribe is full
of its broken branches,

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:17.590
but for those who haven't fallen
into fights the bond is adamantine.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.830
The difficulty of visiting
the prisons was the pain

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:23.770
that I just described, the fact
that we had been free people,

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.890
we knew ourselves as free
people, and we'd been broken.

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:30.700
Not many of my family members
could make those visits, actually.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.210
His mother always went.

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:33.610 position:56%
I went whenever I was in California,

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:37.090
meaning all summer and
Christmas holidays.

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:38.410
And his sister went sometimes.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.500
His brother was never
able to visit him.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.770
Few other family members
were able to visit him.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.850
People in prison don't
get visits that they need.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:55.040
