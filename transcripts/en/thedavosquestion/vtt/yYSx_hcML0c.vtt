[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:15.040
&gt;&gt; What I really think we need to do is make
FGM much more explicit.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.450
The data, the porosity of the data is shocking.
There is a lot that's out there.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.550
But how can we ascertain the global scale
of this issue if we don't

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.680
actually know what we're dealing with ?
The 3 million figure we're all quoting is

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.680
in Africa alone.
It doesn't tackle Indonesia, Yemen, UAE.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.011
It doesn't tackle Europe, where we know 500,000
women are living with

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.850
FGM.
So we don't understand the scale.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.800
We don't understand what needs to be done
on a country-by-country basis

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.570
to tackle the problem.
A solution in Indonesia is completely different

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.840
to what we need in
Cameroon, in Sierra Leone, as in Senegal.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.930
We need to be very, very cognizant of what
is the global action plan?

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.279
Without that, we can't cost a solution.
If this is a matter of resources, then great.

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:15.829
Let's just get on and fundraise.
But until we are much more aware about the

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.039
global scale of this problem
and what needs to be done about it, we can't

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.779
reach that target of 2015.
I think very kind offer from an NGO already

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:29.719
working in this field ---
thank you, I'll be in touch -- but equally,

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:34.509
all the NGOs working in
this area, please get FGM on your agenda.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.209
Do something more about it.
And I've run out of steam.

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.500
Go to my my website.
There are five easy things that you can do.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.889
They may seem little things.
But lastly, do what you can.

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:52.659
This is going out to the YouTube community.
They'll be people watching all over the world.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.130
I chose to enter a competition on Davos; you
may want to find out what

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.679
is happening in your local community.
You may wish to fundraise.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.200
You may wish to push your government on various
things or your MP.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.140
Know what your action is; what your agency
is.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.019
And please just do something.
It's international FGM day, sorry.

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.950
International anti-FGM day on the sixth of
February.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.430
That's a week from today.
Contact a journalist.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.560
Talk about FGM. Thank you.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.319
&gt;&gt;Don't feel you have to contact this journalist
in particular.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.329
I'm already on board.
Ann?

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.110
&gt;&gt; Well, certainly I would agree with all
that's been said.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.430
But I think it's -- first of all, so important
to recognize that this

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.379
is first and foremost a violation of the rights
of the girl child.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.010
Think about the fact that most of the people,
the children who are

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.170
subjected to this are between about the ages
of 4 and maybe 12.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:04.830
I mean, this is a human being that really
doesn't have the right to say

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.390
no.
It's imposed on her.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.999
The second thing I would say is that everyone
should look at those

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:18.019
organizations that are working in this arena.
It isn't a popular cause.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.629
These organizations can't generate lots of
resources for their work.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:27.239
And so support those organizations that are
truly making a difference

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.879
in this area.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.329
&gt;&gt; Um, let me just also say finally that,
you know, this is indeed just

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.340
part of a broader puzzle.
And that quite aside from the simple moral

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.260
issue, it's imminently
practical issue we're not going to make progress

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.719
against global
poverty, against insecurity unless girls are

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.889
brought into the picture
brought into the formal economy, educated,

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.879
and so on.
This is one facet of that larger picture.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.599
And then we really hope that you whether you're
here, right here, or

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:07.280
watching on YouTube, you will get engaged.
And I think Julia really deserves our thanks

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.849
and appreciation for
bringing this issue to Davos and to YouTube

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.340
to the Davos debate.
And please join me in thanking her and all

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.880
of the panelists here today.
