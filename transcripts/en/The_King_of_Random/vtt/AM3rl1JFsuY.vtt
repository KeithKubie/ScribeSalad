00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.362
Acetone, one of the world's
most popular solvents.

00:00:03.362 --> 00:00:07.080
Polystyrene, one of the world's
most popular plastics.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.606
What happens when
they go toe to toe?

00:00:09.606 --> 00:00:11.400
Find out tonight.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.560
[Music]

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.760
Acetone is a common solvent.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.400
Polystyrene is easily dissolved.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.300
We want to see how much

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.285
and how fast we can dissolve
this stuff in acetone.

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:26.285
Guys, in the past,

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:28.600
you watched us melt
a Millennium Falcon,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.900
which contaminated
a lot of acetone.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.200
We still have a lot
of acetone left.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.600
Like a lot of acetone left.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.000
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.399
We've got lots of polystyrene.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.699
We've got lots of acetone.

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:41.477
We're going to see

00:00:41.477 --> 00:00:44.083
how much of the polystyrene
can dissolve into that acetone,

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:46.880
and then try out some creative
ways of combining the two.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.400
Guys, acetone is
a very popular solvent.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.972
And in fact, it's a very
popular nail polish remover

00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:53.031
when it's diluted.

00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:55.200
So you've probably seen
how effective it is

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.000
when it takes off
nail polish or even paint.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.100
We want to show you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.080
what it does when it melts down
different types of polystyrene.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.440
Usually, you refer
to it as styrofoam.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.600
Technically, styrofoam is
a brand name of one type

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.660
of extruded polystyrene.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.400
That's a closed
cell type of foam.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.100
It's used for insulation,
building materials,

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.600
and a few other
things like that.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.559
It's become a pretty common term

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.360
to describe any extruded
or expanded polystyrene.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.800
These things happen.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.440
Regardless of what it's called,
we're going to melt some of it.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:33.180
[Music]

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.000
If you have ever used
nail polish remover before,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.500
or even been around someone

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.300
who's used nail
polish remover before,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.142
you probably recognize
the scent of acetone.

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:42.980
It's almost sweet,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.340
but you can tell that there's
definitely a chemical there.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.500
And if you get a lot of it,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.300
it's going to burn your sinuses
and your nostrils quite a bit.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.300
So be careful.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.200
You only want to be using

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.140
this stuff somewhere
with good ventilation.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.720
So let's actually talk

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:57.148
about some of the safety
precautions you want to take

00:01:57.148 --> 00:01:59.088
if you're handling
just straight acetone.

00:01:59.088 --> 00:02:02.088
Technically, your body produces
acetone in minute quantities.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.600
We're talking about if a couple

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200
of drops somehow accidentally
ended up in your mouth,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.600
it would be uncomfortable,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.095
but it wouldn't kill you.

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.256
If you do accidentally swallow any,
call Poison Control.

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:13.750
I bet it says that on it.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.633
It says that on the container.

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:17.265
Basically, one entire side

00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:19.640
of this canister
is just a warning.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.600
If it gets on your skin,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.700
in most cases,
it will just dry it out,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.780
and it can
cause some irritation,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.500
and it'll make
it extremely cold.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.050
That's not because acetone
itself is extremely cold.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.450
That's the evaporation rate.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.891
The faster something evaporates,

00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:33.550
the colder your skin
is going to get

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.900
if it's in contact with it.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.200
If I dip my finger in there,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.500
it cools it off because it
evaporates so quickly.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.180
It's even cooler than water.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.750
Now, if it hits your eyes,
you can have severe irritation.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.200
Again, call Poison Control.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.700
But skin, nails,
it's going to dry them out.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.700
But other than that,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.600
there's not going to be
a lot of harm done.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.600
So we're standing
in a well-ventilated area.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.700
We're pretty covered,
just as a precaution.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.303
We're wearing nitrile gloves,

00:02:56.303 --> 00:02:58.500
and nitrile actually
is susceptible to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.140
acetone's melting effects.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.800
So if you were to leave
this glove in there,

00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:05.091
as you probably have seen
in our Lego video,

00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:06.766
they would just fall apart.

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:08.800
So short amount
of time, you're fine,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.800
but not for too long.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.460
Something else to look at,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.200
we are talking about
how it evaporates quickly.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.300
You can watch
how fast this evaporates.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.480
And it's gone.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.100
That's actually really
cool to watch.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.700
We've got a little bit
of this expanded polystyrene,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.820
and let's use this
as a first test.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.820
We're just going to dip this in

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.950
for a second, and see
what it does to the ends.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.500
You can already
hear it hissing,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.479
and falling apart.

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.200
So that was dipped in there
for like half a second,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.400
and just immediately
starts ruining it.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.014
Dipping it at a bit of an angle,

00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:38.964
so you can see more
clearly where it has

00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:39.900
and has not touched.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.500
Enough of it was
any acetone that time

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.000
that actually dripped down in,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and now, we have
this gooey polystyrene liquid.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:18.600
[Music]

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.160
That's what's left.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.100
That whole brick

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.300
that I had has now
just been dissolved

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.500
into this liquid white goop.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.340
You can actually see that
underneath the melted plastic,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.500
Nate's gloves are
also falling apart.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.400
It just like loses its cohesion,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.000
and is starting to like
expand a little bit.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.500
Whereas on this hand,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.100
the gloves are
fairly tight fitting.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.300
On this hand, everywhere

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.600
that I've been putting
in the acetone,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.260
it's just loose
and hanging off now.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.720
All right, that was awesome.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.600
But I think we need to scale
that up a little bit.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.080
[Music]

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.194
Normally, acetone
is extremely clear.

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:56.100
This is acetone

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.158
that we did used
to dissolve Lego in,

00:04:58.158 --> 00:05:01.100
and they didn't get
completely cloudy or destroyed,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.040
but I think it's not quite as
clear as new acetone would be.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.900
This isn't our most
contaminated batch,

00:05:06.904 --> 00:05:08.115
but it is contaminated.

00:05:08.115 --> 00:05:08.915
That's true.

00:05:08.915 --> 00:05:10.600
Again, if you saw the Lego video

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.000
where we melted the Millennium
Falcon in acetone,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.405
the first time we tried it,

00:05:14.405 --> 00:05:17.147
we had some off-brand Lego
sheets with some different

00:05:17.147 --> 00:05:18.148
formula of plastic,

00:05:18.148 --> 00:05:20.200
and it just turned
it like light blue.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.400
And as far as I can tell,
it's still like that.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.800
It hasn't changed a bit.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.600
What's next?

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.700
We should know more stuff.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.900
So as we scale this up,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.700
we're going to start dyeing some
of our acetone different colors.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.886
This one's going to be green,

00:05:30.886 --> 00:05:33.142
mostly because this is really
reminding me of the dip

00:05:33.142 --> 00:05:34.400
from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.700
He's never seen it.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.260
Sorry.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.260
[Music]

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.840
Wish this was shoe shaped.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.700
He doesn't understand
that reference.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.340
But neither do a lot of you.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.040
Ha!

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.240
I know a bunch of you
weren't even born

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:49.990
when that movie came out.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.070
I'm gonna melt some stuff now.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.900
Really does look
like it's dissolving in acid.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.900
That's pretty great.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.400
Well now I just feel sad.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.540
But not enough to stop.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:13.860
[Music]

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.780
I can actually watch it just,

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.580
as he's pushing it down,
just it feeding up.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:32.900
[Music]

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.000
We've now put some polystyrene
into the acetone.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.022
I'm curious what happens

00:06:36.022 --> 00:06:38.720
if we apply the acetone
to the polystyrene.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.400
We've got a couple methods
we want to try.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.080
Coming up is the spray bottle.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.100
Polystyrene, we're using expanded
and extruded polystyrene.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.280
There is also
non-extruded polystyrene,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.600
and that's usually
in the form of a thin plastic,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.100
many plastic cups.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.700
If you have a white plastic cup,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.000
there's a good chance
that that is polystyrene.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.600
You'll be able to tell
by looking on the bottom,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.800
and if inside,

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.860
a little triangle
about recycling, it says PS,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.460
that's for polystyrene.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.160
Don't put acetone
in one of those cups,

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:08.200
you'll dissolve it.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.840
This is HPDE.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.120
It does not dissolve in acetone.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.700
Spray bottle full
of purple acetone,

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.100
and some white
expanded polystyrene.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.500
See how this goes.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.680
[Music]

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.800
Can definitely see the spray
pattern of this bottle.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.600
A new way to make cosplay armor,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.061
or decorate anything
out of foam.

00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:32.292
This is awesome.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:45.720
[Music]

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.780
We've seen great results
with the expanded polystyrene.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.840
This stuff is
the extruded polystyrene.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.600
It's not quite
the same texture,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.880
little more dense,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.500
makes a more obnoxious sound
with gloved hands on it.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.300
You can stop that.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:00.800
Yeah.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.260
We can be done with that.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.380
We're going to try moving on
to our next application method,

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.280
the paint roller.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.420
What I'm not so sure about though

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.298
is what this paint roller
is made out of.

00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:12.298
So this may work,

00:08:12.298 --> 00:08:14.628
or it may just melt
the moment it touches it.

00:08:14.628 --> 00:08:15.900
We're going to find out.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:21.120
[Music]

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.400
It's really not rolling
very well anymore.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.283
Spreading.

00:08:24.283 --> 00:08:25.580
Wow.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.100
Well, whatever this paint
rollers made out of,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.100
it is very resistant
to this stuff.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.900
Let's try an actual clean roll.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.160
[Music]

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.220
This isn't a very
good paint roller.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.700
So the interesting thing is
the acetones evaporated so fast

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.600
that this is almost solid again.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.503
Like it's squishy,

00:08:43.503 --> 00:08:45.410
but it's not sticking
to my fingertips.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:55.280
[Music]

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.600
Huh, it rolls little easier
on this stuff.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.200
The acetone is absolutely
eating away at the expanded

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.360
polystyrene more so
than the extruded polystyrene.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.500
So that's kind of interesting.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.340
I want to do a side-by-side.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:17.740
[Music]

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.800
Okay, we are going to time

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.400
how long it takes to melt
8 feet of polystyrene.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.317
Let's see which
one goes faster,

00:09:23.317 --> 00:09:24.964
and how long each one takes.

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:26.552
First, establish the rules.

00:09:26.552 --> 00:09:28.358
We cannot push our pieces down.

00:09:28.358 --> 00:09:30.300
We are simply here
to steady them.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.700
On your mark, get set, go.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.800
Well, mine's just chasing yours.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.800
I'm holding it as upright
as this piece wants to go.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.000
It's just sort of floating.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.540
I mean, I knew yours
is going to go much faster.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.440
It's just--

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.500
Yours just has like
a structural integrity.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.540
[Music]

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.820
I didn't realize you had like
a two point lead on me already.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:02.840
[Music]

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.060
This was a fun game.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:05.430
All right.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.900
I am just past two
and a half feet,

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.320
and yours is gone.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.300
Very young.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:19.500
[Music]

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.300
At this point,

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.600
your piece has actually
started to change the color

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.400
of our dyed acetone.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.700
Like it started out reddish,

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.600
now, it's kind of got a bit
of a purple tone to it.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:40.660
[Music]

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:41.700
That's what's happening.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.200
That's what keeps
it breaking off.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.700
That's actually
really cool shape.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.580
And time.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.940
Not gone yet.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.380
Still going.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.100
3 and 1/2 minutes versus...

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.920
11 minutes, 55 seconds.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.240
So close.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.700
We could still melt a whole lot
of other stuff in there.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.300
Shall we?

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.200
We shall.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:25.200
[Music]

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:25.800
Guys, that's not all.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.222
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:11:27.222 --> 00:11:29.188
That box up at the top
is going to take you directly

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:29.882
to our last video.

00:11:29.882 --> 00:11:31.000
You should go check that out.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.400
The other boxes
going to show you

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.430
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.241
And if you're not subscribed
to the channel yet,

00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:37.539
hit this bomb to get
in the club.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.140
So you never miss out
on a cool video.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.120
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:11:40.126 --> 00:11:41.400
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.380
Talk to you then.
