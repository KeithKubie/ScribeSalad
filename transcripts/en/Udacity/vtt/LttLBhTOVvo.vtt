00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.939
By randomly assigning groups, the different groups on average will be similar

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.460
to each other. They will have about the same number of men and women, young and

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.140
old, and all different characteristics. With random assignment, we can say that

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.130
the two groups were equivalent at the start of the study. That way, any changes

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.164
at the end of the study are most likely due to our independent variable,

00:00:23.164 --> 00:00:28.000
caffeine. Random assignment helps to eliminate bias. There was a good reason

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.700
why we didn't want to use the other types of groups, such as male and female.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.920
Or the first half of the participants who showed up got caffeine, and the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.600
second half didn't get caffeine. There's something innately different between

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.260
those two groups. And by using random assignment, we don't have to worry about

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.599
that.
