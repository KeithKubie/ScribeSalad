00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.890
One of the greatest questionnaires in the
history of 20th-century psychology had a modest

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.401
start in the pages of a local Colorado newspaper
The Rocky Mountain News in July 1985. The

00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:17.950
work of two University of Denver psychologists
Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver, the questionnaire

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.720
asked readers to identify which of three statements
most closely reflected who they were in love.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.930
Image result for rocky mountains To hugely
improve our chances of thriving in relationships,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:38.300
we should dare to take the same test: A: I
find it relatively easy to get close to others

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.970
and am comfortable depending on them and having
them depend on me. I don’t worry about being

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.329
abandoned or about someone getting too close
to me. B: I find that others are reluctant

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.499
to get as close as I would like. I often worry
that my partner doesn’t really love me or

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:02.699
won’t want to stay with me. I want to get
very close to my partner, and this sometimes

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.660
scares people away. C: I am somewhat uncomfortable
being close to others; I find it difficult

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.730
to trust them completely, difficult to allow
myself to depend on them. I am nervous when

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:23.580
anyone gets too close, and often, others want
me to be more intimate than I feel comfortable

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:37.880
being. Behind the scenes, the options refer
to the three main styles of relating to others

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.430
first identified by the English psychologist
John Bowlby, the inventor of Attachment Theory

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.790
in the 1950s and 60s. Option A signals what
is known as a secure pattern of attachment,

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:00.670
whereby love and trust come easily. Option
B is known as anxious attachment, where one

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.830
longs to be intimate with others but is continuously
scared of letdown and often precipitates crises

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.290
in relationships through counter-productively
aggressive behaviour. And Option C refers

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.690
to the avoidant pattern of attachment, where
it feels much easier to avoid the dangers

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.359
of intimacy through solitary activities and
emotional withdrawal. Questionnaires in newspapers

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:33.290
are rarely of much use but Hazan’s and Shaver’s
is the momentous exception. If there is one

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.799
thing we should do to improve our relationships,
it is to know which of the three categories

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:47.469
we predominantly belong to – and to deploy
the knowledge in love so as to warn ourselves

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:53.430
and others of the traps we might fall into.
We then need a little training because half

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.959
of us at least are not secure in love; we
belong in the camps of either the avoidant

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.900
or the anxious, and we have – to complicate
matters – an above average propensity to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.969
fall in love with someone from the other damaged
side, thereby aggravating our insecurities

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.260
and defences in the process. Niccolo Pisano
An Idyll: Daphnis and Chloe Here is a brief

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.830
list of what avoidants and anxious types should
keep in mind in their relationships: IF YOU

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.109
ARE AN AVOIDANT WITH SOMEONE ANXIOUSLY ATTACHED
Recognise the extent to which you check out

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:34.599
emotionally when things are intense, particularly
when there is an offer of closeness. Recognise

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.499
how you will tend to prefer sex and closeness
with strangers and how nervous you will be

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:45.249
around cuddles and kissing. You probably don’t
want the light on either. Watch how you sabotage

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:51.400
long-term intimacy. Have compassion that you
are afraid of what you really want. Think

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.159
back to how in your past, closeness would
have been frightening because people let you

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:02.790
down, and observe how you adopted a strategy
of removal to protect yourself. You are hurt,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.010
not bad. Remind yourself that the present
is different from the past and that you are

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.659
ruining the present by bringing to it fear-laden
dynamics that don’t belong there. It may

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.289
feel like your partner is being aggressive
and ill-tempered with you for no reason; they

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.599
are at heart upset and unable to express their
needs in any other way. They want you; and

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.479
that is why they are behaving as they are.
Look beneath their nagging and their accusations

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.580
and believe in their underlying goodwill.
When they attack you, see their longing for

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.810
love. Do that very frightening thing: extend
reassurance. And explain, calmly, the appeal

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:57.270
of the cave. IF YOU ARE AN ANXIOUS PERSON
WITH AN AVOIDANT PARTNER Things are not necessarily

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:05.120
as bad as they seem. Their quiet might just
be quiet, not a lack of love. Their distance

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:14.290
isn’t meanness, it’s their way of maintaining
equilibrium. You are not demented or ‘needy’

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:20.319
to want more; but your way of dealing with
what you legitimately need is aggravating

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:26.889
things hugely. You are triggering your partner
by asking for intimacy too directly and also

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.830
(probably) with too much anger. Realise that
you need to tread lightly, and to be a little

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:40.840
distant in requesting closeness. The partner
isn’t mean or freakish; merely damaged – as

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:51.849
are you. And that’s very normal. A full
40% of the population are in your positions.

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:57.430
Knowing whether we can be classed as secure,
avoidant or anxious in love should be a basic

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.139
fact we grasp about ourselves. The next step
is to accept with grace that if we are either

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:10.789
avoidant or anxious, we will need considerable
emotional schooling to get out of scratchy

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:16.160
patterns and stand a chance of building up
a good enough relationship.
