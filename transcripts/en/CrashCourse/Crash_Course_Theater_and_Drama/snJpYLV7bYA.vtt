00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.830
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Theater, and today we’re taking on

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.790
the theater of Renaissance England.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.670
Which means Shakespeare, right?

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.049
Wrong, unfortunately.

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.959
It’ll be a bit before we know of poor Yorick.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.219
Get thee to the ceiling, pal.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.090
Believe it or not, there are Renaissance English
plays and playwrights and theaters and troupes

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.370
that existed totally independent of Shakespeare.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.840
Well, mostly independent of Shakespeare.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.821
Today we’ll discuss historical context,
introduce the English playhouse, and meet

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:32.619
some early plays and playwrights.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.880
And we’re not going to talk about Shakespeare!

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.880
Not at all.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.989
It’s gonna be much ado about something…
else.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.399
INTRO
The Renaissance arrives in England… late.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.399
Really late.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.950
Like 150 years later than Italy-late.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.950
Why?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.360
Well, there are a bunch of reasons, but mostly
England spent a lot of the late Middle Ages

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.240
embroiled in the Hundred Years’ War with
France, which obviously lasted one hundred

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.240
and sixteen years, and then thirty two more
years fighting the Wars of the Roses, a series

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.170
of civil wars for control of England, which
involved far fewer actual roses than you may

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.170
expect.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.790
Once the Tudors took the throne, things got
more stable.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.920
Humanism and the scientific method and madrigals
really took off.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.030
The Tudors liked theater.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.810
Like, really liked it a lot.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.700
Henry VII, the first Tudor king, paid for
court entertainments.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.790
His son Henry VIII, the one with all the wives,
established an independent Office of the Revels,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.049
managed by a Master of Revels whose job it
was to arrange plays and masques for the nobility.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.720
There were definitely some plays the Tudors
didn’t like.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.119
England had been Catholic and then Protestant
and then Catholic and then Protestant again,

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.619
and sometimes plays could be used to fan the
flames of religious discord.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.700
So in 1558, Henry’s daughter Elizabeth I
cracked down on religious and political plays.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.920
This pretty much ended the cycle plays.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.340
She also passed a law classifying actors as
vagrants who could be fined for going from

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.439
town to town.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:12.439
The solution?

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:16.889
Troupes of actors hooked up with nobility
and licensed themselves as servants under

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:22.829
names like The Lord Chamberlain’s Men and
The Lord Admiral’s Men.

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.090
Jeez, actors just throughout history, just
CANNOT catch a break, huh?

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.249
If these laws seem restrictive, they are!

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:34.359
But the crackdown on the cycle plays pushed
the theater in new and more innovative directions,

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.180
while that whole vagrancy thing encouraged
actors to professionalize.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.799
The earliest plays of the English Renaissance
predate all this licensing and vagrancy.

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.709
Two of the first English Renaissance plays
were comedies written in vernacular English.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.150
They were modeled on the work of, surprise
surprise, Plautus and Terence!

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.199
But morality plays were an obvious influence,
too, and maybe also medieval farces.

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.620
Neoclassicism didn’t catch on in England
the way it did in Italy and in France, so

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.150
these English plays tend to be looser and
more episodic.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.349
The earliest one is “Ralph Roister Doister,”
which was written in the 1540s by a schoolmaster

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.129
named Nicholas Udall.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.459
The title character is a braggy dolt, kind
of like the Captain from the commedia dell-arte.

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.719
He falls in love with a virtuous widow, Christian
Custance, and tries to win her over, while

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.340
egged on by Matthew Merrygreeke, a clever
trickster type who owes a lot to the Vice

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.569
character from the morality plays.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.760
Ralph gets tricked, beaten, and a rape almost
happens.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.419
But then the widow marries her rich, honorable
suitor, Gawyn Goodluck, and it all ends happily.

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.939
Another early play is “Gammer Gurton’s
Needle” by an unknown author.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.879
It was first performed in the early 1560s,
and it also derives most of its humor from

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.079
bodily harm.

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.069
Gammer Gurton has lost her sewing needle.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.639
Diccon of Bedlam, a wandering fool and another
Vice type, tries to stir up trouble by claiming

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.480
that her next door neighbor, Dame Chat, took
it.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.510
Everyone gets beaten up, including a curate–which
is sorta like a priests assistant–and the

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.379
needle is discovered when a servant is stabbed
in the butt.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.379
Hilarious!

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:08.919
It was a simpler time, ok?

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.449
Wiseguy eh?!

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:12.700
I’m sorry,

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.299
Another early play tried to be all genres
to all spectators.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.900
It was called “Cambises” for short.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.299
Why “for short” you may ask?

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.680
Well the full title goes: “A lamentable
tragedy mixed ful of pleasant mirth, conteyning

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.449
the life of CAMBISES King of PERCIA, from
the beginning of his kingdome unto his death,

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.540
his one good deed of execution, after that
many wicked deeds and tirannous murders, committed

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.240
by and through him, and last of all, his odious
death by Gods Justice appointed, Doon in such

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.289
order as foloweth.”

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.509
I’d love to see the poster for that one.

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.189
It was written by the schoolmaster Thomas
Preston and mostly likely performed sometime

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:48.729
in the 1560s.

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.069
The episodic structure and the focus on good
versus evil link it closely with morality

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.900
plays, but also history plays.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.020
The first tragedy on an English subject is
“The Tragedie of Gorboduc,” a play by

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.060
Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville, first
performed in 1561.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.120
Because it’s a tragedy, Seneca is the big
influence, but there’s some morality play

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.120
elements, too.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.270
It’s written in blank verse, the meter that
he-who-shall-not-be-named-until-the-next-episode

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.810
uses, and also goes by the catchy title “Ferrex
and Porrex.”

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.810
The story goes like this:

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.940
Gorboduc is an ancient king of Britain who
decides to divide the realm between his two

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.190
sons, Ferrex and Porrex.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.789
They fight, Porrex kills Ferrex, and so the
Queen stabs Porrex while he’s sleeping.

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:34.050
Then the people rebel, killing both Gorboduc
and the Queen.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.060
Nobles rise up and kill most of the people.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.490
Everything’s a huge mess, and the succession
is still unclear.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.240
Now that’s what I call a tragedy.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.240
Right, Yorick?

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.050
And yes, this obviously sounds a lot like
“King Lear,” but of course we aren’t

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.050
discussing “King Lear.”

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.810
Unless what I’m saying now counts.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:51.810
DANGIT.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.680
Early English Renaissance plays weren’t
staged in theaters, because freestanding permanent

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.380
theaters didn’t exist yet.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.060
Not in England, anyway.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.600
These plays were staged in gardens, banquet
halls, inn yards and schools.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.770
But as acting became increasingly professionalized
and plays became increasingly popular, troupes

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.490
started to raise funds to build permanent
structures.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.319
They couldn’t build them in the City of
London itself, because there was a belief

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:17.300
that play-going spread plague.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.889
Plays and players were basically outlawed
in the city proper by the 1570s.

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.699
The first theater was probably the Red Lion,
which was built in Whitechapel, just outside

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.430
of the center of London, in 1567.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.259
We don’t know much about it, except that
it had a pretty big stage, some kind of turret—and

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.539
that it was very badly constructed.

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.100
One of the only surviving documents about
the Red Lion is from a complaint by the owner,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.860
John Brayne, against the carpenter who built
it.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.659
The lawsuit over its poor construction dragged
on until 1578—which may have been longer

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:53.780
than the Red Lion itself survived.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.889
A longer-lasting theater was called… drum
roll please…

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:59.009
The Theatre.

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:04.590
It was built in 1576 by the actor and businessman
James Burbage in a neighborhood full of gambling

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.639
dens and brothels, because, as we’ll discuss
in our episode on the closing of theaters,

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.689
they were considered pretty immoral as far
as structures go.

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:17.719
For a look at the theater The Theatre, the
first important Elizabethan playhouse, let’s

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:21.279
look at the Thoughtbubble:
The Theatre borrowed its design from inn yards

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:25.629
or maybe bear-baiting pits, which is exactly
what it sounds like.

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:29.620
In Elizabethan England, deciding what you
wanted to do for the evening was like, “HMMM

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.280
do I feel like watching a bunch of dogs try
to kill a bear, or do I feel like seeing a

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.280
play?

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.189
” The Theatre had a three-level gallery
structure on most sides, surrounding a thrust

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:45.469
stage and a bare-as-in-empty space in the
middle where penny-paying ticket holders could

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:46.469
stand.

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:48.900
If you paid another penny, you could move
to the galleries.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.900
And if you had three pennies, you got a stool.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.430
FAAAANNNNN-CY
The Theater was associated with the Lord Admiral’s

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.809
Men, and a bunch of the early plays by Ole
What Lights Through Yonder Window Shakes.

00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:05.230
Eventually a dispute with the landlord led
Burbage to dismantle the theater and move

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:10.419
it across the river, where it became, dramatic
pause, the Globe.

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:14.009
These early theaters were open air, public
arenas.

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:19.449
They could seat as many as 2500 people—everyone
from slumming nobles to workingmen to the

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:20.449
poor.

00:08:20.449 --> 00:08:25.249
Women came, too, although it wasn’t considered
respectable, so some wore disguises!

00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:26.759
But there were no women on stage.

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:28.629
Boys played the female roles.

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:31.969
And Scenery wasn’t as advanced as it was
in Italy.

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:35.940
Scenes were set with some hanging cloths in
the back and maybe a few props.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.039
Plays were held in the afternoon, to take
advantage of the natural light.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.240
A lot of snacks were sold, and beer, too.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.959
And if the audience didn’t like the play,
those snacks would be thrown!

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:46.970
Thanks, Thoughtbubble!

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.060
You wouldn’t throw snacks at me if you didn’t
like a thoughtbubble, would you Yorick?

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:51.060
HEY, NO.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.060
BAD SKELLY.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.300
I suppose I deserve this after the eyepoking
incident.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:00.170
In 1576, the first indoor, private theater
appeared, Blackfriars Theatre.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.970
It was located on the grounds of a former
Dominican Monastery.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:09.720
It fell into disuse, and in 1596, a second,
fancier theater was built nearby, also by

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.760
James Burbage.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.230
These indoor theaters seated about 750 people,
and since seats were more expensive they drew

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.320
a ritzier crowd.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.970
Whether or not that meant ritzier crackers
were tossed at the talent, I’m not sure.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.500
The plays they put on were thought to be wittier
and more sophisticated than those in the public

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.620
theaters, though, and they were initially
performed by companies of boys, because the

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.339
Renaissance and … child labor.

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:37.300
Who wrote these sophisticated plays for those
child laborers?

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:42.560
Well, they were written by a group of playwrights
who were later called the University Wits,

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.380
because unlike Billy Wiggleharpoon, they all
went to Oxford or Cambridge.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:51.070
These snobs wrote sophisticated plays for
grown-up actors, too, including many that

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.100
are still performed today.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:58.080
Basically these guys started with, and improved,
the early dramas we looked at, making them

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.920
better—truer, livelier, with more awesome
poetry.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.389
They prepared the way for–ok,fine–Shakespeare,
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE ... though they didn’t

00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:08.459
always like him.

00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:10.639
One of them called him an “upstart crow.”

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:11.990
Yeesh!

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.209
Get thee some milk of the poppy to relieve
the scorch from that Rennaissance Burn!

00:10:15.209 --> 00:10:19.870
Among the University Wits were Thomas Kyd,
John Lyly, Robert Green, and Christopher Marlowe.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.009
Thomas Kyd is best known for “The Spanish
Tragedy.”

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:27.470
It borrows from Seneca, helps kick off the
craze for revenge tragedy, and has a strong

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.009
influence on “Hamlet,”.

00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:33.430
John Lyly wrote charming pastorals, which
probably inspired “As You Like It.”

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:38.540
Robert Green, wrote comedies and pastorals
and is best known for “Friar Bacon and Friar

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:43.759
Bungay,” which is a history play and a love
story and also a morality play with magicians

00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:44.899
and a talking head.

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:48.470
YES, YOU ALSO ARE THAT, except you’re pretty
quiet...

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:53.660
And then there’s Christopher “Kit” Marlowe,
who led a very busy life before dying in a

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.110
tavern brawl before he was 30.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.899
He went to Cambridge, where he earned a master's
degree.

00:10:58.899 --> 00:11:04.839
He also worked for the Elizabethan government
in some secret capacity, maybe as a spy.

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:10.579
His plays are long and intense and full of
gorgeous, vivid blank verse which heavily

00:11:10.579 --> 00:11:12.050
influenced Shakespeare.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.440
Marlowe’s characters are ambitious.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.440
Really ambitious.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.450
They want to conquer the world or change it.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.580
Or—as in the case of “Doctor Faustus,”
his most famous play—make a deal with the

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:29.800
devil that guarantees you a couple of decades
as the smartest and most powerful person on

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.149
earth.

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:37.250
His tragedies are tragedies of overreaching...
of characters who want too much and usually

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.480
get it, with disastrous consequences.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.350
Since he’s a big ole deal, we’re gonna
be devoting our next three episodes to Shakespeare.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.240
Also, Yorick insists.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.949
Try to remember that Shakespeare doesn’t
come from nowhere.

00:11:49.949 --> 00:11:53.490
Okay, yes, Stratford-upon-Avon, kind of is
nowhere.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.920
But he doesn’t arise ahistorically, or come
from nowhere artistically.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.839
He arrives in a theatrical culture that’s
already professionalized and thriving, in

00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:09.170
a London of established troupes, competing
theaters, and eager beer-swilling, snack-throwing

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.389
audiences.

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:12.709
Who We’ll see plenty of next time.

00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:50.009
Until then… compost those tomatoes… and
curtain!
