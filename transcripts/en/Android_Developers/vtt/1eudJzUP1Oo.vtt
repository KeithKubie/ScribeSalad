00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.820
Hello, and welcome to "This Week
in Android Development"

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.920
for June 17, 2013.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.920
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.860
If it feels like it's been more
than a week since the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.750
last "Week in Android
Development," you can blame

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.500
these three troublemakers who
flew in from the UK for Google

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.320
I/O. Between keeping them out of
trouble and preparing over

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.395
30 technical sessions for the
conference, our team has had

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:25.600
its hands full.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.940
We've shipped them safely back
to London and also made the

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.090
I/O session videos available
for you to watch in the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.800
comfort of your own home.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.010
One of the biggest announcements
at I/O '13 was

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.140
Android Studio.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.810
To help make the Android tools
the best tools, the Tools team

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.380
have created an Android
Developer Tools

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.172
community on Google+.

00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:44.210
Join us to talk tools
with the Tools team.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.130
Of course, it wouldn't be Google
I/O without the I/O

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.610
app, and the Android Design in
Action team have performed a

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.550
full teardown showing how it
was put together on last

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.630
week's show.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.740
They also dove into building
sharing into your app and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.370
creating immersive
full screen UIs.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.390
For all the Chet Haase fans
out there, we've got more

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.010
"Chet Bytes." Last week's
episode explored animating

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.460
listview deletion.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.810
Chet will be joining us in the
hot seat later this week for

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.250
the first episode of "DevBytes
Backstage." He'll be joining

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.610
us to answer all your animation
questions, so send

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.600
them in, or join us live on
Thursday via our Hangout.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.630
Not to be outdone, Nick and
Roman will be answering your

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.360
design questions this Friday.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.480
Last week, the App Clinic team
had the pleasure of joining

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.290
the Oslo Google Developers
group for our

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.070
second GDG App Clinic.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.040
Oslo is beautiful this time of
year, or so they told us when

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.860
we connected over Hangouts.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.460
Keep an eye out for the
video this Wednesday.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.590
Also last week, we tried our
hand at teaching people

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.840
Android in person, hosting our
annual Android camp for 30 of

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.130
the brightest sophomores and
juniors from some of the top

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.870
universities in the country.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.310
We'll be taking the show over
the pond in August to teach

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.480
Android to some of
the brightest

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.460
students not in this country.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.370
We'll also be making these
instructor-led training

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.780
materials available for
download, so the same quality

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.680
Android education will soon
be available to everyone,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.940
including mediocre students at
below average universities.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.470
In the meantime, we're
publishing plenty of great

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.980
learning material on
developer.android.com, such as

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.610
the last week's release of the
Purchase Status API guide.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.500
It was a big week in app
releases too, with BBC Weather

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.690
launching and quickly rocketing
to the top of the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.480
Google Play UK charts.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.130
It's a beautiful, pure Android
app, so it's no surprise to

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.280
see it do well.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.160
It is currently available only
to users in the UK, but the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.770
team is hard at work adding
support for forecasts that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.610
aren't cloudy with
a chance of rain.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.110
Developers using Google Play
Game Services have also been

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.040
hard at work, with "Jewels
2" becoming the first

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.940
cross-platform game to use
these new services.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.250
That means you can compare your
jewel matching skills

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.910
with friends using all manner of
internet-connected rounded

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.150
corner rectangular devices.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.610
"One Tap Hero" also launched an
upgrade this week that saw

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.460
it integrate leaderboards while
"What's This?" launched

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.120
support for Google+ sign-in,
leaderboards and achievements.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.920
Coming up in "Android Developers
Live" this week,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.370
we've got a new "BizDevByte"
from Shazia, who's introducing

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.110
Google Play for Education
and explaining

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.480
how you can get involved.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.570
This week's App Clinic
will feature GDG

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.250
Vilnius from Lithuania.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.900
There's nearly twice as many
mobile phones in Lithuania as

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.560
there are people, so it's no
surprise to see these guys are

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.840
passionate about Android
development.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.030
You can track all of the
upcoming "Android Developers

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.052
Live" shows at developers.googl

00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:18.780
e.com/live/android.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.240
That's all for "This Week
in Android Development"

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.050
for June 17, 2013.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.490
Join us for this week's "Android
Developers Live"

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.480
broadcasts, and remember,
we're up all

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.720
night for good fun.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.230
We're up all night
to code Android.
