00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.170
The normal distribution is
arguably the most important

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:06.280
concept in statistics.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.039
Everything we do,
or almost everything

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:10.330
we do in inferential
statistics, which is essentially

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.400
making inferences
based on data points,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.140
is to some degree based on
the normal distribution.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.310
And so what I want to do in this
video and in this spreadsheet

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.690
is to essentially give you
as deep an understanding

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.430
of the normal
distribution as possible.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.510
And the rest of your life,
you're always, if someone says,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.049
oh, we're assuming a normal
distribution, it's like, oh,

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.720
I know what that is.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.980
This is the formula,
and I understand

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.440
how to use it, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.045
So this spreadsheet,
just so you know,

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:42.237
is downloadable at
www.khanacademy.org/downloads/--

00:00:42.237 --> 00:00:44.570
and if you just type that
part in, you'll see everything

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.903
that's downloadable-- but
then download/normalintro.xls.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.540
And then you'll get this
spreadsheet right here.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.450
And I think I did this
in the right standard.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.250
But anyway, if you
go onto Wikipedia,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.090
and if you were to type
in normal distribution,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.540
or you were to do a search
for normal distribution-- let

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.675
me actually get my
Pen tool going--

00:01:03.675 --> 00:01:04.800
this is what you would see.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.370
I literally copied and pasted
this right here from Wikipedia,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.716
and I know it looks daunting.

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:10.340
You have all these
Greek letters there.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.980
But the sigma right
here, that is just

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.970
the standard deviation
of the distribution.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.440
We'll play with that a little
bit with in this chart,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.122
and see what that means.

00:01:20.122 --> 00:01:22.080
I mean, you know what
the standard deviation is

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.090
in general, but this is
the standard deviation

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.730
of this distribution, which is
a probability density function.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.160
And I encourage you to re-watch
the video on probability

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.993
density functions,
because it's a little bit

00:01:31.993 --> 00:01:34.910
of a transition going from the
binomial distribution, which

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.031
is discrete, right?

00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.780
In the binomial
distribution, you say, oh,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.030
what is the probability
of getting a 5?

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.634
And you just look at that
histogram or that bar chart,

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:44.300
and you say, oh,
that's the probability.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.990
But in a continuous
probability distribution,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.020
or a continuous probability
density function,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.040
you can't just say, what is a
probability of me getting a 5?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.640
You have to say, what is a
probability of me getting

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.970
between, let's say,
a 4.5 and a 5.5?

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.210
You have to give it some range.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.170
And then your
probability isn't given

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.370
by just reading this graph.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.830
The probability is given by the
area under that curve, right?

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.360
It'd be given by this area.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.739
And for those of you all
who know calculus, if p of x

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.280
is our probability
density function--

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.270
it doesn't have to be a normal
distribution, although it often

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.510
is a normal
distribution-- the way

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.470
you actually figure out the
probability of, let's say,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.940
between 4 and 1/2 and 5 and 1/2.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.890
What is the probability
this is, whatever--

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.640
the odds of me getting between
4 and 1/2 and 5 and 1/2

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.320
inches of rain tomorrow?

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:44.690
It'll actually be the integral
from 4 and 1/2 to 5 and 1/2

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.870
of this probability
density function,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.449
or of this probability density
function, the x, right?

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:51.990
So that's just the
area in the curve.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.016
For those of you who
don't know calculus yet,

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:55.640
I encourage you to
watch that playlist.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.100
But all this is is saying,
the area in the curve

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.449
from here to here.

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.740
And it actually turns out,
for the normal distribution,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.810
this isn't an easy thing
to evaluate analytically.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.745
And so you do it numerically.

00:03:07.745 --> 00:03:10.480
You don't have to feel bad
about doing it numerically,

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.420
because you're like, oh, how
do I take the integral of this?

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.870
There's actually
functions for it,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.820
and you can even approximate it.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.820
I mean, one way you
could approximate it

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.380
is you could use it the way
you approximate integrals

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.046
in general, where you could say,
well, what is the area of this?

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:24.454
Well, it's roughly the
area of this trapezoid.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.120
So you could figure
out the area of that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.400
trapezoid, taking the average
of that point and that point,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.630
and multiplying it by the base.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.130
Let me change colors,
just because I

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.600
think I'm overdoing
it with the green.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.270
Or you could just take the
height of this line right

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.920
here, and multiply
it by the base,

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.750
and you'll get the area
of this rectangle, which

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.267
might be a pretty good
approximation for the area

00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:49.850
under the curve,
right, because you'll

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.359
have a little bit
extra over here,

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.400
but you're going to miss
a little bit over there.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.335
So it might be pretty
good approximation.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:56.470
And that's actually what
I do in the other video,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.030
just to approximate the
area under the curve,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.430
and give you a good sense that
the normal distribution is what

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.240
the binomial distribution
becomes, essentially,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.092
if you have many, many,
many, many trials.

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:10.300
And what's interesting about
the normal distribution,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.841
just so you know-- I don't know
if I mentioned this already--

00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:16.019
this right here,
this is the graph.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.467
And then this is
just another word.

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:20.550
People might talk about
the central limit theorem.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.070
But this is really one of the
most important or interesting

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.890
things about our universe--
central limit theorem.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.450
And I won't prove it here,
but it essentially tells us--

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.320
and you could
understand it by looking

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.660
at the other video, where we
talk about flipping coins.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.177
And if we were to do many,
many, many flips of coins,

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:39.260
right, those are independent
trials of each other.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.960
And if you take the sum
of all of your flips--

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.800
if you were to give yourself
one point if you got ahead

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.240
every time-- and if you were
to take the sum of them,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.390
as you approach an
infinite number of flips,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.120
you approach the
normal distribution.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.270
And what's interesting
about that is,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.760
each of those
trials, in the case

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.610
of flipping a coin-- each trial
is a flip of the coin-- each

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.780
of those trials don't have to
have a normal distribution.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.900
So we could be talking about
molecular interactions,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.560
and every time compound x
interacts with compound y, what

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.717
might result doesn't have
to be normally distributed.

00:05:12.717 --> 00:05:14.300
But what happens is,
if you take a sum

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.830
of a ton of those interactions,
then, all of a sudden,

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.100
the end result will be
normally distributed.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.590
And this is why this is such
an important distribution.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.870
It shows up in nature
all of the time.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.770
If you do take data points from
something that is very, very

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.420
complex, and it is the sum of,
arguably, many, many, almost

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.544
infinite, individual,
independent trials,

00:05:37.544 --> 00:05:40.210
it's a pretty good assumption to
assume the normal distribution.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.682
We'll do other
videos where we talk

00:05:41.682 --> 00:05:43.140
about when it is
a good assumption,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.880
and when it isn't
a good assumption.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.970
But anyway, just to
digest this a little bit--

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.609
and let me actually rewrite it.

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:50.150
This is what you'll
see on Wikipedia,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.970
but this could be rewritten
as 1 over sigma times

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.310
the square root of 2 pi, times--
x is just e to that power.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.750
So it's just e to the this
whole thing over here,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:12.810
minus x minus the mean
squared over 2 sigma squared.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.260
This is the standard deviation.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.940
Standard deviation squared
is just the variance, right?

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.490
And just so you know how to use
this-- you're like, oh, wow,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.948
there's so many
Greek letters here.

00:06:19.948 --> 00:06:20.820
What do I do?

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.260
This tells you the height of the
normal distribution function.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.420
Let's say that this is the
distribution of, I don't know,

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.080
of people's, I don't
know, how far north they

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.799
live from my house,
or something.

00:06:34.799 --> 00:06:35.340
I don't know.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.864
Well, no.

00:06:35.864 --> 00:06:36.780
That's not a good one.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.500
Let's say it's people's
heights above 5' 9".

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.080
Let's say that this was
5' 9" and not 0, right?

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.920
What this tells you
is, if you were to say,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.575
what percentage of
people, or I guess,

00:06:50.575 --> 00:06:51.950
if you wanted to
figure out, what

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.920
is the probability of
finding someone who

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.410
is roughly 5 inches taller
than the average right

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.980
here, what you
would is, you would

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.290
put in this number
here, this 5, into x.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.140
And then you know the
standard deviation,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.110
because you've taken
a bunch of samples.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.651
You know the variance, which is
a standard deviation squared.

00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:10.476
You know the mean.

00:07:10.476 --> 00:07:11.850
And you just put
your x in there,

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.399
and it'll tell you the
height of the function.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:15.940
And then you have
to give it a range.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.480
You can't just say, how many
people are exactly 5 inches

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.950
taller than average?

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.700
You would have to say, how many
people are between 5.1 inches

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.750
and 4.9 inches taller
than the average?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.958
You have to give it a little
bit of range, because no

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.090
is exactly-- or, it's almost
infinitely impossible,

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.580
to the atom, to
be exactly 5' 9".

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.430
Even the definition
of an inch isn't

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.181
defined that particularly.

00:07:36.181 --> 00:07:37.680
So that's how you
use this function.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.984
I think this is so
heavily used in-- one,

00:07:41.984 --> 00:07:42.900
it shows up in nature.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.800
But in all of
inferential statistics,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.970
I think it behooves you
to become as familiar

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.300
with this formula as possible.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.860
And I guess to make
that happen, let

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.880
me play around a little
bit with this formula,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.695
just to give you an intuition
of how everything works out,

00:07:56.695 --> 00:07:57.570
et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.100
So if I were to
take this-- and I'd

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.220
like to just maybe
help you memorize it--

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.370
this could be rewritten
as, if we take

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.279
the sigma into the
square root sign,

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:08.070
if we take the standard
deviation in there,

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:13.610
it becomes 1 over the square
root of 2 pi sigma squared.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.110
I've never seen it
written this way,

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.526
but it gives me a
little intuition

00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:19.024
that sigma squared-- it's
always written as sigma squared,

00:08:19.024 --> 00:08:20.440
but it's really
just the variance.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.023
And the variance is
what you calculate

00:08:22.023 --> 00:08:24.070
before you calculate
the standard deviation.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.334
So that's interesting.

00:08:25.334 --> 00:08:26.750
And then this top
right here, this

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:34.830
could be written as e
to the minus 1/2 times--

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.580
both of these things here are
squared, so we could just say,

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:43.900
x minus the mean
over sigma squared.

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.590
And this kind of clarifies a
little bit what's going on here

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.800
a little bit better,
because what's this?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.010
x minus sigma is the distance
between whatever point

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.700
we want to find.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.610
Let's say we're here.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.070
x minus mu is the
mean, so that's here.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.887
So that's this distance.

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:05.470
And then this is a
standard deviation,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.290
which is this distance.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.660
So this in here
tells me how many

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.494
standard deviations I
am away from the mean.

00:09:12.494 --> 00:09:14.493
And that's actually called
the standard z-score.

00:09:14.493 --> 00:09:15.990
I talk about it in
the other video.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.870
And then we square that.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.350
And then we take this
to the minus 1/2.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.460
Well, let me rewrite that.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.710
If I were to write,
e to the minus

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:28.460
1/2 times a, that's the
same thing as e to the a

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.489
to the minus 1/2 power, right?

00:09:30.489 --> 00:09:32.030
If you take something
to an exponent,

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.446
and then take that
to an exponent,

00:09:33.446 --> 00:09:35.360
you can just multiply
these exponents.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.610
So likewise, this
could be rewritten

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:45.970
as, this is equal to 1 over
the square root of 2 pi sigma

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.700
squared, which is
just the variance.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.950
And I'm just playing
around with the formula,

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.250
because I really want to see
all the ways that-- maybe you'll

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.080
get a little intuition.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.663
And I encourage you
to email me if you

00:09:53.663 --> 00:09:56.647
see some insight on why this
exists, and all of that.

00:09:56.647 --> 00:09:58.980
But once again, I think it
is cool that all of a sudden,

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.905
we have this other formula
that has pi and e in it,

00:10:01.905 --> 00:10:07.769
and so many phenomenon
are described by this.

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:09.810
And once again, pi and e
show up together, right?

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.165
Just like e to the I pi
is equal to negative 1.

00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:15.195
Tells you something
about our universe.

00:10:15.195 --> 00:10:19.540
But anyway, I could
rewrite this as e

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:26.660
to the x minus mu over sigma
squared, and all of that

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.710
to the minus 1/2.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.790
Something in the minus
1/2 power-- that's just 1

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.500
over the square root, which
is already going on here.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.240
So we could just rewrite
this over here as 1

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:49.010
over the square root of 2
pi times the variance, times

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:54.110
e to, essentially, our
z-score squared, right?

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.870
If we say z is this
thing in here-- z

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.500
is how many standard deviations
we are from the mean-- z-score

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.440
squared.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.260
And all of a sudden, this
becomes a very clean--

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.730
we just say 2 pi times
our variance, times e

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.520
to the number of
standard deviations

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.750
we are away from the mean.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.850
You square that.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.610
You take the square root of
that thing, and invert it,

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.970
and that's the
normal distribution.

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.210
So anyway, I wanted to do
that, just because I thought

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.110
it was neat, and it's
interesting to play around

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.330
with it.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:22.920
And that way, if
you see it in any

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.470
of these other forms in
the rest of your life,

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:25.300
your won't say, what's that?

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.250
I thought the normal
distribution was this,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:27.960
or it was this.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.042
And now you know.

00:11:29.042 --> 00:11:30.850
But with that said,
let's play around

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.240
a little bit with this
normal distribution.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.860
So in this spreadsheet, I've
plotted normal distribution,

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.360
and you can the
assumptions that are

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.820
in this kind of
green-blue color.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.820
So right now it's plotting
it with a mean of 0

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.204
and a standard deviation of 4.

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.870
And I just write the
variance here, just

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:48.060
for your information.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.340
The variance is just a
standard deviation squared.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.960
And so what happens when
you change the mean?

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.240
So if the mean goes from 0
to-- let's say it goes to 5.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.960
Notice, this graph just shifted
to the right by 5, right?

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.010
It was centered here.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.420
Now it's centered over here.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:07.320
If we make it minus
5, what happens?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.825
The whole bell curve just shifts
5 to the left from the center.

00:12:10.825 --> 00:12:13.200
Now, what happens when you
change the standard deviation,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.699
right?

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:15.660
The standard
deviation is a measure

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.067
of-- the variance is the average
squared distance from the mean.

00:12:20.067 --> 00:12:22.150
The standard deviation is
the square root of that.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.180
So it's kind of--
not exactly, but kind

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.320
of-- the average
distance from the mean.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.750
So the smaller the
standard deviation,

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.530
the closer a lot of the points
are going to be to the mean.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:33.531
So we should get
a narrower graph,

00:12:33.531 --> 00:12:34.780
and let's see if that happens.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.660
So when the standard
deviation is 2, we see that.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.940
The graph you're more likely
to be really close to the mean

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.860
than further away.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.180
And if you make the standard
deviation-- I don't know,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.930
if you make it 10--
all of a sudden,

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.390
you get a really flat graph.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.500
And this thing keeps
going on forever.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.860
And that's a key difference.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.040
The binomial distribution
is always finite.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.220
You can only have a
finite number of values,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.840
while the normal
distribution is defined

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.020
over the entire
real number line.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.072
So the probability, if you
have a mean of minus 5,

00:13:06.072 --> 00:13:08.030
and a standard deviation
of 10, the probability

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.960
of getting 1,000 here
is very, very low,

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.217
but there is some probability.

00:13:15.217 --> 00:13:16.800
There is some
probability that I fall,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.427
that all of the atoms in my
body just arrange perfectly,

00:13:19.427 --> 00:13:21.260
that I fall through the
seat I'm sitting on.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.330
Its very unlikely,
and it probably

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.420
won't happen in the life of the
universe, but it can happen.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.920
And that could be described
by a normal distribution,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.490
because it says,
anything can happen,

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.960
although it could be very,
very, very improbable.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.880
So the thing I talked about
at the beginning of the video

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.290
is, when you figure out
a normal distribution,

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.120
you can't just look at
this point on the graph.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.170
Let me get the Pen tool back.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.300
You have to figure out the area
under the curve between two

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.370
points, right?

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.370
Let's say this was our
distribution, and I said,

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.581
what is the probability
that I get 0?

00:13:55.581 --> 00:13:57.580
I don't know what phenomenon
this is describing,

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.290
but that 0 happened.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.180
If I say exactly
0, the probability

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.310
is 0, because--
I shouldn't use 0

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.594
too much-- because the area
under the curve just under 0--

00:14:08.594 --> 00:14:09.260
there's no area.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.040
It's just a line.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.420
You have to say between a range.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.120
So you have to say the
probability between, let's

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:21.520
say, minus-- and actually, I can
type it in here on our-- I can

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:27.600
say, the probability between,
let's say, minus 0.005

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.870
and plus 0.05 is-- well, it
rounded, so it says there,

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.550
close to 0.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:38.370
Let me do it-- between minus
1 and between 1, all right?

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.250
It calculated at 7%,
and I'll show you

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.520
how I calculated
this in a second.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.070
So let me get the
Screen Draw tool.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:45.986
So what did I just do?

00:14:45.986 --> 00:14:48.702
This between minus
1 and 1-- and I'll

00:14:48.702 --> 00:14:50.160
show you the behind
the scenes what

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.750
Excel is doing-- we're
going from minus 1,

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.820
which is roughly
right here, to 1.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:01.050
And we're calculating the area
under the curve, all right?

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.166
We're calculating this area.

00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:05.790
Or, for those of you
who know calculus,

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:11.230
we're calculating the
integral from minus 1 to 1

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.420
of this function, where the
standard deviation is right

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.845
here, is 10, and
the mean is minus 5.

00:15:18.845 --> 00:15:20.220
And actually, let
me put that in.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.530
So we're calculating
for this example,

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:27.430
the way it's drawn right
here, the normal distribution

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.930
function.

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:28.429
Let's see.

00:15:28.429 --> 00:15:30.560
Our standard
deviation is 10 times

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:36.660
the square root of 2 pi,
times e to the minus 1/2,

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.150
times x minus our mean.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.150
Our mean is negative
right now, right?

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:43.560
Our mean is minus 5.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.310
So it's x plus 5 over the
standard deviation squared,

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.310
which is the variance.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:55.870
So that's 100 squared dx.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.890
This is what this
number is right here.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:02.290
This 7%, or actually 0.07, is
the area right under there.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.190
Now unfortunately,
for us in the world,

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.620
this isn't an easy integral
to evaluate analytically,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.020
even for those of us
who know our calculus.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.380
So this tends to be
done numerically.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:15.000
And kind of an easy way to do
this-- well, not an easy way--

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.930
but a function has
been defined, called

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.070
the cumulative
distribution function,

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.640
that is a useful tool for
figuring out this area.

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.940
So what the cumulative
distribution function is,

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.420
is essentially-- let me call
it the cumulative distribution

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.270
function-- it's a function of x.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.440
It gives us the area
under this curve.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.220
So let's say that
this is x right here.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.140
That's our x.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.645
It tells you the area
under the curve up to x.

00:16:41.645 --> 00:16:43.770
Or so another way to think
about it-- it tells you,

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:46.650
what is the probability
that you land at some value

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.130
less than your x value?

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.520
So it's the area
from minus infinity

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:57.200
to x of our probability
density function, dx.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.040
When you actually use the Excel
normal distribution function,

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.500
you say, norm distribution.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.119
You have to give
it your x value.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:12.640
You give it the mean.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.339
You give it the
standard deviation.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:15.714
And then you say
whether you want

00:17:15.714 --> 00:17:18.885
the cumulative distribution,
in which case, you say true,

00:17:18.885 --> 00:17:21.260
or you want just this normal
distribution, which you say,

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:21.759
false.

00:17:21.759 --> 00:17:24.680
So if you wanted to
graph this right here,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.347
you would say FALSE, in caps.

00:17:27.347 --> 00:17:29.430
If you wanted to graph the
cumulative distribution

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.950
function, which I
do down here-- let

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.560
me move this down a little bit.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.410
Let me get out of the Pen tool.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:44.730
So the cumulative distribution
function is right over here.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.810
Then you say true when
you make that Excel call.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:48.684
So this is a cumulative
distribution function

00:17:48.684 --> 00:17:52.251
for this same-- this is
a normal distribution.

00:17:52.251 --> 00:17:53.625
Here's a cumulative
distribution.

00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:55.490
And just so you
get the intuition,

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.781
is, if you want to know, what
is the probability that I

00:17:57.781 --> 00:17:59.770
get a value less than 20, right?

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:04.330
So I can get any value less than
20, given this distribution.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:06.220
The cumulative
distribution right here--

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:10.307
let me make it so you can
see the-- if you go to 20,

00:18:10.307 --> 00:18:11.890
you just go right
to that point there.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.265
And you say, wow,
the probability

00:18:13.265 --> 00:18:16.230
of getting 20 or less--
it's pretty high.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:17.230
It's approaching 100%.

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.070
That makes sense, because most
of the area under this curve

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.787
is less than 20.

00:18:20.787 --> 00:18:22.370
Or if you said,
what's the probability

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.200
of getting less than minus 5?

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.362
Well, minus 5 was the mean,
so half of your results

00:18:27.362 --> 00:18:29.320
should be above that,
and half should be below.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.980
And if you go to this
point right here,

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.210
you can see that this
right here is 50%.

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:36.120
So the probability of
getting less than minus 5

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.830
is exactly 50%.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.590
If I wanted to know the
probability of getting

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.330
between negative
1 and 1, what I do

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:51.230
is-- let me get back
to my Pen tool--

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.660
what I do is, I figure out,
what is the probability

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.210
of getting minus
1 or lower, right?

00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:00.357
So I figure out this whole area.

00:19:00.357 --> 00:19:02.440
And then I figure out the
probability of getting 1

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.070
or lower, which is
this whole area-- well,

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.250
let me do it in a different
color-- 1 or lower

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.960
is everything there.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:14.620
And I subtract the yellow
area from the magenta area.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:18.359
And I'll just get what's
ever left over here, right?

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:20.400
And that's exactly what
I did in the spreadsheet.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.400
Let me scroll down.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.380
This might be taxing my
computer by taking the screen

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.520
capture with it.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.290
So what I did is I evaluated
the cumulative distribution

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:39.510
function at 1, which
would be right there.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.720
And I evaluated the cumulative
distribution function

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.630
at minus 1, which
is right there.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.690
And the difference
between these two-- I

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.750
subtract this number
from this number,

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.205
and that tells me,
essentially, the probability

00:19:53.205 --> 00:19:55.290
that I'm between
those two numbers.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:20:02.025
Or another way to think about
it-- the area right here.

00:20:02.025 --> 00:20:03.900
And I really encourage
you to play with this,

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.190
and explore the Excel
formulas and everything.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:12.849
This area right here,
between minus 1 and 1.

00:20:12.849 --> 00:20:15.390
Now, one thing that shows up a
lot is, what's the probability

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:18.390
that you land within a standard
deviation of-- and just

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.470
so you know this
graph, the central line

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:22.337
right here-- this is the mean.

00:20:22.337 --> 00:20:24.170
And then these two lines
I drew right here--

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.128
these are one standard
deviation below, and one

00:20:26.128 --> 00:20:29.700
standard deviation
above the mean.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.860
And some people think,
what's the probability

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.670
that I land within one
standard deviation of the mean?

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:34.669
Well, that's easy to do.

00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:38.190
What I can do is, I'll
just click on this.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.890
What's the probability that
I land between-- let's see.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:43.980
The mean is minus 5.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.560
One standard deviation
below the mean is minus 15.

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.010
And one standard deviation above
the mean is 10 plus minus 5

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.570
is 5.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.380
So that's between 5 and 15.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.040
So 68.3%, and that's
actually always the case

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.740
that you have a 68.3%
probability of landing

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.394
within one standard
deviation of the mean,

00:21:05.394 --> 00:21:07.060
assuming you have a
normal distribution.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.500
So once again, that
number represents the area

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:16.980
under the curve here,
this area under the curve.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.310
And the way you get it is with
the cumulative distribution

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.180
function.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.870
Let me go down here.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:27.040
Every time I move this, I have
to get rid of the Pen tool.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:33.460
You evaluate it at plus 5,
which is right here, right?

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.080
This was one standard deviation
above the mean, which--

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.520
it's a number
right around there.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.978
Looks like it's
like, I don't know,

00:21:38.978 --> 00:21:41.787
80-something percent,
maybe 90%, roughly.

00:21:41.787 --> 00:21:43.870
And then you evaluate it
at one standard deviation

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.350
below the mean,
which is minus 15.

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.170
And this one looks like, I
don't know, roughly 15% or so?

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.080
15%, 16%, maybe 17%?

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.260
Let's say 18%.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.460
But the big picture is,
when you subtract this value

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.550
from this value, you
get the probability

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.060
that you land between those two.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.070
And that's because this
value tells a probability

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.249
that you're less than.

00:22:06.249 --> 00:22:08.540
So when you go to the cumulative
distribution function,

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.290
you get that right there.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.970
That tells a
probability that you

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.720
are-- let me get-- it keeps
crawling back and forth.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:27.581
So when you go to 5, and
you just go right over here,

00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:29.080
this essentially
tells you this area

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.140
under the curve--
the probability

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:31.639
that you're less
than or equal to 5.

00:22:31.639 --> 00:22:32.670
Everything up there.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.300
And then when you evaluate
it at minus 15 down here,

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.510
it tells you the probability
that you're down back here.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.400
So when you subtract this
from the larger thing,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.140
you're just left with what's
under the curve right there.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.819
And just to understand this
spreadsheet a little bit

00:22:48.819 --> 00:22:51.110
better, just because I really
want you to play with it,

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:56.290
and move the-- see what happens
if I make this distribution.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.270
The mean was minus 5.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.760
Now let me make it 5.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.110
It just shifted to the right.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.530
It just moved over to
the right by 5, right?

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:04.264
Whoops.

00:23:04.264 --> 00:23:05.180
I'll use the Pen tool.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:13.157
If I were to try to make the
standard deviation smaller,

00:23:13.157 --> 00:23:15.740
we'll see that the whole thing
just gets a little bit tighter.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.270
Let's make it 6,
and all of a sudden,

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.220
this looks a little
bit tighter curve.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.347
We make it two, it
becomes even tighter.

00:23:22.347 --> 00:23:24.430
And just so you know how
I calculated everything--

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.096
and I really want you
to play with this,

00:23:26.096 --> 00:23:27.305
and play with the formula.

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:28.989
And get an intuitive
feeling for this,

00:23:28.989 --> 00:23:30.530
the cumulative
distribution function.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:31.680
And think a lot
about how it relates

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.888
to the binomial distribution.

00:23:32.888 --> 00:23:35.982
And I cover that
in the last video.

00:23:35.982 --> 00:23:37.940
To plot this, I just took
each of these points.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.060
I went to plot the points
between minus 20 and 20,

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.020
and I just incremented
by 1, right?

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.804
I just decided to
increment by 1.

00:23:45.804 --> 00:23:46.970
It's not a continuous curve.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:49.053
It's actually just plotting
a point at each point,

00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:50.956
and connecting it with a line.

00:23:50.956 --> 00:23:52.660
Then I did the
distance between each

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.990
of those points and
the mean, right?

00:23:55.990 --> 00:24:01.200
Let's say that this 0 minus
5-- this is this distance.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.010
So this just tells
you, the point minus 20

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.280
is 25 less than the mean, right?

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.410
That's all I did there.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.620
Then I divided that by
the standard deviation.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.970
And this is the
standard z-score, right?

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.470
So this tells me how many
standard deviations is minus 20

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.810
away from the mean.

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:24.100
It's 12 and 1/2 standard
deviations below the mean.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.750
And then I use that, and I just
plugged it into, essentially,

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.380
this formula, to figure out
the height of the function.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.350
So let's say, at minus 20,
the height is very low.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:36.260
Well, let's say, at minus 2, the
height's a little bit better.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:42.160
The height's going to be
someplace right there.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.310
And so that gives me that value.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:48.420
But then to actually figure out
the probability of that-- what

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.000
I do is, I calculate the
cumulative distribution

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.400
function between-- well,
this is the probability

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.020
that you're less than that,
so the area under the curve

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.610
below that, which
is very, very small.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:00.820
It's not 0.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.850
I know it looks like 0 here, but
that's only because I round it.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.332
It's going to be 0.0001.

00:25:05.332 --> 00:25:07.290
It's going to be a really,
really small number.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.119
There's some probability
that we even get minus 1,000.

00:25:10.119 --> 00:25:11.910
And another intuitive
thing that you really

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:16.920
should have a sense for
is, the integral over this,

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.470
or the entire area
of the curve, has

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.190
to be 1, because that
takes into account

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.260
all possible circumstances.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.200
And that should happen if we put
a suitably small number here,

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.389
and a suitably
large number here.

00:25:27.389 --> 00:25:27.930
There you go.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.570
We get 100%, although
this isn't 100%.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.120
We would have to go from minus
infinity to plus infinity

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.450
to really get 100%.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:34.860
It's just rounding to 100%.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:41.010
It's probably 99.999999%,
or something like that.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:43.080
And so to actually
calculate this, what I do

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.910
is, I take the
cumulative distribution

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.164
function of this
point, and I subtract

00:25:47.164 --> 00:25:49.080
from that the cumulative
distribution function

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:49.850
of that point.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:52.330
And that's where I
got this 100% from.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.580
Anyway, hopefully
that'll give you

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:59.020
a good feel for the
normal distribution.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.660
And I really encourage you
to play with the spreadsheet,

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.350
and to even make a spreadsheet
like this yourself.

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:05.016
And in a future
exercise, we'll actually

00:26:05.016 --> 00:26:09.340
use this type of a spreadsheet
as an input into other models.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.040
So if we're doing
a financial model,

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.670
and if we say our revenue
has a normal distribution

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.660
around some expected value,
what is the distribution

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.650
of our net income?

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.970
Or we could think of 100 other
different types of examples.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.471
Anyway, see you
in the next video.
