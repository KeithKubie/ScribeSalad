00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.870
 More than 99% of the previously found animal species have now become extinct. Sometimes, it happens 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.350
 Causing violent changes that wipe out most of the factions altogether 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.519
 During a short period of time. So now we are reviewing the most incredible 5 mass extinctions 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.470
 And a look at whether it is possible for the sixth to occur now. 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.770
 Forty-four million years ago, the arthropods became extinct. During that period, most creatures were swimming 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.210
 Or creep in shallow water. While the newly formed volcanic rocks were falling by water and wind 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.989
 They interact with carbon dioxide and absorb it. As a result, CO 2 levels have dropped, and temperatures have dropped 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.129
 And the water was submerged to form. Causing low ocean levels and shallow sea depletion 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.359
 After several cycles of glaciation and shrinkage, about 86% of the flora 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.889
 Lost forever. 

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:51.549
 Then over millions of years the oceans slowly began to thrive with fish and colonized the earth 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.339
 Primitive plants eaten by creeping and flying insects. 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:02.030
 Then 374 million years later, new plants contributed to the next mass extinction. 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.910
 These plants absorbed enough carbon dioxide to create another cycle of global cooling. And changed the soil 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.610
 The triggers of nutrient glutting in the ocean make up huge amounts of algae that are absorbed 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.390
 Oxygen, resulting in the suffocation of more than half of the marine species. However and somewhere in this 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.530
 The world, a small family of fish with fins like feet and lungs survived. Over 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.470
 The next hundred million years, these creatures will evolve into amphibians 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.410
 Reptiles and almost all modern wild animals. 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.640
 About 250 million years ago, the Permian era began. It is the worst collective extinction in history 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.950
 70% of wildlife and 95% of marine life have been wiped out 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.750
 The billions of tons of volcanic gases destroyed the ozone layer and the average temperature of the oceans rose 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.480
 Up to 40 Â° C, it is hotter than most hot water basins. Acid rain fell all over 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.420
 The planet, destroying life on earth. 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.070
 Life took 50 million years to recover until the fourth mass extinction. And in 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.880
 Meanwhile primitive small dinosaurs were scouring the earth. A huge volcanic rift broke out 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.800
 In the middle of the planet. And separated the Americas from Europe and Africa, as a component 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.319
 Atlantic Ocean. The volcanoes also emitted carbon dioxide, causing temperatures to rise about a dozen dead 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.180
 80% of the objects at that time have been well done dinosaurs do well 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.439
 In the new vacant land in the next 135 million years, it has grown to become 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:26.370
 One of the largest wild animals that has ever lived in the world. 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.779
 But everything has a good end. Many scientists believe that extinction 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:35.359
 Dinosaurs were caused by the collision of a small-sized asteroid 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:41.029
 On the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The collision caused millions of tons of dust in the air 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:45.420
 The sun shines and sets the end of all the huge dinosaurs (small ones 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.909
 Survived evolved into birds). The world became ready for a small, rat-like creature 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.129
 He is the grandfather of all modern mammals. During 50 million years, descended from his descendants 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.599
 Wild animals, whales and horses we humans - varied and grew to dominate almost 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.200
 On every environment on earth. 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.249
 So where does this leave us now after 65 million years? Well, human dominance on earth 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:14.879
 Which led to significant changes too, except for today's changes that occur over decades, not thousands of years. 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.609
 Carbon dioxide levels have contributed to many past extinctions, and have risen at least 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:25.139
 Only 25% in the past 50 years, which is a geologically short time. In addition to 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.540
 Climate change, we have shown hundreds of species of overfishing, fishing, and the destruction of the citizen 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.329
 And pollution. The extinction rates of the current factions are estimated 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.450
 Between 100-1000 times higher than natural extinction rates 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.129
 This is only if all groups threatened by population decline will actually be extinct 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:50.109
 We may actually reach mass extinction in just a few years. Since the 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.359
 Previous mass extinctions left some survivors, it is worth mentioning that 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.680
 Creatures at the top of the food chain are usually the hardest hit. We may promise 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.449
 The theater of history repeats itself, and allows a small unexpected object to replace us 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.999
 To become the dominant form of life on the planet 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.969
