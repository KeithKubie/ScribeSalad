00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.610
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, there.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.240
Thank you all for
coming out today.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.150
I'm here to present
Miss Kim Nalley, who's

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.900
going to be speaking
about Billie Holiday.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.980
U.C. Berkeley History Ph.D.
Candidate, and jazz and blues

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.950
singer, Kim Nalley, will
sketch the life and music

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.390
of Eleanora Fagan.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.490
Awarded Most Influential African
American in the Bay Area,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.390
and short-listed for a
Grammy, Nalley portrayed

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.760
Holiday on stage in
the theatrical biopic

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.880
"Lady Day in Love"
in 2005, followed

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.210
with a tribute CD entitled
"Ballads for Billie,"

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.500
a sold-out concert
series at Jazz

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.710
at Lincoln Center in New York,
and will reprise her tribute

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.330
on July 17, 2015, for SFJAZZ.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.390
As a popular writer,
Nalley has written

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.440
for sfgate.com's city bright
series, and for JazzWest.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.990
As a scholar, she has written
several jazz-themed history

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.000
papers, including "This
Bitter Earth-- Infertility

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.730
in Billie Holiday, Ella
Fitzgerald, and Sarah Vaughan;"

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.850
and "Two Gardenias for Civil
Rights-- Robin Carson's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.750
Portrait of Billie Holiday."

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.720
Her research of Holiday
includes interviews

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.565
of people who knew
Billie personally,

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.940
painting an intimate, singing
portrait of the woman whose

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.070
name is synonymous
with jazz singer.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.760
So, thank you again,
and here's Kim.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.670
KIM NALLEY: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.660
It is the centennial
of the birth

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.900
of the woman whose name is
eponymous with the words "jazz

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.610
singer," Billie Holiday.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.800
Her legacy is so ingrained,
that although she

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.740
was neither the
first nor the last

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.910
to wear a flower in
her hair, a songstress

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.090
with a flower in her hair
will invariably evoke Billie.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.140
There is a great triumvirate
of vocal jazz, which

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.310
consists of Billie Holiday, Ella
Fitzgerald, and Sarah Vaughan.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.870
They were the most creatively
fertile women in their field.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.240
And the fruits of
their creative genius

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.075
have set the vocal standards
so high that no other jazz

00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:58.350
singer since has come even
close to dethroning the memory

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.975
of their musicianship.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:03.310
Of the three singers,
Billie is the eldest,

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.660
and her career
started several years

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.310
before Ella, the second-eldest.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.380
Unlike the other singers,
the sensationalism

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.280
around Billie Holiday's
personal life was legion.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.870
Before gossip blogs existed,
even before the term

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.950
"paparazzi" was coined,
the public's interest

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.200
in the lurid details of
Billie Holiday's life

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.640
dominated, and it has in many
ways diminished her legacy.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.850
She did not go to
school for music.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.360
She did not read or write music.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.200
But she is clearly a genius.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.770
And yet her genius
is rarely emphasized.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.310
In comparison, there are
few biographical sketches

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.790
that avoid delving into her
penchant for abusive men,

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.610
and self-destructive drug use.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.300
I recently read a very
terrible centennial piece

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.010
on Holiday that attributed
her musical interpretation

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.880
of "Lover Man (Oh, where can you
be)" to a longing for heroin.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.880
I do not see the
same attention given

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.500
to Miles Davis' or
Charlie Parker's drug use,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.420
or their abusive relationships.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.250
Their women are not given a
megaphone to comment on them,

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.790
and I have never seen their
musical genius attributed

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.630
to drug use.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.210
I sometimes see the hardships of
being a black man highlighted,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.770
but I do not see the same
courtesy given to Miss Holiday.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.350
So I would like to put her
life in historical context.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.120
Billie Holiday was born
Eleanora Fagan on April 7, 1915,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.840
in Philadelphia, but she
was raised in Baltimore.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.320
Now Baltimore was not a
residentially segregated town

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.370
in 1860, on the eve
of the Civil War.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.190
Less than 4% of blacks
lived in cities.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.940
But by the 1900s, thousands
of African Americans

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.440
migrated into cities
looking for work,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.490
and safety from white
Redemption, which massacred

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.690
and terrorized blacks throughout
the South after Reconstruction

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.170
ended.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.640
With the influx of
African Americans,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.760
Baltimore soon became
residentially segregated,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.130
and the construction of
the B&amp;O railroad displaced

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.070
several African Americans
into already filled slums.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.480
Overcrowding and the lack
of sanitation in these slums

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.210
caused an outbreak of
typhoid and tuberculosis

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.300
of epic proportions.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.740
One black neighborhood was
grimly nicknamed lung block.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.520
Urbanization, industrialization,
and depression in Baltimore

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.020
had concentrated in a growing
population of the poor,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.710
the sick, and the ignorant.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.560
By the nineteen-teens, the
decade of Billie Holiday's

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.330
birth, several
residential ordinances,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.850
passed by progressives and
bolstered by Social Darwinist

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.760
ideology, made
residential segregation

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.590
both de facto and de jure.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.600
Baltimore became such a
highly segregated city

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.280
that in legal studies,
it remains the prime city

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.820
to study to understand
the birth of segregation.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.990
This was the world that Billie
Holiday was born into in 1915.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.620
Her neighborhood was
called "Pigtown."

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.250
Here is how it was described.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.210
"Open drains; great lots
filled with high weeds;

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.740
ashes, and garbage
accumulated in the alleyways.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.470
Cellars filled with
filthy black water.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.520
Houses that are total strangers
to the touch of white wash

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.300
or scrubbing brush.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.240
Human bodies that
have been strangers

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.440
for months to soap and water.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.320
Villainous-looking Negroes,
who loiter and sleep

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.650
around the street
corners, and never work.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.270
Vile and vicious
women with but a smock

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.520
to cover their black nakedness,
lounging in the doorways,

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.780
or squatting upon the
steps, hurling foul epithets

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.850
at every passerby.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.390
Foul streets, foul
people, and foul tenements

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:01.850
filled with foul air.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.600
That is Pigtown."

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.830
Billie Holiday was the offspring
of a one-night dalliance

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.840
at a carnival between
16-year-old Clarence Holiday

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.280
and 18-year-old Sarah
Harris, nee Fagan,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.480
who was nicknamed Sadie.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.720
The two never
married, and did not

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.390
appear to have much
of a relationship

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.267
beyond the night that
created baby Eleanora.

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:25.850
There is little
evidence that Clarence

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.410
had contact with Sadie,
and even less evidence

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.840
of financial support.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.540
Jobs for black
women were limited,

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.770
and Sadie had difficulty
finding work as a live-in maid,

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.410
because white families
usually did not

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.570
allow black children
to accompany

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.200
their live-in, domestic maids.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.650
As a consequence,
Billie intermittently

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.510
did not live with her mother,
and was instead shunted

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.810
around various
maternal relatives.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.320
The clothing inside
of this picture

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.146
were likely secondhand
discards from Sadie's employer.

00:06:58.146 --> 00:07:02.150
On the occasion that she
did live with her mother,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.820
they, like many poor or
African Americans at that time,

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.410
lived in boarding houses.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.580
In 1925 Billie was
living with her mother

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.490
in a Baltimore
boarding house, when

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.420
a much older man, who was also
a boarder at the residence,

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.770
raped her.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.850
It was Christmas Eve.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.120
Billie was 11 years old.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.050
The man was arrested.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.150
Billie was placed in
protective custody

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.820
at a reform school called the
House of the Good Shepherd

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.310
for Colored Girls.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.930
This reform school is often
described as a prison,

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.940
and "fallen women" were
frequently placed there.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.320
There are several accounts of
abuse and girls running away.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.050
Her mother had to
hire a lawyer in order

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.990
to get Billie released.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.040
And so Billie
Holiday's first brushes

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.710
with the law as a
prepubescent child

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.890
results in her being
locked up, even though she

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.220
was the one that was raped.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:04.050
After reform school, Billie
began to run errands at a place

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.210
called Alice Dean's.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.570
It was not a formal
whorehouse, but was rather

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.620
described as a "clip 'em
and let 'em go joint,"

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.960
where one could smoke reefer,
listen to the Victrola,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.150
and if they wanted to,
they could turn a trick.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.250
Most people could not afford
a Victrola and the records

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.880
to play on it, so to be
at a place that played

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.440
records was quite an event.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.050
At Alice Dean's, Billie
Holiday heard Bessie Smith,

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.570
the Empress of the blues.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.450
Billie claimed Bessie Smith,
along with Louis Armstrong,

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.179
as one of her
seminal influences.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.900
Billie would later record one
of Bessie Smith's famous songs,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:49.370
"'Taint Nobody's Business If I
Do," to her own great acclaim.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.310
When Billie Holiday
turned 13, Sadie

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.160
began working at a proper
whorehouse called Florence's

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.880
inside of New York City.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.490
She sent for her daughter
to come and stay with her.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.460
When Billie Holiday
arrived, she discovered

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.060
she was expected to work
there as a prostitute.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.400
There are no photos of
Billie and her mother

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.800
from this time period.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.350
So this photo that you see here
is from a later time period.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.310
I only can impress
upon you in words

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.210
that Billie Holiday,
a very young teenager,

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.960
was transported
across state lines

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.840
to work as a child sex
slave by her mother.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.290
We often forget
how young 12 and 13

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:35.020
years old is when we speak
of African Americans.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.270
And even today the law
increasingly treats

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.340
black and brown
children as adults.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.860
I encourage people to watch
the film "Pretty Baby,"

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.450
with 12-year-old
Brooke Shields, so

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.370
that they can get the full
visceral impact of youth forced

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.750
into prostitution, and try
to afford the same emotions

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.720
for Billie Holiday.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.710
Within months of working
at Florence's, Billie

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.010
was arrested.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.520
And although she was one month
shy of her 14th birthday,

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.350
she gave the police
a false age of 21,

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.390
probably to avoid
another juvenile home.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.490
And consequentially,
she was convicted

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:13.260
as an adult. After
doing four months time

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.590
on Welfare Island, which is
now known as Roosevelt Island,

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.420
she was released in 1929,
the beginning of the Great

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.970
Depression.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.340
Billie decided to
stop turning tricks,

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.250
and to place her bets on
getting a job as an entertainer.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.080
She said, "I always
knew I could sing.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.840
I just didn't know I
could make money at it."

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.990
So instead of singing,
she auditioned as a dancer

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.480
at Pod's and Jerry's Club.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.260
But she danced poorly.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.060
And at the suggestion
of the audition pianist,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.320
she sang a song, and
was immediately hired.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.140
She changed her
last name to Holiday

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.590
in order to capitalize on
her father, who by that time

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.110
was a guitarist in one
of the most-respected

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.760
black big bands, the
Fletcher Henderson Orchestra.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.480
The first name Billie
is from Billie Dove,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.870
a famous actress from
that time period known

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.760
as The American Beauty.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:12.630
This next picture is a photo of
Billie Holiday at approximately

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.100
16 or 17 years of age.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.630
This is the only
known photograph

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:20.910
of her as a teenager in
which she is not working.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.860
Billie's fortitude is amazing.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.440
She never really
had a childhood,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.590
yet she turned her rotten
lemons into lemonade.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.910
She grabbed control of
her life at the tender age

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.150
of 14 years old,
so that she could

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.870
become a professional singer.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.600
However it's very
important to not

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.870
have any illusions
about what the jazz

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.630
life was like back then.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.610
There was a prohibition on
alcohol in the United States

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.630
in 1929, and it does
not end until 1933.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.590
Her gigs were speakeasies
run by gangsters,

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.680
who specialized in
this transport and sale

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.040
of illegal, bootleg substances.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.770
These speakeasies were no
Jazz at Lincoln Center,

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.430
or San Francisco Jazz
Center, or any other type

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.530
of reputable music place.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.570
She grew up in a rough world
full of hustlers and gangsters.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.160
It is small wonder she
attached herself to tough men.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.470
These were the type of
men who could protect her

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.420
in these types of environments.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.030
There was no other option.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.740
Women and bands
were property that

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.320
could be passed from
one owner to another.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.630
There was no choice involved.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.630
It was simple necessity.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.710
One of Billie Holiday's
first regular gigs

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.780
was singing in Queens
for $18 a week.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.350
And so you can get an idea of
how much money that was back

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:44.370
then, you should know that
maids got $0.50 a day.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.090
This photo over
here, is not known

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:53.522
what year it is, but I think
that it's probably also 1935,

00:12:53.522 --> 00:12:56.310
because she appears to
be wearing the same dress

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.180
that she's wearing
outside of the Apollo

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.750
with Ben Webster;
Ram Ramirez, who

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.630
is the person who wrote
"Lover Man (Where Can You Be);

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:06.050
Johnny Russell.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.560
You can see her
later in 1939, she

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.190
seems to be wearing a
little better dresses,

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.015
but they're still not
quite fitting very well.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.010
She kept getting
fired from her gigs,

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.570
because she wouldn't
sing the tunes straight.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.250
But nonetheless, her
originality caught the attention

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.360
of record producer
John Hammond, who

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.150
arranged her first recording
with Benny Goodman Orchestra

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.650
1933.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.180
Now it would seem
that by the time

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.840
Billie Holiday made her
Apollo debut in 1934

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.370
that she was already
established, having recorded

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.720
with Benny Goodman.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.720
But she wanted to be working
in Manhattan, not Queens.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.080
Clarence "Pop" Foster,
the MC of the Apollo,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.930
said she was a fat slob who
wore the same common, ugly dress

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.810
every night.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.700
Excuse me-- he was the
comedian, not the MC.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.410
However, ugly polka
dot dress or not, she

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:11.750
competed, and won first prize
with the song "The Man I Love."

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:17.640
After that, she was able to get
more gigs inside of Manhattan.

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.040
She started working at a Mexican
place called the Hot-Cha,

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.540
and formed a close
bond with her father.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.510
This is a picture of
Billie Holiday's New York.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.880
And it's a great photo,
because it illustrates

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.810
how dense the scene is.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.450
This fertile jazz scene is
a product of segregation,

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.790
and a concentration of talent
in a very small radius.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.510
They could sit in with
each other on set breaks,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.510
catch another person's show
before or after their show.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.560
You can see that over
here under the 3 Deuces,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.696
that Oscar Pettiford is playing.

00:14:52.696 --> 00:14:55.320
And then right down the street,
you can see a little bit of it,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.660
there's Art Tatum who's playing.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.015
Pod's and Jerry's, where
she gets her first audition,

00:15:02.015 --> 00:15:02.640
is right there.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.550
And then there's the Onyx,
which is a club that she later

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.780
plays at, inside of her career.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.280
It is then that she runs into
the amazing pianist Teddy

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.340
Wilson, and embarks upon
a series of recordings

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.680
for the Brunswick label.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:25.340
Teddy Wilson was just
a master of rearranging

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.210
bargain-bin tunes.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:29.500
He and Billie would take
tunes, and they would

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.680
be completely unrecognizable.

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.340
And they would have
hits with them,

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.970
where nobody else would
touch these tunes.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.530
It was more like
rewriting the songs

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:42.520
than actually covering them.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.040
This next picture
is of Lester Young.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.480
Billie Holiday was already
established inside of New York

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.420
by the time Lester Young
got into Manhattan.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.980
And she took him under her wing.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.880
And she let him live
with her and her mom,

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.380
and got him recording dates.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.950
And they had a very, very
close musical romance.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.650
They were not physically
involved with each other,

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.870
but they had a very deep,
deep, deep special love

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.080
with each other.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.850
He is the person that
gave her the name "Lady,"

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:13.430
and she, "Pres," for
president, because he

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.530
was the top cat in the country.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.190
Shortly after,
Billie Holiday began

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.590
playing with the Count
Basie Band, which

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:23.790
is one of my favorite bands.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:27.460
It was just a very
popular jump blues band.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.130
During the same period, Ella
was singing with the Chick Webb

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.190
orchestra.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.730
And so, in 1937, when
the very famous battle

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.510
of the bands at
the Savoy Ballroom

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.850
happened, between Chick
Webb and Count Basie,

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.750
it was also another contest
between Ella Fitzgerald

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.050
and Billie Holiday.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.860
There's almost no
recordings of this period,

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:54.010
because Billie Holiday and Count
Basie were signed to competing

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.200
record label contracts.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.400
However the newspapers
who covered the event very

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.390
thoroughly said that,
"Chick Webb kicked

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:08.040
Count Basie's band's butt, but
Billie won over Ella Fitzgerald

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.380
hands down."

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.810
It seems like this would have
been a match made in heaven,

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.040
Billie Holiday and Count Basie.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.750
But unfortunately,
Billie Holiday

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:21.720
quit Count Basie's
band-- or was fired

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.810
for not wanting to
sing blues tunes--

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:28.910
and she joined
Artie Shaw's band.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.910
If you take a jazz
history class now,

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.740
Artie Shaw is not one of the
people you'll probably study.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:37.370
But I assure you that he
was very, very famous,

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.630
and he was much more famous
than Count Basie at that time

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:42.940
period.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.070
This was her chance
to make it big,

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.930
and to be a cross-over success.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.600
Touring with Artie Shaw on
a national level exposed

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.720
Billie to virulent racism
and Jim Crow conditions

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.330
inside of the South,
forcing her to defecate

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.760
on the side of the road,
and wait in the kitchen

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.570
in between tunes; and
subjected to audiences

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.150
yelling, "Let the nigger
wench sing another tune."

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.520
The final straw came when
segregation on the radio waves

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.840
forced the band to
replace Billie Holiday's

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.270
voice with Helen Forrest
for an important broadcast.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.880
Billie quit and went back to
New York to meet her destiny.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.400
She started working at
a place in the Village

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.950
called the Cafe Society.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.760
The Cafe Society was a
hip Greenwich Village

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.490
bar filled with intellectuals,
bohemians, and artists.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.850
It was there in 1939 that
she was introduced to

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:40.820
and began performing
the song "Strange

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:45.420
Fruit," an anti-lynching protest
song written by Jewish writer

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.270
Abel Meeropol.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:49.620
This song catapulted
Billie Holiday

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.740
into a new kind of stardom.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.970
The owner of Cafe
Society was hip enough

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.080
to not only let
her sing the song,

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.680
but to demand absolute silence.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.690
No cash register
buttons were pushed.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.050
No drink orders were taken.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.910
There was no whispering.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.780
And he gave her a black
room, with a tight spotlight

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.890
on her face.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.060
She recorded "Strange Fruit"
on Billy Crystal's uncle's

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.550
brand-new Commodore label,
because her label, Columbia,

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:22.820
wouldn't touch the song.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.540
This song, and her performances
of it at the Cafe Society,

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.360
turned Billie Holiday
into a legend.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.900
She was no longer the singer
of sentimental love songs.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.200
She became a race woman,
an outspoken proponent

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.710
of civil rights,
more than 15 years

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:45.210
before "Brown versus Board of
Education," and almost 20 years

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:48.300
before the March on Washington.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.650
What is less considered
about "Strange Fruit"

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:54.160
is the song's
communist background.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.820
Abel Meeropol was a communist
who, like most communists,

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.660
believed in racial equality.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.900
He is also famous for adopting
the Rosenberg children,

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.460
whose parents, Julius
and Ethel Rosenberg,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:12.480
were executed for passing
nuclear information

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.300
to the Soviets, even though
the United States and the USSR

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:21.950
were World War II
allies at that time.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:25.230
"Strange Fruit" began as a poem,
printed in a teacher's union

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:30.220
paper under the
pseudonym of Lewis Allan.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.620
The song was
printed again inside

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.540
of The New Masses,
a Marxist magazine.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.360
How much persecution did
Meeropol, a white Jewish man,

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.610
face that compelled him to
publish it under a pseudonym?

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.690
As opposed to Holiday,
a black woman,

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.920
who sang it publicly in person,
and attached her livelihood

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.760
to it.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.950
It is important not
to overlook the fact

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.970
that communism was active
in promoting civil rights

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.950
and racial equality.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.520
The connection between
communism and racial equality

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.860
was so strong that
during the McCarthy era,

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.800
people working for
racial equality

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.420
were summarily labeled
communists, or at the very

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.560
least, pinkos.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.160
There are several accounts
of artistic careers ruined

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.530
during the McCarthy
era of the '50s.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.570
These are the same years that
coincided with the last decade

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.900
of Billie Holiday's life.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.810
All in all, Billie Holiday's
life spanned 30 years.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.950
She recorded from her teens
until her death in 1959

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.840
at the age of 44.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.550
There are very, very few
artists, especially vocalists,

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.650
who can claim a recording
career with such length.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.070
Shirley Horn, Etta Jones,
Jimmy Scott, Alberta Hunter,

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.520
and many others, all
fell out of the spotlight

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.360
for decades before
making comebacks.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.110
While much to-do is made over
the changes in Billie Holiday's

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.830
voice over the decades,
any classical vocal student

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:57.010
can tell you that a
voice, like an athlete,

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:00.650
peaks at a certain age, and
declines despite one's best

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.190
efforts to preserve it.

00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.980
Billie Holiday's change
is often accompanied

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.110
by accusations of
self-destruction,

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.110
but I myself admire the
genius of her later years.

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.270
It is a study in minimalism
and breath control.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.520
Her lyricism is resplendent,
and improvisation is so great

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.659
that the melody at
times is unrecognizable

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:24.950
from the published sheet music.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:27.610
Yet so direct and simple,
that her improvisation

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:30.490
is more melodic than
the original melody.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.110
Her final studio
album, "Lady in Satin,"

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.490
was borrowed from my
collection and was never

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.520
returned so often that I
purchased it eight times

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.240
before the digital
world rendered

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.100
such extended loans impossible.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.300
It's never Billie Holiday's
early material that's

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.420
stolen from my collection.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.980
It's always the older material.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.340
Her musical offerings are on par
with John Coltrane, and Parker,

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.497
and should be
considered as such.

00:22:56.497 --> 00:22:58.830
So the next time you read an
article on Billie Holiday's

00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.670
life, remember that
she was a genius who

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:05.490
battled virulent segregation,
racism, sexism, rape,

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.950
molestation, and sexual abuse.

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:10.180
She was trafficked into
child sexual slavery,

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.480
and possibly even sterilized
in prison against her will,

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.310
due to the eugenic
politics of her time.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.060
And somehow, Holiday took
the crap she was given,

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.130
and grew violets for her furs.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:23.110
She truly is one of the
most important artists

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.210
of the 20th century.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:27.190
And now, if you
have any questions,

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:28.280
I'd be happy to take them.

00:23:32.726 --> 00:23:38.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.290
AUDIENCE: So, I was going
to ask, when did you

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.360
first discover Billie Holiday?

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.120
And how did your interest grow?

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.320
KIM NALLEY: She was
one of the artists

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:54.540
that I listened to growing up
inside of my childhood home.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.620
And along with Nina
Simone, and Nancy Wilson,

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:04.370
we were fed a steady diet of
them, and Ella Fitzgerald.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.220
So I can't remember a time
where I didn't know them.

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.450
And then my great-uncle
was also a jazz drummer,

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.700
who played with Dexter Gordon.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.850
So I kind of come from
a family of musicians

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.335
for a few generations.

00:24:15.335 --> 00:24:19.500
AUDIENCE: What did you
think of Diana Ross?

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.400
KIM NALLEY: What did I
think about Diana Ross?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.730
At the time, I really
disliked it as a child.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:32.640
They just took so many
liberties with her story.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.030
So what happened with
Billie Holiday is,

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:42.300
she married Louis McKay right
before she died, because they

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.300
were arrested for drugs.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.420
And so they married,
so that way they

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.740
wouldn't have to testify against
each other inside of court

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.720
under coverture.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.720
So it just so happened
that when she died,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.640
Louis McKay inherited
her entire property.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.210
And he was a hustler
and pimp, and he

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:09.250
decided to spin it so
that he was the savior.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.230
And he got Billy Dee
Williams to play himself.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:16.230
But he was absolutely
terrible, and terrible to her.

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:22.796
So I wasn't impressed with
it at all, even as a kid.

00:25:22.796 --> 00:25:24.700
AUDIENCE: Where do
you suggest that we

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.400
find reliable information
if we want to learn more?

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.220
KIM NALLEY: I was just thinking
right before I came here,

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:34.393
I should have had the last
slide be a bibliography.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.564
So there are a few different
books, biographies,

00:25:40.564 --> 00:25:41.480
that are really great.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:44.090
One is by Donald Clarke.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:47.450
The other is by
Stuart Nicholson.

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.790
And those are very basic
books that probably everybody

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.090
or anybody has.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:57.470
There's also the auto--
her "autobiography,"

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.880
"Lady Sings the Blues,"
which is riddled with a lot

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.500
of inaccuracies.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.100
But at least it gives
you a step to go into it

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.710
and learn some more.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.640
I would say one of
my favorite books

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.390
on Billie Holiday is
called "On Billie,"

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.600
and it's just a collection
of oral histories,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.190
the first person interviews
with people that knew her,

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:20.310
including people that
played with her when

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:23.330
she was 10, 11, 13.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:28.840
And the quote from Pops Foster,
that she was a big, fat slob

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.362
with big titties.

00:26:30.362 --> 00:26:32.320
That's what he really
thought of her back then.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.420
And I think those
are really great.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.590
Her secretary is
included in that.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.430
And then beyond that,
there is Robert O'Meally,

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.620
who is a wonderful scholar.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.230
He is a English literature.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.480
And he wrote a beautiful
book on Billie Holiday.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.590
And it's a really nice
coffee table book.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.740
And it has a lot of
beautiful photographs

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.530
that I've never seen before.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:00.130
And he is an academic
scholar, so it's meticulously

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:00.670
researched.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.990
So it's more than just
a coffee table book.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.380
But it's really nice.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.840
AUDIENCE: One is, how
did she make transition

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.900
from the world of prostitution
to the world of entertainment,

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.270
or did she keep some
of the connections

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.650
with the underworld
of prostitution?

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:21.330
And the second question is,
what was her relationship

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:28.684
to the Civil Rights Movement
in the '50s, before she passed?

00:27:28.684 --> 00:27:33.960
KIM NALLEY: Well, she
made a very clean break

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:40.380
from prostitution into
singing at the age of 14.

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:44.480
And the pay scale
for singing was such

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:50.510
that it was enough to keep
you out of prostitution.

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:55.240
She was getting paid
more as a jazz singer

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.430
than she would get
as a prostitute.

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:01.039
So that's pretty clear.

00:28:01.039 --> 00:28:03.580
But again, as I mentioned-- you
might have missed the earlier

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.660
part-- the world
of jazz singing,

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.580
there was a great
amount of overlap.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.250
So the people frequenting the
clubs during that time period

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:17.500
were frequently hustlers,
and pimps, and prostitutes.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.520
And definitely lots
of white people

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:27.190
who wanted to slum it, and avid
fans, and a good mix of crowd.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:34.330
Just performing at the Cafe
Society was a civil rights act.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:39.400
It was an integrated club,
and it was more than just

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.450
integrated meaning
that the races mixed,

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.390
but they were actually
treated equally.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.430
And that was almost not the
case in most of the places

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.900
in Harlem inside of this period.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.570
Most of these places
had black entertainment

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.090
for white patrons.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:29:03.150
But it's hard to talk about
her inside of the same breath,

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.970
because what we think of as
the modern-day Civil Rights

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.510
Movement is really a
'60s kind of thing.

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.450
And she dies in '59.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:12.720
So she really predates it.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.190
And she is just a really early
forerunner inside of the Civil

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:18.750
Rights Movement, definitely.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.850
AUDIENCE: I know you
mentioned "Lady in Satin."

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:27.270
I'd love to hear, if you're
thinking about listening more

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:31.570
into her music collection,
what else would you recommend?

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:32.570
What are your favorites?

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.096
What really shows the range?

00:29:36.096 --> 00:29:40.090
KIM NALLEY: There is
a box set by Columbia,

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.240
and Columbia is the
record label that she

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.280
was on during her
early years, that

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:50.830
really shows the range of her
voice when she was younger.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.660
And it also has her very
first two recordings

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:58.370
with Benny Goodman that
nobody possibly would know,

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:02.660
unless you happen to
have this box set.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.090
And her voice is very bell-like,
and it's very, very, very

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:10.530
clear, and very high,
and very girlish.

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:14.240
And then I think that most of
us are very familiar with Billie

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.470
Holiday in the later
years, where it's a drawl,

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.700
and you can hear all the
vocal fry in her voice.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.450
That's so recognizable.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:27.520
But that Columbia box
is really, really nice.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.680
And again, that
has a booklet in it

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.430
that has a lot of
beautiful pictures

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:34.300
that you could put
on your coffee table.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:38.450
It's probably about
11 by 17 liner notes.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.369
It's really nice.

00:30:40.369 --> 00:30:42.660
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, Kim,
for speaking to us today.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.730
KIM NALLEY: Thanks.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.280
[APPLAUSE]
