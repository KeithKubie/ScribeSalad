00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:02.961
- [Narrator] This program is presented by

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.502
University of California Television.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.321
(melancholy guitar music)

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.412
- We went into the homes of 32 families.

00:00:40.412 --> 00:00:43.676
The families all had parents who worked.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.351
Both parents worked outside the home

00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:46.998
at least 30 hours a week.

00:00:46.998 --> 00:00:49.439
- And we designed an
ethno-archaeological component

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:52.299
that really addressed the questions

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.650
of how people use their
built environments,

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.834
how they use space, how they interact

00:00:56.834 --> 00:01:00.174
with their material
culture, the material worlds

00:01:00.174 --> 00:01:03.957
of middle class, dual come
families with children.

00:01:03.957 --> 00:01:04.790
- Come in.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.396
- I like this chair.

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:08.881
- We systematically documented what people

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:11.881
have in their homes, where they keep it.

00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:14.893
- And it was that first day, when I-

00:01:14.893 --> 00:01:16.370
I saw he had a camera.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.641
He's taking pictures.

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:20.058
We had tidied up.

00:01:21.176 --> 00:01:23.135
When I heard the first cupboard open,

00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:24.802
and I went, "Oh, no.

00:01:27.293 --> 00:01:32.076
"He's taking pictures of the
insides of the cupboards too."

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:35.021
All these little figurines
and the napkins and things.

00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:37.608
- The archeologist counted
every single thing,

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:41.853
in every single space, every single room.

00:01:41.853 --> 00:01:45.377
So we have a document
of the number of objects

00:01:45.377 --> 00:01:47.140
that are in kids rooms,
the number of objects

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.145
that are in kitchens and living rooms.

00:01:49.145 --> 00:01:51.095
It's really fascinating.

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:55.365
- One of the things that we
discovered and documented

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.198
is that contemporary US households

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.223
have more possessions per household

00:02:02.223 --> 00:02:04.796
than any society in global history.

00:02:04.796 --> 00:02:08.609
Hyperconsumerism is
evident in many spaces,

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:12.141
like garages, corners of home offices,

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:15.094
and even sometimes in the
corners of living rooms

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:17.146
and bedrooms, and the kitchen,

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:19.207
and the top of the dining room table.

00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:20.102
- Shower stalls.

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:22.278
- The shower stalls.

00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:24.111
We find lots of stuff.

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:25.874
- [Elinor] Piles

00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:26.765
- Piles of stuff.

00:02:26.765 --> 00:02:27.624
- Mountains.

00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:30.287
- And it's clearly in
some of these households

00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:34.454
creating some significant
stress for the families,

00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:38.211
particularly the mothers.

00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:43.057
- The finding was that women
who looked around their homes

00:02:43.057 --> 00:02:46.653
and saw clutter, and
remarked on the clutter,

00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:50.750
and remarked on the effect of
the clutter on their lives,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.750
mainly that it was very,

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.349
it was like an ever-present, continuing,

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.182
ongoing burden for them to manage,

00:03:01.077 --> 00:03:03.694
that those women when we looked at

00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:06.931
the cortisol levels of the women,

00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:08.961
their cortisol was very high.

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:12.009
- So this is yes, a very crowded bedroom.

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.558
All the reading that
I haven't gotten done.

00:03:14.558 --> 00:03:16.341
- [Elinor] A house
could be full of clutter

00:03:16.341 --> 00:03:18.003
and nobody cares.

00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:19.231
- [Lyn] That's right, that's right.

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:23.137
- It was generally the case, that men,

00:03:23.137 --> 00:03:25.646
they didn't even remark on the clutter.

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:29.138
So there's a greater tendency
to remark on the clutter

00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:32.807
if it bothers you, if you are the one

00:03:32.807 --> 00:03:35.084
who's responsible for tidying it up.

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:36.502
- We have lots of stuff.

00:03:36.502 --> 00:03:38.864
We have many mechanisms by which we

00:03:38.864 --> 00:03:41.674
accumulate possessions in our home.

00:03:41.674 --> 00:03:44.710
But we have few rituals
or mechanisms or processes

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.382
for unloading these objects,
for getting rid of them.

00:03:48.382 --> 00:03:50.283
- Things come in from all sides.

00:03:50.283 --> 00:03:51.116
They really do.

00:03:51.116 --> 00:03:53.439
They come in from gifts,
and birthday parties,

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:56.721
and holidays, and from relatives,
and those kinds of things,

00:03:56.721 --> 00:04:00.774
and school, and treasures, as I call them.

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:04.604
I have always been a treasure hoarder.

00:04:04.604 --> 00:04:08.139
So a rock, or a branch, or something,

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.664
and my kids then ended up that same way.

00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:13.449
- There are a lot of
forces that encourage us

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:15.163
to consume, and obviously this is

00:04:15.163 --> 00:04:17.183
the entire advertising industry, right?

00:04:17.183 --> 00:04:21.268
Millions of dollars invested
to get us to purchase things.

00:04:21.268 --> 00:04:24.768
(melancholy guitar music)

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.655
This book is really meant
to get us to think about

00:04:34.655 --> 00:04:37.871
how we consume objects, to think about

00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:41.534
the number and types of toys we consume

00:04:41.534 --> 00:04:43.542
and give to our children.

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:47.871
- The United States has 3.1%
of the world's children,

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:51.371
but consumes 40% of the world's toys.

00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:55.159
- [Elinor] Of course,
children in all societies

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.010
have something that is similar to toys.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.390
But the sheer quantity of
toys is really astonishing

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.697
from the cross-cultural point of view,

00:05:04.697 --> 00:05:08.864
and how the toys spill out
everywhere in the house as well

00:05:10.014 --> 00:05:11.597
is also staggering.

00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:17.029
- We found in the study that
children's toys and objects

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.172
were in living rooms.

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:19.819
They were in spare bedrooms.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.386
They were in their own rooms, of course.

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:22.408
They were in kitchens.

00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:24.907
They were even in, sometimes,
in master bedrooms.

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.059
- [Elinor] There's some blurriness

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.526
to the idea of a toy, because the parents

00:05:28.526 --> 00:05:30.334
have a lot of sentimental involvement

00:05:30.334 --> 00:05:31.973
in these toys as parents.

00:05:31.973 --> 00:05:33.819
One of the things we soon realized,

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.928
is that the toys themselves
were toys for the parents

00:05:37.928 --> 00:05:39.463
as well as for the children.

00:05:39.463 --> 00:05:42.058
The house actually had a kind of

00:05:42.058 --> 00:05:44.891
child culture about it as a whole,

00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:48.373
where it became a child-centered house.

00:05:48.373 --> 00:05:49.732
- Some of it's nostalgia, right?

00:05:49.732 --> 00:05:51.571
I mean, Snoopy, he's a cultural icon.

00:05:51.571 --> 00:05:54.110
How many children
actually recognize Snoopy

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.578
in the contemporary.

00:05:55.578 --> 00:05:58.810
I think Snoopy's almost an
artifact of our childhood.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.798
I think the sheer
density and availability,

00:06:02.798 --> 00:06:06.538
and fairly inexpensive array of objects

00:06:06.538 --> 00:06:09.764
that are out there, this
has significantly changed

00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:12.057
over the last 50 years.

00:06:12.057 --> 00:06:15.974
We've found cheaper ways
to produce more stuff.

00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:20.022
Because of that, there's more available.

00:06:20.022 --> 00:06:22.734
The reality is that we're
perhaps spending more

00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:26.083
on children's material culture, on toys,

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.946
than ever before in the
history of humanity.

00:06:28.946 --> 00:06:31.529
(upbeat music)

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:36.487
One of the chapters of
the book is devoted to

00:06:36.487 --> 00:06:38.425
looking at what people
have in their pantries,

00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:42.859
what they have on the shelves
in the garage by way of food,

00:06:42.859 --> 00:06:45.624
by way of what we found
to be stockpiled food,

00:06:45.624 --> 00:06:47.704
and stockpiled household goods.

00:06:47.704 --> 00:06:52.053
We walked into some family
homes, and we found that

00:06:52.053 --> 00:06:55.330
in addition to refrigerators
and freezers in the kitchen

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.472
being packed full of convenience foods,

00:06:58.472 --> 00:07:01.120
the freezer that was in the garage

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.186
as part of that secondary refrigerator

00:07:03.186 --> 00:07:06.093
which is not uncommon in
American family homes,

00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:09.300
was also stocked full of
these convenience foods.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.033
- If you brought someone from Rome,

00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:15.666
or from a town in Sweden,
and you showed them

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:18.297
the size of the
refrigerator in the kitchen,

00:07:18.297 --> 00:07:20.832
and then walked them to the garage,

00:07:20.832 --> 00:07:24.433
and they saw the size of the
refrigerator in the garage,

00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:26.970
they would be pretty astonished.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.921
The refrigerator then becomes something

00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:31.534
to think about culturally.

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.640
Why do we have these big refrigerators?

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.519
What is that saying about
food in our society?

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:39.464
- Dual-income families with children

00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:42.378
face scheduling challenges
that single adults do not,

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:46.392
and that's how do I
coordinate shopping trips,

00:07:46.392 --> 00:07:50.007
going to the grocery,
around school schedules,

00:07:50.007 --> 00:07:54.120
around afternoon pickups,
around the myriad of obligations

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.603
that emerge from coordinating

00:07:56.603 --> 00:08:00.127
two or three calendars on a daily basis.

00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:02.999
Parents perhaps find that it's easier

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:07.683
to shop maybe only once a
week, or once every two weeks.

00:08:07.683 --> 00:08:11.296
Fewer shopping trips,
bigger shopping trips

00:08:11.296 --> 00:08:12.361
when we go do them.

00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:16.642
So hitting the big box
stores like Costco or Target.

00:08:16.642 --> 00:08:17.947
- I think that's true.

00:08:17.947 --> 00:08:19.408
We still do go to Costco.

00:08:19.408 --> 00:08:20.517
When we're there we'll go,

00:08:20.517 --> 00:08:23.301
"Oh, yes, we need 96 granola bars.

00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:24.849
"We need them."

00:08:24.849 --> 00:08:25.698
- Forty batteries.

00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:29.550
- And we still have some
of the residue of that.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:31.702
If I were to walk through
my kitchen right now,

00:08:31.702 --> 00:08:33.781
you're right, I'd still have
a cupboard full of batteries,

00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:36.833
even though we don't
have that many devices

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:38.770
that need those batteries anymore.

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.129
- In addition to this,
you would find shelves

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:45.319
in garages and in pantries
that would be overflowing

00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:48.720
with pallets of bottled
water, and juice drinks,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.431
and paper towels, and cleaning products,

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.079
multiple versions of the same things.

00:08:56.079 --> 00:08:58.662
(upbeat music)

00:09:02.928 --> 00:09:05.265
- The reason for having
such large refrigerators,

00:09:05.265 --> 00:09:07.643
having such large freezers was because

00:09:07.643 --> 00:09:10.785
we were putting inside
the freezer, especially,

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:14.963
boxed items that were
prepackaged convenience foods.

00:09:14.963 --> 00:09:18.402
- Chicken nuggets, frozen
pizzas, fish sticks,

00:09:18.402 --> 00:09:20.938
French fries, things that could be cooked,

00:09:20.938 --> 00:09:23.803
that could be prepared from cold to hot

00:09:23.803 --> 00:09:25.621
in very little time.

00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:28.975
- There are now on average 400 linear feet

00:09:28.975 --> 00:09:32.345
of frozen foods available
in these big box stores

00:09:32.345 --> 00:09:34.279
and these big grocery stores.

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:36.603
This contributes, actually, to the way

00:09:36.603 --> 00:09:38.791
that families are consuming their meals.

00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:42.206
With so much prepackaged
and frozen food available,

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:45.580
we're getting more and more family dinners

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.963
that are actually these
segmented, independent mini meals.

00:09:49.963 --> 00:09:51.919
The kids insist on eating
something different,

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:54.391
because they know that
mom can fix it easily

00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:57.360
with this prepackaged food.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.171
Our data show that only one in six meals

00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:05.074
is eaten together by the entire family.

00:10:05.074 --> 00:10:06.749
- Families have brought into this idea

00:10:06.749 --> 00:10:11.177
that use of these foods
will somehow save time

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:13.699
in the preparation of meals, at the end of

00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:17.138
otherwise busy and hectic
work days, and school days.

00:10:17.138 --> 00:10:20.998
In the end, some of the
self-researchers found that

00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:24.410
families are only shaving off
about 12 minutes per meal.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.610
- We started doing something.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.261
We go to a business that
provides ingredients

00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:32.928
and we "don't cook."

00:10:34.082 --> 00:10:37.671
But you package all the
ingredients for a particular meal.

00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:40.471
This is what your typical
dinner would look like.

00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:41.350
- Oh, right.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.607
- So you package all the
ingredients to make a sauce.

00:10:44.607 --> 00:10:46.357
You get the meat.

00:10:46.357 --> 00:10:48.563
Then you get the whole, all
the cooking instructions.

00:10:48.563 --> 00:10:49.396
- That's fantastic.

00:10:49.396 --> 00:10:52.441
- You un-freeze it, and then
ta da, dinner in a sack.

00:10:52.441 --> 00:10:53.819
It's absolutely fabulous.

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:55.504
- That's very good.

00:10:55.504 --> 00:10:58.738
- It's certainly a strong pattern.

00:10:58.738 --> 00:11:02.585
We saw this recurringly
across the 32 families,

00:11:02.585 --> 00:11:04.425
not all of them, but many of them.

00:11:04.425 --> 00:11:07.983
It really indicates these
consumption patterns

00:11:07.983 --> 00:11:10.694
that have changed over the
last couple of decades.

00:11:10.694 --> 00:11:14.601
We want to go to the store
fewer times per week.

00:11:14.601 --> 00:11:17.730
This is particularly true
for middle class families,

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.286
with both parents working and
with two or more children.

00:11:20.286 --> 00:11:22.888
It's a lot of work, shopping with kids.

00:11:22.888 --> 00:11:25.522
This is a way to get around that.

00:11:25.522 --> 00:11:27.613
But there are very real
material consequences.

00:11:27.613 --> 00:11:30.196
(upbeat music)

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:37.391
This book is very much
a visual ethnography.

00:11:37.391 --> 00:11:40.443
We used some 20,000 digital photographs

00:11:40.443 --> 00:11:44.974
for 32 families' homes as
the basis of the analysis.

00:11:44.974 --> 00:11:48.675
We went in and looked
for things, for patterns,

00:11:48.675 --> 00:11:50.756
and how families were using their homes,

00:11:50.756 --> 00:11:52.537
the kinds of things that they imported

00:11:52.537 --> 00:11:54.502
into various home spaces.

00:11:54.502 --> 00:11:58.747
Kitchens, for example, were these centers

00:11:58.747 --> 00:12:02.373
of intensive and frequent activity.

00:12:02.373 --> 00:12:05.098
- If you look at the data points

00:12:05.098 --> 00:12:08.165
of where family members
are every 10 minutes,

00:12:08.165 --> 00:12:11.081
you'll see lots and lots of little dots

00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:12.550
that are in the kitchen.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:15.259
That's because the kitchen is used for

00:12:15.259 --> 00:12:17.903
almost everything else but-

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.513
No, it's used for eating.

00:12:19.513 --> 00:12:22.217
But it's also used for
a lot of other things.

00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:23.595
If there's going to be
a clock in the house,

00:12:23.595 --> 00:12:25.448
the clock is going to be in the kitchen,

00:12:25.448 --> 00:12:28.330
because the kitchen is what Anthony calls

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.573
the command center of the house.

00:12:30.573 --> 00:12:32.481
- Everything transpires in kitchens.

00:12:32.481 --> 00:12:34.097
Activities are organized.

00:12:34.097 --> 00:12:36.012
Schedules are coordinated.

00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:37.832
Plans are made for the next day.

00:12:37.832 --> 00:12:38.810
Meals are cooked.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.718
Kids are doing homework in kitchen spaces.

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:43.612
Very, very intensively used.

00:12:43.612 --> 00:12:46.014
A lot of the material culture in kitchens

00:12:46.014 --> 00:12:48.681
speaks to this logistical center

00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:52.316
of everyday family life.

00:12:52.316 --> 00:12:55.801
- I think of the table itself
as kind of a touchstone.

00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:58.942
It's the place where
everyone wants to aggregate,

00:12:58.942 --> 00:13:01.603
even when there are wonderful
facilities that were

00:13:01.603 --> 00:13:05.987
designed for the kids to do
their homework, for example,

00:13:05.987 --> 00:13:08.845
inevitably they're out
at the kitchen table.

00:13:08.845 --> 00:13:11.066
That's convenient for
the moms too, of course.

00:13:11.066 --> 00:13:12.328
They can do child care.

00:13:12.328 --> 00:13:15.725
They can multitask with dinner
preparation and child care.

00:13:15.725 --> 00:13:18.549
- That is our refrigerator,
or was our refrigerator.

00:13:18.549 --> 00:13:21.305
I mean, I look at these
and it just gives me joy

00:13:21.305 --> 00:13:22.652
to see this stuff.

00:13:22.652 --> 00:13:25.409
Because these were treasures
that were very near and dear.

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:27.558
- It's amazing how the refrigerator

00:13:27.558 --> 00:13:30.225
is a site of memories and plans.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.549
- Yes, this is memories.

00:13:34.549 --> 00:13:39.017
- One of the studies that
Jeanne and Anthony did

00:13:39.017 --> 00:13:42.556
was look at the family refrigerator door

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:45.973
as a major site of this kind of nostalgia

00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:49.014
and sentimentality for the family,

00:13:49.014 --> 00:13:51.626
looking at how many different photographs

00:13:51.626 --> 00:13:55.346
and other personal things
about children's art,

00:13:55.346 --> 00:13:59.035
and lots of little things about the family

00:13:59.035 --> 00:14:01.689
that went on the door, so much that

00:14:01.689 --> 00:14:03.767
you can't even see the door.

00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:06.345
The door is just filled
with the family culture,

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.668
the family history.

00:14:07.668 --> 00:14:11.886
- There seems to be a kind
of a correlation between

00:14:11.886 --> 00:14:15.653
how much stuff is on the
refrigerator panel door

00:14:15.653 --> 00:14:19.673
and how much stuff is in the broader home.

00:14:19.673 --> 00:14:23.655
- There's still, these are
notices for dentist appointments,

00:14:23.655 --> 00:14:25.397
but those are one timers.

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:26.826
- And these are school things.

00:14:26.826 --> 00:14:28.340
- This is all, if your
kid's going to be sick,

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.491
how do you call in sick,

00:14:29.491 --> 00:14:32.081
because I never remember how to do that.

00:14:32.081 --> 00:14:33.776
A school calendar for the days.

00:14:33.776 --> 00:14:34.899
- And this pizza?

00:14:34.899 --> 00:14:37.213
- These are pizza
coupons that Luke is now-

00:14:37.213 --> 00:14:38.475
Now, look at-

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:41.028
This is going to, this
shows stuff gets up here

00:14:41.028 --> 00:14:42.823
and it never, ever leaves.

00:14:42.823 --> 00:14:46.987
I think the expiration date
on these is two years ago.

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:48.582
- We also found some interesting patterns

00:14:48.582 --> 00:14:50.294
that emerged in bathrooms.

00:14:50.294 --> 00:14:51.856
Bathrooms are where we
start the day, right?

00:14:51.856 --> 00:14:53.345
So we put on our face.

00:14:53.345 --> 00:14:54.369
We put on our clothes.

00:14:54.369 --> 00:14:55.202
We look at ourselves.

00:14:55.202 --> 00:14:56.035
We check in.

00:14:56.035 --> 00:14:57.892
We make sure that everything's there.

00:14:57.892 --> 00:15:01.537
We psyche up for the
workplace and for school.

00:15:01.537 --> 00:15:04.254
They end up being these
anticipatory spaces,

00:15:04.254 --> 00:15:07.325
where we're anticipating the day to come.

00:15:07.325 --> 00:15:09.018
- Not only is our fridge the site of,

00:15:09.018 --> 00:15:12.056
but our bathroom mirror has
become the schedule center.

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:13.925
Because we have a really
big bathroom mirror.

00:15:13.925 --> 00:15:16.328
So anything that kids are
doing that's important

00:15:16.328 --> 00:15:17.369
is taped up there.

00:15:17.369 --> 00:15:20.197
Because I won't always open the fridge

00:15:20.197 --> 00:15:21.202
first thing in the morning,

00:15:21.202 --> 00:15:24.037
but I will always brush my teeth,

00:15:24.037 --> 00:15:25.667
and look at myself in the mirror.

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.393
- Bathrooms are also
perhaps one of the most

00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:30.025
contested resources in families' homes.

00:15:30.025 --> 00:15:31.653
A lot of the families'
homes that we were in

00:15:31.653 --> 00:15:33.320
had only one bathroom.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.209
When you have to cycle
everyone through that space

00:15:36.209 --> 00:15:38.663
within a span of about 30 to 45 minutes

00:15:38.663 --> 00:15:41.841
before shuffling everyone
off to school and work,

00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:42.860
it can be stressful.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.356
You're coordinating opportunities
to visit the bathroom.

00:15:46.356 --> 00:15:48.594
As a result, we found that
there's a lot of sharing,

00:15:48.594 --> 00:15:51.078
and family strategies for dealing with

00:15:51.078 --> 00:15:53.604
this very finite and limited resources.

00:15:53.604 --> 00:15:56.187
Stack multiple people in there.

00:15:57.088 --> 00:16:00.340
Because of that, these
were interesting sites

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.803
of child socialization.

00:16:02.803 --> 00:16:06.396
- One of the clear ideals of these parents

00:16:06.396 --> 00:16:09.813
is to create a master bedroom environment

00:16:11.312 --> 00:16:15.713
that represents a retreat,
a spa-like retreat,

00:16:15.713 --> 00:16:19.501
from the crazy chaos in
the rest of the house.

00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:22.621
- This is perhaps one of
the least intensively used

00:16:22.621 --> 00:16:24.119
rooms in the home.

00:16:24.119 --> 00:16:28.113
Not a lot of activities were
unfolding in master bedrooms.

00:16:28.113 --> 00:16:30.934
But what you might find surprising is that

00:16:30.934 --> 00:16:33.269
this, out of all other home spaces,

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:35.597
this was prioritized more frequently

00:16:35.597 --> 00:16:38.380
as a space for remodeling.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.547
In 2004, the average cost
of creating a master suite

00:16:45.574 --> 00:16:47.776
in the greater Los Angeles area,

00:16:47.776 --> 00:16:49.461
was about $80,000.

00:16:49.461 --> 00:16:51.410
- Their money would have
been much better spent

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.605
on places that are clear
bottlenecks in these homes,

00:16:55.605 --> 00:16:59.611
bathrooms that are overly
busy during the morning rush,

00:16:59.611 --> 00:17:02.217
or kitchens that are often described

00:17:02.217 --> 00:17:05.491
by the family members
themselves as too small,

00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:06.824
too out of date.

00:17:07.864 --> 00:17:11.093
- I can think of nothing
that more potently

00:17:11.093 --> 00:17:15.842
speaks to the significance
of this space to parents.

00:17:15.842 --> 00:17:18.030
We might even think of the master suite as

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.732
a symbolic space.

00:17:19.732 --> 00:17:22.215
If they're like my family, you just crash.

00:17:22.215 --> 00:17:25.761
You fall asleep because you're
tired and you're exhausted.

00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:27.470
But you get to wake up in that space.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.711
These are spaces that were
made to look more hotel-like,

00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:32.963
look more resort-like.

00:17:32.963 --> 00:17:35.996
They were intentionally
decluttered as well.

00:17:35.996 --> 00:17:40.048
This is opportunity for parents to wake up

00:17:40.048 --> 00:17:43.061
in a space that looks
qualitatively different

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:45.591
than the rest of their home.

00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:48.341
For that reason, because of that,

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.130
parents might have conferred some kind of

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.738
restorative benefits out of this.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.331
This is a place to charge your batteries,

00:17:55.331 --> 00:17:58.414
a place of refuge to prepare yourself

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.778
before you go back out
and face all of the work

00:18:01.778 --> 00:18:05.772
that is contemporary American
family households and beyond.

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:08.439
(upbeat music)
