00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.870
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.210
This is another lecture of mechanisms or
methods that are,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.310
they're not sort of current
computer vision research, or

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.590
really the state of the art in Computer
Vision, but they are very important

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.810
methods that we make use of all
the time for a variety of operations.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.625
And what we're going to talk about today
is really some binary image analysis.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:26.035
There are lots of times that we produce
images that are essentially zeros and

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:26.770
ones.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.490
One talks at zero is a background and
one is a foreground.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.310
So, for example, I might be looking
in fact we talked about background

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.930
subtraction when we were doing,
detection of moving objects.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.250
Right, and so basically the ones where
the stuff was supposed to be moving and

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.510
the zeroes were supposed
to be where it wasn't.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.940
And in fact, there was this example that
I showed of people sitting on the steps

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.640
of the University, and we did a median
filter, and then we subtracted them off.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.740
We did a thresholding,
then I did, I said,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.330
we did something called morphological
operations to clean it up.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.790
Today, we're doing
the morphological operations, and

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.620
it's often buried deep within
any functioning vision system.
