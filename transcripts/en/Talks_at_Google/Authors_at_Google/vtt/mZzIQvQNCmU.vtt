00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.970
SPEAKER 1: So let's
start at the beginning.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.040
So Arno, in the late
'80s, early '90s,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.140
you were a founding
member of what

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.600
went on to become one
of the largest hate

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.280
groups in the country.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.090
Tell us about your experience
in Milwaukee, growing up,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.141
and that led to being involved
in an organization like that.

00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.390
ARNO MICHAELIS: What's
interesting about my experience

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.670
is that on paper,
I would have been

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.170
like the last kid
you would think

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.310
that would go that direction.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.580
When I was researching
for my first book,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.220
I was talking to a lot of people
who were in the gang with me

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.820
and who had also gotten
out, and in the process

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.980
of doing that, I was asking
about their childhoods,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.170
asking about things that
they'd been through.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.980
And just about all of them
had horrific childhoods.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.630
There was missing parents.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.980
There was physical abuse.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.530
There was poverty.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.620
In my case, I grew up in a nice
house, in a nice neighborhood,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.480
never went hungry,
never took a beating.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.620
My parents were together.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.810
They both loved me very much.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.920
They let me know
that all the time.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590
In fact, all the
adults in my life

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.760
were just showering me with
affirmation and positivity.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.860
But I grew up in an
alcoholic household,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.540
and my parents fought a lot.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.190
And my mom was
always stressed out,

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.650
trying to keep things running.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.630
And my mom's misery
was very plain to me.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.829
And instead of being a
good kid, and being like,

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.370
hey, mom, I love
you, how can I help,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.730
I would be distancing myself
from her, distancing myself

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.820
from my dad, from all these
adults who were supporting me,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.950
which of course,
made me suffer more

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.540
and led me to start lashing out
at other kids which I quickly

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.560
got a habit for.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.410
I got a habit for
people being afraid

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.100
of me, a habit for the thrill
of teachers freaking out,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.240
of causing havoc in
otherwise orderly places.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.320
And like any kind of substance
abuse, what gets you high

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.870
the first time is old
hat 10 times later.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.700
You got to keep escalating it.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.550
So my anti-social
behavior escalated

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.160
from being a bully
on the school bus

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.170
to fights in the school yard
to breaking and entering,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.560
burglary, vandalism,
fighting in the street.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.200
I started drinking
myself when I was 14.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.750
The first time I drank, I
drank until I passed out,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.240
and I drank like that
for another 20 years.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.450
By the time I'm 16, I'm
a full-blown alcoholic.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.790
I am very conditioned
to violence.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.650
It's like second nature to me.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.380
And hate is just another
part of the thrill,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.850
like just, oh, I
hate the school.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:36.590
I hate the cops.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.235
I hate society.

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:38.400
I hate the government.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.910
Like it was just
part of the habit

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.520
that I was really addicted to.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.700
And so that's who I was when
I heard white power skinhead

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.910
music that was really fast
and aggressive, which I loved.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.900
I was in a punk before that,
and I loved the hardcore fast

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.120
break stuff kind of punk.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.100
And this was the
same kind of music,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.540
but the lyrics were about race
and nation and blood and soil,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.500
all these very seductive
and romantic themes,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.930
and the same themes, really,
that Adolf Hitler used

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.770
to twist the mind of so
many millions of Germans

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.120
in World War II.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.790
Plus, it really
pissed people off.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.550
Nothing pisses people
off like a swastika.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.610
And I was just really in the
business of pissing people off.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.170
That's all I wanted to do.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.170
So my initial involvement in
these white power skinhead

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.500
hate groups was to get
a rise out of people.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.370
It was to repulse civil society
and to provoke hostility,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.600
to provoke fights.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.916
So that's what got me into it.

00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:41.040
Me and a couple of friends
started this white power

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.740
skinhead gang in Milwaukee.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.140
I was already in
punk bands and pretty

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.690
acclimated to screaming loud
and getting people crazy.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.360
So we started our
own skinhead band,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.460
and we were like a
magnet for pissed

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.670
off white kids that just
came from every direction

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.980
to be part of what
we were doing.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.150
And as we radiated
hostility into the world,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.970
the world reflected it
back to us, and oftentimes

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.260
in multiples.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.269
And within a few
months, my best friend,

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.060
who I'd started the
gang and the band with,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.970
went to prison for shooting
a kid who came into a drive

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.140
by our house.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.214
Within a couple of years,
another very good friend

00:04:18.214 --> 00:04:20.089
of mine was shot and
killed in a street fight

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:22.370
as he was out practicing
hate and violence,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.710
as I had taught him to do.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.380
And rather than see these
bad things happening

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.130
as wake-up calls, we
saw them as validation

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.080
of our paranoid narrative.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.040
So rather than wake up
and come to my senses

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.549
when my friend got murdered,
it wasn't his fault

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:42.090
that he was out marching around
with a swastika on his jacket

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.600
and picking fights with people
that led to the shooting that

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.560
killed him.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.320
It was the Jews'
fault for bringing

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.070
all these black and
brown people here.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.940
And so that whole
way of thinking

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.630
is this constant
process of spinning

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.960
whatever's happening in the
world to suit your narrative.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.937
And it took a ton of
energy and really added

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:05.395
to this growing
sense of exhaustion

00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:07.000
that eventually led me out.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.450
SPEAKER 1: And Pardeep, you
had a different upbringing

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.160
in Milwaukee.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.060
So talk about your
time and really--

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.430
I know you were a police
officer for a while-- to where

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.100
you are today, but really
the growing up in Milwaukee

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.080
and what it was like
for you and your family.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.930
PARDEEP KALEKA: Yeah,
for us in our family,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.450
I came to the states
when I was six years old.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.530
And I had sort of a typical--

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.170
and now, I want to
use the word typical

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.290
right now because I think the
time and space that we exist

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.320
in right now calls for a
unity of just immigration

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.840
and immigration patterns,
demographic change.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.600
And so I grew up as
your typical immigrant.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.430
I came here when I was six, not
a lot of money in our pockets.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.280
My dad had $10 in his pocket--

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.880
maybe $35 in his pocket--

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.280
probably a little bit more,
but just scratching, clawing.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.720
We moved to
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.490
At that time, in the 1980s,
Milwaukee was a thriving city.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.980
Soon as we got
here, there were be

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.322
this sort of job exodus,
employment exodus

00:06:12.322 --> 00:06:13.780
in the city of
Milwaukee that would

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:23.046
lead to kind of an illegal
economy, and just an economy--

00:06:23.046 --> 00:06:24.170
there goes the crime rates.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.110
There goes drug raids.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.740
There goes these
shootings, homicides.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:37.240
And before long, we were
caught in the hairs of trying

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.510
to find a safe place to live.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.122
I remember my parents
moving around quite a bit.

00:06:43.122 --> 00:06:44.830
We moved from the
north side of Milwaukee

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.620
to the east side of Milwaukee,
east side of Milwaukee

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.800
to the south side,
west side, and really

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.140
just going on this
whole journey of trying

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:59.080
to find a safe place
to raise their kids.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.740
As I grew up, I
grew up and there

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.920
wasn't a lot of Punjabi people
at that time in the '80s,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.970
especially not in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.140
I think there was about
four or five families,

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.940
and that, not having
somebody or some people

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.130
to call your own led
to this feeling of,

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.250
I wasn't enough, led
to this feeling of,

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.870
I'm not black
enough to be black.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.210
I'm not Latino
enough to be Latino.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.040
I'm not white
enough to be white.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.740
I'm not American enough
to call myself American.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.410
And in a weird kind of way,
I wasn't even Indian enough

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.140
to call myself Indian.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.790
I can, as a 42-year-old grown up
man, can see the beauty in that

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:47.140
now because all of that led to
me being able to embrace myself

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.280
and me.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.620
But at that time,
growing up, it really

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.695
led to a sense of, who am I?

00:07:52.695 --> 00:07:53.740
What am I?

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.520
What do I represent?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.840
And that led to me
saying, OK, you know what?

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.620
I want to do something
with my life that's

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.210
going to mean something to
the country that gave me hope.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.050
And I dreamt about
being a police officer.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.800
I became the first
one in our family

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.590
to graduate from college, became
a police officer in Milwaukee,

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:23.230
and just really
noticing some of the--

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.550
and as I was growing
up, I thought the world

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.210
to be black and white, right?

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.700
We think in simple terms of,
I can give back to the society

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:36.309
if I can keep good people
safe from bad folks.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.669
But we know the realities of
policing are not that simple.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.690
There's a lot of gray,
and over time, that gray

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:46.130
became too much to stomach.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.110
And so I became a
educator working

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.900
with at-risk high school
youth in the same neighborhood

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.400
that I was policing.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.530
The neighborhood
that I was policing

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.850
has a documentary about it.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.920
It's called 53206.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.410
It is one of the most violent
neighborhoods in Milwaukee.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.250
So the entirety of
my policing career

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.760
was getting dope, getting
guns, getting arrests,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.680
and yet, throughout
that entire five years,

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.610
I never wrote one parking
ticket or one speeding ticket.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.070
It was just really just
running and gunning.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.120
And seeing that from that
sense of a police officer,

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.830
and then working
as a teacher, you

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.560
see a different
level of intimacy.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.890
Now you're working
with youth, attempting

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.700
to try to work with them
before they get into this life.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.990
And you get to know parents and
you get to know grandparents.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.402
And you have to develop
relationships, probably

00:09:42.402 --> 00:09:44.610
something that I should have
done as a police officer

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.050
anyways.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.570
But we didn't live
in that culture

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.190
of getting to know the
neighborhood you were policing

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.750
in.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.180
It was really just running,
gunning, arresting,

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.050
and that was that.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:59.520
And that was my life
before August 5th.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.770
SPEAKER 1: Well, that's
exactly what I want to get to.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.970
I think part of
what connects you,

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.428
and we'll get to
your first meeting

00:10:04.428 --> 00:10:06.270
and how you guys
became friends, but I

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:10.632
think August 5, 2012,
is the significant day.

00:10:10.632 --> 00:10:12.090
Do you mind sharing
your experience

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.730
on that day, what happened,
for everyone that doesn't know,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.949
and what was going
through your mind?

00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:18.990
And then, Arno, I'll ask
the same question to you

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.100
after, too.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.630
PARDEEP KALEKA: Sure, sure.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.740
So yeah, August 5th, and when
I think back to the August 5th,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.220
I mean, it's August right now.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.000
And we think about how
warm it is and I just

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.490
think about how nice
it was at that time

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:37.470
to live in this world of
being oblivious, I would say,

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.664
and taking things for granted.

00:10:39.664 --> 00:10:40.830
At that time, I was married.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.030
I had two kids.

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.290
It was summer, summer
vacation for us.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.180
Career was going great.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.770
We bought a house.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.120
My wife was working.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.220
And I thought that
everything was just--

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.200
we had achieved pretty
much the American dream.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.440
My dad at that time
was 65 years old.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.110
He basically collected one
month of social security,

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.860
and he was kind of
joking around about it.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.700
He was like, wow,
like when you turn

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:08.530
a certain age in this
country, they give you money

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:10.870
and they give you insurance
and things like that.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.090
So he was just really
celebrating it.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:17.130
And we, at that time, were
really like, we've achieved.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.360
We've made it.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.850
The entire family
has made it, right,

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.980
from having a
little bit of money

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.090
and being immigrants to saying,
OK, now both my sons have

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.540
graduated school.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.580
I'm collecting social security.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.270
My dad had made it with
the small businesses,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.890
and we were in the
summer of that.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:41.010
And then, this is when,
on that August morning,

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:48.580
a person who was part of the
gang that Arno helped start

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:52.870
told us, in not so much
words, but with gunshots,

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:57.020
that we weren't entitled
to that American dream,

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:02.170
that that dream was not really
meant for people like us.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:08.980
And he, that morning, took
the lives of six people.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.270
One of those people was my
father and temple president,

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:17.190
Satwant Singh
Kaleka, and I mean,

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:22.540
it was only the fortunate
circumstances of my daughter

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:24.580
forgetting something
at the house that

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.660
made us turn around and
be 10 minutes late getting

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.650
to the gurdwara, which
we call the Sikh temple.

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.580
And so even in the
moment when I found out

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.370
that there was a shooting at the
temple, and what had happened,

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:43.860
there was mixed
feelings that I had

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.700
because once the police officer
told me what's going on,

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.770
I knew that both my parents
were inside the temple.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.720
And I asked him, I said,
when did this happen?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.750
And he says, 10
minutes ago it started.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.880
The scene is not secure.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.480
And at that time, all
these different emotions

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.670
start to come over you.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.630
And for those that
have experienced trauma

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.490
in their life or
pain in their life

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.930
can maybe resonate
with this and say,

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.060
OK, there's a feeling of relief.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.120
There's a feeling of
relief, believe it or not,

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.650
of like, OK, I'm not dead.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.890
I'm not inside there, and my
children are not inside there.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.060
There's a feeling of guilt,
the guilt being around,

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.580
maybe I didn't do enough when
I could have done enough.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.110
Maybe I just took
things for granted.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.790
And I settled into this
domesticated life of,

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.970
I have mine, so you know what?

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.860
I don't got to worry about them.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.690
And all these other
different emotions

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.750
are happening at the same
time, anger, frustration,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.850
helplessness, the what ifs
that haunt you, the what

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.180
ifs of like, would
the police have--

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.610
and that day, there's so much
that we were not privy to,

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:05.400
we were not given, and
say, OK, you know what?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.980
We were finding out
in real time what

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.580
was happening with
our loved ones,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.450
and not through law enforcement.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:12.120
We were finding out
through Twitter.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.820
We were finding out through
social media what is going on

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.480
with our loved ones.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.470
And the question that kept
coming up to me was like,

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:25.500
would they do this if
this demographic was not

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.880
a small demographic to America?

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:31.530
What if this demographic had a
little bit more political power

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.990
than our demographic?

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:39.270
Would the police have gone in
quicker if there was different

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:44.870
folks, if it was a church
rather than a temple?

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.350
And that really eats at you.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.820
And I think like, that's been
the part, for me and Arno,

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.880
that's been our inspiration,
that's to say, you know what?

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.190
Forgiveness is going to
look a lot like vengeance.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.320
And we're going to
be vengeful and say

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.360
that nobody is
going to ever have

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.484
to have this feeling of not
being worth enough to save.

00:15:09.484 --> 00:15:11.900
SPEAKER 1: And Arno, so what
was your experience like when

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.049
you heard that a group
that you helped found

00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:15.590
was basically claiming
responsibility

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.800
for such a horrific act?

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.864
ARNO MICHAELIS: I'll never
forget Sunday, August 5, 2012.

00:15:21.864 --> 00:15:23.780
In addition to being a
former white supremist,

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.120
I'm a former IT consultant.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.570
I don't like to talk about
that as it's too dramatic,

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:35.420
but I was actually doing IT work
for a client down in Illinois.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.120
I'd work on weekends
when I could

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.130
because the end users aren't
in my way and vise versa.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.380
And of course, while
servers are rebooting

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.910
and progress bars are
growing, I'm just--

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.210
I'm probably the only IT
guy that ever did this,

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:50.810
but I'd be like dicking around
on social media and whatnot.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.611
And I remember a Twitter feed,
just the hashtag Sikh temple

00:15:54.611 --> 00:15:55.110
shooting.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.550
And it's just pouring
down my screen.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:03.230
And it's saying multiple gunmen.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:05.360
Nobody knows how
many are dead yet.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.090
Sikh temple in Wisconsin.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:14.150
And like so many people before
August 5th, so many Americans,

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:17.705
I had no idea who Sikhs were.

00:16:17.705 --> 00:16:20.330
Like, oh, those are the guys who
drive the taxis with the thing

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.120
on the back with the sword.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.190
I didn't know anything
about what Sikh was about,

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:29.630
but I did know that
because of who Sikhs were,

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.080
because they were so
visibly different than even

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.150
other people of
color in the states,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:39.080
I just had this
sinking feeling that I

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.510
had something to do with
this, that my old ideology had

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:45.680
something to do with this.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.830
There was white supremacy
involved in one way or another

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.420
and very possibly directly
motivating the shooter.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.580
So from my client's
office, and by the way,

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.079
this client is
still a good friend

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:02.120
and aware that I was doing
this on billable time,

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:08.310
but I recorded a video
response to the shooting,

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.599
and really, just first of
all, said how devastated.

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:18.050
I was to imagine people who
have lost their fathers,

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.920
three boys lost their mom.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.050
Like there's a grandpa
there who was killed,

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:27.480
and really feeling
that kind of suffering.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.240
I wanted to convey
that in the video,

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.200
how dedicated I was to bearing
witness to the suffering

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.960
and also to burying as
much of it as I could.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.760
And then, I went on about how,
when things like this happen,

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.330
we really have to let
compassion be our vengeance.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.930
We have to let
what's most beautiful

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.440
about our human experience
come to the rescue

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.560
of this situation.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.030
And I went on a bit
about how we really

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.130
got to see ourselves
in each other,

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.430
no matter what, if we're
Democrats and Republicans,

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.550
or if we're black and white,
or we're rich and poor,

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.180
like whatever.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.030
We still got to see that
we're all human beings first

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:09.710
and foremost.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:14.540
And then, I went home and just
glued myself to the media,

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.326
and by the end of
the night, it was

00:18:17.326 --> 00:18:19.325
revealed that the shooter
was a white supremist,

00:18:19.325 --> 00:18:21.230
an affiliated white supremist.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.920
They didn't say his
name, so that night I

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.740
lay awake all night wondering
if this was somebody

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.510
that I had recruited into
that narrative who had just

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:36.020
murdered six people, or if
it was someone who I knew.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.660
The next morning, the
guy's name was announced.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.730
His name was Wade Michael Page.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.426
They announced his background.

00:18:42.426 --> 00:18:45.410
He was from Colorado
originally, then

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.130
North Carolina, and
only recently Milwaukee.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.900
Even though so much of my time
back in the hate group days

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:55.270
was literally
hazed by alcohol, I

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.100
might have met
this guy in person.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.850
They later revealed that he got
radicalized while in the United

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.120
States Army, and came
out of the Army in 1998

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.490
a full-blown white
power skinhead.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.860
I was able to rule
that out also,

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.170
that I didn't know
this guy personally.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:17.420
But it didn't really change the
urgency that I felt to respond

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.310
and the responsibility
that I felt

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:24.290
to help transform this
atrocity into something that

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.420
would actively counter hate and
violence from that day forward.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.170
SPEAKER 1: So now, you too
are very good friends now.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.940
But I would love to hear how you
decided to meet the first time.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.680
What were the
expectations going in,

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.712
and what was it like
meeting the first time,

00:19:39.712 --> 00:19:41.670
coming from such different
backgrounds and such

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.420
a unique connection
between the two of you?

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.300
PARDEEP KALEKA: Yeah.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:50.220
So after the shooting happened--

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.900
my dad was temple
president and he

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.190
was president for 15 years,
which is a long time according

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.290
to Sikh Indian politics.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:02.540
The president of any church,
synagogue, mosque, like Google

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.510
aura, right?

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.540
So I mean, his
dream was basically

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.920
to make a sanctuary where
people, Sikhs, could come to.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.800
And within that time, he did.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.810
He fulfilled what
he needed to do.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.260
And he died in the place
that he helped build.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.510
No bigger martyrdom.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:22.500
We call it sahidi.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.130
Some people call it kabani,
but no bigger sacrifice

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.407
than a person
could do than that.

00:20:28.407 --> 00:20:30.573
And in fact, I had a lot
of people who came up to me

00:20:30.573 --> 00:20:33.130
and were like, don't feel bad.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.530
Don't feel sad.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.940
Just, your dad did
what he needed to do.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:42.000
And no better death than to
die that death of a martyr.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.760
With that said, that puts
a lot of pressure on you

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.380
as the oldest son, and
puts a lot of pressure

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.350
on what you need to do.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.450
So my personal grief,
my personal healing,

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.310
could not actually start.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.420
I had to figure out
logistics for other families

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.490
who had lost their loved ones.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.190
Most of these families
did not understand

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.666
the culture of America.

00:21:09.666 --> 00:21:11.040
So I was old enough
to understand

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:15.930
the culture of America, how do
we do funeral proceedings, who

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.960
pays for what, the
logistics of everything.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.240
How do we raise funds?

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.000
This thing that I felt,
I felt in my mind,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.610
was just to dive into work.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.680
With that said, we basically put
on a brave face for the world,

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.760
right?

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.270
But at the same time, I
think I was faking it.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:37.650
I think I wasn't truly--

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.060
I was still bitter.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.450
I was still upset.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.340
I was still gritting my teeth
at every interview where they

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.110
would talk about forgiveness.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.170
And I'd be like, oh, fah.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:50.880
Yes.

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.420
Let me talk about this.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.250
And that was my honest truth.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:58.320
I did a thing for law
enforcement one time

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.360
and I could barely
get through the talk

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.790
because I was so bitter.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:09.130
And when we were doing this,
we were approached by every--

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.050
you name it-- gun
rights to education

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:15.720
to everything,
immigration, xenophobia.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.990
And my inspiration
to reach out to Arno

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:23.310
was to figure out, OK, why
did this person do this?

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.770
We weren't getting answers.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.360
So the best person
that can explain it

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.060
is a person that has
lived that lifestyle

00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:34.170
and had started that same
organization to find out

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:37.350
why somebody would do
something like this.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.300
And I didn't know
it at that time,

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:42.000
but that would lead me to
my own personal feeling.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.240
Arno's not only my
friend and my brother.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.171
Arno is my counselor,
my therapist, and that's

00:22:51.171 --> 00:22:52.420
a lot coming from a therapist.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.145
ARNO MICHAELIS: I'm a therapist.

00:22:56.145 --> 00:22:58.510
PARDEEP KALEKA: And
I think we talk.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.620
We talk every week and
we talk about things that

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.720
are unrelated to August 5th.

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.010
We're genuinely friends.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:07.540
We're genuinely brothers.

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.560
This man comes over to my house,
babysits the kids, takes them,

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.530
and all of that
to say, you really

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.050
need to challenge-- we need
to challenge ourselves.

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.570
And not to say that I'm not
putting any blame on the Wage

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.350
Pages of the world.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:25.390
But if I put all the
blame and all the emphasis

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.450
on the Wade Pages, the
white supremacists,

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:31.000
the other people in
the world, then I

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.550
continue to take my
life for granted.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.800
And I think the biggest part
of forgiveness is to say,

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.780
you know what?

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.780
Honestly, if this wouldn't have
happened, you would've went on

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.770
and you would have
lived your life,

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.410
and you wouldn't
have appreciated

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.920
every single conversation
as much as you do now,

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.710
every single relationship
that you do now.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.930
You probably wouldn't
tuck your kids in at night

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.700
and hang around their
bed for an hour,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.150
and just sit there and watch
them sleep because you would

00:23:57.150 --> 00:23:58.390
have took that for granted.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.450
You probably wouldn't
have made love--

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:07.020
oh, sorry-- made love with
a sense of appreciation.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.710
It's OK.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.430
We all know we do it.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.380
But in a way, I think the
forgiveness was really

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:20.680
just like, OK, I need to take
control of my own personal life

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:25.240
and our relationship
definitely helped that.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.220
SPEAKER 1: So when
was the first meeting?

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.600
Talk us through sitting
down the first time.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:35.530
So the first meeting,
well, the first time

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:40.210
we talked, we were both
working for a global think tank

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.250
called Against
Violent Extremism.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.701
And I reached out--

00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:45.700
ARNO MICHAELIS: Founded
in part by Google Ideas,

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.500
which was kind of exciting.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.130
Thank you.

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:49.680
PARDEEP KALEKA: Yeah,
Google put us together.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.010
ARNO MICHAELIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.230
PARDEEP KALEKA: That was
our Tinder back then.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.230
Sorry.

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:57.480
I don't even want to get--

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.020
So the first time
we reached out,

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.730
we connected the same way that
everybody connects these days,

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:04.720
digitally.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.210
And then we texted.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.660
We talked.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.590
And just being
able to talk to him

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.200
was uplifting because I
was getting to a point

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.330
where reality was hitting.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.130
It was about two months
after the shooting.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.360
Reality was really
starting to set in.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.464
Dad's not coming home.

00:25:22.464 --> 00:25:23.880
And these children
are never going

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.990
to see their grandfather again.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.930
He had two grandkids
at the time.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:29.370
They would ask about him.

00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.160
And how do you explain this?

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.840
It's tough to explain.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.075
So my mom was a widow.

00:25:36.075 --> 00:25:39.720
It's like we're figuring out all
this stuff, but it's like, OK,

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.200
after the inspiration of
cameras and things being there,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.567
and you getting to put on--

00:25:44.567 --> 00:25:46.650
and it is a privilege to
be able to put on a brave

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:48.900
face for the world, right?

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.130
There's a sense of purpose to
that, but then, reality hits.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.970
And you go back home
and the loneliness--

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.651
first thing you think
about is the shooting.

00:25:59.651 --> 00:26:01.650
First thing you think
about when you go to sleep

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.350
or when you wake up in the
morning is what just happened.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:05.505
Did I just dream this?

00:26:05.505 --> 00:26:08.000
Did this really
just happen to us?

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.180
And really, the world happening
to you is a victimizing place.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.170
Just think that the world
can just happen to you

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:21.410
and not happen for you,
is a sense of, oh, my god.

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.610
Like what can I do about this?

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.400
So reaching out to Arno
and hearing his voice,

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.450
and just the first
time talking, we

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:33.780
decided to sit down and
then really just conversate,

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.270
face to face.

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.900
When we decided to
do that, I was still

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:44.730
gauging, from my experience with
him over the phone or via text,

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.520
whether he was still
a white supremacist,

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.810
whether a person could
really go from being

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:55.440
a white supremacist to
not having that ideology,

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.110
or whether it was just
so ingrained within us

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.560
that somebody could not
separate themselves from that.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.290
So I'm still gauging
this, and I'm asking him,

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:07.230
like, where do you
want to go out to eat?

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.730
And I swear, if you
would have said,

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.820
I want to go get beer
and brats, or like I

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.820
want to go to a tavern--

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.361
because Milwaukee's
full of taverns--

00:27:14.361 --> 00:27:16.550
ARNO MICHAELIS: For sauerkraut
and wienerschnitzel.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.550
PARDEEP KALEKA: --if you
were to talk like that,

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.536
I would have been like, bro,
I got to like watch the kids.

00:27:21.536 --> 00:27:24.470
I would have put the
whole kid excuse on.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.930
But he says, I like Thai food.

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:29.360
You like Thai food?

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.800
And I was like, yeah,
yeah, I can do Thai food.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.594
Cool.

00:27:32.594 --> 00:27:34.260
And in the back of
my mind, I was really

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.690
thinking, man, he
must have changed

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.710
because white people can
barely handle spicy food,

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.540
let alone white supremacists.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.497
I know they can't
handle spicy food.

00:27:44.497 --> 00:27:45.580
ARNO MICHAELIS: It's true.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.850
PARDEEP KALEKA: So that
helped ease my- like,

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.170
OK, well, we're
going to do this.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.045
But as the weeks
started to move along

00:27:52.045 --> 00:27:54.390
and we started to get
towards that date of meeting,

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:58.020
I started to tell my wife and
my mother and other family

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:03.050
members, and they would be
like, you lost your mind.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.740
Something's going on with you.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:05.830
Don't do this.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.580
These people can't change.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.826
And change is the most
inevitable thing in life.

00:28:12.826 --> 00:28:13.950
Things are going to change.

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.480
We have to navigate that change.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.630
That's how you all stay relevant
in the work that you do.

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:21.780
So we all stay relevant.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.550
But with that said,
a lot of people

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:27.270
think that change can't
happen for certain people.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.170
And I was just like, we have
a faith here who believes--

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:35.520
Sikhi actually is based in
the principle of oneness,

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.310
and that change
will happen, right,

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.400
but they're telling me, no, this
person hasn't changed and can't

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.450
change.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.360
And as much as I didn't
want to believe it,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.556
it starts to seep at your soul.

00:28:46.556 --> 00:28:47.930
And so it starts
to seep and say,

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.020
well, maybe they might be right.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.100
Maybe something is
going on with me.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.870
I might be a little crazy
because I do hang around

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.320
and hug the kids
longer than I should.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.780
Like people don't
normally do this.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.589
They don't just hang out with
their kids and just like,

00:29:03.589 --> 00:29:04.380
I want to hold you.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.670
I want to love you, right?

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.770
So I started to think, maybe
this person hasn't changed.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.650
And through all that--

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.600
me and Arno say it all time--

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.910
through all your
fears, be courageous.

00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:20.310
Just keep testing it.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.460
Be courageous.

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.230
Be courageous.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.390
The thing that you
sometimes don't want to do

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.250
is what you should be doing.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.500
Try to say yes more
than you say no.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.840
Obviously there are things
that you want to say no to,

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.710
but be courageous.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.330
And so just keep going in
that sort of intention,

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:38.640
that spirit of
being courageous, we

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:42.980
find ourselves at this
restaurant together.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.210
And the first time
that I saw him,

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.580
I was like, what am I going
to say to this person?

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.970
What do I really want to know?

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.590
What am I going to ask?

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.620
I get all this other
stuff is going on,

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.360
but now, we're face
to face, and what am I

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.820
really going to ask him?

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.990
And to my surprise, he was
kind of thinking the same way.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:08.830
He was like, what do I
say to this person who

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.720
just lost their father?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.900
I'm sorry?

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.650
I'm sorry would seem kind
of hollow at this point of I

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.930
helped to start this
organization that this guy

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.450
belonged to, and now
I'm sitting here,

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:25.380
and I'm facing the consequences
of actions that I thought that

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:30.330
I put way back there, but
knowing that I really can't.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.280
Like stuff that we
have done in the past,

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.200
we still have to
be accountable for.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:39.350
Forgiveness doesn't mean
that we just move on

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.350
and go forward with our life
without ever going back there

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.000
and saying, you know what?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.870
There's some wounds.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:45.930
There's some stuff back there.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:46.429
Right?

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.970
Sometimes people say, well,
you know time heals all wounds.

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.630
That's the biggest crock
of shit I've ever heard.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:59.330
Who made that saying?

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.010
Time does not heal all wounds.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.460
In fact, sometimes, time
makes them worse, especially

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.860
in an infected wound.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:08.660
Yes, we will go
on with our life,

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.100
and if we got something
wrong, we can pad around that,

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.520
and we can maneuver
our life around that.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.470
But if you're still moving
your life around that,

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.120
this is still the focus.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.020
That wound is still the focus.

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.670
Yeah, you've gone on, but
you haven't removed it.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.340
And that's the thing.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.220
Wounds do not heal with time.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:35.440
They heal with time,
they heal with purpose,

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.810
they heal with
forgiveness, they heal

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.790
with a sense of consciousness.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:47.780
They heal with honoring pain,
and the first time that we met,

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.170
that's who I met.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.930
I met a person who said, listen,
we're going to honor this pain.

00:31:54.930 --> 00:32:00.520
We're going to be conscious
about what this pain is from.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.950
We're going to take
control of our lives.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.980
And that's how healing
wounds really happens.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.280
It's not just about time.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.480
It's about consciousness.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.680
It's about forgiveness.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.314
It's about purpose.

00:32:14.314 --> 00:32:16.480
ARNO MICHAELIS: And it was
actually a physical wound

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.630
that Pardeep incurred about
a week before that actually

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:21.550
was our icebreaker.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:25.110
So like Par said, I was
freaked out going to meet him.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.610
I was really honored
for the ability

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:30.100
to just offer myself
in service to Pardeep,

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.690
and to his community,
and to his family.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:35.440
I was excited about that, but at
the same time, I'm intimidated.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.262
Like where do I even begin?

00:32:37.262 --> 00:32:39.720
And just like Par said, like,
what do you even-- like, hey,

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.020
I'm Arno.

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:43.180
Sorry about your dad.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.400
Nothing I could have
thought of seemed right,

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.719
and I'm rarely at
a loss for words,

00:32:47.719 --> 00:32:48.760
as you may have gathered.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.100
But at the time, I
didn't know what to say.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.020
I get in there early.

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.730
I get to the restaurant, and
this restaurant is like my jam.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:58.980
I'm known to eat here
like five days a week.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.920
I'm a curry fiend.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.250
I no longer drink, so I
get a buzz through chili.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.320
Like that's how I get messed up.

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.140
And this is some of
the spiciest food

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.710
I've had on the planet Earth.

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:11.850
And I love it that way.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.730
And I know the owners.

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:15.530
I know the chefs
and all the servers.

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:17.330
They're all friends of mine.

00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:21.470
And where I look back
to my past and a lot

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:25.220
of my hate and my violence
came from like a fear

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.690
of my vulnerabilities, since
I started meditating in 2009

00:33:29.690 --> 00:33:32.690
and really studied
how my mind works

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.910
and how human
emotion works, I've

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:37.580
really just become very open
in my vulnerabilities, which

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:41.660
means I go to pieces
at the drop of a hat.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.690
After the Sikh temple
shooting, I was doing media

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:49.760
for like eight to 10 hours
a day, and it was at a point

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.160
where I was transitioning
from the IT career

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.140
to a career as a
speaker and an author.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.470
Things were really rough
for me, financially.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:01.310
And all of a sudden, the eyes
of the entire world are upon me.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:05.320
I'm doing CNN, MSNBC,
New York Times, LA Times,

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.110
Norwegian newspapers, Australian
radio, everything in between.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.219
And I'm grateful I
had this opportunity

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:15.469
to bring a message of
compassion and an opportunity

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:20.210
to expose the toxicity of the
white supremist narrative,

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:21.810
and say all this stuff.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.659
But at the same
time, the part of me

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.630
that hates myself, the part
of me that will never forgive

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:30.510
myself for what I've done
and who I've hurt, is saying,

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:33.179
yeah, Arno, go sell some books.

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:35.889
Go get some speaking gigs.

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:38.040
And it sucked.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.730
By the end, Thursday
of that week,

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.179
I had a nervous breakdown.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.030
I just lost it for hours.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.810
I'm just sobbing.

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:47.739
And all I wanted to do was
go back to bones and servers

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.900
if it would bring
those six people back.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.920
But that's obviously
not going to happen.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.710
It's impossible.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.520
And so I just had to cope.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:57.700
And the following
Sunday, exactly

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.170
one week after the
shooting, I was

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.020
invited to come
speak at a vigil,

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:03.880
and I did a really
quick three-minute bit.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.040
And a guy from
the Sikh coalition

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:11.080
came up to me, Jasmit
Singh, and he thanked me.

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.330
Like hey, man, I saw
you on media all week.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:15.080
I saw you-- this
talk was amazing.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.360
Thank you for your voice.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.950
It means the world to us.

00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:21.190
And I was just
floored that I could

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.700
be part of his healing process.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:24.830
And then again, I'm
starting to get teary eyed,

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.160
and I go to pieces.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:31.370
And I'm just like, I wish
there was more Sikhs here.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.050
I hope more Sikhs
come to the country.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.890
I was just so in awe
of the Sikh community,

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:39.280
and really, just, I wanted
more Sikhs everywhere.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.170
Like our society, we
got to Sikh it up.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.410
That's what we need.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.520
And as I'm telling him
this, I'm like bawling.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.670
I'm gushing tears.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:50.176
I got snot flying everywhere.

00:35:50.176 --> 00:35:51.550
And dude's got
this really-- he's

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:53.620
got this beautiful
tied silk turban on,

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.840
and he's got this beautiful
really expensive looking

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.560
silk suit.

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.567
And he comes and gives me a hug.

00:35:58.567 --> 00:36:00.650
And I'm like, dude, I'm
getting snot on your suit.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:01.350
I'm really sorry.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.130
And he was like, naw, dude.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:03.213
Don't worry about it, man.

00:36:03.213 --> 00:36:04.380
It's cool.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:05.140
It was all good.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.560
And that was so uplifting to me.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.360
And again, I'm like, OK, this
dude's community was assaulted.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.570
He's comforting me.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.982
Like what does that
tell you, especially

00:36:17.982 --> 00:36:19.440
coming from this
narrative, saying,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.070
oh, well, white
people are superior.

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:23.640
We're the superior
race, blah blah blah.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.120
Who's superior in
that interaction?

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.230
Jasmit is far and away
the superior human being.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.502
So going forward from there, I
kind of I got my shit together,

00:36:34.502 --> 00:36:36.210
but going to meet
Pardeep, all this stuff

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:37.890
was coming back again.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:41.472
And I was really
intimidated to meet him.

00:36:41.472 --> 00:36:42.180
So I go in there.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.230
I get in there early.

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:48.660
I'm talking to my friends,
King and Mary, the servers,

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.840
and Par comes in, and he
sees me talking to them.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.150
King and Mary are Asian.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:55.210
Go figure, at a Thai restaurant.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:58.286
Par's like, oh, he's talking
to some Asians, so that's good.

00:36:58.286 --> 00:36:59.160
PARDEEP KALEKA: Yeah.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.410
ARNO MICHAELIS: It looks
like they're genuine friends.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.830
So that's a good sign.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:03.930
PARDEEP KALEKA: He hasn't
beaten them up yet.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.971
ARNO MICHAELIS: Yeah, he
hasn't attacked anybody.

00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:08.590
And so as he walks in,
he's got this piece of tape

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.750
above his eye.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.090
And I'm like, I'm
still into rough stuff.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:13.900
I love all the MMA
and things like that.

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.900
I'm too fragile
to do it anymore,

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.300
but the first thing
I thought, seeing Par

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.410
with this tape above his
eye, he looks like a fighter.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.347
And Par's pretty built.
He's got that fighter build.

00:37:24.347 --> 00:37:26.430
And he comes walking in,
and rather than say, hey,

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.537
I'm Arno, sorry about your
dad, I was like, dude,

00:37:29.537 --> 00:37:30.620
what happened to your eye?

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.970
Did you get in a
brawl or something?

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:38.030
Par goes on to tell me
that a week earlier, he's

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.720
bathing his son and daughter,
and his wife's at work.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.740
His daughter is 7.

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.450
His son was 4.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.270
And his daughter is
getting to the stage,

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.270
as a little kid, of being
self-conscious about being

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:51.230
naked.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.210
So she's like, dad,
when I'm taking a bath,

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:54.970
don't look at me.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.560
And Par's like, he wants
to oblige his daughter,

00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.540
but he also needs
to get everywhere

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.750
or his wife's going
to let him have it

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.320
if he's not scrubbing
her down right.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.782
So he's scrubbing
while looking away,

00:38:05.782 --> 00:38:08.240
but he's got to peek and make
sure he's getting everywhere,

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:09.920
and then peek away.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.314
Scrub, scrub, peek, peek away.

00:38:13.314 --> 00:38:15.480
In the corner of the bathtub,
he's going one of them

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.442
shower organizers.

00:38:16.442 --> 00:38:18.080
It's like spring loaded.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.240
It goes between the bathroom
corner of the ceiling

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.740
and you got little
shelves where you

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.480
put your shampoos and whatnot.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:26.900
And hanging off these shelves
are these little loofa hooks.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.990
And Par's wife, Priti, is like,
Par, you got to get rid of them

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.491
hooks.

00:38:30.491 --> 00:38:32.365
Somebody's going to lose
an eye or something.

00:38:32.365 --> 00:38:33.770
This is really dangerous.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:36.320
And Par, like many husbands,
was like, yeah, oh, sure.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.442
I'll get to it, only
he never gets to it.

00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:41.900
So as he's scrubbing and peeking
and scrubbing and peeking,

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.440
he looks away and the hook
goes right into his eye,

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.960
like a hot knife
through butter, just

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.490
like through the
white of his eye

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:51.810
and then out above his
eyebrow, like a fishhook.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.340
Just whoomp!

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:57.883
And so Par's got his face
attached to this contraption

00:38:57.883 --> 00:39:00.610
and he pulls the
springs to get it out.

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.430
He comes up like this
and he's holding it.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:05.350
What the hell am I going to do?

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:08.070
And his daughter, Amaris, there
was freaking out and screaming.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.408
And she grabs it and
starts yanking on it.

00:39:10.408 --> 00:39:11.424
Fortunately--

00:39:11.424 --> 00:39:13.340
PARDEEP KALEKA: I could
hear my eye throbbing.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:17.561
I was like, the eyeball's
going to come out, baby girl.

00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:20.060
ARNO MICHAELIS: Fortunately,
Pardeep's an ex-police officer.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.530
He's very cool under pressure.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:25.050
So Amaris is hauling
on this hook.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:27.730
Pardeep's like, baby girl.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.352
You got to let go of the hook.

00:39:30.352 --> 00:39:32.699
And so she lets
go and he gets up.

00:39:32.699 --> 00:39:34.240
He goes to the mirror
and he takes it

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.240
out the way it comes in.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.580
Blood goes flying everywhere.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.560
He says, OK, kids, get dressed.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.960
We're going to urgent care.

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.460
There's an urgent care
a couple blocks away.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.020
He puts a towel over his eye.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.320
He's got four-year-old
Jay in one arm.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.830
He's got the phone
and the towel here.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.830
Amaris is hanging on his
belt. He calls his wife

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.010
as he walked into urgent care.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:55.870
Hey, honey, yeah.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.640
You know that hook in the bath?

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.830
Yeah, you're going to
say, I told you so,

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.720
but yeah, it went in my eye.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.430
She's like, you idiot.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:06.970
So he gets to urgent
care, comes walking in.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:08.040
They're like, nope, nope.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.700
You got to go to
the emergency room.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.840
We can't help you here.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.452
PARDEEP KALEKA: We
don't see those.

00:40:12.452 --> 00:40:13.910
ARNO MICHAELIS: So
just then, Priti

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:16.939
gets there, once again,
probably called you an idiot.

00:40:16.939 --> 00:40:17.980
PARDEEP KALEKA: Oh, yeah.

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.010
ARNO MICHAELIS: It's an
I told you so moment.

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:25.090
Takes him to the real doctor,
and they take the hook out,

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:26.700
and the doctor's
like, Pardeep, you

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.695
are one of the luckiest people
I've ever met in my life.

00:40:29.695 --> 00:40:31.880
And Pardeep's like, I don't
really feel very lucky.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.421
And the doctor goes,
if it would have

00:40:33.421 --> 00:40:36.280
been 2 millimeters the other
way, you'd have a glass eye.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.300
But as it was, his eye was
OK, but it tore the muscle

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.400
that kept his eyelid up.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.730
So like in true
Punjabi fabulousness,

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:49.790
he tapes his eyelid
up so he can see,

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:52.580
and then he's got
to manually blink,

00:40:52.580 --> 00:40:55.780
bringing his bottom eyelid
up when the eye gets dry.

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.060
And so he tells me this story.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:58.530
And I'm just like
all y'all were.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.370
I'm just like, oh, ew, no.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:05.530
I'm literally squirming
and feeling his pain.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:09.660
And this empathy that I have for
the suffering he went through

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:14.080
on the spot just like broke
the ice, on both sides.

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.040
And for me also, I'm like
an almost fatal klutz.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.970
Like I am my own worst enemy.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.270
I have over 20 concussions,
and probably half of them

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:23.890
are self induced.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.260
And so when he's telling
me about his klutziness,

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:28.170
I'm like this is my guy.

00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.980
We've been separated at birth.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:34.520
So we sat down and we
split some squash curry.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.444
Spicy was level 7, I believe.

00:41:36.444 --> 00:41:37.360
It was pretty banging.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.267
PARDEEP KALEKA:
And we got drunk.

00:41:40.267 --> 00:41:42.600
ARNO MICHAELIS: We were
actually drinking tea all night.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.860
We got buzzed on
those places for sure.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.110
We were pretty buzzed.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.880
And I remember, we met at
6 PM and the restaurant

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.470
closes at 9 PM.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:54.120
And it was almost 10
when King's like, Arno,

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.310
we closed like 45 minutes ago.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:57.690
Could you guys wrap it up?

00:41:57.690 --> 00:41:59.570
And it was amazing.

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:03.406
We just had this brilliant
discussion that was so open,

00:42:03.406 --> 00:42:04.780
and throughout
this conversation,

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:05.710
I have to remind myself.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.043
I'm like, dude, you're sitting
here talking to this dude

00:42:08.043 --> 00:42:10.510
because one of your old
guys murdered his dad.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:15.450
Because Par was so down to earth
and so genuine and so friendly.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:17.470
We just had the
most amazing talk.

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.419
And as we talked, we
saw we had so much more

00:42:20.419 --> 00:42:22.210
in common than different,
even though we're

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:25.000
born on opposite
sides of the planet.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.940
Our family stories are
the polar opposite.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.700
His family scrapped and clawed
to achieve the American dream

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.290
over 30 years.

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.180
I was born with the
American dream handed

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.410
to me on a silver platter.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.320
All I had to do was execute,
and I spent my whole life

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.800
getting away from it.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.390
But as we sat and talked, like
commonality after commonality

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:47.024
after commonality appeared,
to the point of where he was

00:42:47.024 --> 00:42:48.190
saying his daughter's seven.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.731
I'm like, when my
daughter was seven,

00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:52.120
she had this thing
with her socks.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.930
And you'd put her socks on, and
if that seam was like cocked

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:57.682
what-- you know
what I'm saying--

00:42:57.682 --> 00:43:00.240
if it's cocked one way or
the other over her toes,

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.220
she'd just be like this and
just freeze and not go anywhere.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.064
You got to take her shoes
off, put the socks back on.

00:43:06.064 --> 00:43:07.480
And I'm telling
him that, and he's

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.670
like, my daughter does that.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.320
We're talking about our dads.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.367
Par's dad would never pay
anybody to fix nothing.

00:43:15.367 --> 00:43:16.950
Whether he knows how
to fix it or not,

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.416
he's like, I'm
going to fix this.

00:43:18.416 --> 00:43:21.070
This results in him
having the lawn mower

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.920
in pieces on the living room
carpet in the middle of winter,

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.510
much to his mother's horror.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.490
And my dad did the
exact same thing.

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:30.400
So after all these
commonalities,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.400
that was really where the idea
for Serve to Unite was born.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.965
And we walked out of
there right away like we

00:43:35.965 --> 00:43:37.240
were going to work together.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.470
We're going to be doing
something together

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:39.524
from this point forward.

00:43:39.524 --> 00:43:41.440
SPEAKER 1: So I want to
get to Serve to Unite,

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.020
but we do have
two mics, so we'll

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.200
get to audience questions.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.919
So if people want
to start lining up.

00:43:46.919 --> 00:43:49.210
But talk to us about Serve
to Unite, how you founded it

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.990
and the message of
your foundation.

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:52.350
PARDEEP KALEKA: Sure.

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.730
So Serve to Unite
was founded, I mean,

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:58.250
in response to the Sikh temple
shootings on August 5th.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:02.085
And what we saw at that time
in Oak Creek, Wisconsin,

00:44:02.085 --> 00:44:04.090
and it's still
happening right now,

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.540
is we were seeing a lot
of demographic change.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.350
And we saw a lot of
people uncomfortable

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.150
with this demographic change.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.180
And as we've been,
for the last six years

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.430
that we've been
traveling, we've been

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:18.460
able to go to many
communities around the United

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.980
States, small towns
who are uncomfortable

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.132
with this demographic change.

00:44:23.132 --> 00:44:27.130
And so Serve to Unite was
really just to respond to that.

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.020
And eventually what
it started to do

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:32.560
was, in the spirit of
intentions, sometimes

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.840
intentions take you
into different spheres.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.197
And then we started to get
into conversations about, OK,

00:44:38.197 --> 00:44:40.030
how do we bring school
communities together?

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.220
How do we bring broad
communities together?

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.510
How do we bring global
communities together?

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:47.670
And that's really
where Serve to Unite--

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:50.500
it is an organization, but
it's much more a calling.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.220
And it's a calling, not
to say, you know what?

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.020
Serve to Unite, meaning oneness.

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.950
We as human beings
have to understand,

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:04.150
and the principles of
Christianity, Islam, Sikhism,

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:06.850
Judaism, all those
faiths, that we are

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.850
connected at a spiritual level.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:13.360
And it makes no sense
to read anything else

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.340
into any scriptures that closes
you off rather than opens you

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.500
up to that fundamental truth.

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:25.540
And so that's what
Serve to Unite was, is,

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:27.700
and we were privileged
to be able to go

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.920
to different communities
and school communities

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:34.347
and be able to address some of
the rift that exists right now.

00:45:34.347 --> 00:45:36.430
ARNO MICHAELIS: What we
do specifically in schools

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:40.670
is we do arts-driven service
learning and global engagement.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:43.630
So we ask our students
what issues in society

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:45.070
they want to
address, and then we

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:47.350
facilitate service
learning projects,

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:50.570
often involving the arts,
to solve those problems.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:52.330
So our students have
addressed things

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:56.080
like community police
relations, Islamophobia,

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.320
religious intolerance, racism,
homophobia, homelessness,

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.420
human trafficking,
genocide prevention,

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.040
Holocaust education.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:06.280
And we do this in conjunction
with a really amazing roster

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:08.950
of people we call
global mentors, who

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:10.600
are people from
all over the world,

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.650
some former violent
extremists like myself,

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:16.420
some survivors like Pardeep,
all of whom have amazing stories

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.240
and do amazing work
in their own spheres.

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:23.890
We connect them live with our
students via Google Hangout,

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:27.520
and our students are then
like inspired by that story,

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.300
and also advise in a really
practical sense about how

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.150
to best carry out
these service projects.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.310
The dean Uman Yana is
a dear friend of ours

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.440
and who's also appeared
on Google Talks,

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.150
a survivor of the
Rwandan genocide,

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.730
is one of our best
global mentors.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.264
And she helps make all
this kind of stuff happen.

00:46:46.264 --> 00:46:47.305
SPEAKER 1: Want to start?

00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:47.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:48.590
Thank you so much for coming.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:50.840
I really appreciate you
coming and sharing your story.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.230
Arno, you describe
an adolescence

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.045
that is very
hateful and violent,

00:46:55.045 --> 00:46:58.510
but at the time of August
5th, your first reaction

00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:59.800
is compassion.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.340
As maybe an insight as to how
that transformation happens

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.170
to other people in
white supremacy orgs,

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:06.230
what was your story?

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.410
How did that transition
happen and how did you

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:10.030
escape that life?

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.390
ARNO MICHAELIS: That's
an awesome question.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:15.370
The very quick answer to
how I got out of the moment

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:16.780
was exhaustion.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.030
It was exhausting doing
that constant spin.

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:23.020
It was exhausting cutting myself
off from culture and media

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.300
that I had once
taken for granted.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.680
What was most
exhausting was when

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.590
people who I claimed to hate
treated me with kindness.

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:32.530
And I was very fortunate that
during my seven-year span

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:35.860
in hate groups, there were times
when a Jewish boss, a lesbian

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.530
supervisor, black
and Latino coworkers,

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:41.490
treated me with kindness
when I least deserved it.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:45.550
And I think this is crucial to
say, in our political climate

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.130
today, in treating
me with kindness,

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:52.360
they were actively defying
everything that I was about.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.460
Everything I did back then
was meant to provoke hatred.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.400
It was meant to
provoke hostility.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.950
If the hate was directed
at me, all the better.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.590
So when people got angry at
me and they wanted to fight,

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.820
I was like, yes.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.300
Let the aggression flow.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.080
That's what I'm
trying to make happen.

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.620
So the people who treated me
with kindness were like, no.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:13.210
You're not making
the rules here.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.410
I'm making the rules.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:18.130
And the rules are, this is how
human beings treat each other.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.130
If you grow up, you
can live in this world

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:23.480
where you're not
terrified of everyone.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.200
And that's what got me out.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.734
I was very fortunate also--

00:48:26.734 --> 00:48:28.900
within a couple of years
of leaving this white power

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.010
skinhead life, I started
going to rave parties.

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.540
So I'm a man of extremes.

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.130
I go from extreme
hate and violence

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.540
to extreme peace and love.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:41.032
So a couple of years out
from beating people up

00:48:41.032 --> 00:48:42.490
because of the
color of their skin,

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.350
I'm on the south side
of Chicago at 4:00

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.150
in the morning on a
Sunday, shaking my ass

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.690
to house music with 4,000 people
of every possible ethnicity,

00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:53.290
gender, identity,
sexual orientation,

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.780
socioeconomic background
on the planet Earth,

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.280
and loving every minute of it.

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.430
And the people in
the rave scene--

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.270
I used to have
swastikas back on me.

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.320
Like this whole arm was
a big pile of swastikas.

00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:08.700
And people were just like, it
doesn't matter where you were.

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:09.940
It matters where you are.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.050
And we accept you.

00:49:11.050 --> 00:49:14.530
You're forgiven,
unconditionally on the spot.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:19.860
That was really a huge
part of my re-humanizing.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.150
It was a huge part of
my learning and growth.

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:25.090
And I was still being
very self-destructive.

00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:29.310
I had added profuse drug
use to my profuse drinking,

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:31.710
and selling drugs for
a while, but it was

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.570
definitely a big step forward.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:36.180
And so eventually
I quit drinking.

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.040
That was another
big step forward.

00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.540
Brought some more
challenges because

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:43.860
without alcohol to numb my past,
it almost consumed me again.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.530
Fortunately, my daughter
led me out of that,

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:48.750
and I started writing in 2007.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.690
Writing's a really
powerful process.

00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:55.470
I started meditating in 2009,
and my meditation practice

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:58.440
is really what empowers me
to do everything I'm doing.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.410
I think without it, I
wouldn't be able to.

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:03.900
So that was really
how I got from being

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.220
where I was to where I am now.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.437
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:07.437 --> 00:50:08.520
ARNO MICHAELIS: Thank you.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.080
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being
here and sharing your story.

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:13.560
For those of us who are inspired
by the themes of empathy

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:17.760
and understanding different
perspectives, what do you see

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.800
is the role that technology
can play in that?

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.927
So for those of us who
work on Google products,

00:50:22.927 --> 00:50:24.510
or the many Google
products that exist

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:26.490
in some capacity
or another, do you

00:50:26.490 --> 00:50:28.680
see there's a way that
any products could

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.860
be different to help with
the concepts of empathy

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.260
and helping each other,
understand each other's

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:35.455
perspectives?

00:50:35.455 --> 00:50:36.580
PARDEEP KALEKA: Yeah, yeah.

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.280
Great question, and
where we are right now.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:42.490
And I think technology
is something

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:45.250
that's going to be part of
our lives going forward.

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:47.050
It's not something
we can put back in

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:48.340
and say, well you know what?

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.350
We want to engage
in human contact

00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:52.110
like we are doing right now.

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:55.240
With that said, I
think there's a lot

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.820
to be said for the
benefits of technology.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:02.710
I'm a therapist
now, and I see a lot

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:05.680
of clients who have had
very traumatic pasts,

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.836
and we have a lot of suicidal
ideation, homicidal ideation.

00:51:08.836 --> 00:51:10.960
One of the things, one of
the tools, that actually,

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.150
believe it or not,
keeps them living

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:17.730
and keeps them connected to
the world is the virtual world.

00:51:17.730 --> 00:51:21.030
Now, we have to be
careful in our algorithms,

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:25.590
and not siloing a person who is
miserable towards more misery.

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:29.280
So actively challenging the
silo that someone exists in,

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.800
having them critically
think, those

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.610
are those things we can all
do, but don't underestimate

00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:41.550
your power with technology
into keeping somebody

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:45.510
from committing a horrible
act against themselves

00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:46.770
or somebody else.

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:48.560
One of the first things that--

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.915
I forget the name of the
shooter in Sandy Hook--

00:51:51.915 --> 00:51:53.040
ARNO MICHAELIS: Adam Lanza.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:53.850
PARDEEP KALEKA: Adam Lanza--
one of the first things

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:57.004
he did was, he put a bullet
through his computer.

00:51:57.004 --> 00:51:58.210
Right?

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:00.940
And so once you start to
do that, those are threads

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:05.620
of humanity, and threads of
humanity, the more threads

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:09.920
to humanity that you have,
the more stable you can be,

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.800
the more of a support
structure you can have.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:15.850
So the most dangerous
person is the person who

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:18.480
feels rejected and isolated.

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:23.740
Rejection, whether it's
real or whether it's

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:28.090
conceived through self
persecution, paranoia,

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:29.810
is real to that person.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:31.960
And we have to understand
that first and foremost.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:35.770
The next school shooter, and
I hate to say it in this way,

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:37.730
to assume that there's
going to be a next one,

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:40.120
but the school year is
going to start up soon,

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:45.060
is most likely feeling rejected,
most likely feeling isolated.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:47.100
And that could be
for real things.

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.780
Something could be
happening, or it

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:52.890
could be just the delusions
or the chemical imbalance

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:54.430
that that person has.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:53:00.090
But technology goes a long way
as far as making a person not

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:03.620
feel like they're by themselves.

00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:06.750
But it can also,
with any good thing,

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.440
there can be the flip side.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:08.940
Right?

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.990
And we can go really bad
and make them feel even more

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:15.610
isolated and more suffer.

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.850
So I don't know if that
answers your question.

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:20.944
AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you.

00:53:20.944 --> 00:53:21.485
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:21.485 --> 00:53:23.675
Thanks for sharing your story.

00:53:23.675 --> 00:53:24.830
That was really powerful.

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:28.240
It resonated with me personally
on multiple different levels,

00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.240
one of which is I actually
work at Google Ideas.

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.490
It's super cool to
hear that from--

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:32.531
ARNO MICHAELIS: Right on.

00:53:32.531 --> 00:53:34.950
AUDIENCE: --from Against
Violent Extremism.

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:37.360
I guess my concern is,
similar to the last one,

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:41.970
but there are a lot of
debates about free speech

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:46.150
and technology, and what
role tech companies, who

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:48.020
are platforms, should say.

00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:51.360
And you talk about rejection
and feeling isolated,

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.590
but there's also
obviously radicalization

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:56.530
that happens in communities.

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.150
I guess I'm just curious what
your general thoughts are

00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.650
on that.

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:02.370
ARNO MICHAELIS: And
thank you once again.

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:05.610
Obviously, the Against
Violence Extremism network,

00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:08.010
beyond just
connecting Par and I,

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:10.440
has been like the backbone
of Serve to Unite.

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:14.100
Many of our global mentors
have been connected with us

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:16.110
through the Against
Violent Extremism network.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:19.200
And I've been doing counter
violent extremism work

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:21.510
internationally since the
Summit Against Violent

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:24.700
Extremism in the summer of '11,
which Google Ideas made happen.

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:28.220
So that was huge.

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:31.030
Following up on the technology
thing, and as part managing it,

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:32.760
the toothpaste is
out of the tube.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.280
It's not going back in.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.670
That's just the way it is.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:40.020
And technology can be
immensely empowering

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.620
or it can be insidiously evil.

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.564
Fire can burn down
your house or it

00:54:45.564 --> 00:54:47.730
can keep you alive in the
winter when it's freezing.

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:52.180
It's just how we employ it
that really makes a difference.

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.690
And as far as technology
and free speech go,

00:54:54.690 --> 00:54:58.380
I think that I'm a huge
proponent of free speech.

00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:00.879
I love the First Amendment.

00:55:00.879 --> 00:55:03.420
I think it's probably one of
the best things about the United

00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:04.320
States of America.

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:08.130
I am very much
opposed to legislation

00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:09.820
against hate speech.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:13.850
I think it has never
accomplished less hate.

00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:18.180
Countries like England
and Germany and Sweden,

00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.750
where hate speech is
disallowed, have huge problems

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.730
with far right
gangs because what

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:27.570
it does is, it validates
the victimhood narrative

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.010
of this game.

00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:31.440
So if I'm in the
UK and I'm like,

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.630
I can't even say this
word without them

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.300
oppressing me and
putting me in jail,

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.740
that's a means of recruitment.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.680
It's a means of cultivating
the white victimhood that's

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.822
at the base of all that.

00:55:42.822 --> 00:55:45.030
And that goes if you're
talking about Islamist groups

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:46.320
or whatever.

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.150
There's no violent
extremism narrative

00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:51.180
that doesn't revolve around
a sense of oppression.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.520
And whether that oppression
is real or imagined

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:54.930
is completely beside the point.

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:57.190
It's real to the
people who feel it.

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:58.980
And without that
sense of oppression,

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:02.010
they're not going to be
angry enough to hurt people.

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:03.720
So when the
government is actively

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.620
adding to the
oppression by saying,

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:09.230
hey, you can't say this
word without going to jail,

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:11.340
it helps hate groups grow.

00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:14.430
That being said, being a
proponent of free speech

00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:17.790
as I am, I think if
we love free speech,

00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:22.050
and I love how the ACLU
works in this regard,

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:24.840
the more you love free
speech, the more responsible

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.650
you should be with your speech.

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:30.780
If the government isn't going
to say, you can say this

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:32.790
and you can't say
that, it's up to you

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:34.590
to have the personal
responsibility to say,

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:39.030
I'm not going to yell fire
right now in this crowded venue

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.550
because it would
cause a stampede.

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:41.910
Someone could get hurt.

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:44.190
That's my responsibility
as someone

00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:47.040
who enjoys the benefits
of the First Amendment,

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:51.440
is to be extra responsible
and mindful with my language.

00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.590
It's not the polar opposite,
which is what we see,

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:55.717
So like free speech,
rah, rah, rah.

00:56:55.717 --> 00:56:58.050
They want to say all the most
offensive things they can.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:07.380
To me, it's not showing any
gratitude for your ability

00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:08.900
to speak freely.

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:12.427
So I think it's being
responsible, being mindful,

00:57:12.427 --> 00:57:13.260
is really important.

00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:17.130
In a technological sense, I
think technology companies

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:18.810
like Google--

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:21.020
and you guys have done
an amazing job at this--

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.240
need to be very
aware of the power

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.880
that the platform carries.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.857
PARDEEP KALEKA: Just to
piggyback on that real quick,

00:57:29.857 --> 00:57:31.690
the First Amendment and
the Second Amendment

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:35.560
came out in times when like,
what types of guns did we have?

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.080
What type of free
press did we have?

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.730
What type of speech did we have?

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:42.190
If we think about it in terms
of the current situation

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:47.620
that we're in, we're thinking
about speech, press, weapons,

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:52.930
and thinking as far as we can
do weapons of mass destruction,

00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:55.540
or words of mass
destruction, or words

00:57:55.540 --> 00:58:01.030
of mass togetherness or
weapons of mass togetherness.

00:58:01.030 --> 00:58:04.610
So it's just
completely amplified.

00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:09.640
And so, I mean, you guys are the
experts in this kind of field.

00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:14.950
But we need to get to a
place where a person is not

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:18.850
elected because they have the
most social media followers.

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:22.780
We have celebrities who don't
say the smartest things,

00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:25.690
but yet they get a
million retweets.

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:28.630
We have celebrity
stardom, and it's

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:34.030
like, but when is it that we
get the voice back to the people

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:36.640
who are actually
leaders, thought leaders,

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.350
in these fields?

00:58:39.350 --> 00:58:40.960
So a great question.

00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:43.210
SPEAKER 1: We have time
for a very, very quick one.

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:43.630
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:45.130
Thank you so much for
being here and sharing

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:45.880
the story for goodness.

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:46.720
I think I really needed it.

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.350
I'm a Googler.

00:58:47.350 --> 00:58:48.780
I'm an MBA intern.

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.500
And I go to school
in Charlottesville.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.972
So when I heard you saying,
August 5th, August 5th,

00:58:52.972 --> 00:58:54.930
I kept thinking August
12th because I was there

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:56.480
when Heather was murdered.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.550
And it's a wound
every year, right?

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:01.060
This year, I'm going to be our
vice president of diversity

00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.680
at Darden and I've had
people messaging and calling

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:06.450
me, saying, what do I do because
it feels like the wound has

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:07.200
been ripped again?

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.500
And so I'm curious
what advice you all

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.890
have for me to share with
my peers in the community

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:12.880
down in Charlottesville
about how we move on,

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.160
when hundreds of people
like you were there,

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.702
right, protesting hate.

00:59:16.702 --> 00:59:19.285
We might not have the ability
to stay and have a conversation,

00:59:19.285 --> 00:59:20.570
as you all are having.

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:23.075
So what advice do I give to
my peers and to my community

00:59:23.075 --> 00:59:24.030
when I go back?

00:59:24.030 --> 00:59:25.540
Today's my last day, by the way.

00:59:25.540 --> 00:59:27.510
But hopefully I'll
be back here in May.

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:29.680
So what advice
would you give me?

00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.930
PARDEEP KALEKA: Advice for
that, I would give anybody,

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:34.540
is just to honor that pain.

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.650
I think, in our
country's history,

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:40.090
there has been this
sort of an appetite

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:44.050
to move forward without
honoring pain from the past.

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:50.020
And like I said before, we can
build a society around wounds.

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:52.420
Sure, we can, but
until we actually

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:55.480
address the wound that
exists there by honoring it,

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.680
we don't really move
forward because we all

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.220
know that it's there.

01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:02.950
We all know that
it's there because we

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:05.830
can't have conversations around
race without somebody getting

01:00:05.830 --> 01:00:07.390
uncomfortable.

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:09.960
And then, that uncomfortability
speaks to, hey,

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.280
you know what, there's
something still there that

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.200
needs to be addressed.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:20.660
So I'm sorry for what happened
on August 12th and Heather

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:25.571
Heyer, and really, her
life needs to be honored.

01:00:25.571 --> 01:00:27.070
One of the saddest
things that I saw

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:31.180
was, from a lot of social media,
as whether like white allies

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.600
should be honored.

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.180
And I'm like, how is this
even in a conversation?

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.600
How are we getting to
the point in society

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.150
that we are actually
having a conversation

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:48.260
on whether a person who lost
their life, as a martyr,

01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.630
is a life worth honoring?

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:54.130
And so I thank you
for speaking up.

01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.760
I realize that
you are her voice.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.500
ARNO MICHAELIS: I
think it's really--

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:03.520
and again, I'm so grateful
for your dedication

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.290
to bring about a society
where everyone is valued

01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:11.140
and included, and I
bear witness to the pain

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:14.920
that you're feeling over
what happened to Heather

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.650
and over all the other violence
that happened that day.

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:23.180
In that spirit, I want to
empower you and everyone

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:27.740
you work with to truly
defy hate and violence.

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:34.250
And in all candor,
in all frankness,

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:38.830
some people not understanding
that help to contribute to what

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:40.480
happened in Charlottesville.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.790
There's a lot of people
who rightfully believe

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:44.830
that going out and
punching Nazis,

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:48.610
and we can somehow out-hate
them, or hate them out

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:51.860
of existence, and it feeds them.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:53.890
It's the best gift
you can give them.

01:01:53.890 --> 01:01:55.780
It doesn't defy them.

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:57.460
You're actually
putty in their hands

01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.010
when you respond to them
with any kind of aggression

01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:02.470
because that's what
they're trying to provoke.

01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:05.620
In Serve to Unite, we work
with kids from second grade

01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.750
through college,
and every year, we

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:10.210
have a peace summit where we
get all our students together

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.350
in one spot.

01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:13.780
The first year we did this,
we had over 400 students

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:15.810
from second grade
through college,

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:18.400
in historic Turner's
Ballroom in Milwaukee.

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.740
They spent the day doing
collaborative art projects

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.426
and networking and sharing
their service projects

01:02:23.426 --> 01:02:24.175
they did all year.

01:02:24.175 --> 01:02:25.970
We had music and food.

01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:27.190
It was a lot of fun.

01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:30.040
And the last thing that day was
our second and third graders

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.460
from Escuela Fratney,
who were this absolutely

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:37.930
gorgeous diverse spectrum of
ethnicities and backgrounds

01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:41.560
up stage, little tiny kids,
and they taught the whole crowd

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.930
to sing a song of
piece called Salaam

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:47.740
where the verse is in Hebrew
and the chorus is in Arabic,

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.300
and you're singing it around.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.640
And pretty soon, we have
400 kids from second grade

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:55.060
through college, who have
every possible background you

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:58.540
can imagine, singing about
peace in Hebrew and Arabic,

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.720
after spending the day
together, loving each other,

01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.900
seeing each other's
humanity, valuing each other,

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:08.020
collaborating to solve
problems in society.

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:11.780
And as this is going on,
I'm thinking to myself,

01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:15.010
this is a white supremist's
worst nightmare.

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:17.800
And this is how we
respond to hate crime.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.240
This is what you get.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:21.310
If you want to come
and shoot up a temple,

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:23.620
you want to come drive
a car into people,

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.110
you want to commit this
kind of violence and hatred,

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:28.050
this is how we're
going to respond.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:31.600
And if everybody would get board
with that kind of response,

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:35.920
I shit you not, we can put an
end to white power rallies.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.910
I have a blog at
mylifeafterhate.com--

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:41.560
I have an article there, how
to smash neo-Nazi events.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.530
And I implore you to
read that and share it.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:49.630
I really think that showing the
beauty and power of diversity,

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:53.880
winning in the marketplace of
ideas, is how we defeat hate.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.430
And it's really important to
not let yourself play their game

01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:59.380
and not to let them
make the rules.

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.270
PARDEEP KALEKA: Real
quick, the response

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:04.210
has to be so much stronger
than the action committed,

01:04:04.210 --> 01:04:08.090
and with that said, when
August 5th happened,

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:11.710
and one of the
producers for a show

01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:16.970
asked me one time, Pardeep, why
do you say the shooter's name?

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:20.380
There's so many people,
survivors, that he interviewed,

01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.050
and he's like, they don't
ever say the shooter's name.

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:25.150
And I told him, I
said, quite honestly, I

01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:28.570
want to remind the Wade Michael
Pages of the world that are out

01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:31.750
there that are watching this
that what happens when you do

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:33.790
something like this
because you're hateful,

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:37.182
because whatever you believe
in, because you're miserable,

01:04:37.182 --> 01:04:39.640
you think that you're going to
make other people miserable?

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.520
But this made us stronger
and this made us better.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.460
The response was
so much stronger,

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.880
that I wanted to remind, and
that's the greatest violence

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.040
prevention technique
that you can use,

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.760
is make the response
so much stronger

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.340
than the action committed.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.340
And say, well, look
at what happened

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.600
because of what you did.

01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:00.760
Then, think twice about
what you're about to do.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.770
When we're miserable
because of the response,

01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:04.380
or because of the
actual committed,

01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:08.080
then the shooter or the person
committing violence has won.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:10.810
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:12.640
SPEAKER 1: Guys, thank
you for being here.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.790
ARNO MICHAELIS: Thank you, guys.
