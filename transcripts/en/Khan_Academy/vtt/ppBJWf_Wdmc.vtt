00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.050
Problem 1.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.900
For 0 is less than or equal to
t is less than or equal to 6,

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.580
a particle is moving
along the x-axis.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.480
The particle's position x of
t is not explicitly given.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.260
The velocity of the
particle is given by v of t

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.400
is equal to all of this
business right over here.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.310
The acceleration of the
particle is given by a of t

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.170
is equal to all of this
business over here.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.240
They actually didn't
have to give us

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.110
that because the
acceleration is just

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.789
the derivative of the velocity.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.080
And they also gave us-- they
don't tell us the position

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.640
function, but they tell us
where we start off, x of 0

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.970
is equal to 2.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.610
Fair enough.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.630
Now let's do part
A. Is the speed

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.760
of the particle increasing
or decreasing at time t

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.360
equals 5.5?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.002
Give a reason for your answer.

00:00:43.002 --> 00:00:45.210
It looks like they did
something a little sneaky here

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000
because they gave us
a velocity function

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.562
and then they ask about a speed.

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:50.770
And you might say, wait,
aren't those the same thing?

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.250
And I would say, no, they
aren't quite the same thing.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.780
Velocity is a magnitude
and a direction.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.200
It is a vector quantity.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.870
Speed is just a magnitude.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.000
It is a scalar quantity.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.452
And to see the difference,
you could have a velocity--

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:04.410
and this isn't maybe
particular to this problem

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.993
because they don't
give us the units--

00:01:05.993 --> 00:01:09.840
but you could have a velocity
of negative 5 meters per second.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.159
And maybe if we're talking
about on the x-axis,

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.700
this would mean
we're moving leftward

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.440
at 5 meters per
second on the x-axis.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.030
So the magnitude is
5 meters per second.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.980
This is the magnitude.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.290
And the direction is specified
by the negative number.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.650
And that is the direction.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.460
Your velocity could be
negative 5 meters per second,

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.680
but your speed would just
be 5 meters per second.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.260
So your speed is 5
meters per second

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.602
whether you're going to
the left or to the right.

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:42.560
Your velocity, you actually
care whether you're

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.640
going to the left or the right.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.306
So let's just keep
that in mind while we

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:46.860
try to solve this problem.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.550
So the best way to figure out
whether our rate of change

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.660
is increasing or decreasing is
to look at the acceleration.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.040
Because acceleration
is really just

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.722
the rate of change of velocity.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:59.180
And then, we can
think a little bit

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.990
about this velocity
versus speed question.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.222
So what is the
acceleration at time 5.5?

00:02:08.222 --> 00:02:09.180
Get the calculator out.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.170
We can use calculators for
this part of the AP exam.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.850
And I assume they intend us to
because this isn't something

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.480
that's easy to
calculate by hand.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.110
So the acceleration at time 5.5,
we just have to say t is 5.5

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.670
and evaluate this function.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.350
So 1/2-- I'll just write
0.5-- times e to the t over 4.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.320
Well t is 5.5.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.880
5.5 divided by 4.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:56.180
And then, times cosine of 5.5
divided by 4 gives us 0.38.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.070
Did I do that right?

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.320
We have 0.5 times e to
the 5.5 divided by 4,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.520
times cosine-- oh, sorry.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.610
I made a mistake.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.370
That looked a little strange.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.990
It's not cosine of
5.5 divided by 4,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:19.190
it's cosine of e to
the 5.5 divided by 4.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.350
So let's look at that.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.220
So that's one
parentheses I close.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.540
And now that is the second
parentheses that I've closed.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.280
And I get negative 1.3-- well, I
just say roughly negative 1.36.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.270
So this is equal to,
or approximately equal

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.810
to, negative 1.36 if I round it.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.850
And we don't care about so
much as the actual value.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.180
What we really care
about is its sign.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.550
So the acceleration at
time 5.5 is negative,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:54.095
which tells us that the
velocity is decreasing.

00:03:54.095 --> 00:03:55.970
Now, you might be tempted
to say, we're done.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.469
But remember, they're
not asking us,

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.230
is the velocity of the particle
increasing or decreasing?

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.580
They're asking us, is
the speed of the particle

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.760
increasing or decreasing?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.260
And if you're saying,
hey, how did I

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.134
know that, just remember
acceleration is just

00:04:09.134 --> 00:04:10.680
the rate of change of velocity.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.400
If acceleration
is negative, that

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.990
means the rate of
change of velocity

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.950
is negative It is going down.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.279
But anyway, how do we
address this speed issue?

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.850
How do we think about it?

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.519
Well, there's two scenarios.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.550
If our velocity is
positive at time 5.5,

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.770
so if we have a
positive velocity,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.436
so let's say our velocity
is 5 meters per second--

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.060
although they don't
give us units here,

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.350
so I won't use units.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.170
So let's say our velocity is 5.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.530
And then it's negative.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.270
So at some point our velocity is
going to be something smaller.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.960
Then that means that the speed
would also be decreasing.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.850
So if we have a
positive velocity,

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.940
then the fact that
acceleration is negative

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.950
means that both velocity and
speed would be decreasing.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.950
On the other hand, if we had
a negative velocity at time t

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.470
equals 5.5, then the
fact that it's decreasing

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.039
means that we're getting
even more negative.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.705
And if we're getting
even more negative,

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:04.710
then that means the
speed is increasing.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.880
The magnitude is increasing
in the leftward direction.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.380
So what we really need to
do, beyond just evaluating

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.380
the acceleration at
time 5.5, we also

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.280
have to evaluate
the velocity to see

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.160
if it's going in the left
or the rightward direction.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.770
So let's evaluate the velocity.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.100
The velocity at 5.5-- and we'll
just get our calculator out

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.190
again.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.790
Velocity at 5.5-- this is
our velocity function--

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.370
is going to be equal
to 2 times the sine

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.831
of-- let me write it this way.

00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:38.330
Just because I want to make
sure I get my parentheses right.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:51.150
2 times the sine-- let me
write it this way-- 2 sine of e

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.940
to the 5.5, that's our
time, divided by 4.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.650
So I did that part
right over here.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.210
And I'm going to
close the 2 as well.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.310
And then plus 1.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.060
So this is our velocity.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.490
So our velocity at
time 5.5 is negative.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.340
So negative 0.45.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.570
Negative 0.45 roughly.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.630
So this is negative.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.875
The velocity is negative.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.134
So we have this scenario where
the velocity is negative,

00:06:20.134 --> 00:06:22.050
which means we're going
in the left direction.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.260
And the fact that the
velocity is also decreasing

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.090
means that over time-- at
least at this point in time--

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.960
as we go forward in time, it'll
become even more negative.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.730
And it'll become
even more negative

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.500
if we wait a little bit longer.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.830
So that means that the magnitude
of the velocity is increasing.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.072
It's just going in the
leftward direction.

00:06:42.072 --> 00:06:43.530
So if the magnitude
of the velocity

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.000
is increasing
although it's going

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.541
in the leftward
direction, that means

00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.582
that the speed is increasing.

00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:50.040
So the velocity--
so this is one of

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.890
those interesting scenarios--
the velocity is decreasing.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.980
But the speed, which is
what they're asking us

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.196
in the question,
speed is increasing.

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:05.380
And if you wanted to do
it really quick with all

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.610
of this explanation I gave
you, you would say, hey, look.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.480
What's acceleration?

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.660
Is it positive or negative?

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.576
You would evaluate it.

00:07:10.576 --> 00:07:11.910
You'd say, hey, it's negative.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.724
So you know velocity
is decreasing.

00:07:13.724 --> 00:07:15.640
And then you would say,
hey, what is velocity?

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:16.750
Is it positive or negative?

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:17.416
You evaluate it.

00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:18.610
You say it's negative.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.170
So you have a negative
value that is decreasing.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.620
So it's becoming more negative.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.780
So that means its
magnitude is increasing,

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.063
or speed is increasing.
