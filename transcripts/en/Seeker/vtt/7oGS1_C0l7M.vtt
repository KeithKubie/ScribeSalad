00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.220
A glass of wine a day keeps the doctor away!

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.429
NNOooooope don't care what the scientists
say, I'm just gonna keep onnnnn drinkin.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.530
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.640
Red wine: it's got super powers right?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.470
It can fight cancer, inflammation, heart disease!

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:29.359
This is thought to be because of 2 key components
in wine: 1, the antioxidants, and 2, the ethanol

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.539
alcohol itself.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.560
Red wine does have SOME antioxidants in it,
in particular an antioxidant called "resveratrol"

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.160
(which is also found in dark chocolate).

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.860
Resveratrol has been widely tested in lab
animals, and scientists found that it improved

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.860
animals' heart function, ability to use insulin,
and that it may also provide some protective

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.180
effects against diabetes and obesity.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.320
In humans, however, the benefits of resveratrol
hadn't been tested....until now.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.830
A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine
monitored the resveratrol metabolites in the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.130
urine of almost 800 Italians over the course
of 9 years.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.760
They found that more resveratrol didn't actually
translate into lower rates of cancer, heart

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.640
disease, or risk of death.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.900
Womp, womp.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.670
The conclusion?

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.260
It probably isn't the antioxidants doing the
trick.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.320
The lead researcher at Harvard said that the
reason the benefits may have been seen in

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.810
lab animals and not humans is that it is almost
impossible for a human to consume the AMOUNT

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.810
of resveratrol given to the animals in the
study.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.500
In order to consume the same amount, a human
would have to drink 1000 Liters of red wine

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.380
EVERY...DAY...which will send you on a nice
little trip to your grave.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.409
Fun fact, the resveratrol health craze has
created a 30 million dollar industry selling

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.409
resveratrol supplements.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.270
There's no data on how well they work, but
scientists have noted that, like most supplements,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.240
your body probably can't absorb the antioxidants
in supplement form.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.480
Which means, you're better off eating lots
of greens, beans, and berries than drinking

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.799
a glass of wine or taking an antioxidant supplement.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.440
So this research doesn't mean that wine isn't
a heart healthy option -- there are still

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.840
many studies demonstrating wine's ability
to raise good cholesterol, lower bad cholesterol,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.890
and protect the arteries from damage.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.740
What we're learning is that it may just be
the case that antioxidants aren't the reason

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.900
why the wine helps.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.650
It could be because of a different polyphenolic
antioxidant in the wine, or from the ethanol.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.649
There's already been some research suggesting
that it's small amounts of alcohol that could

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.049
be doing the trick, in which case, it's not
necessarily red wine alone that can provide

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.230
the protective benefits.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.540
It could be any kind of alcohol!

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.430
And MAYBE we see the effect with wine drinkers
particularly because the serving size is small

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.430
enough.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.410
We'll keep you updated if we see anymore studies
about alcohol and your heart health.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.489
Thanks for joining me for DNews, I'll see
you next time!
