00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.799
Hop out of bed for some eggs Bunny Side up
and then wage backyard garden warfare with

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:07.700
the Pollinator Beebomb.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.749
Because it’s episode 55 of LÜT.

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:17.710
Emerge from the shadows and learn to harness
them with the Shadow Puppets Mug, and once

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.580
you’ve mastered hand manipulation take a
crack at a full-body challenge on an inflatable

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.980
obstacle course from N-Flatables.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.810
You can rent them for parties, festivals or
just because they’re awesome and they have

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.400
everything from Hidden Temple Courses to Robo-Rampage.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.699
After you’ve had a whale of a time use these
Whale Knives to prepare dinner, but if you

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:43.370
find a spider in the salad bust out this Spider
Catching Gun to keep it from scrabbling away.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.840
Speaking of scrabble, why not add some alphabetic
flair to your living room with the Scrabble

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.429
Light Set which you can use to spell whatever
you want.

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.910
Mark wherever you’ve been on Earth with
the Scratch Map and watch as your travels

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.120
change the world, or at least the color of
the world map.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.610
If you get thirsty on your journeys grab a
Zing Water Bottle which features a built-in

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.620
fruit press so you can add some fruity zest
to whatever you’re drinking.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.560
But no matter what you do, Donut Forget Sticky
Notes.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.540
Do not be afraid to learn some Japanese with
the Jinmenken Haunted School Escape Board

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.540
Game.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.080
The Jinmenken is a Japanese monster dog with
a human face, and you need your character

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.920
to collect various items around the school
before he catches you.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.730
If you end up in the school cafeteria, take
a break from running for your life and enjoy

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.060
a personalized chocolate pizza made from Belgian
chocolate.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.820
Select from one of six different flavors and
personalize the message plaque in the middle,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
making it a great item to bring to somebody’s
birthday.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.340
And since it’s their birthday, you might
as well give them the never ending birthday

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.530
card which once opened plays a birthday jingle
continuously for at least 3 hours -- even

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.640
if it’s ripped up, submerged under water,
or set on fire.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.600
After all that annoying music, the adults
might wanna sink into a Gin and Titonic and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.170
then trick their brains into perceiving fluid
motion with the busy body optical illusion

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.170
toy.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.950
Based on a zoetrope, the Busy Body lets you
pose a number of mannequins placed around

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.340
a mirror and then create your own real life
animated GIF by giving it a spin.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.420
When they’ve run so much they’ve worn
out their shoes, grab a pair of these sneaker

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.620
soaps which come in styles from Adidas Superstar
soaps to Air Jordans.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.200
Then when you get sick of the air, head to
the ocean with deep sea sand art, an interactive

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.030
piece of art that has undersea mountains that
form before your very eyes.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.970
Open your eyes underwater after attaching
the GoFish cam and get high quality footage

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.420
of anything caught on your fishing line.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.450
It has night vision and can connect to your
phone so you can see what’s down there,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.701
but if you don’t check the footage, then
the fish both is and isn’t caught, just

00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:54.709
like this Schrodinger Cat Mug.&nbsp;

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.069
But to be sure your dinner does exist, sign
up for the Carnivore Club which sends you

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.540
a box of artisanal meat every month, like
South African dried meats or Canadian maple

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.540
jerky.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.980
Eat your meat inside the Gazebox, a re-sealable
cover that can act as both a gazebo, and a

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.980
carport.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.920
Now that you have a garage, it’s time to
buy a home -- a spaceship home.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.490
Made by Noem, the spaceship home is built
from three modules, is eco-friendly, and is

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.760
largely automated, so if you ever wanted to
live in a spaceship, this is probably your

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.880
best chance.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.160
Though it is missing something ah yes an Inflatable
Bath Tub.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.910
Just make sure you place it far away from
your Frankenstein Light Switch.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.550
Because if I let you get electrocuted, people
are going to say I’m Cold Hearted Pluto.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:04:04.540
And as always - thanks for watching!
