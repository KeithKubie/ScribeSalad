00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.880
Many female spiders are subjected to an insult
on their genitals in terms of something called

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.410
a mating plug.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.700
The ejaculates of many males contain substances
that are specifically designed to ‘seal

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.720
up’ a female's’ genital openings once
their sperm has been deposited.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.259
The function of these mating plugs (aka chastity
belts) is to deter any future suitors from

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:26.779
adding their sperm to the mix.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.119
The entire notion of the mating plug seems
ultra-unfair to the females that receive them;

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.480
however, that’s not always the case.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.390
Although it may initially seem counterintuitive,
it’s often the females that are plugging

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.390
themselves up.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.390
However, that’s not always the case.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.480
Although it may initially seem counterintuitive,
it’s often the females that are plugging

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.190
themselves up.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.700
And there are actually a number of good reasons
for them to want to do this.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.690
First off, to protect themselves from unwanted
acts of sex.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.430
Giant wood spider females are solely responsible
for production of a hardened plate over their

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.280
genital openings.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.189
These plates are highly effective at preventing
any kind of sexual advances - basically, males

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.899
are virtually unable to insert their pedipalps
(penises) into her.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.179
Other females put their copulatory plugs to
more sinister use.

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.729
Females of an orb weaving species secrete
a sticky substance from their genital ducts

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.219
that functions to entrap unsuspecting males
by their penises.This gives the females ample

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:29.840
time and opportunity to cannibalize the would-be
suitors.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.380
There are also cases where both males and
females work together to produce a mating

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.840
plug - a sort of ‘happy medium’ if you
will.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.670
In another orb weaver , males deposit their
sperm along with their ‘half’ of the mating

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.770
plug.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.850
If a female is happy with her male partner,
she can secrete the other half of the plug

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.100
in order to create a lasting seal (think of
it as two part epoxy).

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.229
If she is not happy with her male partner,
she will not add her magic glue to his plug,

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.409
resulting in both the plug liquid and his
sperm trickling out of her body and out of

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.409
her life.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.070
So yes, it’s true that the notion of a chastity
belt is not generally a fun one for females

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.560
in the animal kingdom.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.780
But you can rest assured that some ladies
out there continue to thrive by creating mating

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.890
plugs that work to their own (female) advantage.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.580
