00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.680
we've talked about before a number of
volunteers play a lot of video games

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:28.690
volunteers play a lot of video games
 

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.970
volunteers play a lot of video games
most of them have some experience in the

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:30.980
most of them have some experience in the
 

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.330
most of them have some experience in the
video game industry and we actually just

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:34.340
video game industry and we actually just
 

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.570
video game industry and we actually just
issued them a galaxy tens or asus

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:37.580
issued them a galaxy tens or asus
 

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.260

fortunately we now have a tablet
emulator they can actually run GL and

00:20:11.009 --> 00:20:11.019
emulator they can actually run GL and
 

00:20:11.019 --> 00:20:13.799

experience with that even if you're
 

00:20:15.729 --> 00:20:17.009
experience with that even if you're
going on a tablet right but that's not

00:20:17.009 --> 00:20:17.019
going on a tablet right but that's not
 

00:20:17.019 --> 00:20:18.690

and actually the one thing to note about
 

00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:25.950
and actually the one thing to note about
about it is tues you can always get the

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:25.960
about it is tues you can always get the
 

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.289
about it is tues you can always get the
density the pixel density as well as the

00:20:28.289 --> 00:20:28.299
density the pixel density as well as the
 

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:29.849
density the pixel density as well as the
screen size and that can help you

00:20:29.849 --> 00:20:29.859
screen size and that can help you
 

00:20:29.859 --> 00:20:33.959
screen size and that can help you
calibrate controls too that's it just

00:20:33.959 --> 00:20:33.969
calibrate controls too that's it just
 

00:20:33.969 --> 00:20:35.279
calibrate controls too that's it just
kind of it's definitely useful to see

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:35.289
kind of it's definitely useful to see
 

00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:36.419
kind of it's definitely useful to see
that when you're on those bigger screen

00:20:36.419 --> 00:20:36.429
that when you're on those bigger screen
 

00:20:36.429 --> 00:20:38.459
that when you're on those bigger screen
sizes what kind of tells you have well

00:20:38.459 --> 00:20:38.469
sizes what kind of tells you have well
 

00:20:38.469 --> 00:20:41.190
sizes what kind of tells you have well

stuff oh you're seeing some really
interesting graphical glitches yeah I

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:08.529
interesting graphical glitches yeah I
 

00:21:08.529 --> 00:21:10.619
interesting graphical glitches yeah I
will be able to get that working you

00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:10.629
will be able to get that working you
 

00:21:10.629 --> 00:21:12.539

00:21:12.539 --> 00:21:12.549
look older did something I have this
 

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:19.019
look older did something I have this
turned on okay yeah yeah so none right

00:21:19.019 --> 00:21:19.029
turned on okay yeah yeah so none right

turned on okay yeah yeah so none right
for those of you watching at home they

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:21.460
for those of you watching at home they
 

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.149
for those of you watching at home they
don't actually seem like what ya doing

so he's got the he's got the development

00:21:28.019 --> 00:21:28.029
so he's got the he's got the development
 

00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:29.039
so he's got the he's got the development
feature turned on where you can actually

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:29.049
feature turned on where you can actually
 

00:21:29.049 --> 00:21:31.289
feature turned on where you can actually
show touches which I should probably

00:21:31.289 --> 00:21:31.299
show touches which I should probably
 

00:21:31.299 --> 00:21:33.209
show touches which I should probably
have turned on and it's just causing

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:33.219
have turned on and it's just causing
 

00:21:33.219 --> 00:21:34.950
have turned on and it's just causing
some graphical glitch it usually doesn't

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960
some graphical glitch it usually doesn't
 

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.719
some graphical glitch it usually doesn't
but in this case it does it's not

00:21:36.719 --> 00:21:36.729
but in this case it does it's not
 

00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:38.269
but in this case it does it's not
surprising it's not behave smells at all

00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:38.279
surprising it's not behave smells at all
 

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:42.329
surprising it's not behave smells at all
so anyway yeah we like this game we

00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:42.339
so anyway yeah we like this game we
 

00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:44.549
so anyway yeah we like this game we
think your you know your upgrade

monetization strategy looks pretty cool

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:48.330
monetization strategy looks pretty cool
 

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.029
monetization strategy looks pretty cool
it's just if the controls are just a

00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039
it's just if the controls are just a
 

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:52.200
it's just if the controls are just a
little bit too difficult for us to

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:52.210
little bit too difficult for us to
 

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.169
little bit too difficult for us to
really get into it mmm I thought you

00:21:55.169 --> 00:21:55.179
really get into it mmm I thought you
 

00:21:55.179 --> 00:21:57.029
really get into it mmm I thought you
know I i like it i think that i think

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039
know I i like it i think that i think
 

00:21:57.039 --> 00:21:59.669
know I i like it i think that i think
it's always a i definitely think that on

00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679
it's always a i definitely think that on
 

00:21:59.679 --> 00:22:01.169
it's always a i definitely think that on
a tablet you know i'd love to see the

00:22:01.169 --> 00:22:01.179
a tablet you know i'd love to see the
 

00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:03.690
a tablet you know i'd love to see the
controls get tweaked but um you know I

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:03.700
controls get tweaked but um you know I
 

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.219
controls get tweaked but um you know I
suspect on a phone it's probably great

00:22:05.219 --> 00:22:05.229
suspect on a phone it's probably great
 

00:22:05.229 --> 00:22:07.139
suspect on a phone it's probably great
so yeah that's that's it's definitely

00:22:07.139 --> 00:22:07.149
so yeah that's that's it's definitely
 

00:22:07.149 --> 00:22:08.100
so yeah that's that's it's definitely
definitely worthwhile

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:08.110
definitely worthwhile
 

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.510
definitely worthwhile

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520
I would love to just be able to control
 

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.799
I would love to just be able to control
where his position is though with my

00:22:10.799 --> 00:22:10.809
where his position is though with my
 

00:22:10.809 --> 00:22:12.660
where his position is though with my
thumb I think that ye or have it almost

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:12.670
thumb I think that ye or have it almost
 

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.010
thumb I think that ye or have it almost
go exactly there that would become that

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:14.020
go exactly there that would become that
 

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.049
go exactly there that would become that
would be fun especially since you know

00:22:16.049 --> 00:22:16.059
would be fun especially since you know
 

00:22:16.059 --> 00:22:18.840
would be fun especially since you know
the that's it's a relatively small part

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:18.850
the that's it's a relatively small part
 

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.310
the that's it's a relatively small part
of the game in terms of in terms of the

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320
of the game in terms of in terms of the
 

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.220
of the game in terms of in terms of the
difficulty of the game I think okay i'll

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:23.230
difficulty of the game I think okay i'll
 

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.130
difficulty of the game I think okay i'll
definitely add a secondary control

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:26.140
definitely add a secondary control
 

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.980
definitely add a secondary control
scheme that would be awesome i got a

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:28.990
scheme that would be awesome i got a
 

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.430
scheme that would be awesome i got a
tablet so for testing and then just uh

shut up alright I stop the process but

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:54.730
shut up alright I stop the process but
 

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:56.580

yeah well I guess I could have done that

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:56.590
yeah well I guess I could have done that
 

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:00.890
yeah well I guess I could have done that
but my boy yeah maybe that's something

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900
but my boy yeah maybe that's something
 

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.180
but my boy yeah maybe that's something
specific to the tablet maybe I don't

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:03.190
specific to the tablet maybe I don't

classic you know problems so one of

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:44.910
classic you know problems so one of
 

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.520
classic you know problems so one of
things we actually ran into a few

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:46.530
things we actually ran into a few
 

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:47.690
things we actually ran into a few
problems was confirming what they were

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:47.700
problems was confirming what they were
 

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.770

did I music interlock and oh the back
 

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.800
did I music interlock and oh the back
key here this is a really interesting

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:54.810
key here this is a really interesting
 

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.130
key here this is a really interesting
case so so what do you do so you hit

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140
case so so what do you do so you hit
 

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.870
case so so what do you do so you hit
till you hit the two the big problem

00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880
till you hit the two the big problem
 

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.950
till you hit the two the big problem
with this game is I'll tell you that the

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960
with this game is I'll tell you that the
 

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.240
with this game is I'll tell you that the
real problem music ever lock so it

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:02.250
real problem music ever lock so it
 

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.760
real problem music ever lock so it
doesn't actually have music / lock what

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:04.770
doesn't actually have music / lock what
 

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:06.260
doesn't actually have music / lock what
actually happens is whenever the game is

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:06.270
actually happens is whenever the game is
 

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.380
actually happens is whenever the game is
paused it stops the music from playing

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:09.390
paused it stops the music from playing
 

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.540
paused it stops the music from playing
and then when you get back into the game

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:11.550
and then when you get back into the game
 

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.000
and then when you get back into the game
the game immediately start stuff without

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.010

the game immediately start stuff without
any music so so it's kind of it's kind

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500
any music so so it's kind of it's kind
 

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.740
any music so so it's kind of it's kind
of bad at multiple ways it's bad first

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:18.750
of bad at multiple ways it's bad first
 

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.630
of bad at multiple ways it's bad first
of all because I just I've just hit the

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640
of all because I just I've just hit the
 

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.920
of all because I just I've just hit the
home screen I'm come back and I'm

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:21.930
home screen I'm come back and I'm
 

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.270
home screen I'm come back and I'm
immediately dead because the game is

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280
immediately dead because the game is
 

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.160
immediately dead because the game is
continuing to play the second thing is

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.170
continuing to play the second thing is
 

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.600
continuing to play the second thing is
if you pause the game and unpause that

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:26.610
if you pause the game and unpause that
 

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.460

the music comes back so if the game
 

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.880
the music comes back so if the game
simply paused gameplay when it went when

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:31.890
simply paused gameplay when it went when
 

00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:33.530
simply paused gameplay when it went when
it when it you would would no longer

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540
it when it you would would no longer
 

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.090
it when it you would would no longer
visible it would actually solve all

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:35.100
visible it would actually solve all
 

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.500
visible it would actually solve all
these problems and it would be you and

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:36.510
these problems and it would be you and
 

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.180
these problems and it would be you and
it would almost be correct so that's one

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:38.190
it would almost be correct so that's one
 

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.290
it would almost be correct so that's one
thing the second thing is how it uses

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:39.300
thing the second thing is how it uses
 

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.610
thing the second thing is how it uses
the back key is kind of interesting to

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:40.620
the back key is kind of interesting to
 

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.500
the back key is kind of interesting to

we like it if the back key doesn't just
immediately quit and this is certainly

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:13.470
immediately quit and this is certainly
 

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.200
immediately quit and this is certainly
better than it just immediately quit and

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:15.210
better than it just immediately quit and

confusing so my feeling is it either it
 

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.830
confusing so my feeling is it either it
should be a dialogue or in this case

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:30.840
should be a dialogue or in this case
 

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.140

the last four weeks so we don't let's
 

00:41:04.119 --> 00:41:06.180
the last four weeks so we don't let's
plug my name well we'll take a look at

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:06.190
plug my name well we'll take a look at
 

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:11.160
plug my name well we'll take a look at
it alright so now i actually did not do

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.510
it alright so now i actually did not do
what i would call a thorough test on

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520
what i would call a thorough test on
 

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.420
what i would call a thorough test on
pestilence i did actually play it and

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:14.430

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960
this um so here's what it looks like on
 

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.960
this um so here's what it looks like on
a tablet now first of all you notice

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:21.970
a tablet now first of all you notice
 

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.099
a tablet now first of all you notice
that it doesn't actually size to the

00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:23.109
that it doesn't actually size to the
 

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:25.970
that it doesn't actually size to the
full screen which makes me really sad

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:25.980
full screen which makes me really sad
 

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:28.289
full screen which makes me really sad
because it would be much cooler it's

00:41:28.289 --> 00:41:28.299
because it would be much cooler it's
 

00:41:28.299 --> 00:41:30.599
because it would be much cooler it's
also you friggin hard to control this

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:30.609
also you friggin hard to control this
 

00:41:30.609 --> 00:41:33.270
also you friggin hard to control this
ball the Explorer this is level two can

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280
ball the Explorer this is level two can
 

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.950
ball the Explorer this is level two can
we switch to the tablet by the way

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960
we switch to the tablet by the way
 

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.289
we switch to the tablet by the way
someone's outside our window oh there is

00:41:37.289 --> 00:41:37.299
someone's outside our window oh there is
 

00:41:37.299 --> 00:41:38.970
someone's outside our window oh there is
yeah but they're not holding up like

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:38.980
yeah but they're not holding up like
 

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.130
yeah but they're not holding up like
signs or anything oh okay that pic

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:41.140

Damien in the mornin hahaha right oh man
 

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.289
Damien in the mornin hahaha right oh man
I just missed it so first of all this

00:41:49.289 --> 00:41:49.299
I just missed it so first of all this
 

00:41:49.299 --> 00:41:50.849
I just missed it so first of all this
game is as I said it's freaking hard

00:41:50.849 --> 00:41:50.859
game is as I said it's freaking hard
 

00:41:50.859 --> 00:41:52.260
game is as I said it's freaking hard
partially because you have to get the

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:52.270
partially because you have to get the
 

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.329
partially because you have to get the
ball up to a high enough velocity to

00:41:54.329 --> 00:41:54.339
ball up to a high enough velocity to
 

00:41:54.339 --> 00:41:56.400
ball up to a high enough velocity to
actually squash the bug that's not just

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:56.410
actually squash the bug that's not just
 

00:41:56.410 --> 00:41:57.990
actually squash the bug that's not just
a question of running over the bugs you

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000
a question of running over the bugs you
 

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.339
a question of running over the bugs you
have to run over the bugs at high speed

00:41:59.339 --> 00:41:59.349
have to run over the bugs at high speed
 

00:41:59.349 --> 00:42:00.990
have to run over the bugs at high speed
and it's pretty fast that that high

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000
and it's pretty fast that that high
 

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.319
and it's pretty fast that that high
speed is and and the maze moat is mostly

00:42:04.319 --> 00:42:04.329
speed is and and the maze moat is mostly
 

00:42:04.329 --> 00:42:05.250
speed is and and the maze moat is mostly
gets in your

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:05.260
gets in your
 

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.380
gets in your
of squashing the bugs now that's not to

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:07.390
of squashing the bugs now that's not to
 

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:10.290
of squashing the bugs now that's not to
say the game isn't fun it you know III

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:10.300
say the game isn't fun it you know III
 

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.670
say the game isn't fun it you know III
mean there and you know there are people

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680
mean there and you know there are people
 

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.020
mean there and you know there are people
who are to do just like frustration and

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:15.030
who are to do just like frustration and
 

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:17.010
who are to do just like frustration and
that was my feeling is the game

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:17.020
that was my feeling is the game
 

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.380
that was my feeling is the game
immediately was just ludicrously hard

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:19.390
immediately was just ludicrously hard
 

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:22.320
immediately was just ludicrously hard
and that might possibly be because it's

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.330
and that might possibly be because it's
 

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:24.180
and that might possibly be because it's
not you know designed around tablets or

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:24.190
not you know designed around tablets or
 

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.410
not you know designed around tablets or
something but it was just like in the

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:25.420
something but it was just like in the
 

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.270
something but it was just like in the
game and the same is the game is really

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280
game and the same is the game is really
 

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.680
game and the same is the game is really
polished like it's actually really

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:28.690
polished like it's actually really
 

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:30.630
polished like it's actually really
beautifully done mm-hmm other than I

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640
beautifully done mm-hmm other than I
 

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.630
beautifully done mm-hmm other than I
really wanted to fill the screen and

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640
really wanted to fill the screen and
 

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.770
really wanted to fill the screen and
yeah wonder why they don't fill this

00:42:34.770 --> 00:42:34.780
yeah wonder why they don't fill this
 

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.660
yeah wonder why they don't fill this
brand look weird i don't know i don't

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:36.670
brand look weird i don't know i don't
 

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:39.780
brand look weird i don't know i don't
know i'm really curious as to what they

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:39.790
know i'm really curious as to what they
 

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.330
know i'm really curious as to what they
were thinking but um but yeah it's

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:42.340
were thinking but um but yeah it's
 

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.360
were thinking but um but yeah it's
definitely it's definitely pretty cool

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:45.370
definitely it's definitely pretty cool
 

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.910
definitely it's definitely pretty cool
and it's you know if you want a really

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920
and it's you know if you want a really
 

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:49.500
and it's you know if you want a really
frustrating or if you just like really

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:49.510
frustrating or if you just like really
 

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:53.340
frustrating or if you just like really
hard games uh it's definitely uh oh okay

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:53.350
hard games uh it's definitely uh oh okay
 

00:42:53.350 --> 00:43:00.120
hard games uh it's definitely uh oh okay
yes haha but any case yeah elation uh so

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:00.130
yes haha but any case yeah elation uh so
 

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:02.160
yes haha but any case yeah elation uh so
uh so yeah it's definitely it's

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:02.170
uh so yeah it's definitely it's
 

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:03.840
uh so yeah it's definitely it's
definitely challenging I think that I

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:03.850
definitely challenging I think that I
 

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.270
definitely challenging I think that I
would probably probably tweak it a

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280
would probably probably tweak it a
 

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.830
would probably probably tweak it a
little bit so that it will didn't

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:07.840
little bit so that it will didn't
 

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.170
little bit so that it will didn't
require such enormous amount of velocity

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:10.180
require such enormous amount of velocity
 

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:14.040
require such enormous amount of velocity

maybe you have levels like where you

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:15.250
maybe you have levels like where you
 

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.310
maybe you have levels like where you
need to have like I can I can easy level

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:17.320
need to have like I can I can easy level
 

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.020
need to have like I can I can easy level
where you can squash the bugs I pretty

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.030
where you can squash the bugs I pretty
 

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.430
where you can squash the bugs I pretty
much rolling the ball over it versus a

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:20.440
much rolling the ball over it versus a
 

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.870
much rolling the ball over it versus a
harder level where you can squash the

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:21.880
harder level where you can squash the
 

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.250
harder level where you can squash the
bug wherever actually takes some

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:23.260
bug wherever actually takes some
 

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:26.220
bug wherever actually takes some
significant velocity to do that yeah you

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:26.230
significant velocity to do that yeah you
 

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.210
significant velocity to do that yeah you
know and this is something that the

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:27.220
know and this is something that the
 

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.440

see so you know there are definitely

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:26.450
see so you know there are definitely
 

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:27.910

things I think squashing bugs does not

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920
things I think squashing bugs does not
 

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.290
things I think squashing bugs does not
fall into that category i think in this

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:29.300
fall into that category i think in this
 

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.000
fall into that category i think in this
game really it is just that the game

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:31.010
game really it is just that the game
 

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:34.320
game really it is just that the game
immediately gets not impossible and and

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:34.330

so it would be great to see a little bit
 

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:39.160
so it would be great to see a little bit
more scalable difficulty on it you know

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:39.170
more scalable difficulty on it you know
 

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:41.230
more scalable difficulty on it you know
as a general rule but i think that the

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240
as a general rule but i think that the
 

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.940
as a general rule but i think that the
game is fun the game design is very very

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:42.950

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:48.050
see a little bit of ramp on it so is
 

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:49.420
see a little bit of ramp on it so is
that is that enough to say about this or

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:57.280
I think it we add if we had multiple
difficulty levels i think we'd we

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:57.290
difficulty levels i think we'd we
 

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:00.100
difficulty levels i think we'd we
totally want it even high and also

00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:00.110
totally want it even high and also
 

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.770

am totally confused as to whether this

00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780
am totally confused as to whether this
 

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.370
am totally confused as to whether this
game is now ah so that's our that's

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:19.380
game is now ah so that's our that's
 

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.530
game is now ah so that's our that's
maybe our issue with this game is that

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:21.540
maybe our issue with this game is that
 

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.240
maybe our issue with this game is that
we don't know what language it's using

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:23.250
we don't know what language it's using
 

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:26.270
we don't know what language it's using
it if it if it permits all languages

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280
it if it if it permits all languages
 

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:29.810
it if it if it permits all languages
then wow I think no I would feel about

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:29.820
then wow I think no I would feel about
 

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.260
then wow I think no I would feel about
that iona I think I'm gonna get beat by

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:33.270
that iona I think I'm gonna get beat by
 

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:35.990
that iona I think I'm gonna get beat by
some polyglot yeah that definitely dost

some polyglot yeah that definitely dost
 

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.160
some polyglot yeah that definitely dost
it definitely does give an advantage

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:37.170
it definitely does give an advantage
 

00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:38.690
it definitely does give an advantage
going out to language today that's the

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700
going out to language today that's the
 

00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:40.880
going out to language today that's the
idea or maybe we're supposed to learn

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:40.890
idea or maybe we're supposed to learn
 

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:42.260

that's like it's a really good point i
 

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.460
that's like it's a really good point i
mean i think what we've discovered over

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:10.470
mean i think what we've discovered over
 

00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:12.650
mean i think what we've discovered over
the last 10 years is that people love to

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660
the last 10 years is that people love to
 

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:15.410
the last 10 years is that people love to
play each other but the asynchronous

00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420
play each other but the asynchronous
 

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.440
play each other but the asynchronous
mode I you know where you're challenging

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:18.450
mode I you know where you're challenging
 

00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:20.300
mode I you know where you're challenging
other people is is a lot more

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:20.310
other people is is a lot more
 

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:21.860
other people is is a lot more
interesting sometimes yeah it's actually

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:21.870
interesting sometimes yeah it's actually
 

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:23.780
interesting sometimes yeah it's actually
it's actually it's a great way of adding

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:23.790
it's actually it's a great way of adding
 

00:50:23.790 --> 00:50:25.190
it's actually it's a great way of adding
my social dynamic without actually

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200
my social dynamic without actually
 

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.260
my social dynamic without actually
adding all of the super challenge

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:27.270
adding all of the super challenge
 

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:28.760
adding all of the super challenge
especially in mobile where you've got

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:28.770
especially in mobile where you've got
 

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:30.680
especially in mobile where you've got
really been latency problems of actually

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:30.690
really been latency problems of actually
 

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:32.090
really been latency problems of actually
actually directly challenging someone

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:32.100
actually directly challenging someone
 

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:33.440
actually directly challenging someone
yeah that's often very difficult unless

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:33.450
yeah that's often very difficult unless
 

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.150
yeah that's often very difficult unless
you're on a local network but here you

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160
you're on a local network but here you
 

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:36.890
you're on a local network but here you
can you can challenge someone even in a

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900
can you can challenge someone even in a
 

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.960
can you can challenge someone even in a
game that is if it's very twitchy and

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:38.970
game that is if it's very twitchy and
 

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:40.400
game that is if it's very twitchy and
have it still be a really good job I

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:40.410
have it still be a really good job I
 

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.050
have it still be a really good job I
think what we're saying is what we'd

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060
think what we're saying is what we'd
 

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.180

go on I think that's that's what comes
 

00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:52.310
go on I think that's that's what comes
to mind anyway that's the only social

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:52.320
to mind anyway that's the only social
 

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.240
to mind anyway that's the only social
network find out

00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:53.250
network find out
