00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
&gt;&gt; Role models are undoubtedly important in
the Middle East and perhaps all over the world

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.839
but I've been very privilege to listen to
one. King Abdullah- of Jordan; now what makes

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:13.830
him a role model? Well for me he speaks from
here, his heart, he communicates with conscience

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:22.880
and he's clearly a man of vision and these
two ingredients put together takes something

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:31.589
very, very exciting but at the same time appealing
and aspiring qualities this person 00:32 [inaudible].

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.500
When he speaks you feel like you know him.
There's no barriers and this is something

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.480
that's very exciting. As someone who's studied
theology and someone interested in faith and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:50.560
studied the Middle East and [inaudible] I've
always been told there's no peace in the Middle

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.920
East. Well I think that with communicating
with conscience with a leader like this coupled

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.090
with the President Obama who supports this
peace process, I think there really is hope.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:13.330
My organization [inaudible] his communications
with conscience and I think that we have one

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.330
here. [inaudible] to have a role model but
it starts here. No it needs to resonate into

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.469
every single home in the Middle East and beyond.
