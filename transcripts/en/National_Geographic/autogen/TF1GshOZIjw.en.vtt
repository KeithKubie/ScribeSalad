so there'll be six this year I don't
know if we know the exact month but

01:09:56.940 --> 01:09:56.950
know if we know the exact month but
 

01:09:56.950 --> 01:10:00.870
know if we know the exact month but
definitely 2013 and they'll be their

01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880
definitely 2013 and they'll be their
 

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.930

they're sort of darkest and biggest when
 

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.650
they're sort of darkest and biggest when
they're about 7 so maybe there's even

01:10:10.650 --> 01:10:10.660
they're about 7 so maybe there's even
 

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:13.860
they're about 7 so maybe there's even
more to go more main and more size to

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:13.870
more to go more main and more size to
 

01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:33.840

hardened now I would think so although
 

01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:46.500
hardened now I would think so although
it does look like they haven't really

know with the way that they were sort of

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:56.630
know with the way that they were sort of
 

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.240
know with the way that they were sort of
mentioning about I thought that they

01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:58.250
mentioning about I thought that they

were could the Lions injury have been

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:05.210
were could the Lions injury have been
 

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:07.830
were could the Lions injury have been
from a snake bite what had thought I

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840
from a snake bite what had thought I
 

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:11.850
from a snake bite what had thought I
actually didn't even think about that

01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:11.860
actually didn't even think about that
 

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:15.190
actually didn't even think about that
well apart from the injury on the actual

01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:15.200
well apart from the injury on the actual
 

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.250
well apart from the injury on the actual
head that I suppose could be a Fang but

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:18.260
head that I suppose could be a Fang but
 

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:20.350
head that I suppose could be a Fang but
then there would be two puncture wounds

01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360
then there would be two puncture wounds
 

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.050
then there would be two puncture wounds
and it looks like a massive puncture

01:11:23.050 --> 01:11:23.060
and it looks like a massive puncture
 

01:11:23.060 --> 01:11:24.640
and it looks like a massive puncture
wound but then again it could have

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:24.650
wound but then again it could have
 

01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:28.080
wound but then again it could have
started small and then gotten big I

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:28.090
started small and then gotten big I
 

01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:31.180
started small and then gotten big I

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:31.190
don't know he does have a few swelling
 

01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:35.700
don't know he does have a few swelling
on some joints as well I suppose if if

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:35.710
on some joints as well I suppose if if
 

01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:38.590
on some joints as well I suppose if if
he had some sort of snake bite that

01:11:38.590 --> 01:11:38.600
he had some sort of snake bite that
 

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.230
he had some sort of snake bite that
could be the case too but I don't know

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:41.240
could be the case too but I don't know
 

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.360
could be the case too but I don't know
it seems like it kind of goes through

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:43.370
it seems like it kind of goes through
 

01:11:43.370 --> 01:11:46.690
it seems like it kind of goes through
the skull just a bit or into the skull

01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:46.700
the skull just a bit or into the skull
 

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:53.200

just a bit some of you guys are
 

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:55.060
just a bit some of you guys are
wondering if a lion would die from a

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:55.070
wondering if a lion would die from a
 

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:56.860
wondering if a lion would die from a
snake bite I suppose in the same way as

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:56.870
snake bite I suppose in the same way as
 

01:11:56.870 --> 01:12:02.320
snake bite I suppose in the same way as
a human may die from a snake bite it

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:02.330
a human may die from a snake bite it
 

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:04.750
a human may die from a snake bite it

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760
doesn't happen often most of the time
 

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.770
doesn't happen often most of the time
when a when a snake bites you you can

01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:08.780
when a when a snake bites you you can
 

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:11.410
when a when a snake bites you you can
experience horrible repercussions and

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:11.420
experience horrible repercussions and
 

01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:14.820
experience horrible repercussions and
that sort of thing but death is not

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:14.830
that sort of thing but death is not
 

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:17.140
that sort of thing but death is not
usually on the cards unless it's

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:17.150
usually on the cards unless it's
 

01:12:17.150 --> 01:12:20.830

something very very venomous maybe like

01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840
something very very venomous maybe like
 

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:24.250
something very very venomous maybe like
a black mamba or a Boomslang or a vine

01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:24.260
a black mamba or a Boomslang or a vine
 

01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.320
a black mamba or a Boomslang or a vine
snake even a vine snake I don't think it

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:26.330
snake even a vine snake I don't think it
 

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:28.960
snake even a vine snake I don't think it
can actually kill you but it will the

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:28.970
can actually kill you but it will the
 

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:32.020
can actually kill you but it will the
venom there is no anti-venom for it so

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:32.030
venom there is no anti-venom for it so
 

01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:33.250

you'll just have to kind of suffer

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:33.260
you'll just have to kind of suffer
 

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:35.800
you'll just have to kind of suffer
through and I'm pretty sure that most

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:35.810
through and I'm pretty sure that most
 

01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:38.080
through and I'm pretty sure that most
other mammals will also feel the same

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:38.090
other mammals will also feel the same
 

01:12:38.090 --> 01:12:40.840
other mammals will also feel the same
sort of effects

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:40.850
sort of effects
 

01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:43.660
sort of effects
but the benefit that us humans have is

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:43.670
but the benefit that us humans have is
 

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:46.240
but the benefit that us humans have is
having access to medical care and of

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:46.250
having access to medical care and of
 

01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:49.380

something that these animals don't have
 

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.260
something that these animals don't have
and the other thing is we have people

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:53.270
and the other thing is we have people
 

01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:57.120
and the other thing is we have people
who bring us food take us to hospital

exactly what we're seeing here you're
 

01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:12.190
exactly what we're seeing here you're
gonna get some guidance from your your

01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:12.200
gonna get some guidance from your your
 

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.010
gonna get some guidance from your your
kind of group members in this case his

01:13:15.010 --> 01:13:15.020
kind of group members in this case his
 

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:17.710
kind of group members in this case his
coalition and then apart from that

01:13:17.710 --> 01:13:17.720
coalition and then apart from that
 

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:20.890
coalition and then apart from that
there's not much else he can do he can

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:20.900
there's not much else he can do he can
 

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:24.310
there's not much else he can do he can
take down a kill but I don't know if

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320
take down a kill but I don't know if
 

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:28.360
take down a kill but I don't know if
he'd drag it to the brother he did lead

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:28.370
he'd drag it to the brother he did lead
 

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:31.300
he'd drag it to the brother he did lead
him to some water early on the waters

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:31.310
him to some water early on the waters
 

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:35.260

just actually ahead of us in this little

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:35.270
just actually ahead of us in this little
 

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:41.230
just actually ahead of us in this little
little patch right so he let his brother

01:13:41.230 --> 01:13:41.240
little patch right so he let his brother
 

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.710
little patch right so he let his brother
to some water but like I said I think

01:13:44.710 --> 01:13:44.720
to some water but like I said I think
 

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:45.910
to some water but like I said I think
that's the best that can be done it's

01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920
that's the best that can be done it's
 

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.820
that's the best that can be done it's
not like he can get get his brother to

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:48.830
not like he can get get his brother to
 

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:51.670
not like he can get get his brother to
kind of bandage up or something like

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:51.680
kind of bandage up or something like
 

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.840
kind of bandage up or something like
that so I hope he does get better and I

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:55.850
that so I hope he does get better and I
 

01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:57.880
that so I hope he does get better and I
really hope it's not a snake bite at all
