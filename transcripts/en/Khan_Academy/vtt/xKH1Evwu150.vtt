00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.690
 

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.170
MacDonald had a farm with a
certain number of orange trees.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.620
He had to cut down 5 trees
to control the insects.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.690
Each of the remaining
trees produced 210 oranges,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.250
producing a total harvest
of 41,790 oranges.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.340
How many trees did MacDonald's
farm have initially?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.630
Let's let t equal what
they're asking is for.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.960
So this is the number
of trees initially.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.670
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.390
So he starts off with
t trees, but then they

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.980
tell us that he has to cut down
5 trees to control the insects.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.090
So how many trees would
he have after that?

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.650
Well, he started with t,
and he had to cut down 5,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.880
so he's going to have
t minus 5 trees now.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.660
Now, they tell us that each of
the remaining trees-- and we

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.780
know there are t minus 5
remaining trees-- produced

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.220
210 oranges.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.040
So each of these t
minus 5 trees are

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.920
going to produce 210 oranges.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.350
So this is the number of
oranges that t minus 5 trees

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.420
are going to produce.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.040
This is the number of trees
times the oranges per tree.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.170
So this is the total
number of oranges

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.660
produced after
cutting the 5 trees.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.420
And then they tell
us that this ends up

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.110
being a total harvest of 41,790.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.130
So this is equal to 41,790.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.570
So we've set up our equation.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.450
Now we just have to solve
for t, the number of trees

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.964
that MacDonald initially had.

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:38.380
So the first thing
I would do here

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.905
is, well, I'm multiplying
this expression by 210.

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:45.212
Well, why don't I just divide
both sides of this by 210?

00:01:45.212 --> 00:01:46.920
There's many ways that
you could do this.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.089
You could distribute the 210
and go in another direction.

00:01:50.089 --> 00:01:51.630
Actually, I will do
it both ways just

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.940
to show that you
could do it both ways.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:00.280
So the first way, I'm going
to divide both sides by 210.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.215
The left-hand side
simplifies to t minus 5.

00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:06.780
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.900
The right-hand side--
let's see, what

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.275
is 4,000-- I'm going to do
some long division here.

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:21.390
I'll do it on the side,
so 41,790 divided by 210.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.010
Let's see, 210
does not go into 4.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.530
It does not going into 41.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.220
It goes into 417 one
time, because two times

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.530
would be 420-- one time.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.340
1 times 210 is 210.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.640
You subtract.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.190
You get 207, and then
you bring down the 9.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.180
How many times does
210 go into 2,079?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.750
It looks like it would go
into it not quite 10 times.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.030
It looks like it would
go into it nine times.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.170
9 times 210 is going
to be-- let's see.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.510
9 times 0 is 0.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.100
9 times 1 is 9.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.940
9 times 2 is 18.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.420
And then we subtract again.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.710
9 minus 0 is 9.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.310
We have to regroup from
the thousands place,

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.420
so let's take 1,000 from there.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.740
Let's give that 1,000
to the hundreds place,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.550
so it becomes 10 hundreds.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.910
But then we have to take
100 from the hundreds place,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.020
so this becomes 9, and
give to the tens place.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.370
So this becomes 17 tens, or 170.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.760
So 17 minus 9 is 8.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.450
9 minus 8 is 1.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.330
So we get 189.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.615
And now we can bring
down another 0.

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:39.585
 

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.430
It's a little
off-center right now.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.820
And we already see that 210 goes
into 1,890 nine times.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.050
9 times 210 is 1,890.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.660
When we subtract, we
have no remainder.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.030
So what we get on the
right-hand side is 199.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.200
And now we just have
to add 5 to both sides.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.520
Remember, whatever we
have to do to one side,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.519
we have to do the other.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.679
Otherwise, the equality
wouldn't be equal anymore.

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.220
They were equal before adding
5, so if you want them to still

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.750
be equal, you have to do the
same thing to both sides.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.810
So the left-hand side becomes t.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.490
I'll do the t in
that purple color.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.500
And the right-hand
side becomes 204.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.810
So he started off
with 204 trees.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.100
Now, I told you there's
multiple ways to do this.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.550
Instead of dividing
both sides by 210,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.849
you could have decided
to distribute the 210.

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.640
And then you would have
ended up with-- let

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.800
me do another alternate
way of doing it.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:49.140
210 times t minus 5 times 210.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.820
Actually, let me just multiply
it out so we save some space.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:01.770
5 times 210 is 1,050-- minus
1,050 is equal to 41,790.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.720
And then you could add
1,050 to both sides.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.630
And so let me do that,
1,050 to both sides.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.150
1,050, not 150.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.870
The left-hand side, you're just
going to be left with 210t.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.460
While the right-hand
side, let's see,

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.350
you're going to
be 0 plus 0 is 0.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.120
9 plus 5 is 14.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.910
1 plus 7 is 8-- 42,840.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:45.067
And now you can divide
both sides by 210.

00:05:45.067 --> 00:05:46.650
Now we know where
this is going to go.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.740
I could do the long
division again.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.370
t is going to be equal
to 42,840 divided

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.170
210, which is equal to 204.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.631
