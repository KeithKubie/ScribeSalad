00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.930
Hey,

00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:08.780

[inaudible]

3
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.070
<v 2>uh,</v>

<v 1>checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.</v>

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.310
I am just checking in to see how your week's going.
Now see,

6
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:23.490
there's a lot of people out there in the podcasting world.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.930
They will do one podcast.
They'll fucking talk to you.

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.390
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.160
<v 1>They'll tell some fucking stories.</v>

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.070
They'll do some ad reads for old zip

11
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.420
<v 3>recruiter and they'll say goodbye.</v>

12
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.730
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.640
<v 3>And you don't hear for them.
Those motherfuckers</v>

14
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.340
for the rest of the Goddamn week.

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.030
<v 1>See those those podcasts.</v>

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.310
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.100
<v 3>They don't care about you the way I had to.</v>

18
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.160
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.950
<v 1>You see,
when we give yourself to Jesus.</v>

20
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.900
<v 1>And you understand that we're all brothers and sisters.
I don't look at y'all.</v>

22
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.010
<v 3>I don't look at Yo.</v>

23
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.140
<v 1>Not just a bunch of listeners.
I look at you like my brothers and sisters.</v>

25
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.160
Praise Jesus.

26
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.510
Praise Jesus and gave me fucking money.

27
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.140
And when it rains that and the waters come up,

28
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.630
I ain't letting you in my fucking arena.
Um,

29
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.160
I still love that.
He didn't fucking let anybody in.

30
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.200
Joel Olsteen fucking dudes a gangster,
man.
Fuck you.

31
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.120
You ain't get my blue carpet all wet.

32
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.953
<v 0>All right.</v>

33
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.760
<v 1>Jesus wants you to get wet.</v>

34
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.270
He wants you to float out into the Gulf of New Mexico.

35
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.880
<v 3>My eyes adored you.
I can't get that fucking song on in my head.
No,</v>

36
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.510
I never laid a hand down.
Would you mind?

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.350
<v 1>Don't you fucking some man fucking something in a fucking,</v>

38
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.420
something so close.
So close.

39
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.110
<v 3>Sad yet.
So far.
Oh,
I carried you fucking books to school.</v>

40
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.180
That song is so fucking sad.

41
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.680
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

42
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.210
<v 3>it's a sad song.
You know what I lived at?
I used to do,
you know something?</v>

43
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:20.070
I was on a,
I did an episode,
you know,
I got these big shows coming up.

44
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.390
F is for family.
Third season is coming up.
So I'm starting the old,

45
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.100
um,
promotion tour.
Like right now.

46
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.510
Right now I have 20 minutes between radio phones.
So I figured,
Hey,

47
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.070
you know what I mean?
I'm a guy.
I'm a guy who does a podcast.
Right?

48
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.860
It'd be nice to get 20 minutes of this podcast out of the way.

49
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:42.750
That's what I'm doing right now.
As you're sitting there going,
wow,

50
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.210
this guy bill checked in on me.
He really cares about me.

51
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.580
I'm actually right now trying to get this out of the way.
Okay?

52
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.190
If you want,
full disclosure,
all you people out there,

53
00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:55.830
all you kids out there in the Internet,
you know,

54
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.670
sniff and fucking glue and fucking trying to make water stand up after you throw

55
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.300
him.
Yeah,
I talked about that on Conan.

56
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.050
I just don't understand why everybody finds that so fucking incredible.

57
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.500
You know,
when you really think of the technology out there,

58
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.940
the fact that you can take your own fucking unmanned helicopter and fly it over

59
00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:20.480
some,
over somebody fucking yard and watch some topless chick,

60
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.880
10 in her fucking tits,
right?

61
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.450
You can do while watching that in you've in your fucking room.

62
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.710
Okay?
Beaten your fucking millennial Dick.
You know,

63
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.840
all of his teeth you would take,

64
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.630
it's something somebody flips a fucking water ball up in the air.

65
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.840
If it stands up upright.
Everybody runs out of the room.

66
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:44.950
Like they just saw a fucking,
which is incredible to me.
You know?

67
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.950
That's what's fascinating.
That's just fascinating about entertainment.

68
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.480
You're never,
you have no idea what's going to be a fucking hit and what is it?

69
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.600
Right?
Just fuck just sitting there.
You're right.
This shit.
You shoot the shit.

70
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.200
You put it out there.
You have no fucking idea.

71
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:06.010
That's why when something is a hit,
Hollywood's like,
oh my God,

72
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.360
they like vampires.

73
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.360
Fucking make 900 of those until they get sick of it.

74
00:04:11.361 --> 00:04:13.310
Then they move onto the next thing.
Like I,

75
00:04:13.311 --> 00:04:18.110
I'm kind of hoping the Superhero Shit is,
has it finally died down.

76
00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:20.720
I was driving down the street the other day,
but I do by duo.
Boop.

77
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.270
And I saw a billboard by Bata,
no pope.

78
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.330
And it said the world has enough superheroes and it just said venom.

79
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.660
And I was like,
oh my God.
Finally.

80
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.160
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

81
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.490
<v 3>they're going to make a movie about one of the bad guys.
Right.</v>

82
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.700
And I can guarantee you if this movie venom is a Fuckin hit,

83
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.050
next thing you know there's going to be Alexa.
Is it Luther?
Is it Lugar?

84
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.950
Is it Luder Lex,
the bald guy?

85
00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:51.660
Like make you know
whose whole fucking thing?

86
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.990
<v 3>Is that like he just can't,</v>

88
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:58.020
he can't stand fucking superman and his full head of hair.

89
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.520
Do you know I was talking to somebody just,
you know what it is.

90
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:01.710
It's not even a full head of hair.

91
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.070
It said he has the audacity to have that little curly cue right down the front.

92
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.710
Just mocking,
you know?

93
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:14.190
I bet Lex had a nice sense of humor at one point before he got all bitter.

94
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.540
You know,
I bet lexicon baby tell a story.

95
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.780
I bet Lex had some fucking attributes that made him special,
you know?

96
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.810
But Superman got that jet black hair done.
They,

97
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.310
<v 0>yeah,</v>

98
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.290
<v 3>it's so black.
He has blue highlights.</v>

99
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.060
<v 3>You know that is uniform.
Just sets it off.</v>

101
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.060
Which brings out his eyes.
What color are his eyes?
That's when you know you're,

102
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.620
you're like two windows superheros when you know,
like what color their eyes are.

103
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.890
First Time I opened a comic book and I saw his steel blue eyes,
I was just like,

104
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.780
oh my God,
who is this?

105
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.960
I felt like I just want to just in the ocean of ant man's eyes,

106
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.220
what do you guys think about stem cell research?

107
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.460
I don't understand why this country is okay with one con one company,

108
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.030
you know,
taking over the food supply,
poisoning it,

109
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.240
and then selling the company to another company and everybody just walks away.

110
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:24.890
Like what they did didn't just happen.

111
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.000
Like there's not fucking eight year olds walking around with full fucking

112
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.720
Baird's because of all the fucking hormones and shit that they've put in the

113
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.310
goddamn food.
I don't understand why this country is okay with that,

114
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.750
but stem cell research is like,
oh,
that's the work of the devil.

115
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.460
And then you hear all these fucking stories of people leaving the country.

116
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.140
They go out,
you know,
and they get the stem cell treatment.

117
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.680
<v 0>Okay.</v>

118
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.600
<v 3>And they come back to this country.
It's like,</v>

119
00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:56.730
I thought this guy was a mouth breathing moron.

120
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.110
I mean he just explained the theory of relativity to me.
What the fuck happened?

121
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.050
Oh,
he got stem cell research on his mouth.

122
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.520
They shot it right into the gaping hole that he used to have.

123
00:07:08.521 --> 00:07:11.190
When he would stare at you mouth agape,

124
00:07:11.191 --> 00:07:14.190
when you would flip a bottle over and it would land on upright,

125
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.970
they shot it right into,

126
00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:20.760
it was like a mist was a stem cell mist and all of a sudden his eyes lit up in

127
00:07:20.761 --> 00:07:24.360
his mouth closed and now he's a fucking smart guy.

128
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:25.830
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

129
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.981
<v 3>no,</v>

130
00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:30.570
I've heard about guitar players like their hands from years of fucking doing the

131
00:07:30.571 --> 00:07:33.690
tap on Solos trying to keep up with Eddie van Halen.
You know,

132
00:07:33.691 --> 00:07:37.350
they fucking get that thing and they come back and they have the hands of a 12

133
00:07:37.351 --> 00:07:39.510
year old,
but they,

134
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.650
they keep the experience of being on the road to devastating combination.

135
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:46.690
You would think something,
you know,
you'd never,
you know,

136
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.360
it's one of the few times it seems like you're going to have your cake and eat

137
00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:52.670
it.
I mean,
any sort of movie,

138
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.480
if I'm right in that movie script,
that guy has the hands of a 16 year old,

139
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.580
but he loses all of this fucking experience,
uh,

140
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.330
being on the road and all of a sudden he's got to go play a fucking arena and

141
00:08:04.331 --> 00:08:08.050
everybody wants to legend and he's coming out there with these young hands,

142
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.770
but he can't remember his songs.
Man.
He can't remember resolves

143
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:18.453
[inaudible]

144
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:19.480
<v 0>okay,</v>

145
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.440
<v 3>I got my fucking hands fixed,
but I can't remember how this song goes.</v>

146
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.110
I fucking don't remember this shit even though I'm the guy that fucking wrote
it.

147
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.360
You know that's a Netflix series right there.

148
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.400
Then you just see what it's like.

149
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:41.401
The Hulk Meets Eddie van Halen and that'd be fucking the end of every episode.

150
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:45.340
He walks away with this guitar,
you know,
hitchhiking.

151
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.840
Cause he got booed off the stage again because he couldn't remember how it went.

152
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:54.160
And like every fucking episode,
he remembers a little more of his catalog,

153
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.090
but he has to

154
00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:01.090
practice so much that he's fucking up his hands again and he's losing money

155
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.660
because nobody showing up.

156
00:09:02.661 --> 00:09:06.350
And now he's not going to have the money to get the stem cell research again.

157
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.710
So of course the woman that fucking spun his blood in the center fuge becomes

158
00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:17.180
his love interest.
Is Anybody writing this down?
This has to happen.
All right?

159
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:22.040
You have my permission to go into Netflix and you pitch this series.
Okay?

160
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:26.150
You want to,
you want to see a fucking streaming services,
um,
um,

161
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.770
industry person's eyes fucking light up.
You just walked in and go,

162
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.150
I've got an idea for a show.

163
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.670
It's like the incredible hulk makes Eddie van Halen and I guarantee you,

164
00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:41.150
you won't even have to get through the pitch and there's going to be a fucking,

165
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.940
they're going to slide that check across the table as they play the,
the,

166
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.750
what's that fucking song?
That quick little son they play.

167
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.450
It's almost like when you watch law and order

168
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.970
[inaudible] they're going to do that except the Netflix on.

169
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.930
It's sort of just a note,
right,
isn't it?
They just hit one note.

170
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.730
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Um,

171
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.710
<v 4>yeah.</v>

172
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.580
<v 1>Yes.
Shell.
It's,
it's like,
it's like captain America</v>

173
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.090
<v 3>meets CC Deville.
Just hear me out.
Well,</v>

174
00:10:14.091 --> 00:10:17.750
my only question would be how does he get his hair underneath that mask?

175
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.640
I mean that's,
that's what bumps for me does.
Does he slick it down?

176
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.820
Do we see some hair coming out of one of the eye holes?

177
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:27.710
I think that could be funny.
Do you guys think that could be,

178
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:28.720
I think that could be funny

179
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.630
<v 1>though.
I never laid a hand on you ma.</v>

180
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.060
What's my fucking time do I have before the next phone or I got to do bill?

181
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.840
Were you always funny as a kid tells?

182
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.840
What do you find funny today?
How do you come up with your material?

183
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.340
Do you have writers?
The pull from your real life?

184
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.900
<v 3>I just did an interview with these guys.
These guys were great,</v>

185
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:57.680
but in the end they go,
hey,
bill Cosby just got sentenced to 10 to 15 years.

186
00:10:57.681 --> 00:10:58.780
What do you think about that?
Yeah,

187
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.890
<v 1>well,
I mean,
nothing funny.
Are we going to end on this?</v>

188
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.320
<v 4>Um,
anyways.</v>

189
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:14.140
<v 1>Anyways.
I mean that's,
that's right up there with fucking,
uh,
what's his face?</v>

190
00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:16.710
The tight end from the Patriots.
Yeah,

191
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.460
just viewing somebody one way and all of a sudden you just look at him the other

192
00:11:19.461 --> 00:11:23.120
way and you're like,
Holy Shit.
And it just fucking affects the whole,

193
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:26.150
the whole way you look at their work.
Bill,
can you,

194
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:31.040
can you separate the comedy from the drugging and the raping when we return?

195
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:32.013
We've got some more.

196
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.233
<v 4>MMM.</v>

197
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:34.710
<v 1>Bill are,</v>

198
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.490
you're familiar with the Hindenburg crashed and we have audio new audio just

199
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:44.491
surfaced we find on a 78 speed LP from back then of people on the Hindenburg

200
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.030
screaming as they burned to death.
Uh,
have you heard it yet?

201
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.740
In what are your thoughts?
This,

202
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.210
tell the folks what you're going to be joking about.

203
00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.813
<v 4>MMM.</v>

204
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.550
<v 1>Um,
anyways,
let me,
let me a,
I get seven more minutes before I got to hit pause</v>

205
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:10.430
and move on to this next one.
So anyways,
this stem cell research,
you know,

206
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.640
I've got this fucked up shoulder and I just been,
you know,
fixing it old school.

207
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.910
I'm thinking maybe when I go to Eastern Europe,
you know,

208
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:21.780
when I have a day off on my tour I'm going to fucking stop in to some local

209
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:26.950
place and like Transylvania or something had my blood spun,
you know,

210
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.980
good evening by one of these fucking guys.
Right.

211
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.800
Is it true that white people in Eastern Europe have fled heads like Frankenstein

212
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.010
too?
They have like bolts coming on to the side.
Um,
I dunno.

213
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.160
They were behind the fucking iron curtain the whole time I was growing up.

214
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:44.320
So anyways,
I was talking to somebody about this shit

215
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.120
<v 4>and [inaudible]</v>

216
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:50.810
<v 1>a buddy all of a sudden like this is all the stuff that people are whispering</v>

217
00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:54.410
about right now.
Hey Buddy of mine was in Australia and he got his knees done.

218
00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.730
I,
I saw him the other day.
He was jumping higher than a fucking pogo stick.
Right?

219
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:03.040
And all this shit's getting in my head I'm going like wow.
Stems.

220
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.150
This is fucking incredible.

221
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.610
Does it have to do like a baby has to fucking die or something for them to be

222
00:13:09.611 --> 00:13:11.980
able to do it.
Is that what it is?

223
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.490
Does the rest of the world not care about dead babies?

224
00:13:16.491 --> 00:13:18.680
They just look at him like a fucking rusted out car,

225
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.290
<v 4>you know,
like a parts car cause you're,
you're,
you know,</v>

226
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:26.163
you just

227
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.620
<v 1>take it a little baby liver out of it and somehow you put,
I mean you don't bill,</v>

228
00:13:29.621 --> 00:13:33.340
it would probably help if you fucking read up on it.
They actually,

229
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.420
this guy was trying to tell me that through stem cell research they've actually

230
00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:39.430
cured male pattern baldness,

231
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:45.740
<v 3>but there's so much money in fucking people like myself throwing Rogaine on</v>

232
00:13:45.741 --> 00:13:48.580
their head,
I don't do that shit.
I did at one time and I leave,

233
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.760
felt my heart speeding up.

234
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.700
Now I don't know if that was just the panic of me dealing with the fact that I

235
00:13:52.701 --> 00:13:55.490
was going bald or if it's actually a side effect.

236
00:13:55.491 --> 00:14:00.200
So allegedly my heart rate went up.
I have,
you know,
if it was,

237
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.560
I can't remember what the fuck was.
This was back in the two thousands

238
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.823
<v 1>in the year,</v>

239
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.620
2000 pounds in the year 2000

240
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.033
<v 4>mmm.</v>

241
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.210
<v 3>And P be fucking hilarious.</v>

242
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.750
Do you understand how funny it would be if they actually had a cure for fucking

243
00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:20.584
baldness,

244
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.580
but they're just making so much money on the snake oil that they don't let it

245
00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:27.780
come out.
I was joking last night with some buddies of mine going,

246
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.790
do you realize that that that would be like,

247
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.230
like Rogaine and all of those guys are kind of like big,
big oil companies.

248
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:40.510
And then the cure for baldness would be like electric cars or solar,
you know,

249
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.420
and I gotta be honest with you,
I don't think that's the cure for like fucking

250
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:46.780
<v 0>yeah,</v>

251
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.160
<v 3>the environment.
Cause you know,</v>

252
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.220
goddamn well all the raw materials and when you throw out your old solar panels

253
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.710
<v 1>or the,
your fucking Tesla ends up in the fucking ocean,</v>

254
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:57.620
that giant fucking battery,
God knows what it's gonna do.
The environment.

255
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.070
But I'll tell you right now that will,
that would be the end to isis.

256
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.330
That would be the end of so many of these fucking terrorists groups.

257
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.450
How are they funded?
They're funded with oil money,
you know,

258
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:16.290
so if both pollute the environment,
but only one if I'm finances,

259
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.180
the fucking cops were fighting.

260
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.050
Why don't we just switch over?
You know,

261
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:28.640
if every stadium in the NFL could go from natural grass,

262
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:34.150
most of them I should say over the astroturf and then convert to sort of astro

263
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.310
turf with old rubber tires in there.

264
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.880
If you could watch the NFL,

265
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:47.070
that billion dollar fucking industry industry changed three times in your

266
00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:48.210
fucking lifetime.

267
00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.150
Why is it that we can't switch over to,

268
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.930
we should be having solar power with full heads of fucking hair,

269
00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.650
you know,
and then we'd be,
then we,
I think,

270
00:16:02.651 --> 00:16:07.651
I think I just solved the entire Middle East problem in about 90 seconds.

271
00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:15.300
You see that?
Do you see what happens
when,
when,
when,

272
00:16:15.301 --> 00:16:20.301
when you're sitting by yourself and there's nobody to question your thoughts or

273
00:16:20.701 --> 00:16:24.450
debate you on any of your points?
Do you see how quickly

274
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.480
you are able to fucking solve problems?
And what do you mean this?

275
00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:34.400
I just got a text message saying he didn't fucking call anybody.
Yeah.
You didn't,

276
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.450
you missed one of your folders.
I called

277
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.950
the six 45

278
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:46.973
<v 0>and</v>

279
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.470
<v 1>the fucking</v>

280
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:54.860
7:00 AM fucking cunts.

281
00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.630
I gotta put this on speaker here.
Whoa.
Hold on a second.
Hang on a second.
People,

282
00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:06.940
according to my email,
I don't have another phone call until 7:30 AM

283
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:09.363
<v 0>period.</v>

284
00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.220
<v 1>You gotta go with a period when,
when you do something like that,
you know,</v>

285
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.760
cause it's polite,
but it's Kurt and then there'll be paranoid.
Like,

286
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.600
is he mad at me?
What is his tone?
And then they back off and then they go,
oh,

287
00:17:22.601 --> 00:17:25.390
I'm sorry,
my mistake.
Even if it was my mistake,

288
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:29.410
they actually take responsibility.
And that's how,

289
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.750
as a person that stands on a stage and performs,

290
00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.860
that's how your ego slowly goes out of control,
you know?

291
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.780
And you see examples of it.

292
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.490
It would be like seeing another standup comedian talking about what other

293
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.790
standup comedians should or shouldn't be talking about on stage.

294
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.890
<v 5>It'd be like,
if that happened.
Um,</v>

295
00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.000
<v 1>yeah,
as far as I know.
The next one I'm calling our backs in O'brien,</v>

296
00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.930
BA and O'Brien in east Longmeadow,
Massachusetts.

297
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:04.570
And this is gonna hype.

298
00:18:04.571 --> 00:18:09.400
My show in Springfield on October 4th at the mass mutual.

299
00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.320
<v 5>I can't wait to do that Gig,
man.</v>

300
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:20.040
You got to understand like how many gigs I did in western Massachusetts that did

301
00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:23.620
not go well.
I've told this story.
I went out to exit too.

302
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.020
<v 1>I got off in Lee,
Massachusetts.
I stood on stage in a restaurant.</v>

303
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:31.640
I had a dinner roll thrown at me like fucking Nolan Ryan fucking through it.

304
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.020
Thank God it missed me.

305
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.170
Jesus Christ sounded like a fucking gunshot when it hit the back of the behind

306
00:18:36.171 --> 00:18:39.140
the wall behind me.
I Dunno if it was a stale role or what,

307
00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:40.910
but I'll tell you right now,
I'm still shaking.

308
00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.813
<v 5>You know.</v>

309
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.470
Oh Jesus.

310
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.100
<v 1>Oh,
there's a text message.
See,
I told you the period always works.</v>

311
00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.090
I shit.
I fucked up.
Got My time zones mixed.
Mixed up.
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:00.091 --> 00:19:03.060
See how that works.
Let me,
I'm gonna read this back to you and said,

313
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:07.080
I called the six 45 and the 7:00 AM period according to my email.

314
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:12.000
I don't have another phone call until 7:30 AM period.
And You keep it like that.

315
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.630
No question marks.
No.

316
00:19:15.631 --> 00:19:18.690
Is that cool or is it me?

317
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.610
You just fact period.
Fact period.
Send

318
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:30.190
skip the seven 31 I'll reschedule it.
Oh,
look at this.

319
00:19:30.191 --> 00:19:32.420
I'm going to get to knock out my whole podcast,
Ma,

320
00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.740
don't ya
though?

321
00:19:38.741 --> 00:19:40.930
I didn't fuck up my radio tour.

322
00:19:40.931 --> 00:19:45.910
Somebody was waiting for role.
Freckles.
The fucking collar man.

323
00:19:45.911 --> 00:19:50.911
Talk about his fucking shit jokes there is going to be telling at the mass

324
00:19:50.951 --> 00:19:54.910
mutual fucking center in Springfield,

325
00:19:54.911 --> 00:19:58.540
Massachusetts.
They got the fucking NBA hall of fame.

326
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.910
<v 5>You know I love about that place.
You get to go in there and take fucking you.</v>

327
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.360
In the end.
They got some hoops.
He can shoot a couple of fucking hoops.

328
00:20:06.361 --> 00:20:08.880
Take a three pointer.
You know I've been to all of them.

329
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.500
They don't have a batting cage at the baseball hall of fame,
nor should they,

330
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.810
because that's,
that's the purest one.

331
00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:21.540
That is the hardest one to get into.
You know what I mean?

332
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.400
You have a better chance of banging a fucking supermodel than you do of getting

333
00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:27.570
into the fuck.
You understand that.

334
00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.350
Then getting into the fucking major league baseball hall of fame

335
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.470
<v 1>because you know,
you go to fucking New York,
you go to La,</v>

336
00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.460
you walk down the street,

337
00:20:40.461 --> 00:20:43.010
you'll see one of those supermodels walking down the street looking like a

338
00:20:43.011 --> 00:20:44.690
fucking giraffe and high heels.

339
00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.660
<v 3>Maybe you say something,
maybe you could maybe get,
throw him a line.</v>

340
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:53.580
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

341
00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.200
<v 3>Maybe you go reverse psychology.</v>

342
00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:02.710
You look at their designer bag and just as like,
is that from,
is that uh,

343
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.610
I wish I knew line of a cheap line of purses,
something,

344
00:21:06.611 --> 00:21:08.410
something that makes them question themselves.

345
00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:10.683
<v 0>You know,</v>

346
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.370
<v 3>not that I've had this experience before,</v>

347
00:21:14.371 --> 00:21:16.560
but I would think that if that is what your job is

348
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:18.800
<v 0>okay.</v>

349
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.580
<v 3>Every fucking day you just looking in the mirror and knowing you're another day</v>

350
00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.413
older.

351
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:24.460
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

352
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.140
<v 3>And that,
oh Jesus,
what am I talking about?
That's the business that I'm in.</v>

353
00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:29.503
<v 0>Do you know what I mean?</v>

354
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:35.280
<v 3>These people that come out here and they base it on their looks or get shit</v>

355
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.180
because of their looks,
you know,
everybody,
like they always look at them,

356
00:21:39.181 --> 00:21:42.060
you know,
and that they love them and then eventually they,
they,
they fucking,

357
00:21:42.061 --> 00:21:46.080
they don't like them anymore cause they're good looking and their beauty reminds

358
00:21:46.081 --> 00:21:50.400
them of the horror that they see every time they brush their own teeth.

359
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.843
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

360
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.170
<v 3>You walk into the bathroom.
Yeah.</v>

361
00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.840
Actually had somebody install a dimmer.

362
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.513
<v 0>Okay.</v>

363
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:07.340
<v 3>Yeah,
the light on like 30%.
You just come walking in,
right.</v>

364
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.340
And just out of memory,
you know,

365
00:22:11.341 --> 00:22:13.200
you're looking down because you just don't want to catch,

366
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.290
you don't want to catch what you see in the Mary.
He just looked down.

367
00:22:16.291 --> 00:22:19.260
You grab your toothbrush,
you put the toothpaste on it at some point though.

368
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:20.763
<v 0>Okay.</v>

369
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.980
<v 3>You have to look up and you have to face you.</v>

370
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.420
It's sometimes she don't like what you see.

371
00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.123
<v 0>MMM.</v>

372
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.250
<v 3>That's a tough fucking game.
You know?</v>

373
00:22:35.251 --> 00:22:36.750
It's funny about really good looking people.

374
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.970
Like they're the only people who get called out for aging.

375
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:44.240
Have you either either that or people you went to high school with?
Well,

376
00:22:44.241 --> 00:22:45.850
back to my high school reunion.
Jesus Christ.

377
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.500
Bill Bird looks like he's fucking in pappy on.

378
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.723
<v 0>MMM.</v>

379
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.040
<v 3>That'd be almost his friends for Jose.
A butterfly</v>

380
00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:00.230
<v 0>that bill,
that bill,

Mom and Mozilla</v>

381
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.660

Frigo

382
00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.280
is a butterfly in the,
in the refrigerator.

383
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.300
<v 3>Why is the butterfly the refrigerator?
This is when you learn French.</v>

384
00:23:17.301 --> 00:23:19.340
This is a kind of shit you learn how to say like shit.

385
00:23:19.341 --> 00:23:20.810
You would never say if he went to France,

386
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.130
<v 0>excuse a mom and my Zillow Eylea

388
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.470

Okay.

389
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.440
<v 3>Basically should I fucking throw the thing out?
Cause it's obviously dead</v>

390
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:45.350
kiss.
Say uhmm sorry.

391
00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.260
Like I'm not going to fuck torture you with my goddamn French.

392
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.160
I already did that to the,

393
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:54.230
to the wonderful people of France who had the fucking decency to say we're not

394
00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.270
going to accept that poisoned food from your country and unless you fucking

395
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:04.090
label it
and then the wonderful people of this country like garage,

396
00:24:04.091 --> 00:24:07.630
no Fuckin word rolling afraid.
And we'll turn the floor.
Yes.

397
00:24:07.631 --> 00:24:09.430
They talk like the devil and a heavy metal record.

398
00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.230
That's how I picture those people.

399
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.620
We're going on a complete roll or whatever.

400
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.830
Put it in your mouth and eat it.
Well,
we will stop making food.

401
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.890
Um,
I know this is fucking weird.
What do you mind for me?

402
00:24:25.891 --> 00:24:28.230
It's like fucking seven in the morning and you're supposed to be up right now.

403
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:29.820
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

404
00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.080
<v 3>This is literally like a vampire fucking getting up at noon to fucking watch the</v>

405
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:35.640
prices.
Right?
Like I should not be,

406
00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.213
<v 0>yeah.</v>

407
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.930
<v 3>Seven 50</v>

408
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:47.180
Bam by watching the prices might come up.
People.
That's fucking funny.

409
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.440
It's funny to me.
In the morning,

410
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.230
high or higher watching the games.
No

411
00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.880
one fucking drew Carey retired from the prices.
Right.

412
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.720
And they hired a vampire to host it.
You know,

413
00:25:03.721 --> 00:25:07.100
they'd have to start doing the tapings at night.
Good.
Even the

414
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.490
bell come to the prices,
right?
Oh my God.

415
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.790
I'm going to fucking pitch that to fucking Hulu.
All right.

416
00:25:14.791 --> 00:25:19.780
This is like a game show meets Bram Stoker's,
whatever the fucking,

417
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.650
I never watched any of those stupid fucking movies.

418
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.790
The last vampire movie I watched was Brad Pitt.
It fucking,

419
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.800
um,
no,
that's not true.

420
00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.670
I watched the one where the little girl was the vampire,

421
00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.090
her and her and her dad moved into the complex.

422
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.263
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

423
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.570
<v 3>that was a cool one.
That isn't true.</v>

424
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.250
I just thought I just basically caught myself in a lie,

425
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:53.483
you know?
Do you know,

426
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.130
it's been like a month since I've flown a helicopter and I just keep seeing

427
00:25:56.131 --> 00:26:00.840
these fucking magnum pis Bao,
Bao,
Bao,
Bao,
Bao,
Bao,
[inaudible] my,

428
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.010
with that fucking song goes,

429
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.670
that's one of the songs you can't hum except at the beginning band 80 knee and

430
00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.720
it just goes off.
Goes up the fucking real.
We'll bill.

431
00:26:09.721 --> 00:26:12.660
Maybe if you watched the show a little more.
Um,

432
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.930
you know,
it's fucking weird about that show.
Like,

433
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.610
oh boy.
Well,
let me get to the point.
Every time I see that fucking,

434
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.000
that beautiful MD 500

435
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.840
when he's flying that fucking helicopter,
I'm just like,
I'm like,
I'm really like,

436
00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:32.130
I'm watching that fucking show.

437
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.400
And I liked that they went old school with the helicopter,

438
00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.340
but I feel like they should've given him a new Ferrari

439
00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.980
because that's not one of the classic Ferrari's like that is not worth

440
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.760
<v 1>a lot of money,
you know?
As far as Ferrari's go,
like you could,</v>

441
00:26:47.761 --> 00:26:50.820
you could pick up one of those fucking four RVs.
Let me,
let me know.

442
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.130
Let's say it's fucking,

443
00:26:53.131 --> 00:26:56.400
look at the price of one of those fucking things right now.
What do you say?

444
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.910
They're freckles.
All right.

445
00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.540
We're looking up Tom Sell Ferrari.
They,

446
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.350
we're going to see how much you'd fucking costs magnum,

447
00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.480
not condoms.

448
00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:13.270
Magnum P I do do,
do,
do,

449
00:27:13.271 --> 00:27:17.120
do,
do better.
[inaudible] like I came from Margot's magnum Pi,

450
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.660
Ferrari.
I was the three Oh eight gts.
All right,
let's look that up.

451
00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.150
F E R r a r I

452
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:31.130
what did I just say?
Three.
Oh,

453
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.920
a g GTB and GTS.
Okay,
let's see.

454
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:42.810
Uh,
the front meter.
Oh,
you fucking Wikipedia.
Can't

455
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.120
Goddamn motherfucker.
Why does,
why is it my,

456
00:27:49.121 --> 00:27:51.800
all my fucking defaults go to those assholes.
You know what?

457
00:27:51.801 --> 00:27:54.400
Probably cause you went to it too many times.
Ah,
this douche again.

458
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.770
Wikipedia,
the bald Khan has another question for you.

459
00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.980
Tell them I'm not here to like,

460
00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.110
hey her bell could see again.
What,

461
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.150
how old is Gavin Macleod?
Ah,

462
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.360
fucking 85 alright.

463
00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:18.330
Ferrari 308 gts for sale.

464
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:23.160
Now I imagine the price went up cause magnum p coming back bowed out out I own,

465
00:28:23.161 --> 00:28:27.780
I own [inaudible] all right.
Three Oh eight gts for sale.

466
00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.940
I remember Barry Katz,
I trashed him on his own podcast.

467
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.390
He owned a half the stand ups in the fucking world money and he went out and

468
00:28:36.391 --> 00:28:41.220
bought one of these things.
Yeah.
54,000.
It's still a lot of money.

469
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.650
79,000 get the fuck Outta here.
Oh,

470
00:28:46.651 --> 00:28:50.310
that one joy.
[inaudible] Huh?
I don't know why I said her name.
I just want,

471
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.930
I just want to say her name.

472
00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.180
She was one of the coolest fucking people I've met in this business by the way.

473
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:55.980
Don't sleep on fucking joy Behar.

474
00:28:55.981 --> 00:29:00.930
I did an episode with of crashing with her and she was fucking hilarious.

475
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:03.810
All right.
Uh,
64 five.

476
00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:08.811
What about the ones from the 80s 83 is 79,000 1980 70,000 Jesus,

477
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:16.140
you know something.
When people buy Ferrari's in the supercars,

478
00:29:16.141 --> 00:29:18.330
everyone thinks it's a giant fucking waste of money,

479
00:29:18.331 --> 00:29:21.150
but you know they really retain their value.

480
00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.540
There's no way that fucking car costs that,
Ma,

481
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.140
I'm going to go out on a limb and say it didn't cost that amount of money when

482
00:29:28.141 --> 00:29:30.810
you first bought it.
It actually appreciated in value

483
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.180
after what these bankers did,

484
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:38.340
did this fucking country in 2008 this people in houses that are never going to

485
00:29:38.341 --> 00:29:41.010
appreciate in value as far as what?
They still own it on

486
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.550
<v 3>people.
I'm telling you right now,</v>

487
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.660
if you want to turn around your financial fucking situation,

488
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:52.640
you sell your house,

489
00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:57.980
you buy a Ferrari fucking JTS and you live in that mother fucker,

490
00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:03.310
eventually that car's going to be worth more money than you owe on for your

491
00:30:03.831 --> 00:30:06.410
house.
What are,
well,
you sold the fucking thing,

492
00:30:06.411 --> 00:30:08.600
but you still owe more than what it was worth.
You know what I'm saying?

493
00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:13.400
There's a balance there that needs to be dealt with.
You don't drive it anywhere.

494
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.970
You just fucking do alternate side alone,
weak fucking parking.

495
00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.260
And you just sit in it too.

496
00:30:19.261 --> 00:30:24.261
One day that fucking car is worth more than what you owe on your house,

497
00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:29.080
plus a Turkey Sandwich.
Then you sell it.
Then you walk down the street,

498
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:33.370
you get yourself a Turkey sandwich and you like,
you know what?
That's delicious.

499
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.630
And now I have nothing.

500
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:37.993
<v 6>MMM.</v>

501
00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:42.050
<v 3>What's that country where bankers get put to death if they do shit like these</v>

502
00:30:42.051 --> 00:30:44.960
fucking constant in this country.
You know,

503
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:51.790
is it Singapore?
Is it somewhere in Malaysia,
Thailand,

504
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:57.520
Laos,
Vietnam,
India,
China,

505
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:01.300
Mongolia,
Japan,
Guam,

506
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.860
<v 6>um,
DG.</v>

507
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.680
<v 3>We heard he mooned in Fiji.
We had a hot,
it was so amazing.</v>

508
00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.350
You look through the floor,
you could see the fucking ocean.

509
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:22.730
It's one of those things like if I was a woman and my husband took me to one of

510
00:31:24.241 --> 00:31:27.230
those fucking huts that sits over the ocean,
like I,

511
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:28.830
I wouldn't be able to sleep comfortably

512
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.390
because I feel like if your husband's ever gonna fucking kill you,

513
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:37.380
it's either going to be 20 years into your marriage or on the honeymoon.

514
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:43.320
So you got to get past that first hiccup and just knowing that this dude could

515
00:31:43.321 --> 00:31:46.650
kill you and then just drop you right through the fucking floor.

516
00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:53.370
You know?
Any other thing,
ladies,
if I can give you any advice,

517
00:31:53.371 --> 00:31:56.640
like you want to be in a hotel so he,
if he drops through the floor,

518
00:31:56.641 --> 00:31:59.970
you landed somebody else's room and at least he's going to get caught.
You know,

519
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:06.700
don't go to that fucking hut that's on stilts above the Goddamn Ocean.

520
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.570
Don't take a cruise,
don't go scuba diving.

521
00:32:12.571 --> 00:32:16.420
These are all fucking stories you hear.
I Dunno if they're true.

522
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:18.280
It's just people you know,

523
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:22.330
say them and then I repeat them without ever doing any research.

524
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:23.831
There was that woman,

525
00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:28.030
she went on a fucking honeymoon and somehow she got eaten by a shark or fucking

526
00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.990
like the guy shut off the oxygen tank.

527
00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.360
It was on the fucking honeymoon.

528
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.960
<v 1>This is why they should have a fucking class in high school teaching people how</v>

529
00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:49.170
to get out of a relationship.
Do you understand?

530
00:32:49.171 --> 00:32:52.920
This person was in a fucking relationship with somebody that they did not want

531
00:32:52.921 --> 00:32:56.460
to fucking be with and all they had to do is just sit down and say,
listen,

532
00:32:56.461 --> 00:33:00.060
we have to talk.
I'm not happy.
I love you,

533
00:33:00.061 --> 00:33:05.040
but I don't love you in a way that makes me want to marry you.
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.060
And that's all you have to say.

535
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.440
How long did that take to say that she's going to cry?
Be Shocked,

536
00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.560
possibly throw something at you,
call you in the face,

537
00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.550
call the police and said that you attacked her and then you go to fucking jail.

538
00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:26.670
Right.
Fucking with you.
But I'm just saying it's literally a fucking fifth.

539
00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.530
It's a 15 second statement.

540
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.930
I know it's awkward.
You don't want to fucking do it,
but just memorize it.

541
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:40.530
Just sit down and say it so you're not standing there at a fucking wedding

542
00:33:40.721 --> 00:33:42.610
going,
what the fuck am I doing?

543
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.600
And just avoiding confrontation and standing there going with this ring Iowa,

544
00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:52.510
do you flop sweat?
Fucking jackass.

545
00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:55.690
Agree to take this woman who was fucking ecstatic because she doesn't know what

546
00:33:55.691 --> 00:33:59.290
you're feeling and you're sitting there,
your head's going,
don't say it.

547
00:33:59.291 --> 00:34:03.850
Don't say it both Sadie,
you go,
ah,
I do do,
do,
do.

548
00:34:03.851 --> 00:34:06.490
And then you're like,
now how the fuck do I get out of this?

549
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.460
Now I'm going to get divorced one day maybe.

550
00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.130
And that's a combination that the fucking divorce laws is so fucking brutal

551
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:22.900
and all these strong women are out there getting fucking ridiculous amounts of

552
00:34:23.081 --> 00:34:25.660
money for child support.
He saw the whole fucking thing.

553
00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.770
So do you realize rather than just simply breaking up with the person,

554
00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.350
this fucking guy goes,
I know

555
00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:39.090
we're going to get certified to scuba dive.

556
00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.200
We're going to go underneath the ocean.

557
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:45.290
I'm going to shut up for fucking tank and went to work.

558
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:49.130
This whole fucking story of having never committed any sort of major crime.

559
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:54.050
I think I'm going to sit across from the cops and be able to hold it together

560
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.240
and get away with fucking,

561
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:59.960
I'm going to break the fifth fucking commandment and for the rest of my fucking

562
00:34:59.961 --> 00:35:00.794
life,

563
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.010
I'm never going to enjoy one day knowing

564
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.250
that I took another life.

565
00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.350
Do you know one time that I know I'm off the rails here?
I,
you know,

566
00:35:10.351 --> 00:35:11.340
one time I fucking,

567
00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:15.570
there was this rapper from Africa and he was one of those boys,

568
00:35:15.571 --> 00:35:20.250
soldiers over there that fucking gets commandeered at like nine and kills more

569
00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:24.390
people than fucking Rambo by the time he's 11.
Um,

570
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.390
he was talking when his album came out,

571
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:31.430
he was talking about,
uh,

572
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:38.040
all these rappers in America that would brag about killing somebody and he was

573
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.480
<v 3>fucking,
he said one of the coldest things,
but like so true.</v>

574
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:47.400
Well,
he was just like basically saying they were full of Shit.

575
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:53.400
He said,
when you kill somebody,
you don't brag about it.
It haunts you.

576
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:59.620
<v 1>And I was like,
oh my God,
I got to listen to this fucking guy's album.
You know?</v>

577
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.540
I mean,
how do you not fucking listen to that guy?

578
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.710
<v 3>I mean,
if you're listening to this shit,
I know what you're saying right now,</v>

579
00:36:05.711 --> 00:36:07.720
but what is the guy's name?
I don't remember,

580
00:36:07.721 --> 00:36:12.610
but I don't think there's a lot of fucking boy soldiers that turned MCS out

581
00:36:12.611 --> 00:36:13.444
there,

582
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.363
<v 6>you know?</v>

583
00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.430
<v 1>All right.
Have I talked enough?
I have to do a little bit of advertising here.</v>

584
00:36:19.431 --> 00:36:23.930
People,
I don't have the advertising yet because I'm so I had the fucking game,

585
00:36:23.931 --> 00:36:25.370
you know?
I feel that I did the upon,

586
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.400
I just did the podcasting equivalent of doing the dishes before you go to bed.

587
00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.580
I'm tell you about if you suffer from fucking depression,
not clinical,

588
00:36:36.581 --> 00:36:39.670
but just fucking low tickets going to work out for me,
man.

589
00:36:39.671 --> 00:36:42.790
If that's what your fucking brain says to you and you want to start turning it

590
00:36:42.791 --> 00:36:45.400
around,
I'll tell you something.
Nothing lifts your spirits.

591
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:46.590
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

592
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:51.590
<v 1>like fucking common downstairs in the morning and all the dishes are done or</v>

593
00:36:52.821 --> 00:36:57.000
walking across your fucking apartment and maybe you're in a fucking studio.

594
00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:02.570
Okay.
And the sinks right next to your futon.
Hey,
I've been there.
Yeah.

595
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:06.500
Knowing that Faucet keeps fucking tripping and you can't get it to shut up.

596
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.341
Shut up seats,

597
00:37:07.341 --> 00:37:12.341
put a towel in there and you just lay there thinking that you solved the problem

598
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:18.750
and then eventually the towel gets too wet and rather than hearing the sound of

599
00:37:19.431 --> 00:37:24.280
the water hitting that fucking stainless steel at then becomes the fucking towel

600
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:25.203
and you just hear.

601
00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.063
<v 6>Yup.</v>

602
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.410
<v 1>And then you start thinking,
maybe I could get certified,</v>

603
00:37:34.411 --> 00:37:36.450
just go scuba diving with my landlord

604
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:43.500
rather than call an a pla.
All right.
Um,
yeah.

605
00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:48.150
That and making,
making the bed,
make the bed before you go to work.
Come home.

606
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:48.610
Do you know something?

607
00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.400
<v 3>I don't know what it is.
You get into a bed that that's made,
it's,</v>

608
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:56.080
it's more fucking comfortable.
The sheets are all fucked up and everything.

609
00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:59.930
He just,
it's just,
it's awful.
You know what I mean?

610
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.110
It's like if you grab a newspaper off the newspaper stand and nobody's read it,

611
00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:09.010
it just,
uh,
it's just CRISPR.
The words jump out at you.

612
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.170
But if you pick one up at the bus station,
you know,

613
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:15.250
pull it off with some bumps fucking face,
which sleeping right.

614
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:20.020
It just doesn't seem the same.
And you know what,
that's one to grow on.
All right.

615
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.040
Um,
I'm gonna shut this off and then I'll fucking splice everything together and

616
00:38:24.041 --> 00:38:26.080
you'll,
you'll never know the difference.

617
00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:30.550
<v 1>All right,
this is weird.
You know,</v>

618
00:38:30.551 --> 00:38:33.290
I guess it's just pretend like I already have the advertising.
All right.
People,

619
00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:38.170
why don't we do a couple of advertising reads here.
Hey,

620
00:38:38.171 --> 00:38:41.140
what's going on?
All right.
It's Bill Barr.
I'm back.
I always have to say,
hey,

621
00:38:41.141 --> 00:38:42.340
what's going on when I'm starting,

622
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.670
I'm trying to get the fucking copy here for the,
uh,
the goddamn reads.

623
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:50.740
And of course it's not working out.
Why would it work out?

624
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:54.160
Why would anything I totally fucked up with my goddamn computer.

625
00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:58.120
The thing was filling up.
It told me it was going to be filled up.

626
00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:01.780
I fucking ignored it.
Now.
It's now,
it's completely fucking full.

627
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:05.110
And I keep trying to put them onto these little fucking lightening sticks.

628
00:39:05.111 --> 00:39:08.290
Whatever the fuck he call them east sticking the Saudi computer.

629
00:39:08.830 --> 00:39:13.220
First one worked fine.
Got All the pictures and video on it.
Second One AG.

630
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.150
Go Fuck yourself bill.
Now I got to play a game.

631
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:18.070
Now I only have it on one of these fucking sticks.

632
00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.520
They are called lightening sticks in my world.
All right,
Amigo.

633
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:25.850
Uh,
no.
That's as ami go.

634
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:27.190
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

635
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.370
<v 1>Like you know,
it's funny.
Back in the day you could read Lord and Taylor,</v>

636
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.450
Jordan Marsh.
Now everybody's gotta be so goddamn cool.

639
00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:45.790
Our Revolutionary Toilet seat replacement for your folk in age.

640
00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:49.120
Are you anal about cleanliness in the bathroom?

641
00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:53.710
Have you really ever thought about wiping with toilet paper?

642
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:59.140
Like really thought about it.
Please click for a demonstration in details.
Yeah,

643
00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:01.480
I'm going to skip that.
A wash

644
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:09.900
washing you and all the right places.
Oh,
this is the,
all that,
the thing here.

645
00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.020
So it's like a bad day.
Is that what we're talking about?

646
00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:14.680
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

647
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.490
<v 1>All right.
Let me see.
Okay.
They got this smiling guy.</v>

648
00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:23.350
Meet Amigo,
Amigo.
All my go.
All right,
let's listen to this.

649
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.433
<v 6>Oh,
see</v>

650
00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.160
<v 2>you see this.
This is the past and frankly that's toilet paper.</v>

651
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:36.280
Let me introduce you to the future.
This is Amigo,

652
00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:40.230
a new high tech toilets and it changes everything.

653
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:44.820
It's going to spray water up your ass.
First thing's first installation.

654
00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:49.970
I'm no handyman,
but it's fast and these just to,

655
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:54.730
<v 1>he's no handy man and there's a woman fucking doing it.
Yeah,
there she is.</v>

656
00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.590
<v 2>Plug it in here.
She's ready to go.</v>

657
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.010
<v 1>I can't tell if that's sexist or empowering.</v>

658
00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.350
I mean he didn't know how to do what she did,

659
00:41:06.351 --> 00:41:08.150
but she was on her knees in the bathroom.

660
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.230
<v 2>The first thing you'll notice is that the seat.</v>

661
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.690
<v 1>Oh,
for fuck sakes.
How fucking long does it have to be?
All right.</v>

662
00:41:14.691 --> 00:41:16.370
Evidently it sprays water up your ass

663
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.500
and that's the way of the future.
All right.
It just,
the water temperature,

664
00:41:25.501 --> 00:41:28.320
the position in case it's fucking,

665
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.100
it's treating your taint like it wants equal rights.
What water?

666
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.640
Water temperature position,

667
00:41:37.641 --> 00:41:41.990
pressure with movement with,
yeah.

668
00:41:41.991 --> 00:41:45.680
I guess there are different size assholes out there.
Features,
heated seat.

669
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:49.130
I'll fuck goodness sake.
Are you serious?
You see,

670
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:52.640
I'm trying to learn how to not not curse in front of my daughter for goodness

671
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:54.710
sakes.
J C F and

672
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:01.250
G.
D F C.
Um.
Alrighty.
Heated seat.

673
00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.960
A nightlight soft closing air dry,

674
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.580
remote controlled.

675
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:12.610
Deodorizer is there not enough global warming that we gotta turn this thing?

676
00:42:12.651 --> 00:42:15.620
I mean,
how about what's,
what is the carbon footprint in this fucking thing?

677
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.350
Say Goodbye to toilet paper.
Save trees.
You're saving water.
Fuck you.

678
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.353
Save saving water.

679
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:26.410
Maybe I'm save water and electricity by having a heated seat and water spring up

680
00:42:27.321 --> 00:42:31.310
your ass as opposed to a cold seat with toilet paper.

681
00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.400
You,
US alone uses 36 million rolls of toilet paper in one day.

682
00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:41.120
Clean and safe.
Automatic self cleaning on demand.

683
00:42:41.121 --> 00:42:46.010
Silver Ini sterilize.
Install yourself in just 20 minutes.

684
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:50.780
Get a hundred dollars off your,
your order when you go to all my army,

685
00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:55.910
go doc.
All my go.
Amigo,

686
00:42:56.330 --> 00:43:00.480
my amigo.com/bird that's o m I g.
O.

687
00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:06.650
Go to Amigo,
my amigo.com my Amigo,

688
00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:12.020
my amigo.com/ [inaudible] to get $100 off the future.
Seems Weird at first.

689
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:13.250
Let it be weird.
All right.

690
00:43:13.251 --> 00:43:17.630
Maybe I'm behind the Times somehow that's more environmentally friendly.

691
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:23.890
All right.
Oh,
look,
look who it is.
It's not us.
It's him.

692
00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:26.300
A,
here's a problem.

693
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:31.160
66% of men lose their hair by age 35.

694
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:35.210
Hey,
that's a sensitive subject with me.

695
00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:39.650
Thing is when you start to notice hair loss,
it's too late.

696
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:43.040
Um,
all right,
well,
I guess I don't need to pay attention for the rest of this.

697
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.280
It's easier to keep the hair you have then to replace the hair.
You've lost.
Oh,

698
00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:53.090
this is fucking genius.
We already got the ball guys dumping shit on their head.

699
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:56.930
Let's get people who have full heads of hair to get paranoid.
I love this.
Uh,

700
00:43:56.931 --> 00:43:57.890
is that hairlines

701
00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:00.390
<v 7>whoa</v>

702
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.870
<v 1>at starting to recede.
Start to move backward.
Any bald spots yet?</v>

703
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.350
How will you feel a year from now if it's business as usual up there?

704
00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.170
I thought you just said,
if you're already losing your hair,
it's too late.

705
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:14.340
Some of these kids,
the way they write their copy,
our boy,

706
00:44:14.341 --> 00:44:18.000
I'll tell you why the guys turned to weird solutions or do nothing.

707
00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.720
Well,
what the fee we get shitting on me.
Yeah.
This,
this,

708
00:44:21.721 --> 00:44:25.140
all of this copy shitting all over me.
Uh,
when they can,

709
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.010
they can turn to medicine and science.
I wanted to age naturally.

710
00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.080
Gotcha.
Uh,

711
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.740
what hymns does is connect with real doctors and medical grade solutions to

712
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:42.300
treat hair loss well known generic equivalents to name brand prescription

713
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.940

720
00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.390

725
00:45:23.331 --> 00:45:25.570

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:03.063
<v 4>MMM.</v>

767
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:07.830
<v 5>How the fuck is adding electricity to a toilet seat?
More environment and,</v>

768
00:48:07.831 --> 00:48:12.010
and fucking a water fountain up your ass more environmentally.

769
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.860
I mean that,
that right there.
That right there is,

770
00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.890
is the reason why I don't invent shit because on paper,
man,

771
00:48:17.891 --> 00:48:21.610
that don't make no fucking sense.
All right,
you guys enjoy the music.

772
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.940
There's going to be another half hour of a,
um,

773
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.710
a greatest hits Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

774
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:34.840
Um,
I'm going to be at the La Forum tomorrow night wearing a Larry Bird Jersey.

775
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:37.270
No,
I won't.
I wouldn't do that to you.
I thought about it,

776
00:48:37.271 --> 00:48:41.190
but I'm not going to do that.
Why not?
Why not make it an enjoyable experience?

777
00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.090
I'm gonna be at the La Forum tomorrow night.
Get your tickets.

778
00:48:43.091 --> 00:48:45.880
You only got one more fucking day.
Come down there and see.
Oh,
freckles.

779
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:49.780
All freckles now.
Big Old fucking place.
And I'm in Denver.

780
00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:55.800
Well Dude,
I called it the pride of Newark,
New Jersey.
Paul Versey,

781
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:01.560
Paul Versey,
owner of an absolutely beautiful,
uh,
Toyota,
Lexus,

782
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:06.840
Teddy.
Say it Lexus by Toyota.
All right,
have a great weekend.

783
00:49:06.841 --> 00:49:08.020
You can go on

784
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:09.123
<v 2>Pat</v>

785
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:04.563
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

786
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:12.850
<v 1>like a boss
that's like,
okay.</v>

787
00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:15.010
I really cry.

788
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.810
And I just think it's nice that after all these years,

789
00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:24.070
the amies finally stepped up and gave everybody else in award.

790
00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.040
Um,
Jason is,
my wife was watching that thing last night.
What a fucking

791
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.873
<v 3>shit show.</v>

792
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:39.340
<v 2>A lot.
Hey,</v>

793
00:50:39.341 --> 00:50:41.310
dapper stranger.
Need a lift.

794
00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:44.510
A drifter in the van with the kids.

795
00:50:44.890 --> 00:50:46.930
<v 3>Sure.
I don't know,
man.
I gotta tell you something.</v>

796
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:54.090
There's no way that it's worse for someone who is into watching award shows.

797
00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.110
I don't awards show to make them watch sports.

798
00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:02.130
There is no way that that's a worse experience than someone who watches sports.

799
00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:06.240
Having to sit there and watch your fucking,
the Emmy's,
you know,

800
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.830
I didn't have to sit there.
I kinda had it had to because uh,
you know,

801
00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.350
I didn't see my wife and a couple of days and she was like,

802
00:51:13.351 --> 00:51:15.300
I want to hang out with you.

803
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:20.430
And then we had to sit there and just watch these fucking things.
It just,
Ugh,

804
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.410
the actress,
it just so God damn dramatic.
Yeah.

805
00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.410
<v 2>Amy Goes to
Sarah</v>

806
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:40.130
[inaudible].
This is the first Emmy Win and sixth nomination for Sarah Paulson.

807
00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:43.700
I had one of those mouth wedding drops and now I can't feel my face.

808
00:51:43.701 --> 00:51:47.050
So this is a problem.
No,
wait,

809
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.690
it was because you thought I could that I even dared

810
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.360
<v 3>because you believed in me.
I dared to try.</v>

811
00:51:56.030 --> 00:52:00.320
I almost fucking threw up whoever the hell said that because you believed in me.

812
00:52:00.321 --> 00:52:04.040
I dared to try.
It's like you're a fucking actor.

813
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:07.760
It's a killer script.
You what?
You're going to turn it down.

814
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.640
That fucking Oj miniseries was,
was unbelievable.

815
00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.970
<v 2>Turn up the pressure pressure.
You want to turn up the pressure?</v>

816
00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:20.070
<v 3>I don't believe in me,
but because you did.
I dared,
I dared to try.</v>

817
00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:24.250
<v 0>Oh,
it was</v>

818
00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.880
<v 3>worst things I've ever heard,
you know,</v>

819
00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:32.450
other than when you call them the cable company,
if you want to get these kids,

820
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:37.050
when you get into that,
talking to a robot lady is one notch lower than that.

821
00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.730
I'm not shitting on the actor.
You know what I mean?

822
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.500
They get got it because they like that.

823
00:52:40.501 --> 00:52:43.010
That's why they give the great performances and because I'm a cunt,

824
00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.460
that's why I do stand up.
You know what I mean?

825
00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:48.180
So everybody finds a little fucking hole is supposed to crawl into,
oh my God,

826
00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:49.630
there's always easier.

827
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:53.460
These are important stories and they need to be told

828
00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.130
<v 8>stories that provoke conversation,
necessary conversation.</v>

829
00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:03.010
And it also creates privilege.
When you take women,

830
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:05.480
people of Color,
trans people,
Queer people,

831
00:53:05.481 --> 00:53:10.370
and you put them at the center of this story,
these subjects,

832
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.230
instead of the objects,

833
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:13.370
<v 3>you change the world.</v>

834
00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:16.370
<v 2>Oh,
did we found out?
I found out.</v>

835
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:22.340
<v 3>Just take your shiny thing and leave.
Just give us the keys.</v>

836
00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.710
Ugh.
Oh God.

837
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:30.210
<v 1>Because you believed in me.
I dare to try.</v>

838
00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.770
Um,
I dared to try.

839
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:35.583
<v 0>Okay.</v>

840
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.810
<v 1>The next time my wife compliments me,
I'm going to say that to her</v>

841
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.570
because she believed in me.
I dared to try.
Um,

842
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:50.850
these are stories that need to be told.
We're storytellers.

843
00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.660
It with us,
without us giving people a voice.

844
00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:04.060
You know what else?
Who's great?
You know,
as the Emmys,

845
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.630
I think the Emmy's got scared by all this shit.
They Oscar's gone,
you know,

846
00:54:08.631 --> 00:54:12.530
and what was funny is many people of color,
that one,

847
00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.870
one of the funniest shots all night long was when,
you know,
if you looked,

848
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:22.370
if they just would like do a shot behind Jimmy Kimmel and you saw the front row,

849
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:26.930
it looked like a great mix of everybody.
But when they did the,
the shot,

850
00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:31.400
when they'd come back from commercial and you saw the whole crowd,

851
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:35.630
it was like from the thousandth row up to the third row,

852
00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:36.980
it was all white.

853
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:40.263
<v 0>It was like,</v>

854
00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.610
<v 1>it looked like a foreign,
a concert for the back row.</v>

855
00:54:48.611 --> 00:54:51.760
All the way like the third rail.
But if they did it the way they shot it,

856
00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:56.920
they front end loaded like the 15 black people that were there.

857
00:54:56.921 --> 00:55:00.880
They just had them all right in front the juice box.
You would like a juice box.

858
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:03.400
There you go.
Take the whole thing.

859
00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:07.600
Some Asian people and all that,
but all the way to the back.

860
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.200
I was joking with Nia like you,
if you live in New York City,

861
00:55:11.201 --> 00:55:14.770
every once in a while you go into one of those Bodegos Etsy that deal with drugs

862
00:55:14.771 --> 00:55:18.160
that just going out of business,
a little corner stores called Bodega's.

863
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:19.360
Say it with me,

864
00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:25.760
both Degas and it looks like it's fucking stocked with food and you grab that

865
00:55:26.111 --> 00:55:28.990
one can of food and you look and it's like behind that can,

866
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:32.740
that's just completely empty.
So I did get some laughs while watching it.

867
00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.100
Jesus Christ,
the weight of every fucking thing that they say.

868
00:55:36.101 --> 00:55:36.940
It's just unbelieve.

869
00:55:36.941 --> 00:55:41.440
It's just like that inside the actor's studio when that fucking guy just sits

870
00:55:41.441 --> 00:55:46.441
there like I hope you realize the presence of greatness that we are at.

871
00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:50.710
You know,
just like Jesus Christ.
If you fucking get pretending to be a fireman,

872
00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:52.893
relax.

873
00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.430
<v 2>We've arrived at a difficult moment.
Of course.</v>

874
00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:06.300
<v 1>Um,
it was so brave.
It was such a brave performance.
You know what I mean?
There's,</v>

875
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:09.320
there's fucking people update at the end of building skyscrapers and shit.

876
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:11.550
All those guys who go up and they change.

877
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.050
You ever see those things might Mike palms literally sweat watching these
people?

878
00:56:16.051 --> 00:56:19.110
They climb all the way up those towers to change the fucking light.

879
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.800
The little light bulb at the top of the tower at the top of the fucking
building.

880
00:56:22.801 --> 00:56:24.670
So,
so plain.
See it at night.

881
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.460
And they got that part where they unhooked the safety thing.

882
00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:33.940
Free climbing is more dangerous of course.
But Osha rules do allow for it.

883
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.960
Jesus Christ it putting on 20 pounds and wearing a wig is brave.

884
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:42.460
What the fuck is that?
Huh?
You can't die acting,
can you?

885
00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:47.140
Well,
I guess you can't
that there's ways to die as an actor,
right?

886
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:50.280
The fake gun on set turns out it's got,
you know,
you put it up to your head.

887
00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.920
Does that they believe fucking bring a helicopter.
People have died on set.

888
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:57.580
So no disrespect to them.
29 minutes,

889
00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:00.640
a Yammer inbuilt Jesus fucking Christ.
You know,

890
00:57:00.641 --> 00:57:04.480
some days the podcast is hard.
Other days it's easy.

891
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:06.900
But I just wanted to say to everybody who lists,

892
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:08.810
<v 2>yeah,</v>

893
00:57:08.810 --> 00:57:12.600
<v 1>because you dare to download.
I dare to try.</v>

894
00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:02.953
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

895
00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:08.720
<v 9>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built burn.
It's the Monday morning podcasts for Monday,</v>

896
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:13.330
September 27th,
2010 and uh,

897
00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:16.490
and it is still Monday for all you fucking assholes giving me shit.

898
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.820
And I haven't,
you haven't posted a podcast.
What the fuck's going on?

899
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:24.800
It's still Monday.
It's still Monday morning.
We're out where I live.

900
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:29.330
It's not my fault.
I live.
I live at the end of the street.
You know,

901
00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:34.580
I live at the end of the fucking street when it comes to the world.

902
00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:38.870
You realize that shit other than Hawaii,
you know,

903
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.990
and maybe a Amelia Earhart's fucking great,

904
00:58:41.991 --> 00:58:46.010
great grandson of grants on at this point,
right?

905
00:58:46.011 --> 00:58:50.990
And be grandson she crashed,
made it to an island.
Fucks him
Goddamn Aborigine,

906
00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:55.790
right?
Bang to two ends up having a fucking baby.

907
00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:59.000
Some fucking group of people that we haven't figured out that they lived there

908
00:58:59.001 --> 00:59:01.580
yet so we could exploit them,
destroy their goddamn culture,

909
00:59:01.581 --> 00:59:05.900
and she put up a fucking best buy.
You know,
maybe,

910
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:07.940
maybe those are the only people who don't bitch at me.

911
00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:12.860
It is the Monday morning podcast.
It's nine 43 Monday fucking morning.
Okay,

912
00:59:12.861 --> 00:59:15.500
so there is the Monday morning podcast.
All right.
All right.

913
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:18.800
The epic fail guy who sent me the email.

914
00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.070
You want to see an epic fail?
Why don't you look up when

915
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:27.030
<v 5>you're shaving next time buddy.
All right,</v>

916
00:59:27.031 --> 00:59:30.870
I'm going to fucking mood.
I am in a mood today because my computer sucks.

917
00:59:31.590 --> 00:59:36.090
Server not found.
What does that even mean?
What the fuck?

918
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:40.200
How am I offline?
Uh,
Jesus.

919
00:59:40.201 --> 00:59:43.470
Now you guys are going to see what kind of skills I really fucking have

920
00:59:43.471 --> 00:59:47.870
considering I'm not even online right now.
They just took away my,

921
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.080
my little security blanket.
Um,
hey,
somebody sent me a,
a,

922
00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:56.910
an email talking about irony.
Um,
you know,
the Segway,

923
00:59:58.350 --> 00:59:58.591
you know,

924
00:59:58.591 --> 01:00:01.320
that little two wheeled thing where you lean forward and it goes forward and

925
01:00:01.321 --> 01:00:04.320
then you lean back and then it stops.
Just something like that.
Evidently it's,

926
01:00:04.321 --> 01:00:06.600
it's,
you know,
it's a,
you know,

927
01:00:06.601 --> 01:00:09.510
one of those devices they made because I think that they felt like people

928
01:00:09.511 --> 01:00:12.120
weren't fat enough and if there's any way,

929
01:00:12.121 --> 01:00:15.780
if we could just eliminate all walking.
Uh,
anyways,

930
01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.650
just the segway owner died,
uh,

931
01:00:19.651 --> 01:00:23.520
after falling off a river cliff riding a segway.

932
01:00:24.250 --> 01:00:25.083
<v 6>Okay.</v>

933
01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:32.680
<v 5>I know it's,
it's not a nice thing to do to laugh at someone who dies.</v>

934
01:00:32.681 --> 01:00:36.100
I know that they have family saw.
Um,
um,
you know,
well what the fuck

935
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:40.480
and just the whole name of its segue.
You know,

936
01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:44.920
the segue brought him from this life into the afterlife.
That was the segue.

937
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:49.180
Jesus Christ,
I want,
what was he thinking on that fall?

938
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.470
<v 9>Hi.
[inaudible].</v>

939
01:00:56.670 --> 01:01:01.530
Oh,
and you know,
he was wearing those fucking shoes with the tassels.
You know,

940
01:01:01.531 --> 01:01:04.980
those ones that rich people,
where are those fucking loafers?
You know,

941
01:01:04.981 --> 01:01:09.150
they always wear the loafers without the socks and they got their khaki shorts.

942
01:01:09.151 --> 01:01:13.830
And some sorta yachting Polo shirt.
I bet he was dressed like that.

943
01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:15.720
He's probably on his cell phone.

944
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:20.400
Maybe he was texting while he had another one up against his chubby rich cheek

945
01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:24.450
from all those fucking Hammes he used to eat at that long dining room table.

946
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:26.940
Yeah,
we going to take out my segue,

947
01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:29.340
go further to spin around the fucking river that we bought.

948
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:39.160
And you know what'd be fucking hilarious is if you only went over the cliff,

949
01:01:39.161 --> 01:01:42.970
I bet he had a death grip.
You ever heard of what a death grip is?
Well,

950
01:01:42.971 --> 01:01:46.980
I'm going to tell you,
even without the Internet sometimes,
uh,
when,
uh,

951
01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:47.710
when you're,
you're,

952
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:52.300
when you're in a situation where you're going to die and I think it involves

953
01:01:52.301 --> 01:01:53.134
falling,

954
01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:59.310
your body has what's known as a death grip and it's,

955
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.600
you just hang on so fucking tight.
Like I saw this one time,
it was basically,

956
01:02:04.601 --> 01:02:08.110
there was,
there was two guys flying in a plane.
Two guys flying into a plane,

957
01:02:08.111 --> 01:02:12.250
walk into a bar.
The bartender says,
Hey,
you,
you can't fucking park that in here.

958
01:02:12.251 --> 01:02:15.700
What's the deal?
Two guys are flying this fucking plane,
right?

959
01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.040
And,
uh,
the rear aft,

960
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.960
<v 5>I believe they say was a,</v>

961
01:02:21.961 --> 01:02:25.140
was making some noise and they thought it might be a little bit of jar.

962
01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.630
So the copilot goes,
I'm going to go back,

963
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:32.780
I'm going to get up and I'm going to secure the door in the after section of the

964
01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:35.610
airplane.
So the other guy says,
yeah,

965
01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:39.790
I'm gonna sit up here with my fucking seatbelt on.
You go over there and,
uh,

966
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.400
learn about air pressure.

967
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:49.470
So this fucking dude goes back and he,
and in his efforts to secure the door,

968
01:02:49.471 --> 01:02:53.040
aft of the airplane,
the Af section of the airplane,

969
01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.620
we need all of you to take yours feet,
please.

970
01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:01.650
We haven't gotten to a full stop at the jetway yet.
Shut up.
You can't.
Um,

971
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:07.320
he goes back there and
I don't know,

972
01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:10.710
he went to try to shut it and the fucking door pops open.

973
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.040
This is one of these small Cessna planes.
You know where you open the door,

974
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.880
like the stairs are on the inside of the door and you plop it down and then he

975
01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:22.050
come down.
If some horror puts a lei around your neck,
one of those planes,

976
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.950
then you go surfing and get fucking hit by a Tki or whatever,

977
01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.813
one of those planes.

978
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:32.090
So the door pops open and this guy somehow as he goes to fall out,

979
01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:36.420
he's falling out backwards.
Or maybe he grabbed the railing or whatever.

980
01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:39.270
All I know is this fucking dude

981
01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.090
went out the plane.

982
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:48.060
So the pilots up front going,
holy fuck,
my friend just died.

983
01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.710
So now he's got to land the plane,
which isn't a problem.

984
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:55.730
But the problem is is that the door was ajar.

985
01:03:55.770 --> 01:03:59.190
The door after the AF section of the airplane is now a jar and he's wondering is

986
01:03:59.191 --> 01:04:00.990
it going to drag?
Long story short,

987
01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:06.510
he fucking lands the plane and when he gets out of the plane or walks to the

988
01:04:06.511 --> 01:04:07.460
back of the plane,

989
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:14.510
he sees the copilot laying like head at the bottom of the stairs,

990
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.360
feet like still in the plane and his hands gripping the fucking skinny little

991
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:23.363
banisters.

992
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:28.080
So he tries to get this guy to let go and the guy is in like this catatonic

993
01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:31.170
state and the the fucking announcer,

994
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:35.760
the host of the show was saying it took the fucking fire department 20 minutes

995
01:04:35.761 --> 01:04:40.761
to pry this guys fingers off of the Goddamn Bannister things because he had

996
01:04:40.921 --> 01:04:42.360
what's known as a death grip.

997
01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.780
I mean do you realize just mentally where you go in that moment where your brain

998
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.200
overrides everything other than keeping your heart beating and your respiratory

999
01:04:57.511 --> 01:04:58.111
system going,

1000
01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:03.111
the only thing your brain is saying is don't fucking let go grab on.

1001
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:07.350
And that shit,
it's just,
it's not even saying,
hang on,

1002
01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.670
I think it's just white noise.
It says,
hang on,

1003
01:05:11.671 --> 01:05:13.530
you have that thought and then it's going

1004
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:18.220
nonstop until

1005
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:22.450
<v 9>you gradually come out of it and you look in intake upside down.</v>

1006
01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.490
Firefighters face.

1007
01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:29.260
That's stupid mustache and the smell of Chile cause he cooks in a firehouse

1008
01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.760
telling you it's okay to let go now.
So with that long fucking story,

1009
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.910
I bet this fat son of a bitch had a death grip on his segway,

1010
01:05:36.911 --> 01:05:38.290
went right to the bottom of the river.

1011
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.220
Ah,
Jesus Christ.

1012
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:50.690
You know what kills me is that thing was completely fucking useless.

1013
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:55.520
Completely useless.
I don't understand what,

1014
01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:57.980
what purpose it served

1015
01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.960
and that guy made,
he became a billionaire.

1016
01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:05.780
The problem was is that they were 10 grand.

1017
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:09.740
Cause you know goddamn well if those fucking things were 500 bucks,

1018
01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.720
everyone would have one like a fucking iPod.

1019
01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:14.690
We would just be going down the street

1020
01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:18.410
looking like the beginning of one of those star wars movies.

1021
01:06:18.411 --> 01:06:21.050
You know where they have all the uh,
what does that,

1022
01:06:21.051 --> 01:06:24.320
what does that computer technology that they always use that ruins every fucking

1023
01:06:24.321 --> 01:06:25.310
movie.
That's what it looked like.

1024
01:06:25.311 --> 01:06:28.250
It looked like that computer technology that I don't know the name of and I

1025
01:06:28.251 --> 01:06:30.860
can't even tell you what it is cause my fucking internet isn't working.

1026
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:35.000
So anyways,
the body of 62 year old

1027
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.930
James Helston Hazeldon and a segway personnel transporter

1028
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:47.730
were found in the river wharf.
I don't know what the fuck you said.

1029
01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:50.000
And he was pronounced dead at the same,

1030
01:06:51.350 --> 01:06:54.680
I'm sure he was with his fucking legs sticking up out of that river mud.

1031
01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.550
He might,
I bet he hit terminal velocity when in there.

1032
01:07:01.551 --> 01:07:05.120
Like a fucking meaty or there's probably some conspiracy there is trying to say.

1033
01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:08.930
It was actually a flying saucer and they just covering it up and they actually

1034
01:07:08.931 --> 01:07:11.720
killed this guy.
Um,

1035
01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:17.530
police said a witness had reported seeing a man fall Sunday over a 30 foot drop

1036
01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:23.110
into the river near Boston spa 140 miles north of London.

1037
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:28.670
The incident is not,
the bleed is not believed to be suspicious.

1038
01:07:28.671 --> 01:07:33.080
Police said is it believed to be ridiculous.
I would've loved to been there.

1039
01:07:33.081 --> 01:07:35.120
Listen to those cops making those fucking jokes.

1040
01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.990
Just the awkward silence and then somebody fucking kills it with a joke.

1041
01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:42.920
It had to be something,
uh,
that I can't think of right now.

1042
01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:46.850
You guys want to write a joke for that?
I'll read them next week.
That's your,

1043
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:50.000
that's your homework assignment.
What did the fucking London police say?

1044
01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.570
The first guy who made the joke about the segway guy who went fucking 200

1045
01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:58.250
something miles an hour into the bottom of a river bed with his own fucking

1046
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:59.930
invention.
Has that ever happened before?

1047
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:06.430
Has the weight of any great inventors invention ever just sent them I guess a

1048
01:08:09.651 --> 01:08:10.484
plane maybe.

1049
01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:11.973
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1050
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:17.090
<v 9>I mean,
that's some Frankincense Frankenstein Shit,
right?
I made you</v>

1051
01:08:18.970 --> 01:08:23.120
really isn't good.
Segues night alive.
Does anybody ever written a segway?

1052
01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:27.410
Now that I'm shitting all over.
See a,
the battery powered Segue,

1053
01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:30.500
which is stabilized by,
by gyro scopes,

1054
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:33.140
was invented by Dean Kamen,

1055
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:37.250
who founded the company in 1999 wait a minute.

1056
01:08:39.610 --> 01:08:41.200
Oh,
it's just a segue owner.

1057
01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:43.870
I thought this was the guy who fucking invented at my fault.

1058
01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:51.730
Oh,
he's just a wealthy businessman.
Jesus Christ.
Isn't that classic?

1059
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.820
Make the fucking have half the goddamn information.
Oh,

1060
01:08:54.821 --> 01:08:56.620
so it's not the guy who invented the fucking thing.

1061
01:08:56.621 --> 01:09:00.880
It's just some rich bastard who had one.
He didn't want to walk anymore.
Usually,

1062
01:09:00.881 --> 01:09:02.230
actually it looks like a hot shit,
you know,

1063
01:09:02.231 --> 01:09:04.060
like you drank some scotch and could tell the story.

1064
01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:05.953
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1065
01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:09.570
<v 9>Jesus Christ.
Now I'm starting to feel bad.
Who the fuck is Dean Cayman</v>

1066
01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:15.030
founder of the company in 1999 the unique transporter relies on electricity to

1067
01:09:15.031 --> 01:09:18.990
recharge his batteries and travels of speeds up to 12 and a half miles an hour.

1068
01:09:23.230 --> 01:09:26.350
I guess it's far more protective of the environment than other scooters and

1069
01:09:26.351 --> 01:09:29.300
automobiles.
The company says,
well Jesus Christ,

1070
01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.260
there's a big fucking red flag according to us,
our products,

1071
01:09:32.261 --> 01:09:36.700
the best claiming it's 11 times more efficient than the average American car.

1072
01:09:36.730 --> 01:09:41.460
Yeah.
And fucking 30 times slower.
You know what?

1073
01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.330
Fuck Dean Cayman.
All right.

1074
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:47.550
If you learn anything from this week's podcast fucked Dean Cayman.
All right.

1075
01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.680
So anyways,
I just got back from Nashville,

1076
01:09:49.681 --> 01:09:54.210
Tennessee and Nashville fucking Tennessee and um,

1077
01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.070
I had a great God damn time out there.

1078
01:09:56.071 --> 01:10:01.071
I saw way more people out at my shows than the last time.

1079
01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.140
Um,
so let it go has been a great thing for me.

1080
01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:06.660
So I want to thank everybody who came out cause a,

1081
01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:10.500
I have a tough time when I go down south for all you guys who ever,
you know,

1082
01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.780
send me emails going,
you know,
you know,

1083
01:10:12.781 --> 01:10:17.720
come to Mississippi to north cack a lackey.
Come on bill.

1084
01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:21.420
You know you like college football,
come on to South Carolina,

1085
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:25.080
check out damn game cocks.
Do a fuck and show problem is,

1086
01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:28.830
is I don't fucking talk like this so none of the other fuckers show up.

1087
01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:34.560
You guys don't fucking show up cause I'm not standing on stage with a camouflage

1088
01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.490
buttoned down shirt,
you know,

1089
01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.160
and a pair of murders or whatever the fuck you call them,

1090
01:10:40.161 --> 01:10:44.270
rubber boots you wear when you go out stomping around

1091
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:48.680
in the fucking mud.
I'm actually jealous of your ability to hunt.

1092
01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:52.880
Got a God damn animal.
Fix it.
No where to shoot it.
Right.

1093
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:55.640
I would do the south if you mother fuckers would show up.

1094
01:10:55.641 --> 01:10:59.930
I have a great idea for a tour.
I have a great idea for a tour.

1095
01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:01.850
All right.

1096
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:06.440
Playing different venues and involves me going to some of my favorite teams and

1097
01:11:06.441 --> 01:11:07.370
the SEC.

1098
01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:08.930
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1099
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:13.650
<v 9>For those of you who a only kind of like NFL football feel like you could become</v>

1100
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:18.000
a bigger football fan.
I'm telling you don't sleep on college football.

1101
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:23.130
Um,
it's absolute insanity.
Like at this point,

1102
01:11:23.131 --> 01:11:27.900
just about every stadium holds at least 80 to 100,000 people and it's fucking

1103
01:11:27.901 --> 01:11:30.690
packed.
Every goddamn one I have go,

1104
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:34.920
I would go see any team in the SCC except for that Mississippi one where it's

1105
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.810
80,000 people with cowbells.

1106
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:42.270
I have no desire to go into that fucking environment.

1107
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.740
I think I really,

1108
01:11:43.741 --> 01:11:47.370
I'm really not into the noisemakers that's why not work new year's eve anymore.

1109
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:52.110
You know,
all the,
all the women coming out there and the,

1110
01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:57.320
with their drunk boyfriends and they got that great Gatsby JP Morgan fucking hat

1111
01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:02.280
on,
except it's plastic.
Oh,
why would you want to,

1112
01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:02.870
I mean,

1113
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:07.870
is there anything more annoying than those little horns that people blow on new

1114
01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:10.063
years?

1115
01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:12.713
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1116
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:17.610
<v 9>do you remember Jim Carrey,
dumb and dumber and he goes,</v>

1117
01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:21.570
you want to hear the most annoying voice ever?
And that's what he sounded like.

1118
01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:24.150
And that's what it was.
So fucking funny to me because when he did that,

1119
01:12:24.630 --> 01:12:26.490
aside from the hilarious look on his face,

1120
01:12:26.491 --> 01:12:30.480
it immediately reminded me of standing on stage.
Um,

1121
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:34.890
after I've done my set and I'm counting down,
Bill might doing the countdown.

1122
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:39.480
You might do an Umi,
you mind starting your New Year that way,
standing on stage,

1123
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:41.560
go and dad.
Nah,

1124
01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.710
you know what I would,
I would mind doing that.

1125
01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:54.270
I resent this entire fucking thing.
And the worst was whenever you do the,
uh,

1126
01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:59.760
um,
when you play a shitty club that doesn't know what the fuck they're doing,

1127
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.830
the classic move that they make is they hand out the noisemakers before the

1128
01:13:04.831 --> 01:13:07.260
show.
Um,
which,
you know,

1129
01:13:07.261 --> 01:13:10.260
I don't even need to get into the details of why that's so fucking horrific.

1130
01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:15.261
But I remember a long time ago I was working Nick's comedy stop in Boston and uh

1131
01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:18.570
,

1132
01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:23.570
Wbz the local fucking station there wanted to shoot something for New Year's

1133
01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:25.560
Eve.
And we were shooting it in November.

1134
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.520
So they handed out all the noise makers before any of us went up on stage.

1135
01:13:32.011 --> 01:13:36.300
And I remember there was this comedian Chris's Edo,
and I had no idea,

1136
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.110
you know,
I was so new,
I had no idea that that was going to be a problem.

1137
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:44.820
And I just remembered when I saw the look on this seasoned headliner,

1138
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:49.560
Chrissy,
those face,
the look of panic on his face,

1139
01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.860
and he came walking into the club and the second he heard them,

1140
01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:56.280
this look I had never seen on his face because he's always,
you know,
relax dude.

1141
01:13:56.610 --> 01:13:58.560
And he's going,
what?
What do they have?

1142
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:00.330
Noisemakers who handed out the noise makers?

1143
01:14:00.331 --> 01:14:04.080
He went right up to the person who ran the shit and Kudos to him,

1144
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:08.340
got them to walk around the entire room and collect all the fucking noise makers

1145
01:14:08.341 --> 01:14:09.300
before we did the show,

1146
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:14.510
which now I realize the brilliance of that move because we were going to go on

1147
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:19.480
television and we would have bombed with what's in the background during our

1148
01:14:19.481 --> 01:14:22.990
entire fucking sets.
That was a long way to go.
But anyways,

1149
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:28.930
so what I'm saying is,
uh,
I appreciate everybody coming down.

1150
01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.650
Hang on one second.
Did I just fucking blow this whole thing?

1151
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.980
All right.
So evidently I didn't fuck it up.
I thought I'm,
I'm glad I didn't,

1152
01:14:38.981 --> 01:14:42.070
but I just saw this,
this plug was sticking way out.
Now how to fucking,

1153
01:14:42.071 --> 01:14:44.080
it'd be sticking out that far and it doesn't matter.

1154
01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:46.690
What is the purpose of having it in there.
See that,

1155
01:14:46.691 --> 01:14:51.570
look at me blaming technology rather than myself.
Um,
anyway,

1156
01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:54.760
so that wasn't new years story
shut up.

1157
01:14:54.761 --> 01:14:57.380
I'm going to pick up the ball and run with it.
So what I was talking about his,

1158
01:14:57.570 --> 01:14:59.860
his uh,
college football.
If you want to get into college football,

1159
01:14:59.861 --> 01:15:04.450
I'm telling you,
watch the SCC for my money.
That's where it's at.
I fucking,
uh,

1160
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:07.780
I love like every Goddamn team in there except for like Vanderbilt,

1161
01:15:07.781 --> 01:15:09.730
like teams that just suck every year.
But uh,

1162
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:15.250
and I was tempted when I was in Nashville to drive the two and a half hours or

1163
01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:18.850
whatever,
just to go see the first,
like I dunno,

1164
01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:22.180
halfway through the third quarter of the Tennessee game,

1165
01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:24.130
cause I've always wanted to go to a game out there.

1166
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:28.540
You know that Purina cat chow fucking looking end zone and 100,000 people going

1167
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:33.240
absolutely insane.
Um,
but,
um,
I dunno,

1168
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:33.551
I just,

1169
01:15:33.551 --> 01:15:36.400
my show is at seven and I was going to have to leave and I would have been

1170
01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:37.210
fucking hammered.

1171
01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:42.210
I know I would have drank and I would've been driving across the 44 to fucking

1172
01:15:42.281 --> 01:15:46.040
west going back to fucking Nashville.
Um,

1173
01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.850
so anyways,
uh,
let's talk a little NFL football,
shall we?

1174
01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:55.420
Um,
another awesome week of football and a,

1175
01:15:55.421 --> 01:15:57.190
this week I actually gambled a little bit.

1176
01:15:57.250 --> 01:16:00.930
I got a little running thing going with the,
another buddy of mine,

1177
01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.860
other comic buddy of mine were around were basically,

1178
01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:06.970
we're picking three games each week and you've got to bet against the spread.

1179
01:16:06.971 --> 01:16:11.650
And I went,
uh,
what did I go?
I think I went,
whoa.
I went one and two,

1180
01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:17.200
but if I teased them,
I would've won.
I think I would have,
this is what I had,

1181
01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:21.370
uh,
the team I won,
I had the bills getting 14 and a half,

1182
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.930
which I almost fucking lost.
But,
uh,
I just,
I hate the Patriots.

1183
01:16:25.931 --> 01:16:28.480
Defense is fucking horrific.
You know,

1184
01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:32.980
we let up a ton of yards against the Bengals.
We let up.
Like,

1185
01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.610
I can't remember that Jill was a jets game.
Was it 30?

1186
01:16:36.611 --> 01:16:40.720
Was it over 30 was it 38 I can't fucking remember.

1187
01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:44.200
We've got our asses kicked and fucking defense looked horrible in that game and

1188
01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.600
our deep,
we just let up 30 points to the bills.

1189
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.510
So sad to say Patriot fans,
myself included.
I see us going,

1190
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:56.380
like if this trend continues at best,

1191
01:16:56.381 --> 01:16:59.230
I think maybe we're a 917 and a,

1192
01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:03.160
I was joking with my buddy watching the patriots,
uh,

1193
01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:04.601
you know,

1194
01:17:04.601 --> 01:17:09.601
we looked like we look like a fucking like a 2001 corvette.

1195
01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.680
That's the only way to describe it.
You know what I mean?

1196
01:17:12.681 --> 01:17:16.460
Where it can still fucking go zero to 60 really fast,

1197
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:20.210
but it has a little that get,
get,
get,
get,
get,
get,
get,
get,
get fucking sound.

1198
01:17:20.211 --> 01:17:23.660
You know,
still a corvette.
But you now it's been beat on a little bit.

1199
01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:27.560
I don't know.
I don't know how to explain it.
It's just like,

1200
01:17:27.561 --> 01:17:29.570
we seem to have a lot of the tools,

1201
01:17:29.571 --> 01:17:34.010
but like we have no fucking pass rush,
great against the rubber boat.

1202
01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:39.590
And,
uh,
I don't know that one play where,

1203
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.910
I mean,
who to first of all,
who the fuck is the bill's quarterback?

1204
01:17:43.911 --> 01:17:45.500
That's what really scared me.
You know what I mean?

1205
01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.270
Some people just have a look in their face,

1206
01:17:47.271 --> 01:17:50.960
they look like a quarterback and then other people look like they work at home

1207
01:17:50.961 --> 01:17:53.600
depot and whatever the fuck that guy's name was.

1208
01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.120
Fitzgerald and I noticed guides guys,
Goddamn name.

1209
01:17:56.121 --> 01:18:00.500
I was watching it at a sports bar.
What's the first half in a,
in Nashville.

1210
01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:03.450
And they had the sound down because everyone was watching obviously the titans

1211
01:18:03.451 --> 01:18:06.560
game cause I was in Tennessee.
And um,

1212
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:11.240
I just kept looking at that guy's face in his red fucking beard.

1213
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:15.790
And I was just like,
is that Eric Hippel?
Who,

1214
01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:18.620
who the fuck is that?
And he was just,

1215
01:18:18.621 --> 01:18:22.660
he was just going right down the goddamn field against us.
So,
uh,
I dunno,

1216
01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:24.590
this is this weird part of the year where a few,

1217
01:18:24.591 --> 01:18:28.280
if you gamble because you're trying to figure out,

1218
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:34.070
you know,
what your team is,
which is really,
if you had any brains,

1219
01:18:34.071 --> 01:18:37.460
you wouldn't gamble for like the first six weeks of a season until you've got

1220
01:18:37.461 --> 01:18:42.440
some sort of consistency.
Right.
Because as much as I talk shit about the jets,

1221
01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.990
it's like they kicked the shit out of the Patriots.
He started taking,

1222
01:18:44.991 --> 01:18:47.420
well wait a minute,
maybe all this talk is for real.

1223
01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.470
But then it's like you kick the shit out of the team that,

1224
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:55.850
that gave up 30 points to the bills,
you know,

1225
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:57.230
and then you go down to the dolphins,

1226
01:18:57.310 --> 01:19:01.790
you play the dolphins and the dolphins have no fucking offense to speak of.

1227
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:05.990
And it,
you basically couldn't put them away until the final fucking 20 seconds.

1228
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:09.710
If that guy,
he had a fucking goddamn arm that would have been,
you know,

1229
01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:14.030
well no you can't say that cause I needed a two point conversion.
But,
um,

1230
01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:16.820
I dunno.
So,
okay,

1231
01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:20.810
let me finish with the bets I had then I had the fucking Lyons.

1232
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:23.900
I'm getting 13 and a half.
I lost that one.

1233
01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:29.120
And then I had the saints given three and a half.
I went against my,
uh,

1234
01:19:29.121 --> 01:19:32.900
my theory about divisional rivalries and uh,

1235
01:19:32.930 --> 01:19:34.610
I was going to bet the dolphins,

1236
01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:39.230
but I just didn't like them given three to the jets just cause the jets have a

1237
01:19:39.231 --> 01:19:41.030
great,
uh,
a great defense.

1238
01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:45.380
And I didn't like the fact that the dolphins had no offense.

1239
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:50.120
So I stayed away from that one.
And if I had to,
you know what it was,

1240
01:19:50.121 --> 01:19:53.360
I think I was leaning towards taking the jets with the points and I just

1241
01:19:53.361 --> 01:19:55.460
couldn't fucking get myself to,

1242
01:19:55.810 --> 01:19:58.790
then I'd be rooting for the jets and I just couldn't get myself to do it.

1243
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.130
So having said all that,

1244
01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:06.950
the team that I think right now looks the best to me is the Pittsburgh Steelers.

1245
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:11.670
They are three and o with the third stint,
third string quarterback.

1246
01:20:11.671 --> 01:20:14.820
And their defense looks fucking unbelievable.
And that they,

1247
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:18.060
like they say that's what wins championships.
All right.

1248
01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:19.860
And I got a couple of emails.

1249
01:20:19.861 --> 01:20:22.800
Some jets fans go and you still going to keep hating on the jets.
You know,

1250
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:27.000
typical jet fans are all excited because they're two and won three games into

1251
01:20:27.001 --> 01:20:30.210
the season.
Right?
And old fat boy wrote on that bus,

1252
01:20:30.211 --> 01:20:34.170
they're going to the Superbowl.
Um,
he says,
I know you hate the jets,

1253
01:20:34.171 --> 01:20:38.040
but are you going to let that cloud your objectivity and pick the jets to lose

1254
01:20:38.370 --> 01:20:40.530
for the next 13 weeks?
Now I'm not.

1255
01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:44.010
And yet that's actually a fair question because I hate New York teams to such a

1256
01:20:44.011 --> 01:20:48.420
level that it will cloud my objectivity.
But,
uh,
I wouldn't,
uh,

1257
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:52.710
I wouldn't get too excited there buddy.
Boy,
you guys have,
I mean,

1258
01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:56.640
the only team I think that you really played that had a serious like playoff

1259
01:20:56.730 --> 01:21:00.090
defense was the ravens and they held you to like nine points.

1260
01:21:00.091 --> 01:21:03.570
So you know,
I'm sure you're excited about beating the patriots,

1261
01:21:03.571 --> 01:21:05.640
but be honest with yourself.
True football fans.

1262
01:21:05.641 --> 01:21:08.340
The fact that the team that you kicked the shit out of just let up 30 points to

1263
01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:11.340
the Goddamn jet.
I'm bills.
I mean,
do you think jets,

1264
01:21:11.341 --> 01:21:14.790
do you guys think that you're going to do that?
I'm actually going to that game.

1265
01:21:14.791 --> 01:21:16.170
By the way,
the bills,
jets game,

1266
01:21:16.230 --> 01:21:21.120
I am going to that game because I'm doing a theater in Buffalo,
the Saturday,

1267
01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:24.000
uh,
night,
right before the game and I'm going to hang out.

1268
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:27.570
I'm going to go there and with all my heart I'm going to root against the jets

1269
01:21:27.571 --> 01:21:30.990
even though I know the bills are going to fucking lose.
Um,

1270
01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:36.010
yeah.
So anyways,
is that all boring to people who aren't in the fucking sports?

1271
01:21:36.250 --> 01:21:40.150
So I,
I still,
I would say at this point,
I would say the two top contenders,

1272
01:21:40.151 --> 01:21:43.180
I would say the Steelers too early to say the chiefs,

1273
01:21:43.181 --> 01:21:48.181
whether they're for real or not and just cause the colts seem to win 13 games

1274
01:21:48.281 --> 01:21:50.710
every year,
but they always blow it in the fucking playoffs.

1275
01:21:51.610 --> 01:21:53.350
But the best thing that jets have going for them,

1276
01:21:53.351 --> 01:21:56.620
I seriously think is the fact that Sanchez hasn't thrown an interception yet.

1277
01:21:57.010 --> 01:22:00.040
And yes,
I hope that jinx is him into throwing five next week.

1278
01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:04.690
But if he's going to play like that,
you know,
uh,
I don't know.

1279
01:22:04.691 --> 01:22:08.280
I just don't,
you're not a fucking Superbowl team.
Fuck the jets.
All right,

1280
01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:11.950
let's get to some youtube videos.
No,
you know what,
I gotta,

1281
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:16.630
I gotta tell you something that's been fucking bugging the shit out of me.
Yeah.

1282
01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:20.180
They have a friend.
You just fucking outgrow them.
You know what I mean?

1283
01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:21.543
<v 11>Okay.</v>

1284
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:26.450
<v 9>I don't even want to get into this shit.
You just fucking,
you did just,
it's like,</v>

1285
01:22:26.451 --> 01:22:29.390
you know,
you're chugging along,
you're doing your shit,

1286
01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:32.360
you'll life's go and good and their life isn't going good.

1287
01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:37.010
And then eventually what that ends up happening is all of a sudden they just

1288
01:22:37.011 --> 01:22:41.360
start making little snide remarks about your life.
You now,

1289
01:22:41.361 --> 01:22:44.190
and then he got to sit there and go,
wow,
that was fucking weird than I do.

1290
01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.400
And I'm just fucking around.
I'm sorry man,
I'm fucking,

1291
01:22:46.401 --> 01:22:49.880
they always end up apologizing.
Nah,
I'm just going through some shit,
blah,
blah,

1292
01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:53.750
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
And then it just becomes more and more and more.
I,
I,

1293
01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:57.710
you know,
I got this fucking buddy of mine and it's just like,
you know,

1294
01:22:57.711 --> 01:23:00.140
he's one of these fucking guys,
his life is all fucked up.

1295
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.780
Just think of every dumb thing that you could do,

1296
01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:07.770
every dumb thing that you could do to fuck up your life,
you know?

1297
01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:09.073
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1298
01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.310
<v 9>Smoking weed,
gambling,</v>

1299
01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:13.723
<v 6>uh,
you know,</v>

1300
01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:19.300
<v 9>being high at work,
flunking drug tests,</v>

1301
01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:24.790
losing jobs,
getting drunk,
falling down,
fucking up your face,

1302
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:29.020
that type of shit,
that type of Shit,
right?

1303
01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:33.700
One of those fucking guys calls you up with a crisis every six fucking weeks,

1304
01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.870
dude,
you'd have to believe it would ever been.
It's never their fault.

1305
01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:40.330
One of those fucking guys where it's just like,
all right,
you know,

1306
01:23:40.331 --> 01:23:42.850
you choose to live your life that way.
That's how you live your life.

1307
01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:45.400
But then they fucking come on,
they make snide remarks at you,

1308
01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:48.880
and then you want to come back and just fucking unload on him.

1309
01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:53.230
You know,
it'd be like,
dude,

1310
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:57.610
you're fucking a drug test working at a goddamn fruit stand.
You fucking loser.

1311
01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:58.450
You know,

1312
01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:02.080
why don't you come home and blow some more fucking weed smoke into your family's

1313
01:24:02.081 --> 01:24:05.470
face as you give them,
you know,
$3 for the fucking week.

1314
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:10.000
You know,
that's what you want to say,
but you don't,

1315
01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:16.060
you wait to your podcast.
Yeah man.

1316
01:24:16.061 --> 01:24:19.870
It's just like,
ah,
that's one of those,

1317
01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.390
that's one of those things you guys [inaudible] you guys have any stories like

1318
01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:24.790
that?
Cause I really don't want to talk anymore about this,
but I know you do.

1319
01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:27.280
Come on.
Some of you guys out there,
you're doing well,
right?

1320
01:24:28.270 --> 01:24:31.930
Maybe somebody you were friends with when you were both struggling with isn't

1321
01:24:31.931 --> 01:24:36.250
doing well yet.
All right.
But they're so busy focusing on,
on,

1322
01:24:36.251 --> 01:24:39.510
on what you're doing that are,
they don't need,

1323
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.380
they start giving me this roundabout shit.

1324
01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:46.140
<v 6>Oh my God,
that's fucking dude</v>

1325
01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.480
<v 9>saw my special right.
And leaves me this fucked up message.</v>

1326
01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:57.200
Right?
And then just click hangs up and I'll call him back for like,

1327
01:24:57.201 --> 01:25:01.790
you know,
10 days or whatever week or So.
Call the dude up.
I'm like,

1328
01:25:01.791 --> 01:25:04.490
listen to what the fuck was with that message.
You know,

1329
01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:09.650
it's like,
if you're not happy with you own life,
fix your life.

1330
01:25:10.370 --> 01:25:14.300
The fuck you taken it out on me for,
you know,
and then he,

1331
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:18.590
and he texted me back some bullshit about a dude.
I was just joking.

1332
01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:20.630
Don't be so insecure,
you know?

1333
01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:24.870
And it's just a really is,
is that what the fuck?

1334
01:25:25.260 --> 01:25:27.120
And then I go to column and his phone is off

1335
01:25:29.230 --> 01:25:30.063
<v 6>fucking idiot.</v>

1336
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:34.130
<v 9>Um,
insecurity of the guys.
Got To fucking smoke weed all the Goddamn time.</v>

1337
01:25:34.131 --> 01:25:37.010
Turn your life into a movie because you can't fucking deal

1338
01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:42.150
looking at the God damn ceiling.
Hey,
you fucking moron.
Anyway,

1339
01:25:42.210 --> 01:25:45.360
let's plow ahead here.
Plowing ahead.
Plowing ahead.

1340
01:25:46.230 --> 01:25:50.850
If you've got any fucking stories like that.
This is just getting negative.
Um,

1341
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:54.270
let me,
Oh,

1342
01:25:54.271 --> 01:25:58.710
do I want to fucking unload on this guy?
I want to fucking unload on this guy.

1343
01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:01.020
I really do.
And I'm going to say,

1344
01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.400
I just know I'm going to say shit and then that's just going to be the end of
it.

1345
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:08.150
And uh,
that's why I'm not,
that's why I'm just choosing my words,

1346
01:26:08.151 --> 01:26:12.620
words very carefully,
still saying things really conti.
Um,

1347
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.090
but I'm not worried about him here in this cause he's too fucking high till even

1348
01:26:17.091 --> 01:26:21.730
he doesn't even have to use a computer,
you know.
So I,

1349
01:26:21.731 --> 01:26:25.680
I basically could go off on whatever.
Send me your stories.
So Cathartic Lee,

1350
01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:30.020
I can fucking,
I in a Cathartic way,
if I'm using that word correctly,

1351
01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:33.260
I can go off on your friends rather than my own.
All right,

1352
01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:37.280
let's get into some advice.
The asset bill section of the week.
Uh,
Bill,

1353
01:26:37.281 --> 01:26:39.170
I'd appreciate it.
Uh,

1354
01:26:39.171 --> 01:26:42.440
if you could give my friend some advice concerning a girl.

1355
01:26:42.590 --> 01:26:45.590
My friend is in college and works part time at a restaurant as a waiter.

1356
01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:50.860
Within the past few weeks they hired a girl to host and bus tables on some of

1357
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:51.883
the days he works.

1358
01:26:52.270 --> 01:26:55.400
I think you going to say literally this girl was hosting and busing tables.

1359
01:26:55.401 --> 01:26:58.940
I was just like,
ah,
that's kind of nasty.
Uh,

1360
01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.700
I told you guys that story right when I was working for that restaurant that was

1361
01:27:01.701 --> 01:27:05.630
going out of business and at one point I was the grill chefs.
I don't know,

1362
01:27:05.631 --> 01:27:06.351
I told this story,

1363
01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:11.210
but I actually worked on a mesquite grill with one of those top chef hats on,

1364
01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:12.201
glassed in.

1365
01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:17.060
Like I knew what the fuck I was doing and I also bus tables and wash the dishes,

1366
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:23.060
you know,
in this like I'd cook the meal and as I was cooking it,

1367
01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:27.260
I would be watching other people trying to see if they were done eating and when

1368
01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:30.620
they were,
I would ducked down behind the grill,

1369
01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:34.670
take off the hat and my apron and underneath it I had that half a Tuxedo that

1370
01:27:34.671 --> 01:27:37.820
you were in a restaurant that tries to look like it's fancy.

1371
01:27:38.060 --> 01:27:42.650
And I would come out there,
my face red from working on the grill

1372
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:47.210
from it being so God damn hot in there.

1373
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.900
I'd bust the table and then I would go back,
throw out the food,

1374
01:27:50.901 --> 01:27:54.860
scrape off the plates and load up the load and it fucking put it in the

1375
01:27:54.861 --> 01:27:55.694
dishwasher,

1376
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.290
not wash my hands because I didn't have time because I had to run back to make

1377
01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:02.450
sure the medium rare burger didn't become medium.

1378
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:07.070
That's what I thought you were suggesting there.
Um,

1379
01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:08.960
so keep an eye on the employees.
People,

1380
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:12.350
make sure there's no double agents at the fucking restaurants you go to or you

1381
01:28:12.351 --> 01:28:16.130
do not want to eat their little tip.
All right.
All right.
Here we go.

1382
01:28:16.131 --> 01:28:20.750
Plowing ahead.
Uh,
well the hell were we,
uh,

1383
01:28:20.751 --> 01:28:21.460
they developed,

1384
01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:24.890
they quickly developed a relationship where he would hang out in her dorm

1385
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:28.670
between classes for hours at a time doing what college kids do.

1386
01:28:28.671 --> 01:28:31.830
I guess he really thought that she was the one.
Uh,

1387
01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:36.500
I tried to tell him to slow down a bit because nothing good comes from obsessing

1388
01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:41.480
in that early pre relationship period.
Anyways,

1389
01:28:41.481 --> 01:28:42.410
a week into it,

1390
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:45.830
she tells him that she's really not looking for a relationship because she

1391
01:28:45.831 --> 01:28:49.250
doesn't want to get tied in with the guy and get distracted from school.

1392
01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:53.360
They pretty much agreed to be friends with benefits in parentheses.
He says,

1393
01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:57.770
I hate that term.
Yeah,
they're going to be fuck buddies.
Um,

1394
01:28:57.800 --> 01:28:59.360
sounds reasonable to me.

1395
01:28:59.570 --> 01:29:03.300
Then I guess he overheard something during work or you had called her and this

1396
01:29:03.301 --> 01:29:07.140
other guy answered or something.
Answer the phone.
Anyway,

1397
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:11.310
he finds out that she's already going out with some other dude,

1398
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:13.740
like a full on relationship.

1399
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:17.640
So now my friend has to work with this client and try to go on like nothing

1400
01:29:17.641 --> 01:29:20.430
happened,
happened.
You know what's great,

1401
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:24.480
why my voice always cracks was cause I fucking screamed my act the night before

1402
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:26.550
actually the two nights before.

1403
01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:30.900
So he has to go around and act like nothing happened.
Uh,

1404
01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:31.980
what should he say to her?

1405
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:35.250
I feel bad for him since he would talk on and on about her,

1406
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:39.900
about this girl everyday.
I appreciate the insight bill.
If you read this.
Um,

1407
01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:44.760
all right.
Um,
all right.
What should he say to her?
Nothing.

1408
01:29:46.230 --> 01:29:48.930
He shouldn't say anything.
Uh,

1409
01:29:48.990 --> 01:29:53.340
she's a young girl who doesn't know how to get out of a relationship yet,

1410
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.970
or maybe she's afraid to be alone.
I don't know what,
but uh,

1411
01:29:56.971 --> 01:29:59.820
what he should do is,
uh,

1412
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:04.850
he should stop attempting to fucker his best move was just to be cool.

1413
01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:09.450
It's going to be hard because he likes her.
Just be like,
Hey,
what's going on?

1414
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.150
And uh,
and kind of leave it at that.
And if she comes up like,
well,

1415
01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.960
how come you're not talking to me?
No,

1416
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:20.580
there's something weird what's going on guys?
And just be like,
look,

1417
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:22.260
I'm not trying to be a jerk,

1418
01:30:22.261 --> 01:30:27.030
but I kind of got wind that year that you have a boyfriend.
And uh,
so,
you know,

1419
01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:29.100
I don't mess with girls who have boyfriends.
That's all.

1420
01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:32.660
I'm not judging you or anything,
but uh,
yeah.
So,
you know,

1421
01:30:32.730 --> 01:30:36.020
I actually Kinda liked you and uh,
when I found out you had it,

1422
01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:38.100
I guess that's the first thing you should do.
There you go.

1423
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:42.420
Putting the cart before the horse
he should find out.

1424
01:30:42.421 --> 01:30:44.490
But I really wouldn't find out from her.

1425
01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:48.060
Find out from someone who kind of knows and just be like,
she has a boyfriend.

1426
01:30:48.061 --> 01:30:49.830
Right.
And then,

1427
01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:53.550
and then when you've clarified that she has a boyfriend,

1428
01:30:53.850 --> 01:30:58.770
then just keep the conversation short a how you doing?
Blah,
blah,

1429
01:30:58.771 --> 01:30:59.604
blah.

1430
01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:04.020
And eventually when you don't try to find your friend doesn't try to fuck her

1431
01:31:04.021 --> 01:31:08.490
again or hookup or whatever,
she's going to be like a,
you know,

1432
01:31:08.491 --> 01:31:12.690
what's going on.
This things seem like it's going on with you.

1433
01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.850
Hey you hey.
You know I ain't do that shit.

1434
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:22.860
I'm trying to fill yours.
It's a matter they did everything.
All right.

1435
01:31:22.861 --> 01:31:25.590
Between like things are

1436
01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:30.240
still cool cause I just kinda noticed you just Kinda let me,

1437
01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:32.310
he said hello to me but used to stop and you know,

1438
01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:35.600
maybe can compliment they are looking at or anything.
Perfect.

1439
01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:39.810
Oh the end of that bullshit.
Right.
And just be like,
uh,

1440
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:41.881
yeah.
You know,

1441
01:31:41.881 --> 01:31:45.540
I just kind of heard through the grapevine that you have a boyfriend,

1442
01:31:45.570 --> 01:31:48.640
a serious full on relationship boyfriends.
So uh,

1443
01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:51.270
kind of threw me for a loop because you never brought it up.

1444
01:31:53.370 --> 01:31:58.350
Oh yeah.
That um,
Kay.
Ah,

1445
01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:05.480
all right.
I should have said something and right there,
you know,

1446
01:32:05.481 --> 01:32:10.481
she just trying to warm her way out of it with the long pauses between what

1447
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:15.950
she's saying.
Yeah.
That bullshit and just,

1448
01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:21.920
I just don't say anything and just look at her as she stammers her way through

1449
01:32:21.921 --> 01:32:25.790
it.
If she does,
she might be one of these people who like,

1450
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:29.540
she's probably going to just turn around and fucking walk away because a,

1451
01:32:29.541 --> 01:32:32.180
she doesn't like confrontations.
She could deal with confrontation.

1452
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:34.940
She'd get out of that fucking relationship and be like,
look,
I'm not happy.

1453
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:40.040
I'm not happy.
Okay.
I,
yeah,

1454
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:44.930
so get your books in your Letterman jacket and fucking beat it,
you know,

1455
01:32:44.931 --> 01:32:47.390
whatever the hell you got to say.
Um,
yeah,
so I,

1456
01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:51.470
did I give any advice or did I just imitate this girl that I never met?

1457
01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:55.100
That's what I would do.
I would confirm from someone who knows her really well,

1458
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:57.910
that she has a boyfriend and when she,

1459
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.550
and just be nice to her,
hey,
what's going on?

1460
01:33:01.551 --> 01:33:05.690
You don't want to create any fucking shit at work because you need the job.

1461
01:33:05.691 --> 01:33:09.230
You don't want to lose your,
your,
uh,
any money or whatever.
Look,

1462
01:33:09.231 --> 01:33:12.560
at the end of the day,
you fucking banged her.
All right?
So that's a plus.

1463
01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:15.833
<v 10>Uh,</v>

1464
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:18.270
<v 9>you know,
that's not the kind of girl you want to marry.</v>

1465
01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:23.040
Someone would be in a full on fucking relationship and would,
would,
uh,

1466
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:27.780
try to set up where you're,
you're,
you're fucking somebody else on the side.

1467
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:32.400
That's not the mother,
your kids,
you know,
I mean,
grant y'all think saving her.

1468
01:33:32.401 --> 01:33:34.890
She's young,
so she has some growing up to do.
But uh,
yeah,

1469
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.990
you don't wanna be involved in that because the next thing you know,

1470
01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:40.770
you're the guy in the fall on relationship with her and she's banging some other

1471
01:33:40.771 --> 01:33:43.140
way to run the side when she doesn't have to break up with you.

1472
01:33:43.650 --> 01:33:47.790
So I would stay away from that girl and uh,
that's it.

1473
01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:52.590
Then I would also stop fucking people where I work.
That's another thing.

1474
01:33:52.591 --> 01:33:54.180
You don't shit where you eat,
where you eat.

1475
01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:57.420
It's something you do when you're young.
You know,
you just,

1476
01:33:58.590 --> 01:34:03.510
you just fucking your vicinity and you fulfill it.
But,
uh,
yeah,

1477
01:34:03.511 --> 01:34:06.840
I would try to avoid doing that.
So that's basically my advice.

1478
01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.000
Do you want me to say it again?

1479
01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:12.330
I just keep saying the same thing over and over again in different order.

1480
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:16.560
That's a,
that's how I would handle that situation.
And,
uh,
and with that,

1481
01:34:16.561 --> 01:34:20.130
I think I'm pretty much out of information that people have given to me this

1482
01:34:20.130 --> 01:34:24.450
week.
Let me do the math here.
Had done 36 minutes.
I owe you another 14.

1483
01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:28.980
The fuck am I going to talk about?
If I could get on the Goddamn Internet,

1484
01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:32.790
I try to fucking pick some teams next week.
Who Do you guys like tonight?

1485
01:34:34.970 --> 01:34:35.611
Greenbay and the bears.

1486
01:34:35.611 --> 01:34:39.330
This is one of these classic early season match ups where you're going to get to

1487
01:34:39.331 --> 01:34:44.190
see who's for real.
You know which bears team is going to show up.

1488
01:34:44.670 --> 01:34:49.440
The one that technically lost to the lions in the first fucking week or the one

1489
01:34:49.441 --> 01:34:52.740
that manhandled the cowboys last week.
I don't know.

1490
01:34:52.741 --> 01:34:56.010
I like Mike Martz is a fucking offensive coordinator.

1491
01:34:57.860 --> 01:35:01.040
Um,
if I was a gambling man,

1492
01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.160
cause I just do bullshit,
you know,
we're basically,

1493
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:08.300
it's like a hundred bucks for the year.
Whoever has the best fucking record.

1494
01:35:08.301 --> 01:35:11.570
I know that's a pussy bed.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

1495
01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:17.480
but if I had to gamble tonight,
this might be,
I,
if I would take the home team,

1496
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.780
I would take the fucking home team on this one.
Well,

1497
01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:24.620
how the fuck can you say that bill,
without seeing the Goddamn points spread?

1498
01:35:24.621 --> 01:35:29.510
That's a great point.
That is a great fucking point.
Come on,
get me online.

1499
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:34.250
Pale his fucking money for this shit.

1500
01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:36.200
Whatever you guys want me to some youtube videos for the week.

1501
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:40.910
I got some great ones.
I have some great ones.

1502
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:42.410
Here we go,
uh,

1503
01:35:42.411 --> 01:35:47.120
African American man hoses off a white woman who called him.

1504
01:35:47.690 --> 01:35:51.860
And it's basically the n word.
All right?
You have to watch this video.

1505
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:56.060
It's fucking phenomenal.
And,
uh,
like I always say,

1506
01:35:56.061 --> 01:36:00.260
if you want to,
uh,
rather than search all of these yourself,

1507
01:36:00.290 --> 01:36:05.270
just go to the [inaudible],
podcast.com t h e m m podcast.com,

1508
01:36:05.271 --> 01:36:06.620
the Mlm,
podcast.com,

1509
01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.350
the official a fan page for the Monday morning podcasts.

1510
01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:15.170
We'll have all the youtube videos right in the fucking row.
Um,
and you can just,

1511
01:36:15.171 --> 01:36:17.660
you can just blow right through them.
All right.

1512
01:36:17.661 --> 01:36:22.400
So look up African American man hoses off a white woman who called them,
uh,

1513
01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:27.530
the n word and it's just awesome.
She's in one of those motorized,
you know,

1514
01:36:27.531 --> 01:36:32.531
those motorized carts that people who can walk but you know,

1515
01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.960
don't feel like it drive,
I don't understand them.

1516
01:36:35.961 --> 01:36:36.950
It's different than a wheelchair.

1517
01:36:36.951 --> 01:36:39.950
Wheelchair for the most part means you can't walk.

1518
01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:43.990
But those motorized carts mean,
uh,
I dunno,

1519
01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.700
I think you can't walk for long.
Yeah.

1520
01:36:46.701 --> 01:36:49.790
You can't walk for long distances and a,

1521
01:36:49.791 --> 01:36:53.450
so they are sort of drive and you have an inability to stand up on a segway and

1522
01:36:53.451 --> 01:36:55.850
you're worried that you're going to drive off a cliff and go into a fucking

1523
01:36:55.851 --> 01:36:59.730
river.
So anyways,
guys,

1524
01:37:00.170 --> 01:37:03.170
Washington is fucking 85 caprice classic I believe.

1525
01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.430
And this woman just fuck it is on the other side of the street yelling at him

1526
01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:08.510
and he just starts fucking,

1527
01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:14.840
you know what I love?
It's not that he just sort of like,
you know,

1528
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:18.200
back and forth hoses it rough.
Like he's spraying a garden,

1529
01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.090
he full on blast or in the face and just holds it there.

1530
01:37:23.091 --> 01:37:27.320
And it's really great because it's the whole,
like when black people used to,

1531
01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:28.041
you know,

1532
01:37:28.041 --> 01:37:31.490
we had to march for civil rights in the fucking evil white people would be

1533
01:37:31.491 --> 01:37:35.690
holding the hose in their face.
It's come full circle now.

1534
01:37:35.691 --> 01:37:38.690
Here we are 40 fucking years later,
50 years almost.

1535
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:43.520
And now the black dude is holding it in,
then the white person's face.
Uh,

1536
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:46.760
but it's just a garden hose.
So it's hilarious.

1537
01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:55.740
He's just spraying or just not moving.
It goes.
Say it again,
say it again,
bitch.

1538
01:37:56.150 --> 01:37:58.440
It's fucking awesome.
Ah,

1539
01:37:58.770 --> 01:38:03.420
and when she drives away in the end and is still giving them shit and she's

1540
01:38:03.421 --> 01:38:04.320
soaking wet,

1541
01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:08.680
I mean it was just one of the fucking great laughs I've had in a,

1542
01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.800
let's just one of the,
I just,
it was awesome.

1543
01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:15.990
I just fucking die laughing watching it and I'm,
all right.

1544
01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:18.120
Here's the next one.
This one is actually really,

1545
01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:22.110
I can't believe this guy didn't get hurt really bad,
uh,

1546
01:38:22.590 --> 01:38:24.270
airbag test in Russia.

1547
01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.060
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1548
01:38:27.060 --> 01:38:32.060
<v 9>This guy has to go at least nine feet in the fucking air and lands like a</v>

1549
01:38:32.701 --> 01:38:37.200
Goddamn rag doll.
And his friends are just laughing at him.

1550
01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:40.980
I mean,
just the concussive force alone,

1551
01:38:40.981 --> 01:38:45.870
what that would do to your ear drums is a,
is beyond me.
It,
speaking of that,

1552
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:48.120
a reoccurring theme on this podcast,

1553
01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:52.650
I've brought it up a few times because I've done permanent damage to my ears

1554
01:38:52.651 --> 01:38:57.030
from seeing bands live music and playing drums.

1555
01:38:58.620 --> 01:39:01.530
Um,
I'm telling you because I was out in Nashville,

1556
01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.550
my buddy out there took me out to some clubs that I always have the earplugs.

1557
01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.600
And I was actually talking to this guy who was about my age and,

1558
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:16.470
uh,
from what his friends were saying,
you know,
got a lot of ass back in the day.

1559
01:39:17.650 --> 01:39:20.940
All right.
And he was,
see,
saw that it had on earplugs.
He goes,
what?
He goes,

1560
01:39:20.941 --> 01:39:23.820
do you wear those all the time?
I go,
yeah,
I try to.
He goes,
yeah,

1561
01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.300
because recently I went to the doctor and the guy said,
hey,

1562
01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:32.280
will you ever in the military?
And he said No.
And he asked,
did you work in,
in,

1563
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:36.390
in a machine shop?
Basically asking all those fucking questions.

1564
01:39:36.391 --> 01:39:38.460
And the guy just said no.
And I'm telling you,

1565
01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:43.940
it was from years of going out to bars where they got the music cranked way too

1566
01:39:44.581 --> 01:39:47.850
fucking loud and uh,

1567
01:39:47.910 --> 01:39:49.740
you know that shit we hitting on the girl.

1568
01:39:50.710 --> 01:39:51.120
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1569
01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:54.930
<v 9>Do you live around here?
You literally leaning into her ear,</v>

1570
01:39:54.931 --> 01:39:57.570
you're screaming into her fucking ear.

1571
01:39:57.571 --> 01:40:01.710
Like just imagine if there was no music on and somebody did that to you,

1572
01:40:01.711 --> 01:40:04.770
you'd punch him in the face.
But when you're in those clubs,

1573
01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:09.980
the music is so fucking loud that someone has to get right near your ear and

1574
01:40:10.141 --> 01:40:13.770
yell into it just so you can hear him.
So I'm telling you.

1575
01:40:15.490 --> 01:40:16.323
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1576
01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:18.840
<v 9>How do you know how the fuck I got on this subject?
Oh,</v>

1577
01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:21.620
I guess see the airbag tests,
you know,

1578
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:23.570
I know you're young and then you've got ear plugs.

1579
01:40:23.571 --> 01:40:27.470
What do you will fucking queer up telling you?
Put those goddamn things in.

1580
01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.060
If you ever want to experiment one night,

1581
01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:34.180
just where one where one and standing there for a fucking half hour and walk out

1582
01:40:36.561 --> 01:40:38.690
and take the other one out and feel the difference.
Your,

1583
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:41.500
you're the ear that didn't have one is going to feel like it's underwater.

1584
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:43.760
And every time you do that you're doing permanent.

1585
01:40:43.761 --> 01:40:46.190
Like you ever have your ears ring out of nowhere.

1586
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:49.640
You just walking down the street and they go,
Oh yeah,

1587
01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:53.860
that means you have,
you have permanent hearing damage.

1588
01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:58.420
Uh,
so where are your ear plugs?
Their kids?
Is this crisis,

1589
01:40:58.421 --> 01:41:01.540
one of the fucking corneas things I've ever said,
but I dunno,

1590
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:07.870
it's driven people to suicide.
So cause it just keeps getting louder.
All right,

1591
01:41:07.871 --> 01:41:11.200
here's another,
here's another fucking youtube video.
This one is unbelievable.

1592
01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:16.210
It's called Uks best free runners and uh,

1593
01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:19.180
it's like a six minute video.
Usually.
I don't like videos this long,
but this is,

1594
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:22.240
these are these people who basically,
um,

1595
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:25.180
run and jump off of like,
you know,

1596
01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:29.080
out of second story windows land and roll and keep going and do like a fucking

1597
01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:33.460
back flip and then run up the side of a tree and then do another back flip.

1598
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:34.960
The fucking unbelievable.

1599
01:41:35.230 --> 01:41:40.230
And the only thing that this video is missing is I want to see a free runner get

1600
01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:44.380
chased by a cop on foot because this dude,

1601
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:49.750
one of these guys,
he fucking runs at uh,
you know those,
those big,

1602
01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:54.340
um,
when you go down there like a,
uh,
like a,
a wharf,

1603
01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:56.830
if you're not doing a drug deal or whatever,

1604
01:41:56.831 --> 01:42:01.150
you know those big containers that they basically lift off of the ship and they

1605
01:42:01.151 --> 01:42:04.540
can put on the back of a an 18 wheeler.
That's what the basic,
it looks like.

1606
01:42:04.541 --> 01:42:06.820
It looks like that the back of an 18 wheeler,

1607
01:42:06.821 --> 01:42:11.821
this fucking dude is running full speed at it and then runs two steps like Bo

1608
01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:18.060
Jackson up the side of the thing and then grabs the top of it and does a pull up

1609
01:42:18.461 --> 01:42:19.570
and pulls himself up.

1610
01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:24.690
And this is all one motion continues to run and then jumps like a six feet,

1611
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:30.490
six foot gap over to this other building where he's got where he's got to reach

1612
01:42:30.491 --> 01:42:34.450
up,
jump to the ledge,
does another pull up and now he's up on the building.

1613
01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.780
All of that takes about a second and a half.
And I would just,

1614
01:42:37.781 --> 01:42:42.280
would have loved to seen a cop chase in this dude and he just want,
you know,

1615
01:42:42.970 --> 01:42:44.200
even if he wanted to shoot him,

1616
01:42:44.201 --> 01:42:46.150
he couldn't have got the gun out quick enough and it would just,

1617
01:42:46.151 --> 01:42:49.280
would have been like,
yeah,
pursuits over.
I don't know.
I,

1618
01:42:49.450 --> 01:42:53.860
he was in front of me and then he ran up a fucking building.
Now Dude,

1619
01:42:53.861 --> 01:42:58.030
I'm telling you,
he ran up a building.
I didn't have time to shoot him.

1620
01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.100
Well,
you fucking chase.
Uh,
um,

1621
01:43:02.410 --> 01:43:04.660
check that out is another quick one.

1622
01:43:05.170 --> 01:43:09.280
Ladies teeth fall out during divorce court.
That's pretty much self explanatory.

1623
01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:15.730
Um,
then I've got a couple of Tourette's videos.
There's a guy with Tourette's,

1624
01:43:15.970 --> 01:43:19.240
Tourette's,
Karaoke,
um,

1625
01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:23.170
tourettes karaoke and the guys doing rdms losing my religion.

1626
01:43:23.171 --> 01:43:27.430
It's fucking hilarious.
Then there's a,
there's another one out there called,
uh,

1627
01:43:27.970 --> 01:43:31.760
the best of Tourette's guy.
And,
uh,
I,
I'm,

1628
01:43:31.761 --> 01:43:36.761
I'm convinced the guy's an actor because he doesn't have Tourette's as far as,

1629
01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:37.511
you know,

1630
01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:40.600
being on the opie and Anthony Show and being around people with Tourette's for a

1631
01:43:40.601 --> 01:43:41.560
long fucking time.

1632
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:46.950
It's sort of a rep repetition of either weird noises and there is cursing.

1633
01:43:47.741 --> 01:43:52.690
But the way this guy's cursing,
it's Torres.
It's not Tourette's,

1634
01:43:53.170 --> 01:43:56.300
Tourette's.
It's not tourettes,
but it's fucking hilarious.

1635
01:43:56.301 --> 01:44:00.590
So look up Tourette's guy.
Um,
and that's it.

1636
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.880
That's what I got this week.
I'm sorry.
I have the windows open.

1637
01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.640
We've got a heat wave out here.

Kind of life.

01:47:26.670 --> 01:47:30.090
from the let it go special.
And speaking of that,
let it go.

1688
01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:34.470
We'll be aired again on comedy central October 1st.

1689
01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:39.630
Please watch it.
Um,
if you can watch it live because that,

1690
01:47:39.631 --> 01:47:43.320
those are the only ones that I get credit for as far as the ratings.
Um,

1691
01:47:43.321 --> 01:47:47.730
you guys want to hear a little behind the behind the curtain show business shit.

1692
01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:48.810
This is how it works.

1693
01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:53.520
How the ratings work is they don't count Tivo watches if you record it and then

1694
01:47:53.521 --> 01:47:57.100
you watch and they don't count it because you know,

1695
01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:01.590
when I know that you blow through the commercials and ratings exists so they can

1696
01:48:01.591 --> 01:48:04.800
figure out how much that they can charge advertisers so they can figure out how

1697
01:48:04.801 --> 01:48:09.180
many people are actually watching the goddamn commercials.
So,
um,

1698
01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:13.530
October 1st comedy central is showing,
uh,
let it go again.
And uh,

1699
01:48:13.531 --> 01:48:15.540
that's pretty much it.
Oh.
And a Halloween,

1700
01:48:15.570 --> 01:48:19.470
I'm hanging out and I'm going to the rams game in St Louis,
so there you go.

1701
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:24.090
That is it.
That is it.
And just so if you want to plan ahead,

1702
01:48:24.091 --> 01:48:28.350
I got the funny bone in Columbus,
Ohio,
November 12th,

1703
01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:31.680
13th and 14th and then a,

1704
01:48:31.681 --> 01:48:35.820
I'm in DC at the listener auditorium on,
uh,

1705
01:48:35.821 --> 01:48:39.660
November 19th.
And then I'm doing Foxwoods,
right?

1706
01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:45.360
Foxwoods day.
You Go Foxwoods on November 20th.
There's another one,

1707
01:48:45.361 --> 01:48:47.790
people don't come to Connecticut.
I'm in Connecticut,

1708
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:52.910
November 20th and a and then the last one I will give you as I'm at the Moore

1709
01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:58.090
Theater in Seattle,
November 27th.
And,
uh,
the,

1710
01:48:58.091 --> 01:48:59.670
this is a cute little mini run for me.

1711
01:48:59.671 --> 01:49:02.040
This is the first time I actually tried to do theaters on my own,

1712
01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.440
so I'm really excited about all that.
All this and this.

1713
01:49:04.441 --> 01:49:08.040
How much of a sports fan I am.
I'm flying in the Friday night,

1714
01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:13.950
uh,
to do the radio so you know,
to the radio to hype it.
Th The uh,

1715
01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:17.850
the Damn Gig and I'm actually going to drive down and go to that Trailblazer

1716
01:49:17.850 --> 01:49:20.160
Hornets game and then I'm going to the CDC,

1717
01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:25.170
I'll Seahawks game on the Sunday afterwards and I brought all of that up as the

1718
01:49:25.171 --> 01:49:29.070
lovely Nia just walked in here.
The lovely Nia just walked in here.

1719
01:49:29.071 --> 01:49:29.960
Does that make you upset?

1720
01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:34.620
And I spending an extra day on the road to go to a football game.
Huh?
Come here.

1721
01:49:34.710 --> 01:49:38.010
Come here.
Come in here.
Come here.

1722
01:49:38.610 --> 01:49:42.450
It's not until the end of next month.
I like football.

1723
01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:46.920
I love you.
But I like football.
Come here,
come over here.

1724
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.300
Oh,
she just slammed down her purse as if to say,
you know,

1725
01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.440
you don't like the rams.

1726
01:49:56.240 --> 01:49:57.620
Saint Louis Rams makes her about the rams there.

1727
01:49:57.621 --> 01:50:02.300
One of the original teams that made up the NFL and uh,

1728
01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:05.300
they were in Los Angeles for a while and that didn't work out well.

1729
01:50:05.330 --> 01:50:09.290
Worked out for a while and then they,
then,
then they,
then they moved down.

1730
01:50:09.370 --> 01:50:13.760
I don't care to Anaheim.
We're Disney land is one of the happy places.

1731
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:19.330
And then after while punch you in your patronizing red face.

1732
01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.780
Come on,
if I fight,
this is a technique that,
you know what?
I have OCD.
All right?

1733
01:50:26.781 --> 01:50:31.390
If I go to that rams game,
the only team in,
in,
in,
in,

1734
01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:35.240
in the Midwest,
first of all,
you don't have OCD.
Stop being dramatic.

1735
01:50:35.241 --> 01:50:38.180
There are people who actually have OCD and they want to kill themselves.

1736
01:50:38.181 --> 01:50:41.090
You don't have OCD.
You like going to football games.

1737
01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:43.050
That doesn't mean you have those cds.

1738
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:47.840
See that that's what you need in your life.

1739
01:50:47.841 --> 01:50:50.180
You need a woman who can put you in your place when you're being ridiculous.

1740
01:50:50.181 --> 01:50:55.010
Was I being ridiculous?
Yes.
You just gave me the look.
Really

1741
01:50:57.490 --> 01:51:01.210
stop cursing on the podcast.
You know,
I had enough of you.

1742
01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:03.670
See that these supposed to be honest in a fucking relationship.

1743
01:51:03.671 --> 01:51:06.460
I told you what I'm doing rather than coming home,

1744
01:51:06.850 --> 01:51:09.940
I'm going to the fucking rams game.
Oh,
here she comes.
To be honest with you,

1745
01:51:09.941 --> 01:51:13.720
the fact that you've been on the road constantly and are choosing to stay out

1746
01:51:13.721 --> 01:51:17.890
longer is really fucking rude.
I have two weeks off.
Yeah,

1747
01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:21.490
exactly where you should be home.
I'm going to be home during those two weeks.

1748
01:51:21.491 --> 01:51:25.090
These are,
these fucking games are in like November except for the fine go.

1749
01:51:25.091 --> 01:51:29.710
I don't want to see you anyway,
except for the two in October.
Uh,

1750
01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:30.710
she just gave me the finger.

1751
01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:36.440
Your pumpkin bread or I'm going to do the Pumpkin's and I'm also going to make

1752
01:51:36.441 --> 01:51:39.440
the pumpkin bread.
I'm big on Halloween.
Everybody.
I like it.
You don't have to,

1753
01:51:39.441 --> 01:51:44.300
but you have to buy any gifts.
You know all these kids coming up the stairs.

1754
01:51:44.301 --> 01:51:48.860
Dress like Godzilla though.
Yeah,
it's adorable and I make it.

1755
01:51:48.890 --> 01:51:52.520
How great was the Pumpkin bread I made last year?
It was great.

1756
01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:55.100
You make great pumpkin bread.
You're a great baker.

1757
01:51:57.770 --> 01:52:01.640
That was all insulting.
It was great.
It was great pumpkin bread.
You're a great,

1758
01:52:01.641 --> 01:52:04.730
but you know what,
you know I don't,
you know what,
I,

1759
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:08.700
I'm smart enough not to engage in this with you.
This,
Ooh,

1760
01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:13.490
this is just your way of saying that you love me and you miss me,

1761
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:18.230
so I'm not gonna engage in this.
I love you too.
Ah,
see,

1762
01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:21.920
figured that one out.
Go,
go,
go.
Pour yourself a bowl of cereal.
Get out of my face.

1763
01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:27.140
I'm going to finish this up.
Oh,
fucking cheap shot.

1764
01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:30.980
There's a woman ever just square up and just go,
let's go.
They don't,

1765
01:52:31.010 --> 01:52:35.300
they wait till you're not looking in your fucking throw a punch.
Fucking cheap.

1766
01:52:36.230 --> 01:52:38.570
I was nice.
It was right where my appendix used to be.

1767
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:43.670
Did you have your appendix out?
Um,
yes I did.

1768
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.520
I had it out back in the day,

1769
01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:49.580
way back in the day on those little house in the prairie days where you almost

1770
01:52:49.581 --> 01:52:53.160
died of it because people didn't know what's wrong with you walking around.

1771
01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:57.530
You face the same color as glue.
Your Dad just going,
what's wrong with that guy?

1772
01:52:57.710 --> 01:52:58.940
Your bed,
you're being a baby.

1773
01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:05.570
I feel like there's somebody invisible stabbing me in my side.
Ah,

1774
01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:09.680
c'mon.
C'Mon.
Stop it.
Grow Up.
Um,
all right,

1775
01:53:09.681 --> 01:53:14.460
that's the podcast for this week.
Um,
so please,
um,

1776
01:53:15.650 --> 01:53:16.260
check out,

1777
01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:19.370
check out my special October 1st if you missed it and please buy tickets to my

1778
01:53:19.371 --> 01:53:20.930
shows.
I have a brand new hour.

1779
01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:26.000
I have a big theater tour coming up.
And uh,

1780
01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:30.060
you know what else I didn't mention?
I didn't mention this shit.
All right,

1781
01:53:30.230 --> 01:53:31.630
because this is how I booked myself in the road.

1782
01:53:31.650 --> 01:53:36.650
I have to whisper here so nia doesn't figure this shit out at how I book myself

1783
01:53:37.371 --> 01:53:41.570
on the road is take like the funny bone in Columbus,
Ohio.

1784
01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:46.760
All right,
I'm going to be there the 12th,
13th and 14th of November.

1785
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.030
Why did we pick this weekend?
You know what I mean?
Who the fuck?

1786
01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:53.600
Why the fuck would you ever go to Columbus,
Ohio?

1787
01:53:54.290 --> 01:53:59.120
There's only one fucking reason and that's to go to Ohio state buckeyes game.

1788
01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:00.530
Other than that,

1789
01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:04.970
there's no fucking reason unless you want to join a militia or maybe use that as

1790
01:54:04.971 --> 01:54:08.600
your base camp as you drive down to go see that chick who plays with the

1791
01:54:08.601 --> 01:54:13.520
pretenders and I forget where the fuck she's from.
So anyways,

1792
01:54:13.521 --> 01:54:17.470
Ohio state is playing Penn state that day.
And uh,

1793
01:54:17.471 --> 01:54:19.940
I'm really rolling the dice because of the flex schedule,

1794
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:23.540
which is basically if Ohio state and Penn state are ranked really high,

1795
01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:25.860
that game will then become an eight o'clock game.

1796
01:54:25.861 --> 01:54:27.950
So not only will I not get to go to the game,

1797
01:54:28.190 --> 01:54:31.640
nobody will show up to my fucking show because everyone's going to be at the

1798
01:54:31.641 --> 01:54:35.050
fucking Goddamn Ohio state game.
All right.

1799
01:54:35.690 --> 01:54:38.000
And I'm telling you people,
if you,
if you,

1800
01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:42.710
if you come from like a town I come from,
which is a professional sports team,

1801
01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:45.350
a professional sports town,

1802
01:54:46.130 --> 01:54:49.430
you have no fucking idea how insane it can get.

1803
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:53.950
<v 5>Like as much as they talk about the Yankees,</v>

1804
01:54:53.951 --> 01:54:58.951
red sox rivalry and how fucking insane it can't hold a candle to Ohio state,

1805
01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:04.290
Michigan.
If you don't believe me.
Hbo Did a documentary on it and it's,

1806
01:55:04.291 --> 01:55:07.930
it's absolutely fucking insane.
And I'll tell you right now,

1807
01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:13.140
if Fenway Park or Yankee Stadium Somehow held a 100,000 fucking people,

1808
01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:17.680
they wouldn't sell it out.
You couldn't get 100,000 people to go to that.

1809
01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:20.560
I don't think you'd get 100,000 people to go to a fucking world series game.

1810
01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:25.840
<v 9>Um,
but college football,
they'll fucking have 100,000 people just to watch.</v>

1811
01:55:25.841 --> 01:55:28.690
Ohio state kicked the shit out of bowling green.
They don't give a shit.

1812
01:55:30.610 --> 01:55:35.380
They just show up.
Um,
anyways,
that is the podcast for this week.

1813
01:55:36.370 --> 01:55:37.150
And I realized is

1814
01:55:37.150 --> 01:55:41.290
<v 5>that a,
I didn't address that my podcast has been taken off of iTunes.
Uh,</v>

1815
01:55:41.291 --> 01:55:44.130
I believe that was something that I did.
Can't figure out what it is,

1816
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:44.700
<v 9>but,
um,</v>

1817
01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:47.940
I have some people working on it and I didn't even address it because I'm hoping

1818
01:55:47.941 --> 01:55:51.150
it's just gonna be a one week problem and a,
that is it.

1819
01:55:51.151 --> 01:55:54.090
That's the podcast for this week.
Good luck to everybody.

1820
01:55:54.091 --> 01:55:57.630
I know who the fucking patriots have next week we have the dolphins.

1821
01:55:58.590 --> 01:56:00.750
And I'll tell you right now,
I don't like that game.

1822
01:56:01.230 --> 01:56:04.410
I don't fucking like it until we have a goddamn defense.

1823
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:08.430
I don't like any game that we're playing.
I don't like it,

1824
01:56:08.431 --> 01:56:11.490
but I'm loving Hernandez.
I'm loving that guy.

1825
01:56:11.491 --> 01:56:15.330
But I'm hoping Mohs is going to get some more touches because he's going to

1826
01:56:15.331 --> 01:56:19.950
start bitching or something.
I don't fucking know.
God Damn it.

1827
01:56:19.951 --> 01:56:21.000
That's my prediction right now.

1828
01:56:21.001 --> 01:56:24.150
The way we've played the first three weeks and all the points we let up,

1829
01:56:24.151 --> 01:56:27.420
I'm saying we're going to go nine and seven.
Um,

1830
01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:32.280
and we might even be tied for second with the dolphins and they might even be 10

1831
01:56:32.281 --> 01:56:36.630
and six jets might go 11 and five.
Um,

1832
01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:38.760
I got to wait to the jets actually play another contender.

1833
01:56:38.761 --> 01:56:42.210
I know we're playing the Steelers.
I don't know if the jets play them,

1834
01:56:42.211 --> 01:56:45.150
but that's going to be a big game when Ben Roethlisberger is back.

1835
01:56:45.151 --> 01:56:49.620
I'll tell you what Chet fans,
I'll tell you this right now.
Okay.

1836
01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:53.340
And know that the reason why I gave the jet so much shit A's because they're

1837
01:56:53.341 --> 01:56:55.950
from New York and also because they were talking so much fucking shit.

1838
01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:58.260
That's what happens.
That's what happens.

1839
01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:01.860
And noticed after they got their fucking asses kicked,

1840
01:57:01.861 --> 01:57:03.690
they didn't get their asses kicked but they lost,

1841
01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:06.420
where's all the shit talking now they shut the fuck up,

1842
01:57:06.421 --> 01:57:08.520
which is actually me hating the jets.

1843
01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:11.370
I kind of wished that they beat the ravens cause they still would have been

1844
01:57:11.371 --> 01:57:16.080
talking and then they would have been in a situation like the 2007 Patriots were

1845
01:57:16.081 --> 01:57:18.720
the entire league wants to kick the shit out of you.

1846
01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:22.710
And eventually someone does and you go home sad with your head hanging down.

1847
01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:25.800
But I will tell you this,
if you guys do play the fucking Steelers,

1848
01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:30.420
alright in Big Ben is back and uh,
you know,

1849
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:35.040
and you guys beat him,
then I will say you guys are for are for real.

1850
01:57:36.210 --> 01:57:39.630
All right,
and as much as you,
New Yorkers can't fucking stand,
stand me.

1851
01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:41.940
You've got to admit that's how you have to be.

1852
01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:48.210
You can't just say this shit and not be the shit and then everybody just says

1853
01:57:48.330 --> 01:57:50.550
you're the shit unless you're Peyton Manning,
of course,

1854
01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.330
who can just do no fucking wrong.
Right,
right.
Once again,

1855
01:57:54.331 --> 01:57:56.490
he's off to with these on a fucking tear,

1856
01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:00.930
putting up ridiculous numbers and I'll tell you this fucking cult fans,

1857
01:58:02.610 --> 01:58:07.500
if pate manning wins three super bowls with the regular season stats that he's

1858
01:58:07.501 --> 01:58:07.861
put up,

1859
01:58:07.861 --> 01:58:12.720
if you want to say that he's the best guy who ever played that position at that

1860
01:58:12.721 --> 01:58:15.900
point,
I would have a hard time arguing with because he would,

1861
01:58:17.130 --> 01:58:20.340
he would have that final piece that he needed,

1862
01:58:20.341 --> 01:58:25.341
which was leading your team in the playoffs to the promise land as opposed to

1863
01:58:26.341 --> 01:58:27.780
getting them to the promise land.

1864
01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:31.800
You're right there at the gates of Wally world and then throwing a pick six to

1865
01:58:31.801 --> 01:58:34.380
fucking John Candy and he runs it back 60 yards.

1866
01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:39.300
All right,
so for all you fucking guys,
cause you guys love your team so much.

1867
01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:40.710
You're not even listening to what I'm saying.

1868
01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:44.080
All said was rex Ryan is his out of his fucking mind.

1869
01:58:44.081 --> 01:58:46.120
He's not as confident as he acts.

1870
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:50.200
He cries himself to sleep with a fucking gallon of ice cream every night.
And uh,

1871
01:58:50.201 --> 01:58:52.480
he has,
uh,
a as a,
a chronic need to be liked.

1872
01:58:52.481 --> 01:58:55.270
And I am right on all of those fucking points.
I don't give a shit.

1873
01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:58.530
And I also said that all this shit you were talking was bullshit,

1874
01:58:58.570 --> 01:59:02.710
which was proven in the first fucking week when you lost.
All right?
So when you,

1875
01:59:02.711 --> 01:59:05.410
when you beat a legitimate super bowl contender,

1876
01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:07.300
which you have yet to fucking play,

1877
01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:12.760
all you've played so far is one team that has a playoff level defense and you

1878
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:15.880
didn't beat them all.
Right?
Really?

1879
01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:17.670
Do you think the dolphins are going to win the Superbowl?

1880
01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:20.410
Do you really think you're going to run into them again in the fucking playoffs

1881
01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:23.260
with their no name Qb?
You're not.

1882
01:59:23.890 --> 01:59:26.420
Do you think the Patriots are going to do anything letting up 30 points a

1883
01:59:26.421 --> 01:59:27.730
fucking game than not?

1884
01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:31.240
I know that because Belicheck is still there and Tom Brady is still there.

1885
01:59:31.241 --> 01:59:34.720
You think that they're still the o four or o seven paths?
They're not.

1886
01:59:35.170 --> 01:59:38.860
They're not.
This is,
this is a whole new fucking team and um,

1887
01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:42.460
and it's fucking ridiculous.

1888
01:59:42.461 --> 01:59:46.030
We have to score like 35 38 points to get a victory.

1889
01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.280
We scored 38 points on the bills,

1890
01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:52.510
38 points and it was still a nail biter right down to the fucking end.

1891
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:56.530
All right,
whatever.
It's fucking frustrating.

1892
01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:00.010
And you guys couldn't beat the dolphins to till the last God damn play the game.

1893
02:00:00.010 --> 02:00:01.750
And you guys are sitting there talking super bowl.

1894
02:00:01.870 --> 02:00:05.140
Is that what you ice cream fucking eating fags down there in New York?

1895
02:00:05.141 --> 02:00:07.990
Is that what you're doing?
Who's team actually plays in New Jersey?

1896
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:12.250
All you douchebags ago.
Why did you call the New England patriots?

1897
02:00:12.730 --> 02:00:15.280
There's not even a Boston team.
That's how dumb New Yorkers are.

1898
02:00:15.281 --> 02:00:17.950
They don't realize that Massachusetts is in New England.

1899
02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:21.910
It's a region of the northeast.
All right?

1900
02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:26.170
For All you folks who don't know your history,
the Boston Patriots started out,

1901
02:00:26.171 --> 02:00:27.580
they played at Nickerson field.

1902
02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:30.730
Nobody showed up because nobody knew who the fuck they were.

1903
02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:32.500
It was considered an a farrier league.

1904
02:00:32.590 --> 02:00:36.520
They were going bankrupt and in a desperate attempt to try to rope in more

1905
02:00:36.521 --> 02:00:40.000
fucking fans,
they switched to New England patriots.

1906
02:00:40.001 --> 02:00:41.710
Something that I have never liked.

1907
02:00:42.490 --> 02:00:44.920
I still think that they should be called the Boston patriots.

1908
02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:49.210
All that fucking Patriot tea party horse,
shit all happened at Boston.

1909
02:00:49.210 --> 02:00:53.080
They should be called the Boston patriots,
but they're not.
So that's why,

1910
02:00:53.081 --> 02:00:55.330
but Boston is in New England.
You're dumb,

1911
02:00:55.331 --> 02:00:59.860
New York or Fox and you guys got a lot of nerve considering the New York jets

1912
02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:04.630
and the New York giants play in New Jersey and share a fucking stadium.

1913
02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:09.670
Just why don't you guys stay on the fuck down.
All right.
See,

1914
02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:12.520
that's what always happens.
Always make good points about football.

1915
02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:15.910
And then my hatred of New York just comes up.
But admit it.
You love it.

1916
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.910
You love it.
Every God damn you know something.

1917
02:01:18.911 --> 02:01:21.970
I actually don't even hate the giants.
I actually liked the giants.

1918
02:01:23.720 --> 02:01:24.553
<v 10>MMM.</v>

1919
02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:28.210
<v 9>I Dunno.
I liked the uniforms.
I like the old helmet that they went back to.</v>

1920
02:01:28.230 --> 02:01:33.100
I like them.
I like this style of play,
that smash Mouth Defensive Shit.

1921
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:38.020
I know that they kind of suck so far,
but I,
um,
I coffins a good coach.

1922
02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:40.010
Maybe you can turn it around.
I don't know.
I don't

1923
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:44.770
<v 5>know what,
but uh,
there's something about the jets.
I just,
there,</v>

1924
02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:48.460
you know what it is.
Their fans are desperate and there's just something,

1925
02:01:48.461 --> 02:01:51.730
when you smell desperation,
you just want to see failure.
You know,

1926
02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:57.460
they just slept in about that silly little fireman on top of his boyfriends

1927
02:01:57.461 --> 02:02:00.430
shoulders and they're 1920s cheer,

1928
02:02:00.730 --> 02:02:03.700
j e t as jets,
jets,
jets,
and they,

1929
02:02:03.701 --> 02:02:06.040
and they think that that chair is awesome.

1930
02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:11.880
That's what kills me the same way it kills me when red sox fan sink sweet

1931
02:02:13.281 --> 02:02:17.570
Caroline and they think it's awesome to be going [inaudible] with your fucking

1932
02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:22.310
chicks head on your shoulder.
I swear to God,

1933
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:26.960
if I could,
if I became the next Hitler,
but going big on this one,

1934
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:31.940
the people that I would target would be red sox fans.

1935
02:02:32.060 --> 02:02:37.060
Anybody who sings [inaudible] in the seventh inning of a red sox game and anyone

1936
02:02:37.370 --> 02:02:41.960
who puts a fireman on their shoulder and goes,
j e t as jets,
jets,
jets.

1937
02:02:41.961 --> 02:02:46.790
That's it.
You're out.
You're fucking out.
You're done.

1938
02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:50.570
All right.
You're not part of my master plan.

1939
02:02:53.630 --> 02:02:56.450
Ah,
Gee,
she is.
How fucked up was that?
Well,
go fuck yourself.

1940
02:02:56.451 --> 02:03:00.440
That's the podcast for this week.
God bless all the police come out to my shows.

1941
02:03:00.441 --> 02:03:04.100
I got a brand new hour and,
um,
I,

1942
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:08.810
I think I have a new girl.
I think I have a new,
uh,
fun joke about a goat.

1943
02:03:09.230 --> 02:03:12.080
I'm hoping that killed in Nashville,

1944
02:03:12.110 --> 02:03:14.660
but God knows those Pete Guy knows the people down there.
Come on,
man.

1945
02:03:14.690 --> 02:03:15.523
Who's kidding?
Who,

1946
02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:20.600
how does a goat joke not killed in fucking Tennessee?
All right.

1947
02:03:20.601 --> 02:03:24.380
The real test.
It's not even going to be in Albany.

1948
02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:29.450
I think he'll be in buffalo.
Albany animal is a lot of farmland around there.

1949
02:03:29.570 --> 02:03:30.470
Do you know,
let's the highway.

1950
02:03:30.471 --> 02:03:35.210
I hate the most [inaudible] 87 north just because for so much of my career,

1951
02:03:35.211 --> 02:03:38.600
I drove up there in either a bus or a rental car,

1952
02:03:38.601 --> 02:03:41.030
just go into some fucking nightmare of a gig.

1953
02:03:41.031 --> 02:03:45.320
So I just always associated with that.
I have talked too long.

1954
02:03:45.380 --> 02:03:48.490
I have overstayed my welcome.
God bless all year.
I'll see you next week.

1955
02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:24.733
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

1956
02:04:29.020 --> 02:04:29.020
[inaudible].
