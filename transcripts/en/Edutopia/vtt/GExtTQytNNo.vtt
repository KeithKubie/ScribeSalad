00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:07.736
&gt;&gt;Liza: So when you're
working on projects

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:11.876
and you really have student-driven
lessons, it can be scary

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:14.636
because you don't feel like you're
in control, but you really are.

00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:17.866
If you are planning the
right way ahead of time,

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:21.406
you are scaffolding every
single aspect of that lesson

00:00:21.406 --> 00:00:22.716
and what the students are doing.

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:25.296
You may say to yourself, it's way
too much, there's too much to do.

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:28.746
But that hard work in
the beginning allows it

00:00:28.746 --> 00:00:31.606
to be completely student-driven
and they know

00:00:31.826 --> 00:00:34.676
that this is their education and
that I'm here to support them.

00:00:34.676 --> 00:00:36.756
I'm not here to tell them
what they need to know.

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:38.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What else
can we use the lake

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.846
for besides drinking and fishing?

00:00:40.956 --> 00:00:43.366
I want you to think about
more uses for a lake.

00:00:43.946 --> 00:00:46.406
Keep thinking, think about
the lakes in our community.

00:00:46.406 --> 00:00:48.696
What kinds of things do
we use our lakes for?

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:51.606
&gt;&gt;Sheela: So it's not about
just giving kids a worksheet

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:54.416
that the teacher has
created to complete.

00:00:54.716 --> 00:00:59.196
It's about introducing the topic
in a way that will build curiosity.

00:00:59.596 --> 00:01:03.816
It's about being able to provide
opportunities for kids to enquire

00:01:03.816 --> 00:01:05.396
and ask questions around it.

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:09.016
It's about providing opportunities
for kids to work together

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:12.826
to find their own answers to
the questions that are posed,

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:15.386
or perhaps generate more questions.

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:19.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Just think for a
minute and reflect on this idea.

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:23.796
What is working well for your group?

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:27.136
&gt;&gt;Peggy: Teachers need to be
very conscious of building

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:28.466
in opportunities for reflection,

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.516
because that's the thing
that's very easy to forget.

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:32.816
Whether it's setting aside
the last three minutes,

00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:36.226
whether there are benchmarks and
when you finish a particular part

00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:40.836
of the project, you stop reflect
on what you've learned so far.

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:45.676
Some teachers use a class
whiteboard and as things are learned,

00:01:45.676 --> 00:01:48.376
she stops the class and says, "Let's
all gather round for a minute.

00:01:48.526 --> 00:01:50.796
Let's talk about the
things we've learned.

00:01:50.796 --> 00:01:54.016
Let's reflect on this
learning so far."

00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:57.876
&gt;&gt;Sheela: And then the next step
would be to really be able to engage

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:02.166
in discussion with their peers,
to gauge what was the thinking

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:05.556
from their partner or their
group members and how does

00:02:05.556 --> 00:02:08.926
that now shape my thinking?

00:02:08.926 --> 00:02:12.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I'm really proud to hear
how well you're working together.

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:15.306
&gt;&gt;Liza: So we have learning
targets for every day.

00:02:15.306 --> 00:02:18.226
Sometimes the students write
them, sometimes I write them.

00:02:18.626 --> 00:02:22.146
And I like to have them track
themselves on that learning target,

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:24.676
either throughout the lesson
or throughout the week,

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:26.216
if it's a longer learning target.

00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:29.656
So having them do it
themselves gives them that pride

00:02:29.656 --> 00:02:33.226
in their own education and makes them
more engaged in what you're doing.

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:34.776
They don't feel like, "Oh, okay,

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:37.066
Miss Zeller doesn't think
I'm learning anything.

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:39.046
I know that I'm learning something,

00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:41.056
because I'm the one
tracking my own learning."

00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:46.606
&gt;&gt;Sheela: I definitely believe that
in comparison to a traditional model,

00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:52.996
A PBL model allows for relevant,
rigorous and responsive teaching

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:56.876
and learning, that
happens each and every day.
