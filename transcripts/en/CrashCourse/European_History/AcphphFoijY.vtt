00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.530
Hi I’m John Green and this is Crash Course
European History.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.120
So today we’re going to continue looking
at European expansion and its impact on the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.120
world’s humans.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.829
Like, imagine learning that there are people
in places you did not know existed, that they

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:20.590
eat foods you’ve never seen, that their
world contains plant and animal species entirely

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.210
different from your world.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.160
What people thought was one world turned out
to be two, and the collision of those worlds

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.529
wrought devastation and opportunity on a truly
mind-boggling scale.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.239
And today, we’re going to ask you to look
at the consequences of European expansion,

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:45.520
and consider how those consequences change
depending on where you find yourself.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:53.150
INTRO
Destruction from Iberian expansion was truly

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.170
extraordinary across the sixteenth century.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.820
As Hernan Cortes commented: “We could not
walk without treading on the bodies and heads

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.570
of dead Indians.”[i]
Besides the slaughter of empire-building directly

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.340
inflicted by the invaders and their local
allies, the ongoing progress of smallpox,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.430
and measles, and other diseases that Europeans
brought to the Americas completely overwhelmed

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.000
the healthcare systems of native Americans.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.540
Many millions died.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.000
Within a century, the population of native
Americans had fallen perhaps by as much as

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.370
90%.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.040
Throughout the Spanish Empire in the Americas
the colonizers made use of existing political

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.659
structures that were already in place for
collecting taxes and otherwise maintaining

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:36.659
order.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.380
Even as the Spanish king appointed elite men
from Spain as viceroys enforcing civil and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.560
military rule over what had been the Incan
Empire for instance, the Incan systems of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.400
roads and communication networks facilitated
Spanish domination.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.500
It’s also important to remember that because
the Spanish had never before experienced almost

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.439
three- thousand-mile-long imperial operation,
like the one the Incans had, the Spanish had

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.909
very little understanding of how to maintain
its functions or to provide for its upkeep.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.450
Much as the Spanish empire initially depended
on brute force, sustaining it required practical

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.790
interactions with conquered people and in
many cases their cooperation.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.220
The rewards of empire for the Spanish were
truly astonishing.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.860
Thanks to the seizure of art and religious
objects made with precious metals, the discovery

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.690
of mines, and the know-how of native Americans
and others in running those mines, by the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.460
mid-sixteenth century silver and gold were
pouring into Spain.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.160
And what had been a very poor kingdom became
a very very rich one.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.590
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.430
It’s now believed that pre-Columbian peoples
knew how to use liquid mercury to process

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.430
silver and gold--a method that’s still used
today.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.740
It was also used by the Spanish
and by the end of the century the Portuguese

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.600
had discovered precious metals in Brazil,
too.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.500
The Portuguese cut down trees in Brazillian
forests to trade in Brazilwood.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.940
And sugar production flourished across the
Caribbean beginning in Jamaica in 1515 and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.210
eventually spreading across tropical and forested
regions of the New World where the vast tracts

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.930
of trees could be felled to feed the fires
needed for sugar refining.To launch and sustain

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.250
all these enterprises—mining, metallurgy,
sugar refining, lumbering—Iberians initially

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.000
used the forced labor and know-how of local
peoples, as I mentioned earlier.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.090
The Spanish government awarded its soldiers
and adventurers encomienda, that is the labor

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.240
of local people on a large plot of land.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.440
But there were critics of this system among
Europeans, perhaps most notably Bartolomé

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.870
Las Casas, a Catholic missionary who had helped
in the savage conquest of Cuba and who had

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.740
received an encomienda for his participation.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.430
But then the preaching of a Dominican friar
made him see conquest in a different light

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.560
and he began a campaign on behalf of local
people.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.400
Las Casas, while underscoring the benefits
of conversion to Christianity, lambasted his

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.230
fellow conquerors for their murder, brutality,
and pillage.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.070
He wrote of native Americans, “To subject
them first by warlike means is a form and

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.300
procedure contrary to the law … and gentleness
of Jesus Christ.”

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.820
Las Casas wrote much more and lobbied the
Spanish court (some would say he harassed

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.980
it), beginning in some historians’ minds
the drive for what are considered today human

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.980
rights.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.980
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.280
Las Casas’ story is a reminder that the
cause of human rights always needs people

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.430
who have them in order to press it forward.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.990
But ultimately the people who are responsible
for expansions in human rights are the people

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.900
who are denied them and insist upon their
humanity anyway.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.970
So to shift perspectives for a moment, some
Europeans were advocating for human rights

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.460
but many many people without those rights
were advocating for them.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.480
And as for indigenous people in the New World,
to present one story of their response to

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.690
colonization would be inaccurate--at times,
communities and individuals resisted; at times,

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.730
some cooperated.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.150
But it’s hard to overstate how destabilizing
it was to these communities to lose in many

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.290
cases 90% of their population.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:17.120
One of the huge changes though was the arrival
of Christianity and the demand that the colonized

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.750
become Christians.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.130
Christianity changed the Americas, but the
Americas also changed Christianity.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.420
In the face of the demand of the Church that
conquered people become Catholic, they might

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.160
for instance blend their own beliefs with
Catholic ones.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.210
In 1531, the Aztec Cuauhtlatoatzin, whose
baptismal name was Juan Diego, had five visions

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.800
of the Virgin Mary on a sacred Aztec spot
of the corn goddess, near Mexico City.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.540
Mary’s miracles left an imprint of her form
on Juan Diego’s cape.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.590
And on the cape, Mary appeared to be an Aztec
woman wearing a robe with Aztec designs and

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.590
symbols.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.370
This version of Mary, known as Our Lady of
Guadalupe, was brown-skinned and was often

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.820
called, “the dark virgin.”

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.050
Many shrines to Our Lady of Guadalupe were
built, and her story was written down both

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.280
in Spanish and in the Aztec language, Nahuatl.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.040
Our Lady of Guadalupe replaced some of the
local goddesses that were suppressed by the

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040
Christians.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.040
Women in particular took up devotion to her
as a symbol of motherhood.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.720
And today, Our Lady of Guadalupe’s basilica
in Mexico City is said to be the most visited

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.420
shrine in the world.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.910
It wasn’t too long before other European
powers, eyeing these profits, sought to literally

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:34.980
capture Spanish wealth.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.750
Like English privateer Francis Drake began
his career of attacking Spanish shipping in

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.340
the 1560s and often seized huge fortunes for
the queen and investors in his voyages.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.920
While circumnavigating the globe, he captured
stores of Spanish gold and silver from ships

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.280
along the west coast of South America.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.920
In some cases, a single seizure might yield
the equivalent of an entire year’s income

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.760
for the royal treasury.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:08.510
You heard that right--taking down one Spanish
ship could equal all the tax collection in

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:14.030
England for a year--which gives you a sense
of just how much wealth was being extracted

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.030
from colonies.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:20.790
No wonder Elizabeth knighted Drake in 1581
after he returned from his historic circumnavigation—which

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.620
was only the second circumnavigation of the
globe in European history at the time.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.510
And Drake made it home Magellan.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.820
Stan am I allowed to make a joke about Magellan
dying.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.470
Has enough time passed?

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:32.470
Stan says “yes”.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.470
Right.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.250
So the French, Dutch, and other treasure-hungry
people joined the English in Atlantic piracy,

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.630
which increased the wealth of many European
kingdoms and individuals of course.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:49.660
But those same European states also began
imitating the Portuguese and Spanish in global

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.540
exploration, trade, and eventually settlement.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.660
In 1497, Italian sailor John Cabot, which
was not his Italian name by the way.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.470
I’ve always found it very funny that the
two most famous Italian sailors in history

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.720
are named John Cabot and Christopher Columbus.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.940
At any rate John Cabot commissioned by Henry
VII of England and landed somewhere north

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:13.470
of Maine, probably on the Canadian coast.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.820
And then returned to London to great acclaim.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:21.550
The English established the East India Company
in 1600 to focus on their exploration efforts

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:27.510
and the Dutch founded a similar United East
India Company in 1602, which brought together

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.890
several trading companies from various Dutch
states.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.830
And other governments chartered similar corporations.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:39.440
These companies performed a variety of functions
from gathering investors, and building ships,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:46.640
to raising armies and taking over new territory
and enslaving people to work conquered land.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.250
Lest you think that like corporations are
newly evil.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.470
Which brings us to the slave trade.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.950
Initially, Portuguese sailors sought to catch
Africans they happened to spot along the coast,

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.330
and then sell them as slaves in Europe.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.339
But by the end of the sixteenth century, the
capture of Africans for sale to Europeans

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:12.170
became routine and then eventually a massive
business for both African slade traders and

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.750
Europeans after 1650.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:18.080
And this was also partly due to disease and
the devastation of colonization.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.490
The Spanish had trouble with sugar production
in the Caribbean after the native Taino people

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:27.680
had been wiped out by disease; the British
then took over and began importing African

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.860
slaves to work in sugar plantations.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:34.040
By the eighteenth century British slavers
had taken the lead in the Atlantic trade.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.320
Partly due to petitions like those from Las
Casas, Spanish rulings that Native Americans

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.560
could not be enslaved led the Spanish landowners
and mine operators to import Africans and

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.250
Asians to stay within the law, which did not
yet say that you know people could not be

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.270
enslaved.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:54.641
Some Asian slaves, once brought to the Spanish
Empire, were able to pass as local people,

00:09:54.641 --> 00:09:57.360
and claim their freedom on that basis.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.249
But almost everyone who was enslaved died
in slavery.

00:10:02.249 --> 00:10:09.350
Life expectancy was very low; all manner of
mistreatment was common; and legal protections

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.680
were almost nonexistent.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.630
It’s very important to consider those perspectives
too.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:18.900
And also to consider why traditionally those
perspectives have been ignored.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.750
We’ve talked about how the establishment
of transoceanic travel meant that diseases,

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:29.230
and people, and finished goods were traveling
across oceans but so were plants and animal

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.260
species.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.750
This whole process is sometimes known as the
Columbian exchange.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:39.860
This movement of goods and people and species
across the Atlantic was tremendously important

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:46.010
to history--before it, new world foods like
pumpkins and tomatoes, maize, potatoes did

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.190
not even exist in Afroeurasia.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.510
Did the globe open up?

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:50.860
What’s in the center of the world?

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:51.860
It’s a pumpkin.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.910
You want to know why there were no jack-o-lanterns
in 13th century Europe?

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.910
There were no pumpkins.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.920
There was no popcorn because there was no
corn.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.920
#sponsored.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.920
I wish.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920
I love this stuff.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.250
You know the famous bananas of South America?

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.600
No, you don’t.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.970
Bananas are from Africa.

00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.090
They didn’t exist in the Americas until
the Columbian exchange.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:17.380
So much of what feels natural and even defining
about our cultures and histories is in fact

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.529
really really new.

00:11:18.529 --> 00:11:20.080
Nigerian cassava.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.740
Irish potatoes.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.700
Vanilla Ice Cream in Europe.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.700
Tomatoes in Italy.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:29.190
None of this was conceivable before the Columbian
exchange.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.650
Europeans also learned a lot from the Americas
about food preservation.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:37.970
Like the Incas dried some potatoes for instance,
which made them lighter and easier to transport,

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.570
and then would later reconstitute them so
they could be eaten, a strategy which fortified

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.520
messengers along the Inca’s extensive network
of roads.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.330
Similar processes came to be used in Europe
and would eventually be used to fortify astronauts,

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.990
who often eat reconstituted dehydrated food.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:00.250
And over time potatoes and maize (know here
as corn) increased overall calories available

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.390
to Europeans because they could be dried and
stored in huge quantities.

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.029
And that decreased starvation and increased
populations.

00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:13.590
Meanwhile, as we’ve discussed, the travel
of microbes to the Americas devastated communities

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:19.770
there, and a range of Afroeurasian animals--horses,
sheep, and pigs to name a few--arrived in

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.490
the New World for the first time.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:26.400
In some ways, these new animals were useful
of course, but they also did extensive damage,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.630
stripping away vegetation necessary for soil
conservation and trampling farm land.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.000
And deforestation began with the clearing
of forests for sugar cane production, as we

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.830
discussed earlier, a process that accelerated
in Central and South Americas through the

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.029
twentieth century.

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:47.660
In Europe, sugar was initially such a precious
luxury that a sprinkle of it was all that

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.570
even the wealthy could afford.

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.440
Queen Isabella of Castille and Spain gave
a small box of sugar to her daughter as a

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.190
Christmas present to be treasured.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:00.610
[[TV: Chocolate]] Chocolate began as a ceremonial
drink for the powerful, as it was among the

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.610
Aztecs.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:06.110
But as European communities became wealthier,
more people transitioned from subsistence

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.310
living to being able to afford goods from
distant places.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:17.040
Treats of sugar, chocolate, tea, coffee and
tobacco transformed attitudes, while the hot

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.560
water that was needed for making tea and coffee
and hot cocoa is thought to have extended

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.370
the life spans in Europe by killing water-born
germs.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:30.410
And slowly the English and some of Spain and
Portugal’s other competitors established

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:36.680
their own colonies—the English had the unsuccessful
colony of Roanoke in the 1580s, and then Jamestown

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.330
in 1607, and the Massachusetts Bay Colony
in 1620.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.960
Some of these settlers came in families but
many came as single men and occasionally single

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.960
women.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.360
And in the developing propaganda war among
these rivals, English latecomers to the Atlantic

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.050
world promoted an idea that came to be called
the “Black Legend.”

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:59.310
It maintained that unlike the tolerant and
kind English Protestants, the Spanish were

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.560
bigoted Catholics, brutal and destructive
of local people.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.980
That would be what Psychologists call “projection.”

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:12.430
Today we know that English settlers slaughtered
local peoples with abandon—even people on

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.899
whom their own survival depended because many
adventurers had no knowledge of farming.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:23.550
Moreover most English settlers were as bigoted
as other Europeans in those days.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:29.630
But the “Black Legend” was a really powerful
idea in history for a long time--in fact,

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:34.780
when I was a kid growing up in Florida, I
was told that it was unfortunate Florida had

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:39.140
been a Spanish colony, because the English
were much kinder rulers.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.700
So by the end of the seventeenth century,
the rush for trade and empire was in full

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.700
swing.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.910
Plantations based on New World tobacco had
been set up in North America and sugar mills

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.370
in the Caribbean and South America.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:56.440
Mining and many other lucrative enterprises
as well as the promise of exploitable land

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.410
kept the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans crowded
with voyagers.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:05.760
All the while most native people ruled by
colonizers saw the vast majority of their

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.110
labor’s value exported.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:13.600
It was the beginning of the true globalization
we experience today, complete with all of

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.100
its contradictions and complexities.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:22.269
We live in a world today of tremendous abundance
where a pinch of sugar is not generally seen

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:24.790
as a great Christmas present.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:28.959
Starvation and child mortality are more rare
than they have ever been.

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:34.430
But we also live in a world with profound
inequality and injustice, where the powerful

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:38.170
have legal and social protections that the
weak do not.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:44.190
It’s important to remember that in all those
senses we are the products of history--but

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:47.470
of course we are also producing history.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.470
Thanks for watching.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:49.880
I’ll see you next time.
