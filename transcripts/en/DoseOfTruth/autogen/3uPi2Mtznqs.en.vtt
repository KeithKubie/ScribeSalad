okay so let me ask you another question

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100
okay so let me ask you another question
 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.370
okay so let me ask you another question
about that then so see one of the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380
about that then so see one of the
 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.499
about that then so see one of the
problems that I've had because I've been

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509
problems that I've had because I've been
 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.160
problems that I've had because I've been
trying to look at the the potential for

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
trying to look at the the potential for
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.900
trying to look at the the potential for
our true relationship between Islam and

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
our true relationship between Islam and
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.520
our true relationship between Islam and
Christianity you know to the degree that

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530
Christianity you know to the degree that
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.589
Christianity you know to the degree that
I understand Islam or Christianity which

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599
I understand Islam or Christianity which
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.750
I understand Islam or Christianity which
of course there's plenty to understand

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760
of course there's plenty to understand
 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.220
of course there's plenty to understand
about both so it's no easy thing to

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
about both so it's no easy thing to
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.230
about both so it's no easy thing to
manage but there is this claim as well

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
manage but there is this claim as well
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.080
manage but there is this claim as well
that that that's widespread and rather

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
that that that's widespread and rather
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.779
that that that's widespread and rather
vague that that Islam is in essence a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789
vague that that Islam is in essence a
 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.089
vague that that Islam is in essence a
religion of peace and but when I look at

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099
religion of peace and but when I look at
 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.519
religion of peace and but when I look at
the historical data say stemming from

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529
the historical data say stemming from
 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.910
the historical data say stemming from
the medina the medina time and then

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
the medina the medina time and then
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.310
the medina the medina time and then
moving forward and the fact that the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
moving forward and the fact that the
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170
moving forward and the fact that the
Muhammad was definitely someone who

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180
Muhammad was definitely someone who
 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.750
Muhammad was definitely someone who
engaged personally in warfare and in an

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
engaged personally in warfare and in an
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.690
engaged personally in warfare and in an
expansionist warfare it's not it's not

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
expansionist warfare it's not it's not
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.290
expansionist warfare it's not it's not
an easy thing for me to make the leap to

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300
an easy thing for me to make the leap to
 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.779
an easy thing for me to make the leap to
to comprehending or being able to accept

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
to comprehending or being able to accept
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.819
to comprehending or being able to accept
the claim that the fundamental doctrines

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
the claim that the fundamental doctrines
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.880
the claim that the fundamental doctrines
of Islam are peaceful are associated

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
of Islam are peaceful are associated
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.170
of Islam are peaceful are associated
with peace because it looks to me like

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180
with peace because it looks to me like
 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.549
with peace because it looks to me like
there's an element of it that's quite

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
there's an element of it that's quite
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.910
there's an element of it that's quite
militaristic and I've also thought that

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920
militaristic and I've also thought that
 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.319
militaristic and I've also thought that
let's say there's a religious element to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329
let's say there's a religious element to
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.880
let's say there's a religious element to
Islam and I mean this is not an original

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
Islam and I mean this is not an original
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.740
Islam and I mean this is not an original
thought obviously there's a religious

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750
thought obviously there's a religious
 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.480
thought obviously there's a religious
element Islam but there's also something

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
element Islam but there's also something
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.399
element Islam but there's also something
that's clearly more like a political

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
that's clearly more like a political
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.260
that's clearly more like a political
movement and more like a governmental

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
movement and more like a governmental
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.719
movement and more like a governmental
movement and that's also complicated by

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
movement and that's also complicated by
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.249
movement and that's also complicated by
the fact that there isn't any clear

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
the fact that there isn't any clear
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.140
the fact that there isn't any clear
separation between church and state and

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
separation between church and state and
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.539
separation between church and state and
Islamic doctrine as far as I can tell so

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
Islamic doctrine as far as I can tell so
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.270
Islamic doctrine as far as I can tell so
when we hear claims that are when claims

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
when we hear claims that are when claims
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.039
when we hear claims that are when claims
are made that Islam is essentially a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049
are made that Islam is essentially a
 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.950
are made that Islam is essentially a
religion of peace then that doesn't seem

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
religion of peace then that doesn't seem
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.770
religion of peace then that doesn't seem
to be the case with the Medina end of

that that emerge thereof and then part

that that emerge thereof and then part
of the problem is how do you reconcile

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
of the problem is how do you reconcile
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.249
of the problem is how do you reconcile
that with the contradictions in
