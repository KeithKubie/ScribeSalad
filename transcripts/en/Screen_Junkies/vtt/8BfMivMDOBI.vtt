00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.719
Ugh, we get it already.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.590
From the director of two good Batman movies
comes a film that will obliterate your eardrums

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.789
with deafening horn noises.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.200
When dream thief Dominic Cobb gets his toughest
assignment yet,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.020
he'll assemble a team of experts, including

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.700
this small boy who can suddenly learn to make
complex dream mazes

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.890
after doodling,
a chemist who is literally the worst driver

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.800
ever,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.300
and a sidekick whose only job is to explain the plot.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.000
"In a dream, you can cheat architecture into impossible shapes."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
"Five minutes in the real world gives you an hour in the dream."

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.300
"In the dream state, your conscious defenses are lowered."

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000
"You can't wake up from within the dream unless you die."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.670
"Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing is down there -
except for whatever might have been left behind

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.540
by someone sharing the dream who's been trapped there before."

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.970
 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.890
And yet, not even the characters in the movie
can figure out what's

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.410
going on.
"So what happens when we die?"

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.970
"What's a kick?"
"If this is my dream why can't I control this?!"

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.400
"Wait, who's subconscious am I going into
exactly?"

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.000
"I'm just trying to understand."
"How could you understand?"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.100
"You don't understand."

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.140
To get back his children, Cobb's team will have to fight anonymous dream soldiers who have no idea how to

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.100
hit anything with an automatic weapon, or duck.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.000
A
movie so complex, it requires intense concentration
at every moment -

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.380
which is really difficult when this guy goes
over important plot points in a heavy accent.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.590
"My main competitor is an old man in poor
health.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.820
His son will soon inherit control of the corporation."

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.370
A supposedly original film that's actually just The Matrix,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.770
but with creepier extras and unclear rules.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.300
Witness Leonardo Dicaprio fight his way through
any physical challenge,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.129
but struggle to squeeze through an alley way.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.280
Immerse yourself in the dreams of Christopher
Nolan,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.350
which apparently don't include sex, flying,
or

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.120
any other things normal people dream of.
A dream land where you can think of literally

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.400
any weapon,
but for some reason only dream of small-to-medium

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.950
sized guns.
Seriously, they couldn't dream up a tank or

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.220
something?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.300
George Takei

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.000
The son from Third Rock from the Sun

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and a dreidel.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.060
INCEPTION.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.060
If Cobb couldn't enter the country, wouldn't
Michael Cain just fly the kids out to him?

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.120
Ugh, whatever.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.290
