ANANT SHUKLA: Joining us all
the way from the United Kingdom,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.424
please give a warm
welcome to Polly Samson.

00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:06.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:10.050
So, Polly, let's
start off a little bit

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.360
about your upbringing and kind
of how your career started.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.650
So tell me about that
journey to becoming a writer.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.240
Where did you decide as
a student or as a child

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.620
that writing was what
you were going to pursue?

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.080
POLLY SAMSON: I've never decided
to write because I always

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.782
wrote.

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:29.240
And it wasn't until I had my
own children, and some of them

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.004
write and some of them
not such ready writers,

00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:34.420
but when I had my own children
I sort of-- aged about five

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.878
and I was thinking, well where
are all these little stories

00:00:36.878 --> 00:00:39.410
and poems, you know,
waiting for this eruption

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.240
of writing that never happened.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.330
I then realized that it
was just something in me.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.540
And it was something
I'd always done.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.319
And so there wasn't a
sort of blinding flash

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:49.610
where I decided to be a writer.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.420
It was just a
natural progression.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.800
ANANT SHUKLA: Progression, yeah.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.010
There's bits and pieces
of your family history

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.630
that shows up in both of the
collections and the novel

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.930
as well kind of.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.660
Is there a particular
story that inspired you

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.620
for a certain passage or--
you have a rich family history

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.430
that just learning
about is fascinating,

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.580
I'm sure, for the audience.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.790
POLLY SAMSON: It's a great
well, my family history.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.800
For those who don't
know, my parents

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.490
were both refugees
into England in 1938.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.290
My mother was 6 at the
time, half Chinese,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.230
coming from Shanghai
fleeing the Japanese.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.700
And my father, who
was 10 at the time,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.576
came from Hamburg on
the Kindertransport.

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:34.200
I mean obviously they
didn't meet then.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.210
They had very
different journeys.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.670
My father, there was
a large Jewish family

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.680
that embraced him.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.870
And he went on to study
and become a journalist.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.260
My mother, unfortunately,
ended up in an orphanage

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.480
and at the age of 16 took
herself back to China

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.900
to find her father.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.420
She didn't find her father
but she found a revolution.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.710
And she joined Mao's army and
for 10 years was in Red China

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.679
until eventually
she got out again.

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:03.470
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.761
POLLY SAMSON: So there's a
lot there for me to draw on.

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:09.380
And I don't directly write
about their histories

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.750
but it certainly
informs a lot that I do.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.670
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.910
Along that journey of
writing between novelist,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.480
between short stories,
obviously there's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.234
a different process
that's involved.

00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:23.650
Mentally you need to change
the way you're going to write.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.733
Can you tell me a little
bit about that transition

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:27.560
between the different
writing styles,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.552
between lyrics,
between-- if there's

00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:32.260
major events kind of
that drive you again

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.850
in one of these
directions or this

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.400
is when you decided I'm
done with my first novel

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.900
and now I'm going to
work on short stories.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.940
Now I'm going to try lyrics.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.065
Kind of how did that begin?

00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:41.480
POLLY SAMSON: No,
it's again, I think

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.710
every story finds its medium.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.040
Writing a short story
is almost simpler

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.094
because you can keep the
whole idea in your head

00:02:52.094 --> 00:02:54.260
without feeling like your
brain is going to explode.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.340
It's very containable.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.420
It goes very well with
having small children

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.712
actually because you don't
need to write anything down.

00:03:01.712 --> 00:03:03.586
But you've got this
whole other secret world.

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:05.300
And you're sort of
wandering around doing

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.140
the rest of your life and
kind of writing and editing.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.410
So that by the time I write a
short story, it's like typing.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.370
I've worked on it
so much in my head.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.260
But with a novel,
you know, your brain

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.260
would explode if you tried
to keep a whole novel

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.301
in your head in that way.

00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.080
So you have to be more,
in a way more rigorous.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.420
You have to sit at your desk
every day and work on it.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.490
And certainly towards the
end of writing a novel,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.490
there's a sort of
feeling of mounting panic

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.870
that you really don't want
to leave your desk at all.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.410
I can remember when I was
writing my first novel

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.530
and, you know,
the family kind of

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.930
knew to leave me alone in
the later stages of it.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.660
And there was this knock at
the door and it was my husband.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.690
And he said, we need to
go to parents evening.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.610
And I said, why do I have
to go to parents evening?

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.440
And he said, you're a parent?

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.490
So that gets a
little obsessional.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.680
And then lyric writing
is different again

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.570
because I'm not drawing
entirely on something in me.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.530
I've got this
wonderful prompt which

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.320
is that the music comes first.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.030
So lyric writing, again,
it takes place mainly

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.360
when I'm walking, much
less sitting at the desk.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.150
And I have-- I do
one song at a time.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.970
And I have a track
in my earphones.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.920
And it's playing and playing
and playing and I often do that.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.550
I think it's often referred to
as the Paul McCartney method.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.730
You know, scrambled
eggs was "Yesterday".

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.710
And I start to make
up something and then

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.970
gradually some sort of
meaning will emerge.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.659
And so it's miles on the
feet for a song as well.

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.450
ANANT SHUKLA: So even
within "The Kindness"

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.812
I think there are entire
chapters that on their own

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:38.770
could be a short story.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.300
Did you find yourself
picking up pieces

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.050
that you didn't include
in "Perfect Lives"

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.275
or in other kind
of collections you

00:04:45.275 --> 00:04:47.650
were working on that you then
incorporated in and changed

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.540
the characters or--

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.310
POLLY SAMSON: No, not really.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.020
ANANT SHUKLA: Do
you have a stash

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.314
that you keep somewhere
of material I want to--

00:04:52.314 --> 00:04:53.730
POLLY SAMSON: I
really wish I did.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.460
I don't, actually.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.840
"The Kindness" started
life in a different format.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.500
I was feeling quite
militant about short stories

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.280
because publishers
certainly in the UK,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.669
I think it's different
in the US, but in the UK

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.460
there's a kind of
self-fulfilling prophecy,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.520
oh you know, short
stories don't sell.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.150
And so my last collection
had been a collection

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.437
of linked short stories.

00:05:16.437 --> 00:05:18.770
And so I thought, well I'll
take this one stage further.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.150
I'll do a novella.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.650
And at the end of the novella,
my main character, Julian,

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.160
would have an explosion
of creativity and within

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.160
that he would write
some short stories that

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.220
would show that he's come
to some sort of realization

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.190
of the events of his life
that he hadn't understood

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.650
in the novella.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.350
And so I did start
"The Kindness"

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.789
by writing his short stories
and then very quickly realized

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.830
that however militant I
felt about short stories,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.426
it was better to
get the novel right

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:48.800
and that it needed
to be a novel.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.180
And things find their form.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.369
And that demanded to be a novel.

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:54.160
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.580
You mentioned about your
creative process walking.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.890
Kind of for you, where do
you find that inspiration?

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.534
Is it just walking the dog
outside, taking in the air,

00:06:02.534 --> 00:06:03.450
sitting in your study.

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.116
You've mentioned a
few different things.

00:06:05.116 --> 00:06:09.370
POLLY SAMSON: Yeah, well I can't
sit and stare at a blank screen

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.286
because I find that
really agitating.

00:06:11.286 --> 00:06:13.206
And I don't know how
anyone does that.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.830
I mean there are a
lot of people who'll

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.880
say writing is about
fixing the bum to the seat.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.840
Well I don't really
agree with that.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.460
I think, you know, I've
got a really grateful dog.

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.530
He's very keen on
this idea that writing

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.920
is about doing about
10 miles walking a day.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.950
And I think that if you walk
and you're thinking about it,

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.240
and I often do something
called method writing, where

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.790
I walk as my character,
and whatever is happening,

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.840
I see it through my
character's eyes.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.760
And you know it can be
quite embarrassing at times,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.190
you know, because my main
character in "The Kindness"

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.080
is a man called Julian.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.710
You know, women are coming
towards me and I'm Julian

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.040
and I'm giving them the
once over because I really

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.380
convince myself that
I am that character.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.520
And by the time you get back
to the desk, it does, it flows.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.739
You know, if you put the
miles in on your feet

00:07:00.739 --> 00:07:02.530
and you've really
managed to think about it

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.000
and you've really got under
the skin of that character,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.867
there's no trouble once
you get back to your desk.

00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:10.200
ANANT SHUKLA: I know we've
talked-- you write some times

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.716
about the inspiration.

00:07:11.716 --> 00:07:13.090
Are there particular
authors that

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.390
have influenced you a
lot, a particular time

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.014
period in writing, whether
it's UK literary, history

00:07:19.014 --> 00:07:21.680
American literary history, other
parts of the world where you're

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.680
drawing short stories and fables
that have been strung together?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.210
For you, who are those
kind of well muses?

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.080
POLLY SAMSON: Well my
main inspiration probably

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.420
came from-- I
worked in publishing

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.760
in the 1980s in the UK.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.390
And I worked for a company
called Jonathan Cape which

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.420
was the literary publisher.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.590
And it was run by a total
genius called Tom Maschler.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.050
And, you know, I mean he
invented the Booker Prize,

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.550
for example.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.810
He published, you name some
great authors, Martin Amis,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:58.010
Ian McEwan, Nadine Gordimer,
Doris Lessing, Bruce Chatwin,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.230
Margaret Atwood, Salman Rushdie.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.900
You know, I mean it was
just ridiculous our list.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.240
You know, it was a
wonderful place to work.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.820
And it meant that I read really,
really great books for my job.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.450
It was heavenly.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.960
And so I think that
period of literature

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.900
has been very influential
because I read so much of it.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.640
And nowadays I still read
a lot of my contemporaries

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.890
but I'm having a surreal
moment of catching up

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.580
with the Victorians and
I'm loving it, actually.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.060
It's good to go back.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.560
It's good to go back.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.549
There is so much great
stuff in every period.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:35.929
And then poetry-- when
I'm writing fiction

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.750
I don't read fiction-- but
I start every day by reading

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.100
really good poetry and different
poets for different books.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:48.640
I mean "Perfect Lives" I read
a lot of Neruda strangely.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.230
And for "The
Kindness", I started

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.150
with one of my favorite
poets W.B. Yeats

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.740
and then very quickly
realized that I really

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.620
needed to get into
John Milton because I'd

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.650
made Julian a Milton scholar.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.820
So I spent a year
reading "Paradise Lost"

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.790
which was not a year lost to me.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.390
It was a wonderful year.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.620
And then another
poet who I adore

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.590
is a contemporary poet
called David Wevill who--

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:20.160
I don't know how well known
he is but he is amazing.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.110
And I'd say that
if anyone's looking

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:24.750
for a contemporary
poet-- he lives in Texas.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.530
I think he's probably
in his 80s by now--

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.940
he has published since the
early '60s consistently.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.690
Not a bad word
flows from his pen.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.389
Just incredible stuff.

00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:39.430
ANANT SHUKLA: You just
mentioned "Paradise Lost".

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:41.610
I think there are
overt references.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.500
There are references
that you would

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.260
have to read the kind
of whole story together.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.832
For you was that the
driving factor in your-- I

00:09:50.832 --> 00:09:53.290
know you mentioned you don't
organize it kind of in a web--

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:56.430
but how did you decide where
to weave in "Paradise Lost"?

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.202
Or did you have a scheme
or an outline for you

00:09:59.202 --> 00:10:00.660
that you said these
are references.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.243
I know Zephyr.

00:10:01.243 --> 00:10:03.470
I know there's Lucifer.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.330
He's a scholar.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.560
POLLY SAMSON: Yeah, it just
gave me a feeling of glee

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.800
while I was writing because
it's a kind of secret layer

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.060
in the book because
actually I think

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.587
there are very few people who
really know "Paradise Lost".

00:10:15.587 --> 00:10:17.920
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah, here it's
required reading, I think,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.790
in middle school, high
school, and then people forget

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:20.150
about it.

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.660
POLLY SAMSON: And I
think in England it's

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:22.630
also required reading.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.671
And I think there's nothing
like required reading

00:10:24.671 --> 00:10:26.700
to put people off a writer.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.130
And so I was lucky, you know.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.860
I have no formal education
so I came to it on my own.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.350
And it was a joy
because it takes you off

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.210
into so many areas, you know,
labyrinthine kind of footnotes.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.580
If you get the Longman edition
which has amazing notes

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.470
I mean the classical references,
the biblical references.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.530
It's an education all
on its own as well as

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.290
being the most extraordinary
piece of writing.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.130
And so, yeah, I
think-- I'm sorry.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.010
What was the question?

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.461
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah, I think
you've answered it, yeah.

00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:01.210
And along with that,
I think the research,

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.922
I know you do a lot of research
going into your novels.

00:11:03.922 --> 00:11:06.130
For you this novel took a
little bit longer to write.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.720
Kind of why did it
take longer this time?

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.240
Was it the research that
you were doing differently?

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.270
Are you researching
characters specifically?

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:16.037
Or you come up with an idea
for a plot and then decide,

00:11:16.037 --> 00:11:17.620
if I research this,
it'll become a lot

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:19.750
more concrete and descriptive.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.500
POLLY SAMSON: Well I think
I could blame YouTube

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.850
for some of the time that
it took because, of course,

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.380
it is the perfect
writer's resource.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.500
You don't have to go and
wander around Amsterdam.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.190
You can just go on to YouTube
and you can find that street

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.520
and you can find
lovely clips of it.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.020
And it really does
help enormously.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.630
I mean, another
thing that YouTube

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.010
was brilliant for while
I was writing this novel

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:46.820
was there's a scene, and
it's quite a pivotal scene,

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.140
where my character Julian gets
to see-- he has a friend who's

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.910
a medical student--
and he gets to see

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.530
his sperm under the microscope.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:56.920
And I wanted to
write this piece.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.420
And I wanted to
write it, you know,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.280
I didn't want to just write,
and they look like tadpoles.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.050
I wanted to kind
of get something

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.557
more out of the scene because
it's such an important scene.

00:12:05.557 --> 00:12:07.140
And so I thought,
oh I'm going to have

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.030
to go to a fertility clinic
or what am I going to do.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.250
And then eventually
I went YouTube.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.050
They'll be a scientist.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:16.150
He'll have posted some
sperm under the microscope.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.970
So it was like a little
bit of trepidation

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.520
to put it in the search.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.100
And what came up was very
surprising and very helpful,

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.940
which is that a lot
of young men seem

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:31.720
to like to make films of their
sperm under the microscope

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.240
and post them onto YouTube and
play a guitar solo with them.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.260
So hurray for those men.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.570
So yeah, I got to write that
passage with plenty of input

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.295
from YouTube and it was great.

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:44.670
ANANT SHUKLA:
Timing wise, right,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.770
I think you had other
events going on in your life

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.200
that you worked on it for a
bit, put it aside, came back.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.830
POLLY SAMSON: I
think the reason it

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.150
took-- my first
novel to first draft

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.840
took six weeks and this one to
first draft took over a year.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.930
And I think really
the main difference

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.546
was that with my first novel
I had a lot of small children.

00:13:05.546 --> 00:13:07.170
So it was like I've
got to get it done.

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:07.810
I've got to get it done.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:10.268
You know, I'm really meant to
be doing something else here.

00:13:10.268 --> 00:13:11.650
Got to get this done.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:14.170
And I was able to take my
time with my second novel.

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:15.770
And you know it's a luxury.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.440
It's a luxury to take your time.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:17.940
That's good.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.020
ANANT SHUKLA:
Shifting gears a bit,

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.686
we've talked a lot
about "The Kindness".

00:13:20.686 --> 00:13:23.490
For the "Perfect Lives" kind
of I found it very fascinating

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.240
the way you've
structured the story.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.300
It is not necessarily
a linear kind

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.940
of plot line, the
characters again

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.880
weaving in and out of
each other's lives.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.370
For you, kind of, where did that
idea and inspiration come from?

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.160
POLLY SAMSON: It
was never planned.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.540
And nothing I ever write
seems to be planned.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.130
Everything takes on
a life of its own.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.210
And with "Perfect
Lives" it really

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:47.720
was that I wrote one story,
and then I wrote another story.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.481
And what happened, for
example, the reason

00:13:49.481 --> 00:13:51.230
that the characters
kept emerging was they

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.090
kept kind of-- a character who
was a minor character in one

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:55.870
story, I'd come to
write the next story

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:57.911
and this character would
be sticking the hand up.

00:13:57.911 --> 00:13:58.785
Me, me, me.

00:13:58.785 --> 00:13:59.410
Write about me.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.190
And so for example
the first story

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.345
I wrote was called
Barcarolle and it

00:14:04.345 --> 00:14:07.340
was about a piano tuner
who has terrible--

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.400
He was supposed to
be a concert pianist

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.670
and then stage
fright did for him.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.790
And it's during
his day as a piano

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:17.590
tuner he meets a lot of
pianos and a lot of people.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.820
So I'd written that story.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.110
And then I knew that the
next story I wanted to write

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.004
was inspired by my
husband's last tour,

00:14:26.004 --> 00:14:26.920
the On an Island tour.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.040
We went to Hamburg
which is where

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.280
my Jewish family were from.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.380
And I was standing at
the back of the stage

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.500
while the audience were sort
of screaming for an encore.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:41.990
And I had a really unhealthy
conflicted feeling.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:43.857
I had to keep saying,
it's not them.

00:14:43.857 --> 00:14:44.440
It's not them.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.590
There was something about
these people shouting

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.070
that gave me the chills.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:53.137
And I wanted to express that
second-hand memory thing.

00:14:53.137 --> 00:14:54.720
You know nothing
happened to me but it

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.420
happened to my ancestors.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.730
And they didn't do anything
but maybe their ancestors did.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:05.860
And it's a very
difficult emotion.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.290
And so I wanted to explore that.

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.780
And so I knew that I was
going to have a musician.

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.940
And I knew she was
going to be Jewish.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.630
And I knew she was
going to go to Hamburg

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.713
and she was going to play.

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:16.380
And she was going to
have those feelings.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.312
And so I was thinking, well
maybe I'll make her a pianist.

00:15:19.312 --> 00:15:21.840
Yeah, OK, who is she?

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:25.120
And then I sort of thought back
to the story I had just written

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.530
and there was just a minor
character in their called,

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.430
whose piano was being tuned,
called Aurelia Leiberman.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:31.640
And I thought Leiberman?

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.340
She's obviously Jewish.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.740
And so that's really how
one emerges from another.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.486
It's really not planned
and then it gets to be fun.

00:15:39.486 --> 00:15:41.110
You know, once you're
a few stories in,

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.110
you do, you start looking
for them and thinking,

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.670
I'm going to tell your a story.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.010
And it's great.

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:48.450
It's really, really a
lovely form, I think,

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.970
the linked short story form.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.060
I'm a huge fan of linked
short stories anyway.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:58.830
I mean I love Elizabeth Strout's
"Olive Kitteridge" and I love,

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:01.830
there's a book by Daniel
Kehlmann called "Fame" which

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.780
is again linked stories.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.260
Wonderful, I think.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.470
It's a good form.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.470
ANANT SHUKLA: You touched upon
the piano and piano tuner.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.550
The piano seems to manifest
itself in almost every story.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.240
Kind of for you, what
is that symbolism?

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.150
Is it from your own
musical background

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.360
that you want to use that
as the main motif or--

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.920
POLLY SAMSON: Yes, well what
happened was I had three sons

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.890
and I wrote.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.360
And then I had a
princess and I also

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.860
knew she's going
to be my last baby.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.420
So I told myself I
wasn't going to write

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.180
because of having this
rather obsessive personality.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.830
Writing kind of blots out
children while I'm doing it.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.700
And I thought, I'm really
going to just enjoy my children

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.750
and particularly my last child.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:45.220
I'm not going to write.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.690
I'm not going to write.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.350
And a couple of my boys
were learning piano.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.810
And when they had to do
their piano practice,

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.220
you know like lots
of boys, there

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.720
didn't seem to be
anything you could

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:57.542
do to persuade them to sit
down and do their practice.

00:16:57.542 --> 00:16:59.000
And so I said to
the piano teacher,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.260
would it help if
I learned and then

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.070
at least I could be helpful.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.230
And she said yeah, that
sounds like a good idea.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.890
But the thing is
I am quite a geek.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:10.800
So as soon as I
started learning,

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.500
I kind of took it all in like
I was spending sort of hours.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.584
I could have been writing.

00:17:14.584 --> 00:17:16.291
Learning the piano,
I mean, I was playing

00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:17.740
the piano for five hours a day.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.920
The children would
come home and they'd

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.378
say I need to do
my piano practice.

00:17:20.378 --> 00:17:22.069
Sorry, I'm doing mine right now.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.369
Took all the exams.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.569
I was like a child prodigy.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:29.980
Rose up through the levels
and kept on taking the exams,

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.530
kept on playing the piano.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.370
But it's not my thing.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.030
And so when it
came to the moment

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.955
when my daughter then
went to nursery school

00:17:37.955 --> 00:17:40.080
and I knew that it was time
to start writing again,

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.910
I was just absolutely
soaked in piano.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.800
And you know the piano became
the metaphor for everything

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.840
I wanted to say.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.890
There's so much to do with
learning a musical instrument

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:52.682
that's fascinating.

00:17:52.682 --> 00:17:54.556
ANANT SHUKLA: So I think
this is a good segue

00:17:54.556 --> 00:17:55.510
for our next section.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.910
We just talked about
your musical piano

00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:59.880
training and whatnot.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.830
So let's listen
to a bit of a clip

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.580
from some of the lyrics
you've worked on.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.705
And we can discuss with you
your songwriting process.

00:18:06.705 --> 00:18:09.440
[MUSIC - PINK FLOYD, "HIGH
 HOPES]

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.580
ANANT SHUKLA: So how did this
collaboration with your husband

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.472
begin?

00:18:40.472 --> 00:18:42.430
POLLY SAMSON: He wasn't
my husband at the time.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.180
He was my boyfriend.

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:49.970
He had gone into a
studio and he was

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.440
jamming with Rick Wright and
Nick Mason for the first time,

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.770
I think, since the '70s that
they played freely together.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:01.040
I at the time had what's in
England called glandular fever.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.660
Here I think it's
called Epstein-Barr.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.734
So I was at home with a
massively high temperature.

00:19:06.734 --> 00:19:08.150
And he'd come back
in the evenings

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.030
and play me this beautiful
music and then say,

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.570
but yeah, I just need a lyric.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.330
I was working as a journalist
at the Sunday Times right then.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.200
I had no desire
to be a lyricist.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.760
But I was lying
there with this fever

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.150
and I would occasionally sort
of say some obscure thing,

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.200
kind of, I was just thinking
about ivy growing over a door,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.260
and he would write it down.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.470
And then these things would
start sort of emerging.

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.849
And so it kind of,
he'd show me something

00:19:36.849 --> 00:19:38.390
and he'd say I think
this would work.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.600
And I'd look at it once
I'd taken something

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.940
to bring the fever down.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.540
And I'd think, not sure
that does work quite.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.270
Let me have a little
fiddle with that.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.980
And so it progressed and then
it became more formalized.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.090
And at the beginning
he said that, you know,

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.770
that he agreed that I wouldn't
have to have my name on it.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.670
And I know that sounds odd.

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.850
But it was a different
world back then.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.850
It was a misogynist culture,
particularly rock and roll.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.600
Pink Floyd I don't think had
had any female contributors.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:13.780
I had this real sort of terror
that if my name was on it,

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:17.800
I would-- somehow people would
start calling me Yoko Ono.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.441
And I think about
that now and I think

00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:22.690
what would be wrong with that?

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:25.440
I mean she's an amazing artist.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.970
She's an innovator.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.090
She's never stopped.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:29.390
She's incredible.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.590
She's a woman in her 80s
who's still producing new art.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:34.580
So I now think,
please, you know,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.730
if anyone would like to call
me Yoko Ono I'll accept that

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.390
with grace and
enormous happiness.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.590
But at the time that seemed
like kind of an insult.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.260
And so David said, OK
it's fine, I'll pay you,

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.460
and I thought, yeah, but your
name doesn't need to be on it.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.030
And then by the
time we'd finished,

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.871
he sort of said, I'm
sorry but, you know,

00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:56.870
you're getting a credit.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:57.930
Your name's going on it.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:01.280
And one day you will
thank me because you

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.380
know uncredited work
is a horrible feeling.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.270
And he was right because I'm
really proud of that work.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.550
And of course now I
would really hate it

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:09.630
if my name wasn't on it.

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:12.420
But at the time I was
a shrinking violet.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.460
ANANT SHUKLA: Again
here, I know David often

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.520
mentions you're his muse.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.340
For you, again,
when you're writing,

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.580
is there a muse that's
spurring on a certain lyric one

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.080
way or the other
or again is it just

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.610
you're walking
outside with a tune,

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:24.950
you writing and composing?

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:26.325
POLLY SAMSON: Well
it's the tune.

00:21:26.325 --> 00:21:28.650
I mean the muse is the
tune and so I suppose

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.670
the tune has come from David.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.400
So you know, I mean, I know
it sounds a bit happy couple-y

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.530
but I'd have to say that
the muse for the lyrics

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.270
is quite clearly David because
the music is always first.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.500
And it's a wonderful
thing to write a lyric

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.600
because you have this prompt.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.090
You know, instead of that
thing, there's no blank page

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.780
because it's there.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.210
The music is there.

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:56.480
When I write a lyric, he
scats a top line melody.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:01.192
And the scat, it feels like
it's just under the surface

00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:02.650
there are these
words and it's just

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.900
a matter of sort of bringing
them up to the surface.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.820
It's a very different process
from writing something

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.999
from what I think of as scratch.

00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:13.540
ANANT SHUKLA: Is there ever an
instance where the lyrics came

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.750
first and then the music or?

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.270
POLLY SAMSON: I think
just once and that

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.810
was on the last Pink Floyd
album, "The Endless River".

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.600
And because it was--
the "Endless River"

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.930
was put together from that
session I mentioned earlier.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:31.860
There were so many
beautiful pieces of music

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.364
and about 10 or 11 of them made
it on to the "Division Bell".

00:22:35.364 --> 00:22:37.780
And for years we'd always been
listening to the other bits

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.960
of music, you know.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.170
And they were lovely and
so there came a moment

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.750
where it just felt that
those pieces of music

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.730
should be released.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.810
And Rick had sadly died.

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:55.540
And so I just felt awkward about
imposing a lyric on something

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.134
from a time when Rick was alive.

00:22:58.134 --> 00:23:00.300
And so I didn't want to
write it to a piece of music

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.970
but I knew that
David wanted a song.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:07.570
And I knew that he wanted a
song to be that big full stop

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.480
on the Pink Floyd history.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.410
So I wrote that song to "Louder
Than Words" to sort of try

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.430
and sum up the thing to
do that I'd noticed most

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.850
about the members of Pink
Floyd which is just how

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:24.190
eloquently they speak to each
other with musical instruments.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:27.010
But put them in a room
together and it is the most

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.020
awkward thing you can imagine.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.960
No one speaks.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.515
It's so yeah, so that's
what that song's about.

00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:36.890
It's about men who don't use
words to speak to each other

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.424
but who have something else.

00:23:38.424 --> 00:23:39.340
ANANT SHUKLA: Awesome.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.798
Yeah, I think we're
going to listen

00:23:40.798 --> 00:23:43.970
to another clip from the solo
album "Rattle That Lock".

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.590
This one is called
"In Any Tongue".

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.150
Let's get the AV back up.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.629
[MUSIC - DAVID GILMOUR, "IN ANY
 TONGUE"]

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.420
ANANT SHUKLA: So obviously
some very strong war motifs,

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.429
the video itself as well.

00:24:35.429 --> 00:24:37.720
Tell me a little bit about
the process behind this song

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.280
and if it was any different
from what you just mentioned.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.350
POLLY SAMSON: Well
this was in a way

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:44.920
quite a daunting song to write.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.720
And it was the last
one that I wrote

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.230
for the "Rattle That Lock".

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:53.430
And it was a piece of music
that was so suggestive of what

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.090
it had to be about.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:25:03.030
And I for some reason felt
inhibited by the enormity

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.820
of that subject, you
know, the wastage of war.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:11.350
And so I spent a long time
reading poetry, basically

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.910
the poetry of
conscience, so you know

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:18.180
poetry written by people who
had served in Afghanistan,

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.040
a lot of different poetry.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.970
I mean I even read the
poetry of the Taliban.

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:27.050
I wanted to sort of read a
lot of poetry to do with war.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:29.690
And I kind of got really
bogged down in it, I mean.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:34.620
And it got to the point where
I couldn't write a word.

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.510
And so I read more and more of
these collections of poetry.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.971
And in the end David
said, it doesn't matter,

00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:40.720
it doesn't matter.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.280
You know, if it doesn't
make it on to the album,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.029
it doesn't matter.

00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:45.750
You know he's very,
very good like that.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.310
And I think it was
kind of the last day.

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.289
And I thought, oh it's
such a great tune.

00:25:50.289 --> 00:25:52.330
I don't want to be
responsible for this not going

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:53.400
on the album.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.310
And I sat in the
sunshine and just

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.630
thought, why am I making
such a meal of this.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.900
I know what I think.

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.580
I know exactly what I think.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.880
And I think I wrote the lyric
in maybe 10 minutes once I'd

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.540
give myself a firm talking to.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.736
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:26:06.736 --> 00:26:09.530
I think we want to open
it up to any audience

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:13.390
Q&amp;A. If you guys
have any questions,

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:16.299
now's a great time to
ask Polly on everything

00:26:16.299 --> 00:26:17.090
she's talked about.

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.852
We have some mics that
will be coming around.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.990
AUDIENCE: Polly, when
you write a short story

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:36.320
you said you have-- you sort
of have it floating your head.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.620
When you're doing a novel,
are you carrying the ending

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.680
in your head and then you're
just letting the story progress

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.300
and the characters develop?

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:51.260
You don't really know how you're
going to get to the ending?

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.037
POLLY SAMSON: Yeah.

00:26:53.037 --> 00:26:55.120
It's a great question
because it is very different

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.230
from a short story,
writing a novel.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.140
And I think it's very
different for different sorts

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:00.890
of novelists.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.800
I have a friend who
plots the whole thing.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.680
And I'm quite envious, really.

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.170
You go look in her
writing room and there it

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.860
is, chapter 1, chapter 2.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.910
And she knows
everything she's doing

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:13.540
and it's this
wonderful scaffolding

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.060
and she just hangs the
writing on the scaffolding.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.970
But I have to admit
that that would bore me.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.830
I know who my characters are.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.750
I know what their
moral problems are.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.224
I know the moral choices
they have to make.

00:27:26.224 --> 00:27:28.390
But other than that, I don't
really know the ending.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:29.610
And things change.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.410
I mean this method writing,
that's when things change.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.050
I mean walking as that person
and thinking as that person

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:41.220
and responding to things
as that person makes

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:44.962
the story and the journey
to the end very different

00:27:44.962 --> 00:27:46.420
from something I
might have thought

00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.020
I was doing in the beginning.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.790
And that's what makes
it exciting actually

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:54.550
for me is I like the surprises.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.090
I like the way that
things I thought

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:59.030
I was going to do just change.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:02.060
It's endlessly surprising

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.410
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.420
Question in the back.

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.120
AUDIENCE: So
songwriting is something

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.210
that's always interested me.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.580
And one of the things
that I've always wondered

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:18.120
is after a certain point,
you become famous, right,

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.885
and you're living a different
sort of life than other people

00:28:22.885 --> 00:28:24.260
and you're seeing
things that are

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:28.120
different than other people,
than an average person.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:34.380
And yet often when artists
become famous their albums,

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.010
not always, will become better
and better and better, OK,

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.093
sometimes worse, but better
and better and better.

00:28:39.093 --> 00:28:41.450
And I have always wondered
how do you actually

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:45.610
continue to kind of be
hungry, continue to see things

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.525
from the view of
non-famous people

00:28:48.525 --> 00:28:50.900
who have a very different,
potentially, view of the world

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.275
that maybe you
don't have anymore

00:28:52.275 --> 00:28:55.410
and still connect with people.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.430
It's something I've
just always wondered.

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.280
How does Pink Floyd
or David or you

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.300
get down and still write a song
today that can connect with us?

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.060
Thank you.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.350
POLLY SAMSON: Thank you.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.700
I don't feel like I
have a wall anywhere

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.430
built between me and anyone.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.300
I don't feel famous,
I mean, and I'm not.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.370
So I can't answer how
it is to be famous.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:23.440
But I do know that we
live a very ordinary life.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.750
We don't-- we live
an ordinary life.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:28.090
Our children go to school.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:28.880
We cook.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.210
We walk.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.460
We walk our dog.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.130
Our friends are
not famous people.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.790
Our friends are, you know--
I feel very connected.

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.060
I don't feel my life has changed
because my husband is famous.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:43.200
If that answers the question.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:46.810
AUDIENCE: Sort of, I mean in the
sense that it's not just fame,

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:52.300
but it's you first are writing,
when your first writing

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.090
songs, your financial
position or view of the world

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.510
and everything has got to
be very different than once

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:01.005
you have, whether it's
specifically you that's famous

00:30:01.005 --> 00:30:02.505
or that world that
your living in is

00:30:02.505 --> 00:30:03.939
a very, very different world.

00:30:03.939 --> 00:30:05.980
And I mean, I don't know,
like "Comfortably Numb"

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.194
was written about being
on tour or something

00:30:09.194 --> 00:30:10.610
like that and
something like this.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:14.370
That's something that most of
us don't-- it's a great song--

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:15.970
but something most
of us don't have.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.840
I guess it's kind of how
do you think you can still

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.030
connect to people.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.280
POLLY SAMSON: OK there is
a one word answer to that.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.820
And it's the most
important thing

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.370
that a writer needs to
possess and it's empathy.

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.940
So you know it's
what I talked about.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.898
It's about, it's like
method writing, you know.

00:30:29.898 --> 00:30:32.920
It is about being able to
get under anyone's skin.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:35.860
And you know I
don't think there's

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:39.000
a writer alive who
hasn't got empathy

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.360
as their greatest skill.

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.568
I mean and if they haven't
they shouldn't be writing.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.709
ANANT SHUKLA: Another
question here.

00:30:47.709 --> 00:30:49.000
AUDIENCE: So I'll preface this.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.700
I'm not a published
author but I really

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.719
understand your method writing
that you were discussing,

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:56.510
that that's kind of
exactly how I do stuff.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:59.800
But when I do that, I find that
for every one finished product

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.570
that's like good and goes
somewhere, that's clever

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.362
and other people
might want to read it,

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.820
there's probably at least five
to nine other things I like,

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.944
eh, it kind of petered out.

00:31:07.944 --> 00:31:08.870
It didn't work.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:10.830
So you have two
published novels and I

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.560
was wondering how
many did you start

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.900
writing that just didn't
go anywhere or are you able

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.010
to salvage them somehow?

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.369
ANANT SHUKLA: You've got to
silence your inner critic

00:31:19.369 --> 00:31:21.910
because you know you say there
are eight or nine that are not

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:22.409
working.

00:31:22.409 --> 00:31:24.730
But that's your inner
critic is telling you that.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.600
And maybe your inner critic
is being too harsh with you.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:30.680
Just a thought.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.470
I don't have a load of
stuff that I've started.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.320
I tend to kind of-- if I
start something, I finish it.

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.920
But I take a long time
to start something.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.740
I have to know that
it's going to take time,

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.430
it's going to take energy, and
it's going to be obsessional.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.810
So I have to know that I'm
jumping into the right pool

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.020
before I take the leap.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.980
I've written one novel that
didn't reach full gestational

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.890
and it got to
about 20,000 words.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:00.960
And my inner critic
was deafening.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.520
And actually I found it on
an old drive the other day.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.920
And my inner critic on
that occasion was correct.

00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.280
It was terrible.

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:13.340
But you know I think it's
about starting the right thing

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.695
if that's any help.

00:32:14.695 --> 00:32:16.070
ANANT SHUKLA: That
kind of segues

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.236
to my next question in terms
of what's next for you?

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:19.000
Another novel?

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.598
Another short story collection?

00:32:22.598 --> 00:32:26.310
POLLY SAMSON: What's next
for me is another novel.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.940
I've got three novels
kind of float--

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.060
this is the thing about
selecting the right thing.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.406
There are three ideas kind
of flying around out there

00:32:33.406 --> 00:32:34.530
and it's which one to land.

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.290
I have no idea at the moment.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:40.900
And I can't wait to just pick
on one because then again you

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.870
can get into that total
obsession, tunnel vision,

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.370
and think about nothing but
that research, nothing but that.

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:51.181
And that is the greatest state.

00:32:51.181 --> 00:32:52.930
And I also want to
write some more lyrics.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.780
But I can't do both
things at once.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.860
I need to have just one
thing in my head at a time.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.780
So I'm at this
moment, I'm not sure

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:04.160
if it's lyrics
next or novel next.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:04.680
We'll see.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.180
ANANT SHUKLA: And
outside of writing

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.930
I know photography
is a big passion.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:09.620
What else kind of drives you?

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.578
POLLY SAMSON: Well
photography is a big passion

00:33:11.578 --> 00:33:13.480
because I'm not a
natural photographer.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.490
I'd say that because
I've always written

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:19.630
and it is the thing--
for most of my life

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:22.160
it has defined me, writing.

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.940
And photography doesn't
come naturally to me.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.510
So I love something that
I have to really work at.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:28.930
And I love learning.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:31.000
And the piano is the same thing.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.590
I like things that
are incremental.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.740
So you know I've had all sorts
of things that I can juggle.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.500
And that again is a kind of
incremental learning thing.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:44.180
And yeah, I still play the
piano and I play guitar.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.990
So, yeah, but my
passion is writing.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:48.680
ANANT SHUKLA: Great, great.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.290
Are there any other
audience questions?

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.470
So we're going to
start off with Polly

00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:58.326
reading a little bit, one short
passage from "The Kindness".

00:33:58.326 --> 00:34:00.700
POLLY SAMSON: So I'm going to
simply read the first three

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.190
pages just set in
August 1989 this bit

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:08.580
although the novel
spans 23 years.

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.590
"Lucifer flew well for
her in the fading light,

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.620
falling through the sky when
she summoned him and away again

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:17.610
towards a great bruising sunset.

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.550
She was alone on
the ridge at first,

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:23.090
just her, the bird,
and the wide open view.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:26.530
It was one of those nervy summer
days of sudden strong winds

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:28.889
that fretted the hawks
feathers as he stared at her

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.900
from his perch on her gauntlet.

00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.850
She was wearing a long red
shirt over jeans and sandals.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.790
Her hair was breaking
free of its band.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:40.190
A leather pouch hung from
her belt and a whistle

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.580
from a cord around her neck.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.949
The hawk braced his feet on her
wrist, making a leather tassel

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.721
swing from the gauntlet.

00:34:47.721 --> 00:34:49.679
She felt the breath of
his feathers on her face

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.800
as he departed.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.900
And she watched him go with
the wind right under his wings,

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.450
scattering crows like drops
shaken from an umbrella.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:01.530
Julia was trying her best to
get it right for the bird.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:04.115
The morsels were small
to keep him active.

00:35:04.115 --> 00:35:09.050
A shaming 26 ounces he'd weighed
on the scales that morning.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.480
She called him with a
whistle, two short bursts.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.670
And there he was.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:15.490
A dark cupid's bow
firing straight at her

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:17.420
from the heavens.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:19.350
She continued along
the ridge, Lucifer

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.730
steady on her arm, his manic
eyes never leaving her face

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.710
until she gave the signal.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.700
She sent him reeling to
and fro and neither of them

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:32.120
knew that this was to
be their last dance.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.360
The evening started to chill.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.400
She'd almost forgotten
that Julian was supposed

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.550
to be meeting her there.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.460
Or perhaps she'd
just given up hope.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.400
He was panting when
he arrived, still

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.820
red in the face from the
run up the hill, his bike

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.040
and its useless tire abandoned.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.670
He had the air of
a boy who'd crossed

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.070
three continents to
see her, his sweatshirt

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.920
knotted around his waist.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.960
Impossibly young
with hair falling

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:58.420
over his eyes and an uncertain
lope, one leg of his jeans

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.650
still tucked into his sock.

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.350
He didn't dare
kiss her, he said,

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:04.320
with the hawk glaring
at him like that

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.900
from the end of her wrist.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:10.020
The hawk shrugged his shoulders
and she sent him flying.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.080
They kissed and when Julian
stopped to glance nervously

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:15.480
at the sky, she took
off her gauntlet

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.880
and pushed his hand inside.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.760
She urged the hawk
with her whistle,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:24.150
moving Julian's arm up and down,
the gauntlets tassel dancing.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.900
But Lucifer only
soared higher, the wind

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.830
whispering murder into his ear
and deafening him to her call.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.400
Julia ran cursing, Julian
lolloping beside her.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.650
She grabbed back the gauntlet.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:38.660
And as the hawk
fell to his kill,

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:41.070
Julian's hands were
warm on her waist

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:43.760
and it seemed to them both
that the scream of the rabbit

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.420
went on forever.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.440
It was almost midnight when
she got back to Witchwood.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.060
She'd have stayed
at Julian's digs

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.580
until morning if it hadn't
been for Lucifer, bloody bird.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.670
She parked the car in the
lane, coaxed him from is crate,

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.360
and clipped him on.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.790
Lucifer shook out his
feathers a little irked

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:05.080
that somebody had
carelessly creased his cape.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.070
Fallen twigs cracked
under foot as she

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:09.880
cut through the copse, the
bird a resentful weight

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.820
on her arm, the accusatory
glitter of his eyes

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.630
the only brightness
beneath the trees.

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:16.690
The darkness dropped.

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.270
The branches stilled.

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:20.500
Witchwood stood
alone in the clearing

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.930
as unexpected as a
Grimms' Brothers cottage

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:26.300
with its wonky black
boards and crooked windows.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.820
At once she could
see a light was

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:31.550
on though she was certain
she'd switched everything off.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:34.150
Her face owlish white, Julia
slipped through the back gate,

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.260
whispering to Lucifer
as she transferred him

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.250
to his post in the shed
and all alone up the path.

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:44.070
Heart beating, a skittering
stone loose at the steps,

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.190
she pushed the door
open with her foot

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:49.420
and straight into the kitchen.

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.960
A gasp, mostly relief.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.890
Chris, her husband,
streaky hair flat his head,

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:59.280
his giant gray trainers kicked
halfway across the floor,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.810
chinkering his spoon in a cup.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:04.110
She took half a pace back.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:06.260
'Why the look of
surprise', he said.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.640
'I live here too, you know'

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.350
Maggie, his lurcher, quivered
in disgust beside him,

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:14.920
her nose pressed to his knee.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.770
'So here I am, home.' He
made a mockery of the word,

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.810
bristling with it, pointing
his spoon at her like a weapon.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.770
'I wasn't expecting you.'
She hung the leather gauntlet

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.070
on its hook, brain racing
for an alibi and stalling.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.070
'You gave me a fright.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:32.190
You could have been anybody.'

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.000
He cursed her for the
welcome, baring teeth older

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.222
than his mouth,
Nescafe and tobacco.

00:38:38.222 --> 00:38:38.930
'What did you do?

00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:40.554
Did you leave Lucifer
in the boot while

00:38:40.554 --> 00:38:43.740
'you--' 'I couldn't get the
car to start.' He snatched

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.450
the leather pouch from her and
threw the leftover bits of meat

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.140
to his dog, then
pulled it inside out.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.490
'If you don't clean it out,
they'll be maggots again.'

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:55.670
He was supposed to be away
until Christmas by which time

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.700
Julia promised
herself to be gone.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.120
His overalls fell open to
a Ramones t-shirt so faded

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.280
you'd have to already
know the name of the band

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.490
and down to a belt with
a large metal buckle.

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.950
He unloaded his pockets
over the kitchen counter

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:15.120
tobacco, Murray mints,
rolling papers, dope tin,

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.710
change clattering.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.970
His hair was dotted
with gray paint

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.720
like flies have been
laying eggs in it.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.310
'It's great you're so
pleased to see me', he said,

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:28.190
'a real treat.' 'Likewise'.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.070
I'll leave it there.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:32.801
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:32.801 --> 00:39:33.800
ANANT SHUKLA: All right.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.540
I think we'll segue then
to the second reading

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.670
from "Perfect Lives".

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:42.080
Everybody join me in giving
a great round of applause

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.876
for Ms. Polly Samson.

00:39:43.876 --> 00:39:44.376
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:44.376 --> 00:39:46.860
POLLY SAMSON: Thank you.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.640
So the thing to
say about this is

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:54.220
I've sort of taken a few
little bits of one story

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:58.430
and talking about real
life influencing something

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:02.200
you might write, when I wrote
this story or just before I

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.680
wrote it, I had
three friends, three

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.660
wonderful, wonderful women who
were married to really, really

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:09.040
boring men.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.980
And these really boring men
left these wonderful women

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.230
for other women.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:18.350
And these women who seemed to
have tired of these boring men,

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:22.671
all became stalkers
of their ex-husbands.

00:40:22.671 --> 00:40:24.170
And they would all
tell me about it.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:28.110
And the material was
just too good to waste.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:33.040
And you know the internet makes
stalkers of all of us, so yeah.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.248
Anyway it's called "Morgana".

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:43.010
"Morgana burst into my
life, jingling and jangling

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:45.620
armfuls of bracelets and
puffing thin cigarettes

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.230
that she rolled herself.

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:50.990
Silk flowers scattered here and
there in twists of dark hair,

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:55.552
fresh from her crisis and
still prone to sudden tears.

00:40:55.552 --> 00:40:57.760
My shoulders were not the
kind that usually got cried

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:01.140
on, a bit on the tense side I
suppose what with Simon working

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.470
all the time and Angus and
Ivan like leaky pockets,

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.840
never full no matter how
much I poured into them.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.480
Morgana's fandango,
what a nightmare.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.760
Things being thrown,
hot cups of tea

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.040
across the kitchen, Mike's
clothes into marine parade,

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.920
the photographs of their
wedding day removed

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.760
from the top of the piano,
put back again twice,

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.750
and removed again
with such force

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.370
that the glass
shattered in the frames.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:27.110
She was wild when he left.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:30.450
A river of tears washing over
a fortnight's dismal blowjobs

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:32.630
that failed to make him stay.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:34.970
She put half a brick through
the window of the basement

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:37.910
he was renting one night when
he wouldn't open the door.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:39.930
His girlfriend Elizabeth,
who he pretended

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.670
didn't live there
with him at all,

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.550
looked up from playing her
oboe straight at Morgana

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.720
outside on the pavement, and
laying the oboe carefully

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.250
down raised her arms to
release a long skein of hair

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:53.340
from its band,
sending it falling

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:56.400
and swinging down her
back like molten metal

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.260
and sashayed to the
telephone to call the police.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.890
Morgana's driving
is not improved

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:04.560
when she tells me
about these things.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.600
I had, though not
without misgiving,

00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.860
agreed to put my life
in Morgana's hands

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:11.200
a couple of afternoons a week.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.890
She was quite bold
when she suggested it.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.560
Mike did all the driving,
she told me one afternoon

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.940
when I'd come with my
films to the studio she ran

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.710
from the basement of her house.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:23.420
'After 29 years in
the passenger seat,

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.645
I'll be needing to brush up.

00:42:25.645 --> 00:42:28.400
I never even got to touch
the radio in our car.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.410
And the steering wheel was most
definitely out of bounds', she

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:35.230
said, the first time she sat
clutching my car's wheel.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:36.840
'I'm sure I could drive.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.540
I've definitely got a license
and I can remember taking a red

00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.310
Mini Moke right up the
middle of Portabella Market.'

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:44.980
I was in awe of her then.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.960
I was nervous when
she developed my films

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.950
and printed my
pictures, worrying

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.770
that my composition was not good
or the exposures ill judged.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.260
She made prints from
the best of them.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.410
There was glamor to her.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:57.910
She was festooned
with it, all those

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:01.630
bracelets she wore, the layers
of fine fabrics, the charms

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.310
and old meaningful rings that
hung from her neck clustered

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.400
together on a long gold chain.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.040
The hints of a rackety
life once lived up and down

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.870
the Kings Road.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.830
I called for her on
Tuesdays and Thursdays

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:15.580
at 2:30 in the afternoon
so we had a clear hour

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.670
to mow down pedestrians
before I had

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:22.320
to collect my pair of leaky
buckets from their school.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.240
Sometimes I could feel
my poor Peugeot quake.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.120
A variety of stimuli
could set Morgana off.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:32.150
An alabaster statuette
spied through his window

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:34.860
flaunting its nakedness
atop his new desk.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:39.040
'Do you suppose it reminds him
of her?' CDs or books spotted

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.020
lying on the
backseat of his car,

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.510
a thick one with an
irritating title.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:46.010
'The man on the cover looked
to be in fear of his life,' she

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.930
said, rattling my keys at
the ignition irritably.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.300
'What's he doing reading
self-help books?'

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.720
Sometimes, Morgana told me,
she couldn't sleep at night

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.420
and in the darkness she
tiptoed quite undetected

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:02.110
through the perfumed gardens
of Elizabeth's Facebook.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:04.470
Elizabeth seemed to have
accepted Morgana's alter ego

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:05.400
as a friend.

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.950
I said it just proved
how few friends

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.070
she had in the real world.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:12.150
Bang outside Mike's flat and
into a space either directly

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:14.450
behind or directly
in front of his car

00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:17.150
always seemed to Morgana
to be the perfect place

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:19.980
to practice parking
because curtains

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.360
were drawn at the front.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.000
They had been since
the last time he'd

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.360
allowed her over the threshold.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.400
And much to
Elizabeth's displeasure

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.790
and Morgana's later
mortification,

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:30.590
she and Mike had
ended up wrestling

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:33.320
on the floor like bad children.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:36.450
Once parked, Morgana was
able to nip out and search

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.400
for those little sharp
nuggets of information

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.880
that she so craved,
peering through the windows

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.132
of his black Audi.

00:44:42.132 --> 00:44:44.440
I watched her with her
hands against the glass

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:46.600
of the car that had
once been her chariot

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.490
and cringed as I imagined
Elizabeth or Mike seeing

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:51.020
her there.

00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.440
'Awaken the Giant Within'.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.950
'What's that supposed to mean?

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.950
When did he ever read books like
that?' She huffed as we pulled

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:00.590
away in a series
of ostrich jerks.

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:02.770
'Mirrors, mirrors' I yelled.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.950
'Silly little girl must be
telling him what to read.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:08.030
Self help.' Her bracelets
jangled as she thumped

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:09.730
the steering wheel for emphasis.

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:12.670
'He never had any trouble
helping himself', ignoring

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:14.531
the hooting from the car behind.

00:45:14.531 --> 00:45:16.530
'What do you suppose I
did to his giant, anyway,

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.530
to put it to sleep.' She
scraped the gears as she changed

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:20.520
into third.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.260
'Sorry,' she said to me and to
the man who'd overtaken shaking

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.010
his head.

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:26.010
'And he's listening
to Ting Tings.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.680
What's he doing listening to
the Ting Tings?' Thank you.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.430
ANANT SHUKLA: Thanks
again, everybody.
