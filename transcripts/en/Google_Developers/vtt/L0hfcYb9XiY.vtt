MARTIN OMANDER: Hello.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.810
My name is Martin
Omander and I welcome you

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.900
to "Google Root Access,"
the show featuring

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.410
actionable startup advice.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.320
My guest today is
Mani Doraisamy,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.560
founder of the
startup Guesswork.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560
Mani, tell us a bit
about your startup.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.601
MANI DORAISAMY: We are a
machine learning startup

00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:24.020
that helps to qualify leads and
increase customer conversion.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.455
We do that by building
predictive intelligence in CR.

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:29.080
MARTIN OMANDER:
Predictive intelligence

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.430
in customer relationship
management systems.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.390
MANI DORAISAMY: Right.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.890
MARTIN OMANDER: How
come you decided

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.000
to work on that problem?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.930
MANI DORAISAMY: We
found this problem

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.670
that the leads from the
internet marketing channel

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060
doesn't convert into
customers very well.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.460
For example, if you look
at real estate agents,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.050
they get like a
hundred leads per day.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.670
And out of the 100
leads, 90 leads

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.450
are from internet marketing,
like Trulia and Zillow.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.510
And 10 of them are from
traditional channels.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.320
But the problem is, out of the
90 leads, only five of them

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.940
convert into customers.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.230
On the other hand,
out of the 10,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.900
the same five leads convert
in the traditional channel.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.630
So very often, we see
real estate agents

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.850
and the small business owners
think that internet marketing

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.560
leads don't have
serious inquiries,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.609
and tend to ignore them.

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:20.400
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.010
And then they got rid of
half of their serious leads,

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.510
right there.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.790
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.730
Even though it can
double their sales,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.220
they start ignoring them.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.550
So that's how we decided
to build Guesswork.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.630
So we started building this
machine learning service

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.490
that predicts which of
them are serious inquiries

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.800
and which of them are casual
inquiries, so that they

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.530
can focus on the serious ones.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.094
And we desire to build
it part of the CRM.

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:45.010
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.260
So let's talk a bit
about objection handling.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.330
You are selling to CRM
vendors, I understand.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.710
And they are technically astute.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.680
And you talk to them
about machine learning.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.690
Do they ever tell you
that, hey, why should I

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.170
go with a small startup
and their machine learning,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.480
when there are big players
like Google, and IBM,

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.340
and who knows who
else, is doing machine

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.862
learning stuff with
more resources?

00:02:11.862 --> 00:02:13.570
Does that come up and
how do you respond?

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.694
MANI DORAISAMY: Very often.

00:02:14.694 --> 00:02:18.700
So in fact, you can't
compete with Google

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.150
on machine learning.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.560
They have years of head
start on machine learning.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.800
Have hundreds of engineers
working on machine

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.500
learning every day, right?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.750
So we don't compete with them.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.180
We leverage them.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.550
So we build on top of
Google Prediction API.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.760
Similarly, we build on top
of App Engine, and BigTable

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.620
to scale for huge
volumes of data.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.150
So in fact, whenever we talk
about using Google Prediction

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.770
API for machine learning,
most of the objections

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.529
about technology already
stop from the customers.

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:48.570
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, good.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.820
That's a good objection handling
technique, if it just stops it.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.570
So I could see a potential
other objection coming up, then,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.470
with somebody you're selling to.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.600
The customer saying, oh, you're
using Google Prediction API

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.620
and Google BigQuery.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.870
Why don't I just do that myself?

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.050
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.830
So our value comes
from the rule engine

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.350
that we are built on top
of, Google Prediction API.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.610
For example, think about the
same real estate example.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.860
If a customer asks for an
apartment in Palo Alto,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.120
right, the machine
learning algorithm

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.170
can come up with an apartment
recommendation, right?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.350
But then that apartment
could have been sold out.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.010
So the machine learning doesn't
give that intelligence by

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.750
itself.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.420
A rule engine which understands
that business context,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.750
and then decides to pick
the next-best alternative,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.640
is very important
for such cases.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.897
That rule engine is our IP that
we have brought into the table.

00:03:41.897 --> 00:03:42.980
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.475
And so you're
complementing the machine

00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:47.725
learning with the rule engine.

00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:47.990
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.730
MARTIN OMANDER: And you are
good at building rules engines,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.720
because you've been
doing that for a while.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.140
And then there's
something about focus

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.650
and the customer
leads there, as well.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.090
Tell me a bit more about that.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.040
MANI DORAISAMY: Sure.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.520
So we always know and talk about
technology, because, I think,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.155
there is part of
the stakeholders who

00:04:10.155 --> 00:04:12.830
are interested in-- I mean,
like for example, [? CT1s ?]

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.430
in a CRM company-- who was
interested in the value we

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.110
bring on in the
technology portion.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.970
But if you have to
convince the business guys,

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.110
then we have to talk
about what value we bring

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.960
and what business
problems we solve.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.140
So we always talk about how
we want to transform CRM

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.230
from being a record-keeping
system into a customer

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.500
conversion agent.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.300
That business value is what
convinces the stakeholders

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.430
in CRM who are
business guys, right?

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.230
Who are focused on solving
a business problem rather

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.720
then just a technology problem.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.770
So you have a combination
of both objection handling

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.470
for the technology
stakeholders as well as

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.660
business stakeholders.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.370
And that's very important when
you look at a target market

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.960
where you have
both stakeholders.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.043
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, I see.

00:04:59.043 --> 00:05:02.010
So into a sales meeting,
you come armed with here

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.320
is why this is good
for your business.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.010
And no technology
discussion there.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.120
And then when the
technology-- the CTO

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.680
and so on, they
kick the tires, you

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.670
can tell them that
this is good stuff.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.560
It will hold up.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.559
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:19.480
So I think it's always about
getting the entry into a sales

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.230
cycle where you convince the
business guys about the value

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.150
proposition.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.650
And then later on
in the sales cycle

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.370
where you talk about how
good your technology is

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.790
with the technology
decision-makers, right?

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.255
So we have both gatekeepers
that you need to cross.

00:05:32.255 --> 00:05:33.380
MARTIN OMANDER: Aha, right.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.630
And either one could stop you.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.260
So you'd better be
prepared for both.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.160
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.076
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:05:38.076 --> 00:05:41.000
So, Mani, you've been doing this
for a while with your startup

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.500
here.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.040
What would your advice be
for other startups building

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.430
on somebody else's technology?

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.270
And how to think about
objection handling,

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.260
and how to handle objections
in sales situations?

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.760
MANI DORAISAMY: I
think if you look

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.040
at choosing somebody
else's technology,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.850
it has to be always based on how
it adds value to the customers,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.430
right?

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.210
Very often, we see people
choosing a technology

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.030
because they get
marketing mileage, right?

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.710
Typically, there is this
business development guy

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.160
who is responsible
for partnership.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.850
And he finds that he'll
get more customers

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.117
if you have a big-brand
logo in their website.

00:06:20.117 --> 00:06:21.950
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, the
logo in the website.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.449
Yes.

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.340
I worked for a couple
of startups like that.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.340
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.010
So it's this you
scratch my back,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.770
I scratch your
back sort of thing.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.520
And that's the worst way
to choose a technology.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.590
I think the best way to look at
choosing others' technology is

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.400
to find out whether
you would choose

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.230
that technology irrespective
of the marketing or sales

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.140
mileage you will get out
of the big brand that

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.460
provides you that technology.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.410
I think that is the
one that will provide

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.090
long-term benefit
to the customers.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.340
And that way you will
win, irrespective

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.642
of what the other
company does for you.

00:06:54.642 --> 00:06:57.100
MARTIN OMANDER: And you'll be
able to handle the objections

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.320
better in the sales situation.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.320
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.240
And also I think the objection
handling is not just using

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.620
somebody else's technology.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.710
It's also about bringing
a complementary strength.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.460
It could be technology
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.380
For example, in our case, we
bring in that rule engine IP

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.320
into the table, right?

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.040
It helps because we have
14 years of experience

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.050
in building rule
engines already.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.990
During the initial
stages of a startup,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.790
customers don't buy the product.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.970
They buy you.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.330
Founders are the product, right?

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:28.640
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.460
The product might not be mature,
might not even exist, right?

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.990
MANI DORAISAMY: Exactly.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.740
So you make a personal
guarantee that you

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.542
will deliver the
results, irrespective of

00:07:36.542 --> 00:07:38.250
whether you have a
product or not, right?

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.290
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.790
MANI DORAISAMY: So I think this
notion of founder to market fit

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.110
is quite popular in the
investment community.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.120
Chris Dixon popularized it.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.060
But I think it's
equally important

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.310
during the initial
stage of the startup,

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.420
because you convince
the customers based

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.664
on the founders' strength,
and not just on the product.

00:07:57.664 --> 00:07:58.580
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.060
Well, thank you for coming on
and sharing your experiences

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:01.679
with us, Mani.

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:02.970
MANI DORAISAMY: Thanks, Martin.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:04.382
It's my pleasure.

00:08:04.382 --> 00:08:06.090
MARTIN OMANDER: Thank
you for joining us.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.880
We hope you found something
you can use in your startup.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.180
Your input matters.
