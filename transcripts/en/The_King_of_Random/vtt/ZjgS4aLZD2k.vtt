00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.022
In today's video, we are taking
an ultrasonic vaporizer,

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:04.983
seeing if we can make
a colored mist,

00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:05.807
and if we can,

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:07.000
what we can do with it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.080
[Music]

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.000
Guys, this is
an ultrasonic vaporizer.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's the component

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.200
that's normally found inside of
a humidifier to make the mist.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.700
It makes the vapor
that comes out of a humidifier.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.200
In this container here,
we've got a big fancy one.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.200
It's basically 12

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.600
of these little ones all wired
up together in one housing.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.900
So ultrasonic vaporizers
are meant to be used with water,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.200
and they make a super
fine opaque vapor.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.900
We want to see
what we can do with it.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.100
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.452
Using a component commonly found
in household humidifiers,

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:46.460
we're going to try
to make colored fog

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.200
out of food coloring.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.150
We're going to do a quick test,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.400
first, with our little
single plate vaporizer.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.672
We're going to plug
this thing in,

00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:54.100
and we're going to watch
how it works.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.063
We're using a clear cup

00:00:55.063 --> 00:00:57.031
so you should at least
be able to see some of it.

00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.024
However, our vision
might get a little obscured

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:00.800
as it does fill
with vapor pretty quickly.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.400
So we can see the ultrasonic
vaporizer down here,

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.362
and then we've got
a lot of clear water

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:08.097
where you can see little bits
of stuff floating around,

00:01:08.097 --> 00:01:09.609
and that it's not still water.

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:12.159
But it doesn't really look
like it's doing too much.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.600
Up here at the top however,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.100
you can see water
is just being shot out,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.200
and drips all over,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.400
and that's why we're doing
this on top of a towel.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.851
So, the ultrasonic humidifier
actually uses ultrasonic waves,

00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:24.744
and it creates sort of fine mist

00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:27.802
through the water itself
with a broken capillary wave

00:01:27.802 --> 00:01:29.320
at the water's surface.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.640
[Music]

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.400
The vaporizer has
a ceramic plate

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.160
that's oscillating several
thousand times per second.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.097
The way that impacts
the water forces

00:01:45.097 --> 00:01:48.307
it to break up into
microscopically small droplets,

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:49.400
which form a fog.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.100
When this is in a humidifier,
those microscopic droplets

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.980
quickly evaporate into the air,
adding humidity and moisture.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.020
That's our small-scale one.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.137
Now, we're going to try
the large-scale one.

00:02:00.137 --> 00:02:02.159
Like I said,
this has 12 of those,

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.093
and this is probably a much
higher quality brand.

00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:07.600
The small one is
from Amazon and cost $10,

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.930
and while it's very cool,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.860
it's not exactly the most
stable, well-built thing.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.480
They can only be on
for a few hours

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:14.460
before they break.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.600
So, you need to limit

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.027
how long you leave
them on a time.

00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:19.010
This one is designed
to be a lot more sturdy,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.200
and obviously, it's bigger.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.300
This one's actually one
that's made for a pond,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.500
so it's made for a much
larger surface of water.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.220
Yay.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.400
Again, there's a reason
we have the towel down.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.700
This is just shooting a lot

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.300
of water up and out
of the container,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.020
but you can see this
is also making a lot of vapor.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:51.620
[Music]

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.600
Something interesting
about this mist is even

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.000
though it's been
running for a while,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.200
and we have quite
a good fog down in the jar,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.310
it's not really escaping
the jar very much

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.700
unless I blow down into it.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.964
The mist that this
makes is really dense,

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:04.240
and this is designed,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.064
as Calli said,

00:03:05.064 --> 00:03:07.200
to go in a pond
or a lake or something,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.057
and flow over the
whole surface of it.

00:03:09.057 --> 00:03:11.557
When it's in the jar,
it just can't build up enough

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:13.600
that it escapes out
the top very well.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.100
So I have here a bike pump
that I've modified a little bit,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.166
and by modifying,

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:20.300
I mean, I tore
the front out of it.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.160
He means a lot.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.800
Usually, it has like
a valve built out of that.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800
So if you are pumping
air into something,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.028
it doesn't pump
it right back out.

00:03:26.028 --> 00:03:26.800
We didn't want that.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.500
We just wanted physically
a giant syringe.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.160
So now, we can just put the bike
pump down in there, pull back,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.020
and it's full
of our water vapor,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.800
and there's something I
definitely want to try.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.400
I want to see

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.000
if we can use this
to blow bubbles.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.740
Shall we try this?

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.760
I'm always having fun.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.400
I know.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.300
Yes, it works.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.040
Nice.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.100
And they're kind of sticking.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.700
So we were taking

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.271
our little pump syringe, and we
were filling it with vapor,

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.500
and they were blowing it
through the bubble wand.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.252
Now, we've decided
to cut out a step,

00:04:00.252 --> 00:04:02.636
and we're just dipping
the front of our syringe

00:04:02.636 --> 00:04:03.871
into the bubble soap,

00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:06.500
and we're just making
the bubble directly on it.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.700
That was a really
good vapor bubble.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:16.320
[Music]

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.300
All right, so here's
the next thing we want to try.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.000
We've got a bunch
of food coloring,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.600
and we want to see

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.684
if we can actually change
the color of the vapor itself.

00:04:25.684 --> 00:04:29.100
Now, the vapor were looking at,
it looks white.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.000
It comes across as
being a white vapor,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.800
but in truth,
this vapor is clear.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.940
These are tiny tiny droplets
of clear water.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.700
It looks white

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.333
because we're shining
white light on it,

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:40.800
and that's getting
reflected around.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.865
A lot of the time,

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.159
with things like bubbles
or vapor, mist,

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.102
stuff like that,

00:04:45.102 --> 00:04:47.514
it's really hard
to change the color of it

00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:50.700
because it's actually just
such a very very thin amount

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.100
that it's just clear

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.687
and reflects whatever
light is around it.

00:04:53.673 --> 00:04:54.538
But we're going to try.

00:04:54.538 --> 00:04:55.800
We've got a lot
of food coloring,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.700
and we might be able
to make this work.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.863
All right, we're going to start
with blue food coloring,

00:04:59.863 --> 00:05:00.762
and we're going to use

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:02.600
a ton of it to see
if we can get this to work.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.800
I think we should try
an entire bottle of blue,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.799
and there's only about
a cup of water in here,

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:08.700
probably less with
the vaporizer there.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.034
So that's pretty concentrated.

00:05:10.034 --> 00:05:10.834
Yep.

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:11.702
An entire bottle?

00:05:11.702 --> 00:05:12.302
Whole thing.

00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:13.320
All right.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.340
[Music]

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.620
Look at how it's
like sinking down.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
That's cool.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.100
All right.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.148
This is intense.

00:05:24.148 --> 00:05:25.000
Here it goes.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.340
[Music]

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.200
So what do you think?

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.847
Is that actually blue vapor?

00:05:33.847 --> 00:05:35.629
You know, I wish
I could say yes,

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:36.800
but I don't think so.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.864
So there are some types
of like essential oils,

00:05:40.864 --> 00:05:43.753
even that are made
specifically to dissolve

00:05:43.753 --> 00:05:47.400
sort of into the surface
of the water in a humidifier.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400
But even then,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.200
it's not necessarily
part of the vapor.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.654
It's just getting
picked up with it.

00:05:51.654 --> 00:05:53.400
I don't think that's
what's happening here.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.000
I think that's
still a white vapor.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.000
I'm--

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.500
So I'm trying to like pointed

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.710
at the side to keep it
from splashing out,

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.300
&gt;&gt; and I'm not--
&gt;&gt; There is the color.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.000
I mean the splash is
not really part of--

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.500
Yeah, we're really just
getting a white fog here.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.060
Guys, we did one.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.600
We're going to add four more.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.500
[Music]

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.700
There's such a delayed reaction.

00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:15.700
Wait!

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.160
Wait.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.040
That actually looks like

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.580
&gt;&gt; it's colored.
&gt;&gt; That might be blue?

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.100
[Music]

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.640
It's so--

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.052
&gt;&gt; I think--
&gt;&gt; It's very subtle,

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.900
but I'm pretty sure
we've got blue right there.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.199
I'm also curious,
this is water vapor.

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:33.376
If you blow it out
directly onto the paper,

00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:35.200
will the paper like pick it up?

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280
Look at that.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.820
It's like the
worst airbrush ever.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.100
Don't move.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:49.960
[Music]

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.000
We are out of blue.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.600
We're not out of
the other colors.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.100
And we have a lot of this one.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.900
We do.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.200
We do have black.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.788
So here's the next thought.

00:06:57.788 --> 00:07:00.700
We added a lot of food coloring
to a little bit of water,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.864
but what if we try a lot
of food coloring and no water?

00:07:04.864 --> 00:07:06.140
There's none.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.640
Straight food coloring.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.380
Let's do it.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:25.280
[Music]

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.160
Moment of truth.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.200
Pure green food coloring.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.360
Wow, you can see it already.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.200
It does not produce
nearly as much vapor.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.500
But what vapor it
is producing is very colorful.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.494
I wonder if we added
just a little bit

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.500
of water to raise the height.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.880
[Music]

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.760
That's my new favorite.

00:07:46.764 --> 00:07:48.071
That's got color.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:54.660
[Music]

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.580
So there's like white
vapor at the top,

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.500
and greener vapor at the bottom.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:07:59.833
I think.

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:01.500
It could just be
the green food coloring,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.338
but I'm going to pop it,

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.700
and we can see
if the vapor looks green.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.400
There's still--

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.800
That's green vapor.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.400
There's still green vapor
in there for sure.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.720
That's so cool.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:27.360
[Music]

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.300
Why do they--

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.200
Okay, whatever is

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.800
in food coloring should
be used to make bubbles.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.000
We had the best result,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.970
like the most intense color
by using pure food coloring.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.500
We have five bottles of the red.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.100
I don't know

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.526
if that's enough to fully
cover our ultrasonic vaporizer.

00:08:42.526 --> 00:08:44.200
I don't think so
but we should try.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.800
So, we'll see what we can do.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.500
Here goes red.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.800
Switch on in 3, 2, 1.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.040
[Music]

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.440
It's kind of got like a bloody
mist thing happening here.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.140
[Music]

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.380
All right, I'm going for it.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.180
It's definitely
making vapor now.

00:09:04.182 --> 00:09:04.417
Yeah.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.600
And it has color.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.100
There's almost no vapor
coming off of this.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.740
[Music]

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.800
Oh, wait.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.900
Almost.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.400
Almost.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:18.480
A little.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.660
It's not as powerful
as the green.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.980
[Music]

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.100
You had it for like
a small second.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.680
And I have paid the price.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.300
Oh, no.

00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:33.488
This is what happens

00:09:33.488 --> 00:09:35.840
if you make food
color bubbles, kids.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.000
Bubbles full of colored vapor.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.750
It is possible.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.300
Colored vapor is
possible to make.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:39.529
Yeah.

00:09:39.529 --> 00:09:41.000
I never would have thought that.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.700
That is pretty gnarly.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.200
I'm going to be
wearing it forever.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.340
But I love it.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.800
Guys, we are going

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.073
