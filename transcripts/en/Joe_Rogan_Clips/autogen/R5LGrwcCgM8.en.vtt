00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
it's a circular saw and there would have
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860 align:start position:0%
it's a circular saw and there would have
been<00:00:34.530><c> a</c><00:00:34.559><c> crank</c><00:00:35.010><c> that</c><00:00:35.219><c> you</c><00:00:35.430><c> wound</c><00:00:36.059><c> it</c><00:00:36.360><c> with</c><00:00:36.510><c> and</c>

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 align:start position:0%
been a crank that you wound it with and
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
been a crank that you wound it with and
then<00:00:36.960><c> you'd</c><00:00:37.079><c> release</c><00:00:37.469><c> it</c><00:00:37.739><c> and</c><00:00:37.920><c> it</c><00:00:38.010><c> would</c><00:00:38.160><c> spin</c>

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 align:start position:0%
then you'd release it and it would spin
 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
then you'd release it and it would spin
sort<00:00:38.790><c> of</c><00:00:38.850><c> automatically</c><00:00:39.390><c> oh</c><00:00:39.570><c> yeah</c><00:00:40.469><c> and</c><00:00:40.710><c> the</c>

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 align:start position:0%
sort of automatically oh yeah and the
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.350 align:start position:0%
sort of automatically oh yeah and the
idea<00:00:41.100><c> was</c><00:00:41.280><c> that</c><00:00:41.340><c> it</c><00:00:41.550><c> would</c><00:00:41.579><c> make</c><00:00:41.760><c> it</c><00:00:41.820><c> faster</c>

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
idea was that it would make it faster
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
idea was that it would make it faster
but<00:00:42.570><c> the</c><00:00:42.930><c> reason</c><00:00:43.230><c> why</c><00:00:43.320><c> I</c><00:00:43.350><c> love</c><00:00:43.710><c> this</c><00:00:43.890><c> saw</c><00:00:44.129><c> so</c>

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 align:start position:0%
but the reason why I love this saw so
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.420 align:start position:0%
but the reason why I love this saw so
much<00:00:44.520><c> is</c><00:00:44.730><c> that</c><00:00:44.969><c> it</c><00:00:45.120><c> was</c><00:00:45.239><c> a</c><00:00:45.270><c> massive</c><00:00:45.930><c> failure</c>

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 align:start position:0%
much is that it was a massive failure
 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.650 align:start position:0%
much is that it was a massive failure
and<00:00:47.430><c> um</c><00:00:47.700><c> I</c><00:00:47.850><c> don't</c><00:00:47.940><c> think</c><00:00:48.239><c> we</c><00:00:48.300><c> talked</c><00:00:48.510><c> about</c>

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
and um I don't think we talked about
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.420 align:start position:0%
and um I don't think we talked about
failure<00:00:49.170><c> enough</c><00:00:49.469><c> in</c><00:00:49.739><c> science</c><00:00:50.160><c> and</c><00:00:50.309><c> medicine</c>

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 align:start position:0%
failure enough in science and medicine
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
failure enough in science and medicine
you<00:00:51.300><c> know</c><00:00:51.420><c> all</c><00:00:51.660><c> the</c><00:00:51.899><c> things</c><00:00:51.960><c> that</c><00:00:52.260><c> work</c>

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 align:start position:0%
you know all the things that work
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.959 align:start position:0%
you know all the things that work
there's<00:00:52.890><c> a</c><00:00:52.949><c> lot</c><00:00:53.010><c> of</c><00:00:53.309><c> things</c><00:00:53.460><c> that</c><00:00:53.610><c> don't</c><00:00:53.760><c> work</c>

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that don't work
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that don't work

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 align:start position:0%
when he tried it out it was spinning so
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.529 align:start position:0%
when he tried it out it was spinning so
fast<00:00:59.100><c> that</c><00:00:59.489><c> he</c><00:00:59.609><c> took</c><00:00:59.760><c> off</c><00:00:59.879><c> his</c><00:00:59.910><c> assistants</c>

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 align:start position:0%

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:43.660 align:start position:0%
know it being visible to the naked eye
 

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.230 align:start position:0%

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.850 align:start position:0%
but yet she survived she did survive and
so<00:14:46.540><c> then</c><00:14:46.689><c> you</c><00:14:46.779><c> have</c><00:14:46.929><c> to</c><00:14:46.959><c> question</c><00:14:47.259><c> whether</c><00:14:47.559><c> she</c>

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:47.860 align:start position:0%
