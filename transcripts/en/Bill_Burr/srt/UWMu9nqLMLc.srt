1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,770
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:06,771
It's bill burr and it's time for a another
special edition of the Monday morning

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:09,930
podcast. If you knew my podcast, you'd
probably say, Hey, what's this special?

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,950
What's a special one?

5
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:14,700
Usually I'm here by myself laying in
my fucking underwear running my yet,

6
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:18,540
but every once in a while I
have a special guest and a this,

7
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,950
this person will not let you down.

8
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:23,790
This is one of my great friends in this
business is one of the funniest bastards

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:27,910
I have ever met in my life. He has a
new special coming out on Netflix, um,

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,840
called mouthful of shame on a,

11
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:35,340
that's already funny on March 14th
please welcome the legendary Jim Norton.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,200
Thank you bill. That's a nice intro.

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,080
I don't know how to handle nice
things being said about me. I know.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,250
Does it make you uncomfortable people?

15
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:44,580
I was going as big as I could go
because I was feeling you squirmy.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,510
What am I great friends, one of the
best comics I ever saw just to listen.

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,490
Just watching you squirm over there.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,870
I can handle personal things are a far
away. We are from one another. It is odd.

19
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,660
My manager's kind of sitting there
uncomfortable with this fucking giant cock

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,900
bulge in the middle. He looks
like a retired figure skater.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,570
Sorry. All right. Anyways,
I can handle personal like,

22
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:10,270
cause we are great friends, but any
type of compliments of work I can't,

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,870
ain't makes me so like you like
watching clips of yourself,

24
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,610
I'm going to torture you for this next
hour. Drives me nuts, dude. I watched it.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,410
We get to watch a clip of yourself when
they bring you back and then the people

26
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:22,920
in the room like, oh yeah, that
was good. It's so fucking worse.

27
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,010
If you ever do a talk show
and then they'll like,

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,740
and they play either something you've
already done or whatever you're promoting.

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,350
I literally will, uh, you know,

30
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,370
if they cut to it and I actually look to
monitor to see if the crowd's watching

31
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:37,410
it at home. And then I just literally,

32
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:41,340
I'll put my fingers in my ears if I have
to. I'll start humming. No humiliating.

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,380
Oh, it's horrific. Do it man.

34
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:46,020
I can't watch because then they
feel like they're fake laughing.

35
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,390
Like they don't really like it. They're
just playing along to be polite.

36
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,420
I feel like they're just kind of
being nice to little Jimmy Norton.

37
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,800
They just being polite to me. The
only way I can watch myself is if I'm,

38
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,950
I filmed myself at a club and I'm just
watching it. But the second that I would,

39
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,910
I knew it was going to be uploaded or
broadcasted and I know that everybody's

40
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,190
going to see it immediately.
I'm like, oh my God,

41
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,770
what did I do that with my hand?
What did this fucking sign?

42
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:11,910
Everything just so immediately. It's
horrific. But having said that, I uh,

43
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,850
I actually made sure my last
special that I sat through it.

44
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,120
I sat through a couple of times to make
sure that at least I had like the look

45
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,980
of it, the look of it right now.

46
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,220
Did you do that with your new special
mouthful of shame that comes out on March

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,270
4th I'm going to hype the shit
out of this. It's funny. Yeah,

48
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:31,920
I did it obsessive. I've probably seen
it about 60 times, but just in editing,

49
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,450
like I don't mind watching it to edit.

50
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:36,390
Like I go point by point
over both shows I want,

51
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,900
I know exactly what I
want from the late show.

52
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,980
I'll pull this from the early shot.
I'm really anal about it. That's good.

53
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,010
That's good to have. Yeah cause I
don't trust that like anyone else,

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,650
Netflix is easier cause
there's no commercials you
have to worry about and they

55
00:02:46,651 --> 00:02:50,280
don't give a shit if it's 56 minutes for
promos it can be an hour and two hour

56
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:53,130
and three. So I was very comfortable
doing that. But like you said,

57
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,870
as soon as somebody else in the room,

58
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,210
I want to hang myself but
I can do it alone all day.

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,860
Cause I know I'm doing it as part
of, it's still part of the work.

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,350
But once it's done I'm like
I can never watch it again.

61
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,750
Oh I walk out of the room second.
Other people didn't watch it.

62
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,880
Oh Hey can I see a thing
here? And absolutely.

63
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:09,250
And then they sit down and I
closed the door and walk out.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,680
Could you watch it with via? Could you
watch it with someone you're really,

65
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:14,320
really close to if like, it's not
like somebody you need to impress.

66
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,154
I just don't have to

67
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,153
standing up.

68
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,600
I would be standing up with my fucking
hands on top of my head like that. Like

69
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,390
good, is it good? Is it good? Is it soc?

70
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,290
I'd be doing that the whole time
and she literally gets mad going.

71
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,390
She knows at this point Nia
knows to be like, you know,

72
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,940
she'll just come up and say, Hey, I
watched your special, it was good.

73
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,270
Or I watched this, it was good and
blah blah blah. And I go, okay, good.

74
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,720
Well you start like if some of the parts
coming up that you don't like legally I

75
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,460
hated the way I did this thing like
right before it happens cause you like,

76
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:42,040
you don't want them to watch it and
pretend to like it when you know it's not,

77
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,250
it's fucking psychotic. Have that
thought buttons. It comes out like this.

78
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,180
I just, I just go
[inaudible] just a noise.

79
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:50,350
I just yell over

80
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,210
over and it just, it will bother her.
But I've also learned that, uh, yeah,

81
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,460
did just that. You're going to think
it's way, way worse than it fucking

82
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,060
goodness,

83
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,310
but don't you find the comedian to are
so comfortable watching themselves saw

84
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,550
something wrong with
that? Yeah man, I can't,

85
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:09,270
I keep your eye in back could literally
watch a fucking marathon of their entire

86
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:13,230
career and be like, Oh yeah, I love that
sport coat. I loved when I wore that.

87
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:14,580
The way I rolled those sleeves up.

88
00:04:14,581 --> 00:04:18,000
I absolutely loved this one was a dog
and cat thing. Oh you're gonna love this.

89
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,940
You know who I've been to loop.
I've, I've been on a loop,

90
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:25,710
a tear watching Robert Klein videos cause
I, we are having him coming in and I,

91
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:28,740
and he's one of my idols and I'm watching
like Robert Klein from the tonight

92
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:32,490
show in 81 82 83 watch him on
74 on soul train or whatever.

93
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,350
He was fucking great man. Robert Klein
is a guy that most people don't mention,

94
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:39,210
like don't talks about
Robert Klein anymore.

95
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,860
As much as I mentioned prior and Carl
and Robert Klein is the most underrated

96
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,640
guy. I think to ever, Seinfeld always

97
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,020
gives them a bunch of prompts and was
talking like how he was that I think, um,

98
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,940
that was one of his guys. He liked
Cosby in Robert Klein I believe. And um,

99
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,180
I forget how he put it, but
he was like sort of their age,

100
00:04:58,181 --> 00:05:00,940
like when he was doing those things in
the 70s and he was going to colleges,

101
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:05,290
like he was like that age part of that
generation. So he was kind of there.

102
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,730
So thank keep like Carlin was more of
a sixties guy even though he blew up in

103
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:13,260
the 70s. I think, um, people from that
generation remember him. But it's,

104
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,530
it's weird how some people,

105
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:19,030
despite their contributions will kind
of slipped through the cracks like that.

106
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,440
Uh, it's, I find with most
people that went that are like,

107
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:27,400
that they're not into self promotion.
So if you're not spoonfeeding it,

108
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:30,280
like the amount of fucking journalists
out there, if you just tell them,

109
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,660
you know, like, uh, I'm one of the
edgiest guys on the set. Like, what,

110
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,970
what not that's too, too straight.
But if you're like the, um, uh,

111
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,630
I would always like,
I don't know, I would,

112
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,020
I would equate it to Detroit
that calls itself hockey town.

113
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,830
Like they gave themselves a fucking
nickname. Like, why are you hockey town?

114
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,920
Wouldn't at least be
Montreal. Montreal Canadians.

115
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:54,580
They have the most fucking
uh, you know, championships.

116
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,190
They got the f the fans were literally
drive people out of town. I mean,

117
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,270
why? Because you're that, well no
one Michael Jackson the king of Pop,

118
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:04,700
not saying he wasn't good, but he
kind of gave himself that like,

119
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,350
right that nickname.

120
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,350
But like how a lot of hacks do that and
nobody thinks that somebody will be a

121
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:11,760
big enough asshole to give
themselves a nickname.

122
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:12,920
So people just kind of go with it.

123
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,930
Like people must have
called him the king of Pop,

124
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,500
cause nobody can be that fucking
narcissistic to give himself the nickname,

125
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:19,760
the king of pop, like probably did.

126
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:22,520
And the press loves them because
they write the story for them.

127
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,200
That's why they'll love a Rex Ryan.

128
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,260
But hate bill Belichick like
Belicheck is smart enough to be like,

129
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,690
you Consta going to take any little
thing that I say and turn it into Bolton

130
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,320
board material. That's why he stands
out gun, you know, they're good.

131
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,740
And I think next week it's gonna be a
tough game in just taking a long wait time

132
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,940
and then they want a guy
like rex Ryan go look, go,

133
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,210
I'm going to win the super
bowl. Then they love him.

134
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,000
I didn't come here to kiss the
rings. I'm going to go in there,

135
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,520
we're going to shove it right up
their ass. And they're just like,

136
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,200
before he's done talking, their article
is written. Me Wanting to go four and 12

137
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,550
I love Rex Ryan. I love
what a pervert he is.

138
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:58,930
I love that he loves his wife's feet.
He's the best. But he loves his wife too.

139
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,060
Yeah, he does. His wife keeps
him on the rails. I swear to God,

140
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:03,950
if he didn't have that guy
would ate himself to death.

141
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,590
I see it like all that
shit talk and he does.

142
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,360
You see like that's why I love that guy.

143
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:13,130
When I watch him like
he's his flaws. I'm like,

144
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,920
Oh my God, this guy, he's a shit
show. This guy's a shit show.

145
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,990
And he loves his wife to
death because she saved them.

146
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,340
You totally see the whole thing. Yeah.
He's a disaster. He's a disaster.

147
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,260
I'll try to say that a
nice. Yeah, but he is,

148
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:26,050
but there was something endearing
about that and I, you know,

149
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,660
I just started watching football
again. I can't care about it. I'm like,

150
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:31,550
why you are, you're the
biggest one. We were coming up.

151
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,940
You were a huge Campbell cowboys fan
and then you were huge Yankee Fan. Yeah.

152
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:37,970
I just, I stopped. I started
going on the road more and more.

153
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:39,590
I just stopped caring as much. I'm like,

154
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:42,650
I'm putting in so much effort to these
guys and I meet them and they don't give

155
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,760
a shit that I'm alive.

156
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,130
I had a couple of bad experiences with
athletes and I remember done. Yeah,

157
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,280
I was wrong about the
Jeter thing. I was a baby.

158
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:53,000
I really act like a little douchebag.
I was fucking rat. He was addicted,

159
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:56,510
not time, but I way overreacted on the
air. I'm embarrassed by that. Well,

160
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:59,870
if you, if you, if you go to the
psychology of the way you overreacted,

161
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:04,220
it wasn't really just your love for
the guys and the team. Yes, you are.

162
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:06,970
Jilted lovers. Patrice used to
always say, yeah, good lover.

163
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,190
That's exactly what it is. I
mean, you know, uh, the, the,

164
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:12,170
the husband that becomes a stalker is
the guy that was obsessed with his wife.

165
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,730
Like, you know, that's what I was,

166
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:15,350
I was obsessed with them and
then they didn't love me.

167
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,830
One of my biggest meltdowns was gene
Simmons cause he hurt my feelings.

168
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,740
He blew me off and I wanted a photo and
he was kind of a dick about it. And I,

169
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,480
it just ruined me and I fucking
killed him on the radio about it.

170
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:29,000
And then I kind of felt bad cause he
was nice to me. The next time I saw him,

171
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,240
I met him one time. He was teasing
me about losing my hair and shit.

172
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,350
I just so wanted to be like, dude,

173
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:36,680
do you think anybody's buying that fucking
Darth Vader helmet on you wearing a

174
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,570
walk in your fucking
head? That's terrible.

175
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,520
He has Chewbacca is heroin

176
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,280
dude in it is like shoe Polish,
black. I mean you, you can't,

177
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,510
you talk to the guy and your
kid's kid not even look at,

178
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,960
but what I love about him is he would
sit here and laugh right along with you

179
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,150
and not give a fuck and then just
scribbled down Chewbacca with hair.

180
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,750
And the next day there'd be a picture of
him dressed as Chewbacca with his shit

181
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:05,400
written on it and he would make $1 million
on unreal unapologetically go make $1

182
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,080
million off of that. He really
doesn't care. You don't.

183
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:08,220
One thing I like about Gina,

184
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:11,800
and this is one thing that Dan rather
interviewed him and he talked about,

185
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,410
is he's a patriotic guy.

186
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,160
Like nobody loves America more than
Gene Simmons because his mother was in a

187
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:21,440
concentration camp and she came here and
when he was a kid and he remembered it,

188
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,980
I think he was Iranian, the
biggest kiss fan. Yeah. No,

189
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,510
you'll way off though. That's just
about as far off. Yeah, he was.

190
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:34,890
He's a Brazilian. I thought he
was Irish. Yeah, he's a, he's a,

191
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,410
he was born in his name. His
real name is hime white I think.

192
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,490
And he was born in Israel and he said
his mother zig high old when she came to

193
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:42,181
Ellis Island.

194
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:46,230
And he tells that story to Dan Rather
about how moving it was to have them tell

195
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,064
her to put her armed.

196
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,070
So you watch that and it's like that's
the gene he should be showing people.

197
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,350
Why did she do that? Cause she
was, she didn't know any better.

198
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,790
She came to America and she had to
pledge allegiance to America to get in.

199
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:00,360
That's what you did. So she's high
and the guy put his, put her arm down.

200
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,340
It's like, no, no, you
don't have to do that.

201
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,670
So if that made gene incredible patriot,

202
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,860
those people were so lucky back then
that there was no youtube that would have

203
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,420
ruined her life. Never run for office.
Never even opened up bakery. Yeah.

204
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,210
The seek high. A little girl is now
coming of age to make some pastries.

205
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,030
Fuck you. You Hitler, love and pitcher.

206
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,100
Would all of that picture her with
the statue behind her? Hell yeah.

207
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:26,910
You're right. There's no live in a town
now. Do you have any clips about you?

208
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,390
I this, there's so many things on me
that I, that could ruin my life, that I,

209
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:33,240
I think that it's almost, there's so
many that they can't at this point.

210
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,790
Things I've said or you
know, things I've admitted.

211
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,130
Is there things in your
life that you're like, fuck,

212
00:10:38,131 --> 00:10:40,090
I wish I didn't talk about
that way back. Weddings.

213
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,670
I didn't realize that it comes up
on me or do you not care? Yeah.

214
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:46,490
I mean I just, I mean, it's gonna happen.

215
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,140
It's inevitably going to happen to
everybody. They're going to go like, oh,

216
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:53,400
you said this in 2006 you'd be
like, Oh, did I? Yeah. All right,

217
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,730
well why don't you get your time
machine and have me apologize.

218
00:10:56,731 --> 00:11:00,170
The 2006 version of me. You
know what a lot of it is,

219
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,590
I would equate it to the Eddie Murphy
thing where Eddie Murphy put out delirious

220
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,761
and he did all that,

221
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:09,480
that material about gay people and
everybody laughed and nobody said Shit.

222
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,120
I'm sure gay people didn't,
but mainstream did not.

223
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,780
And then when mainstream catches
up and starts to learn that, oh,

224
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:19,200
that's really hurtful and blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah to gape,

225
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:21,990
then all of a sudden everyone's just
like, you know, they talk, oh my God,

226
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:23,430
they look the other way. Bob.

227
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,600
You know when they talk about that part
of the special they act. It's like,

228
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:28,890
well where were you during that year?

229
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,000
I know you saw it and you sat there and
left it at the same way I did. I didn't,

230
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,430
I didn't know that. I didn't know
what the Sh that it was to that level.

231
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:38,310
So I think you can do
that with anybody. Well,

232
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,660
I think what lets Eddie off the hook,

233
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:42,150
especially with that type of
material is the whole, you know,

234
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:43,140
I was giving her a ride,

235
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,010
excuse me for that special young lady and
boy if that didn't make me love Eddie,

236
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:49,920
nothing. Well but like after that
you're like, Eh, all right, we get it,

237
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,100
we get it. Who knows he could for him.
Who knows? I get involved in people's

238
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,640
personal lives. I don't give up. I don't
either. And not in a judgemental way.

239
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:02,140
I love the fact when when things about
let's say any celebrity come out,

240
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:05,740
they could or could not be true.
It makes me like the more like,

241
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:09,340
it makes me understand like, yeah,
this, this is a public persona.

242
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,130
Like I feel bad for,

243
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,410
there's one major actor in particular
who miss male massage therapists said he

244
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:18,010
was doing stuff and I feel so bad
for this guy. I'm like, he said,

245
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:20,350
what a torture it is to live your life.

246
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,740
Being afraid you're going to get caught
or being for being who you are. Yes.

247
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,270
Yeah. Oh God.

248
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,690
That's gotta be going to affect how much
money you make because of the, yeah,

249
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:30,040
that's all. It's all the, you know, some,

250
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,110
a lot of that personal life shit that
kind of drove me away from ESPN cause it

251
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:38,740
used to just be the games and they'd
show highlights and just seemed like a

252
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:42,460
bunch of people, you know,
broadcasting, it just loves sports.

253
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,760
But when they started to just keep like
delving into these people's lives and

254
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:50,730
trying to like, uh, do like the
controversy shit, I just, um, I dunno.

255
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,630
I just Kinda, I got away
from it after awhile.

256
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,160
That's why I love the sports packages.

257
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:56,140
I just taped the games
that I want to watch.

258
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,150
I S I blow through the pregame and I,

259
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,470
and I never watch any
postgame analysis or anything.

260
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,180
I just watched the fucking game.
That's it. And that's it. You know,

261
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:08,410
the Knicks recently handled
Hannibal burgers retreated
this thing where they did

262
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:09,860
the first half with a,

263
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,970
you went to the game and there wasn't a
bunch of people run around shooting tee

264
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:15,040
shirts at you every time
it was a stop at you play.

265
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,190
Not a bunch of music playing and all I
would would've loved to have gone to that

266
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,260
game. Yeah, it is distracting.

267
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,890
And they think we need constant
stimulation and constant noise. Like no,

268
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:26,470
we're at the game. I'm okay
just watching the game.

269
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,910
I'm okay if it's the third thing and it's
a, you know, two in one and this one,

270
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:35,650
I don't need care. Got Bad,
bad, bad fucking manic.

271
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:37,810
Stop it. Basketball's the worst.

272
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:40,750
Basketball is the worst just because they
run out into the court and it could be

273
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,460
like a really critical part of the game.

274
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,910
One Oh three one oh three timeout there.

275
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,450
There's like time for like one more shot.

276
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,110
These fucking assholes guy comes out in
a gorilla suit shooting tee shirts at

277
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:53,500
you and shit and it's just Kinda,
it becomes like a chuck e cheese.

278
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,840
You're supposed to be teaching
your kid the game here.

279
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,680
Like this is really important and there's
all these people that extra excited

280
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:03,250
look on their faces, they're
holding the tee shirt off. I always,

281
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:06,220
I sit through all of that, hoping
that I'm going to, you know,

282
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,020
nobody ever sits with me, but I have this,

283
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:11,200
this is my little fucking dream is that
I'll sit and everyone else would just

284
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:14,260
stare at fucking daggers at
them and they won't do anymore.

285
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,790
I don't give a fuck about a bunch of
cops smiling, jumping off a trampolines,

286
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,430
dunking the ball. It's actually
embarrassing. The white people like,

287
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:24,640
look how little we can jump.
It's humility. We need this here.

288
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,500
I saw that at a Sun's game. I had a great
time at the game, but that bullshit.

289
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,620
They're like, yeah, that calm that
crazy trampoline fucking guys.

290
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,220
And it's like fucking nine white guys
coming out there. We don't need him.

291
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,490
[inaudible] yeah, and there's
nobody blocking them either.

292
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:44,110
And there's mats fall. It's like a nerf
hoop, like taken to the next level.

293
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,770
I'm sure someone's going to tweet me. Oh,

294
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,710
actually that's really hard combining
those sports. But um, I hate mascots.

295
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:52,370
I think they're unnecessary

296
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,540
and they're stupid and they, they, they,
they child up the game. Like the I,

297
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,240
we interviewed the Philly fanatic in
2001 it was, I like to Philly fanatic.

298
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,210
Oh he smells. Those uniforms stink. I too,

299
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,460
I remember about being next to
the Philly fanatic, the stench.

300
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,470
I'm sure they all smell like that
but they [inaudible] August man.

301
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,820
You know you're out there
wearing some for fucking outfit.

302
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:17,630
It's horrendous and to me they just, they
do nothing to make me enjoy the game.

303
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,010
That's what I kind of always liked about
like I hated the mets cause fucking Mr

304
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,850
met and that big stupid, I love our
lack of imagination of that one.

305
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,610
It's just a guy with a baseball
for a head. Yeah Mister.

306
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:31,490
And then they named them after
the team. I literally is stupid.

307
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Really comes off as the first
idea. What are you going to,

308
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,630
how about Mr met good
guys got a baseball head.

309
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,753
He's a guy.

310
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,250
Call him mister. We played
during Valentine's Day.
Maybe we could have Mrs. Mat.

311
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I actually love a mascot standing on a
street corner holding up a tax tax thing

312
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:53,050
and doing a stupid dance when
I'm sitting at a red light.

313
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,570
It makes me laugh my fucking ass
off. I don't know what it is.

314
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,020
I think they should have them just,
mascots should be like in traffic,

315
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,250
like every 200 yards to just somebody
doing a stupid dance just to entertain

316
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:04,990
you. That's what I need. Entertainment,

317
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,870
not when I'm fucking attic
at an entertainment thing.

318
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:10,200
I don't need entertainment
during the interview.

319
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,050
In between the moments of entertainment,

320
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:15,260
you don't need the extra entertainment
and it's not even entertaining. Mascot.

321
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:17,780
You're not entertaining. I never
watched a mascot and like, oh,

322
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:21,050
that was kind of funny or cute. It's
insulting and it's really, it's,

323
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,320
I would say the f, the Philly
freak, the San Diego chicken.

324
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,490
There's a couple of classic ones
where they were actually funny. Um,

325
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,740
that's about it. I always
feel bad for the, uh,

326
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,700
couldn't they slide when they
run in and take the big slide?

327
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,620
Like the little guy couldn't deal it? No.

328
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,100
I like when like the Philly freak will
walk up and fuck with the umpires and

329
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:42,920
mess with people on the other other
team and stuff like that. It's, it's,

330
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:46,880
I don't know, like that's one of
the classic ones, but I forget, uh,

331
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,910
the red sox they tried to have on a long
time ago was called the Fenway freak

332
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,120
and he lasted like seven games. People
were just pelting him with shit,

333
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,980
know what was like the 70s.

334
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:00,650
This is when you could actually go
there and be a fucking alcoholic,

335
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,860
scare children. And then they brought
this guy out in a fucking, you know,

336
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,240
muppet outfit and he just got the
Philly freak, but now they have a,

337
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,340
Ugh, this is, is this the green monster
one? Yeah. And it's called Wally Wally.

338
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,780
Oh, it's like a pun. It's
a mascot with a pun, name,

339
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,440
Pun for what the park is known
for. Yeah. And then, then, yeah.

340
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,410
And then they sewing sweet Caroline
during the seven thing stretch.

341
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,700
Just when I thought your why YMCA Horse
Shit at the Yankees game. It's bad.

342
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:31,610
But at least the, you know, was the
grounds crew. They kind of looked like,

343
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,480
all right,

344
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,720
like they took this boring thing and
made it entertaining a little bit.

345
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,160
Like that was kind of interesting, um,

346
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,050
to watch people still spell out why
YMCA was just, yeah, that, that's,

347
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,340
that was always tough to watch.

348
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,570
I don't need to watch the ground's crew
singing what was probably the gay anthem

349
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:48,160
for 19, for the 70s.

350
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,110
I don't to see them fucking seen
that every seventh wedding. Yeah.

351
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:54,170
That might've been the, uh, like,

352
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,900
like they was so gay than the shit that
they were doing I think would actually

353
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:59,430
be offensive to gay people.

354
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:02,610
I'm a construction worker and I
have the big mustache and I'm,

355
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:04,260
the leather guy would be like, dude,

356
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,210
like literally now gay groups
would be like, you know,

357
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,130
you're perpetuating stereotypes.

358
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:11,310
We go to workings gray suits
just like you do or whatever.

359
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:15,180
But it's fucking hilarious. Do you
remember Victor Willis the lead say,

360
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,020
did you know what they were? I didn't
know they were gay. It was a big village.

361
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,600
My father took me to see
them when I was a kid.

362
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,700
It was them and sister sledge was the
opening band and I didn't know what

363
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,260
legendary, you know, disco
show. Absolutely. That was
like for that might've,

364
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,880
it was either them or kiss was the first
one and I didn't know they were gay,

365
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,140
but I found out like I didn't
know what the village was,

366
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:35,490
a grinding village thing. I had no idea
what any of that meant. I didn't either.

367
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:38,060
I thought it was cool to way, oh,
that's the construction worker guy.

368
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,800
Why is he construction worker? Yeah,
I didn't know that. Musicians, yeah.

369
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,030
Why is he just a bass player or the
Indian Phillippi rose. He's still,

370
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:48,270
he's still my favorite. I thought he
was awesome. I love this head dress.

371
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,330
I really did. I actually liked
the one who looked like a,

372
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,200
somebody who hit on Al
Pachino and cruising. Oh,

373
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,480
Glenn Glenn was the one I
liked. I thought he was bad ass.

374
00:18:57,481 --> 00:19:00,480
Like that's why I never saw rob
Helford from a million miles away.

375
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:03,360
Cause I'm part of that last generation
where if you bought a bunch of leather

376
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,600
and had a mustache, you would
like some bad motorcycle.

377
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,780
I didn't understand that. There was a
whole other side to that. I had no idea.

378
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,790
But now you look back
on old Helford video,

379
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,310
I'll go back on Youtube and watch
old Judas priest from like a,

380
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,790
from that doe always that content.
They didn't like 83 and Philly.

381
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:20,460
There was that dude that just
live eight or whatever it was.

382
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:23,310
You watched priests from that and
you're like, oh, how did we not know?

383
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,380
That's sounds so obvious.

384
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,870
And I loved the fact that he
came out and nobody gives a fuck.

385
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:31,380
It's just how offered, you know, he's
like a big power top, you know, he just,

386
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,120
he's a, he's a fucking ramrod. I, I've
just loved the guy. Nobody gives a shit.

387
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,660
I think he grew into that role.
He looked like a bottom early on.

388
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,950
I think as he got older, you know,

389
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,420
we get a little more
comfortable with himself.

390
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,570
There's a story that he has a big Dick
and he put some guy in the hospital,

391
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,090
Florence, he told me his story.
If you put a guy in line,

392
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,050
he didn't put any person in the hospital
with your Dick. You're a legend.

393
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,100
And I heard that there was some,
some hairdresser who for years,

394
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,920
one and half for to find it. It's
consensual. Let's put that out there.

395
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,230
That clip gets you until they're over
18 I mean, I'm talking, you know,

396
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,580
the asterisk is that it's an adult and
a consensual relationship or consensual

397
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,730
encounter and you willingly allow him to
put your Dick and you'll end up in the

398
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:10,410
hospital. That guy's a legend. Oh,

399
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:13,440
just picture the interview afterwards
with the fucking other person.

400
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:17,980
At what moment did you realize you were
in over your head? When I was, when I,

401
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,060
when I told him he has to pull it out
and I realized there was still four more

402
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:21,811
interesting. Yeah.

403
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:24,300
There was some moment where he
realized this was a bad decision,

404
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,330
but I heard he was bugging Alford to
fuck them and he was a hairdresser or

405
00:20:27,331 --> 00:20:31,680
whatever he was. Was whoever
the guy is that how for oh fuck.

406
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:36,060
Intend to the hospital and
Hallvard finally did it and
the guy wound up how you

407
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:39,670
hate fucked him. All right, fine. I'll
give you the rock star Dick. Yeah,

408
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,650
I hear he's packing like an animal, so
there's nothing but good, good things.

409
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,020
You think he did a right before his show.

410
00:20:44,021 --> 00:20:46,740
So he's wearing all that
fucking awful studded shit.

411
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,640
It's just the sound of your screaming
in his fucking milky thighs rubbing

412
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,960
together the leather pants. I'm sorry
everybody. Sorry. Just paint that visual.

413
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,750
He smells good too. I interviewed
him before a show one time.

414
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,970
Me and this guy Troy from
the show went to the,

415
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,130
I guess it was a garden or wherever
they were where the metal a,

416
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,480
he smells so fucking good.
So I bought the same Cologne.

417
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,540
A lot of times I'll smell Cologne that
British rock stars have on and I'll buy

418
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,070
it and it's very specific.

419
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,940
It never could they make gay British
Rock Stars or just British rock star? No.

420
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,550
Ozzy's not gay. Ozzie's Ozzie's
the best smelling guy in music.

421
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,150
Ozzy smells better than anybody.
A Rob Halford smells great.

422
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,120
I would've never guessed that with Aussie
asking. Not Saying I, you know, just,

423
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,720
you wouldn't think that he smelled you
and that you wouldn't associate him with

424
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:31,060
like a really rich guy smell. But Ozzy,

425
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:35,320
you can smell from down the hall and he
has it, I think in his hair or whatever.

426
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,420
It's this British Cologne and he fucking,

427
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,680
he smells fucking amazing.
He smells amazing.

428
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,260
How also smelled good, but
it never smells good on me.

429
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,860
I buy it and I just smell like
garbage. How do you know I can,

430
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:49,930
I smell it on myself. I'm like, it stinks.

431
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,480
I thought you can't really smell
yourself. Oh yeah, the Cologne. You can.

432
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:55,590
I put it on and it's great for a minute
and I put my like shirt. I'm like, look,

433
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,320
suck. It isn't. Yeah, but that's
self hatred. No, but I don't,

434
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:02,050
I never get compliments on it. No one's
ever said, hey, you smell great in that.

435
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,910
Like, you know when Ozzy walks
in, people like you fucking smell.

436
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,120
That's the first thing I noticed about,

437
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,080
first time I met him was with Jim
Florentine in 97 and the first thing that

438
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:12,790
struck me is this guy smells amazing.
They're not getting enough ass.

439
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:15,100
You know what I mean? They've
got to show like Jesus Christ.

440
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:17,640
That's what you gotta fucking send
your wife into. The next room. Yeah,

441
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,650
go get some of you hoes.

442
00:22:20,651 --> 00:22:23,170
That shit off of you police so I can
still be married at the end of this.

443
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,060
How funny is it that he just, you know,
he had the whole thing with shower.

444
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,740
We got caught having the affair and he's
not, I love that the damage control.

445
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,380
Ozzy does it in an interview.
He's like, well, I'm a fucking,

446
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:35,980
I'm in a fucking band on. I like, that's
his reasoning. Like what do you expect?

447
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,270
I thought that was the greatest.

448
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,650
That's something you say
to your friends though.

449
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:41,860
You don't say that in an interview.
If you play. I fucking said that.

450
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,300
I am too for I. If it doesn't get them
divorced, I'm happy. He said, look,

451
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,600
I fucking,

452
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,620
you might've fucking people that aren't
in his position that can easily sit

453
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,650
back. You know your fucking life
is. If you're not in a band,

454
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,710
you don't have all these women fucking
throwing themselves at you. You're like,

455
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,230
what the fuck is he supposed to
do? I know. I know how to use you.

456
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:04,480
You're like a grounded guy. Like I
really mean that. Like, I look at you,

457
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:08,050
you're married, you have a baby
and like you're I fucking Bose gym.

458
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,730
That's what [inaudible] in the green
room until everybody leaves and I booze.

459
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,020
They really, yeah, I admire, I sit there
and I just tell stories with people.

460
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,960
They bring a bottle in and I'm
with like four or five of them.

461
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:23,080
I did it the last night. I was
just in a, where the fuck was,

462
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:25,630
I stand up live in Phoenix
and they brought it,

463
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:28,240
they had this bottle for us and
for three days we just, you know,

464
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,880
taking a third, a third and a third
and by the last night, you know,

465
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,500
we just sitting in there, I go to cigar
bars. I just basically go. But dude,

466
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,750
I always used to look like
fucking Ralph mouth too.

467
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,670
So it was never really a
problem. You know what I mean?

468
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,910
That wasn't like a fucking
like Geraldo rest his soul.

469
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:46,220
I mean that guy was like a fucking
great in those, those guys,

470
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:49,190
you feel funny and he had a, he had
like a, I also always had like a really,

471
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,530
you know, angry fucking energy. So,

472
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:56,531
like most women who had even remotely had
a decent father or maybe an uncle that

473
00:23:56,721 --> 00:24:00,110
they spoke to had a nice conversation
once would be running for the hills.

474
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,030
And I would get these absolute fucking
lunatics that would come up to me.

475
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,530
And um, you know, so it kind of took
care of itself to be honest with you.

476
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,490
It is scary when you meet women and
like the girls you dated at first or for

477
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:16,280
awhile when you realize I
represent something to her.

478
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,700
Like I'm an average looking guy and this,
some girls I've dated who are better,

479
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:21,290
a lot better looking than I deserved.

480
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,480
And like I knew that there are
mental things and I'm like,

481
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,070
I f I represent something weird to her.
It's a father issue. Mouthful of shame.

482
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:30,890
I would say that, you know,
yeah. It's monster rain.

483
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:32,920
I mean the names of your
[inaudible] it's very, uh, yeah,

484
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:35,090
you've carved out quite a niche
for you. So, yeah. You know,

485
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:37,370
I gotta think I gotta be honest, cause I,

486
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,260
what type of girl tried to blackmail me,

487
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,440
I needed to go and try to blackmail me
one time. She had no idea who I was.

488
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,810
And we had hooked up a few times,
you know, it was a money thing,

489
00:24:44,811 --> 00:24:47,270
not a big expense. We had
texts, a lot of dirty fantasies,

490
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,720
and then she wanted me to send her money
to try and blackmail me. And I'm like,

491
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:53,390
well, I'll send you money to help you
with this, but I'm not doing it that.

492
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,141
And she goes, well,

493
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:59,141
maybe all your friends would want to see
your fantasies played out on Facebook.

494
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,450
And I'm like, you really don't
know who you're talking to. And I,

495
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,333
I texted it to you.

496
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:07,880
I don't give a fuck everybody who I
know knows what I'm liking what I do.

497
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,250
I'm at that moment. I was grateful to
be me. Yeah, you gotta be kidding you.

498
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,810
You know what you, when you put it all
out there and you know they can't get,

499
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,320
there's nothing funny.
I, one of the funny,

500
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,110
I watched it was a scene in a movie
watching somebody's thinking that they can

501
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:24,350
blackmail somebody and they just
completely don't give a shit do that.

502
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,570
Am I gonna say the guy's name? But
that happened to a hockey player.

503
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,730
He was like in his forties and he, I'm
all, yes. Yeah. He hooked up with some,

504
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:34,850
like 19 years old and it was legal
and everything. And she's just like,

505
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:37,190
I'm going to tweet this out and you
know, if you don't, blah, blah, blah.

506
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,700
He goes, what did I slept with a
smoking hot chick. Half my age. He goes,

507
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,420
get into it. I don't give a fuck.
And she did. Sometimes they will.

508
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:48,950
They will at times do it. She said
she was gonna he said he didn't care.

509
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:53,030
She did. And he didn't give a fuck
and nobody else did. Oh my God,

510
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,460
this guy did something illegal. Yeah.

511
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,390
She really didn't have like
a leg yesterday. I, he,

512
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,590
he did what we'd all love to do.
Shame on him. Good for him. But,

513
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,750
but if you're married,
if you got kid, you know,

514
00:26:02,751 --> 00:26:06,500
there's so many guys that they like I
heard a lot of rappers get like girls will

515
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,680
, you know, uh, special ladies,
a lot of rappers, you know,

516
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,060
are a little on the DL as they
say about certain things and uh,

517
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,380
they get blackmailed a
lot. Like I've heard a lot.

518
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:16,910
A lot of times the girls would go, yeah,

519
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,240
I want $30,000 I'm going to start
fucking screaming in the lobby.

520
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,300
And there's been times where that
stuff has worked. It's a shame Jesus.

521
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,910
You can't just go, go ahead, go
screaming the lobby's stupid.

522
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:29,390
Well you know what, if everyone was like
me, you could and you like I wouldn't,

523
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:31,730
I wouldn't give a shit. I
like that's what kills me.

524
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:35,390
Like whenever a controversy
like that comes out,

525
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,300
like I like he were talking about that
guy with the massage therapist and all

526
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:38,661
that stuff.

527
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:42,680
I always just think like I cannot fucking
wait to go to his next movie just to

528
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,190
make this type of shit go away.

529
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,870
Cause right to support it. Yeah.

530
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,610
Cause even the worst case scenario is
they did something where they just fucked

531
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:53,490
up. They fucked up. What am I saying?
The guy goes on the road, he bangs,

532
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:57,280
you know, fucks around in his wife
every that's between them. Yeah.

533
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,790
Does that mean I don't
like that song any better?

534
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,700
I those fucking people who do
that shit where they just go like,

535
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,600
Oh fuck that guy. I'm done with this
movie. Really get done with those movies.

536
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,890
I'm done with his movies when his
movies suck, you know, if he's not,

537
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,820
if he's not out there,
you know, they'll say,

538
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:14,460
fucking people will still go to mass
every Sunday. The Catholic Church.

539
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,220
But you know, it wasn't
everybody. It's like,

540
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,360
is that really what you're thinking?

541
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:22,230
That's just your fear of dying and not
knowing where you go when you die and you

542
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:25,020
don't want to piss off the
invisible guy. All right, my buddy,

543
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,630
my brother said it the best.
He goes talking about the
Catholic Church. He goes,

544
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:30,870
dude, if that was any other fucking
business, they would be shut down.

545
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,470
Fucking shut down. I'm still on.

546
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:38,490
And I think of this a lot by the fact
that you don't believe in name calling.

547
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,730
I've thought of that a lot, like
how negative it is and bad it is.

548
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,760
And it's something that,

549
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,330
not that I've had a cause to
cause I'm single at this point,

550
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,880
but you're in a relationship with a woman.

551
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,680
I've never done the Europe fucking bitch
and blind w I would never of thought

552
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,510
and, but hearing you say
that, it's like, yeah,

553
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:59,511
I guess it really is a damaging thing to
do it I can't kick cause it builds up.

554
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,500
Ah, it builds up resentment
cause people don't forget like a,

555
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,770
I got this weird thing if my wife goes,
you know, you're a fucking asshole.

556
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:10,740
I don't care. I know other guys
that would be like, you know,

557
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:14,340
you like that would actually, it would
hurt him in a way that they as a man,

558
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:19,140
they wouldn't want to admit I don't
give a shit. Um, but like I, I,

559
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,830
I saw enough guys growing up doing that
you fucking bitch thing and everything

560
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:26,760
like that. And I, I just,
I saw what that did. Uh,

561
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,700
I was a little kid and just saw it. I
just saw it. It just, it didn't look,

562
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:32,950
you know, this big, deep voice
yelling at, you know what I mean?

563
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,440
It just was not, it just, I,
I dunno. So I just made a vow.

564
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,430
It's just one of those things. I was
like, you know what, I'm not doing that.

565
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,480
But then there was other stupid behavior
that I guess I didn't recognize them

566
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:45,990
then. I repeated that, but that
was the one that I, I didn't do.

567
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,620
So what do you do? She calls
you an asshole. You just,

568
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,830
he's talking about what she's
doing as if I go, oh, real mature.

569
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,250
I wish I had the presence
of mine ice. I, uh,

570
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:02,460
what do I do? You know, I definitely
say the f word a lot, but I don't, um,

571
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,130
you know what? Now that I have a
daughter, so I really, I just shouldn't,

572
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,520
I don't do that. I'm not gonna fucking
sit there and screaming. You can't. Yeah.

573
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,730
When there's a baby in the road,

574
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:13,000
it's really changed that we can Sam my
radio part and just had a baby and see

575
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,230
everybody I know is having kids. He, I
guess it changes the way you do shit,

576
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:20,070
right? Yeah. Because the,
there's that whole, uh,

577
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,830
I think for the first time in your life,

578
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:27,831
you're actually aware of your
behavior affecting other people with,

579
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,270
you know, with your girlfriend or your
wife. It's an adult to adult thing.

580
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,360
So you really don't,
you're like, oh, this,

581
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:37,470
especially as an adult that can drive
a car, you know, I can say this stuff,

582
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:38,760
this isn't going to affect them, you know?

583
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,750
But it's when you have the kid and
everything and it's just like, you know,

584
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,940
that this could actually affect
who they marry, right? Oh yeah.

585
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,630
This, that literally, you know,
if I do what I'm, you know,

586
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:55,480
if I flip out right now
and I consistently do this,

587
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:59,140
this could literally drive my daughter
to a trailer park someday. Right.

588
00:29:59,141 --> 00:30:00,850
You know, and, and be one thing,

589
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:04,720
if I was just completely oblivious that
I could just sit at a bar, Go, Nah,

590
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,990
she's a fucking lojack yet out. She grew
up in a house. Now she said a thing,

591
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,320
but I am kind of aware of the effect
of it now and then I would have to sit

592
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:15,610
there and take on that kind of guilt.
So, um, plus I, I don't know. I, I don't,

593
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,470
um, I just growing up, that was a
lot of just the era when I grew up,

594
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:25,090
like every authority, authority
person was just so not approachable.

595
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,880
And as I said this, and this is what
it is, and you shut the fuck up.

596
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:31,900
And it was that just, you know, that's
kind of what stoked the whole fire in me,

597
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:36,160
I think. So I try to, uh, you know,
I think you go one of two ways.

598
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:38,800
You either repeated or you just
remember that. So like, um,

599
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,050
I actually got a really good compliment
from somebody one time. It's like,

600
00:30:41,051 --> 00:30:43,420
you know what? He goes, Mike, you
should gotta come by, come by my house.

601
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:46,750
He goes, my kids love you. And I was
like, really? He goes, yeah. He goes,

602
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:48,430
they let you talk to
them like they're adults.

603
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,930
I wasn't even aware I was doing it like
I would be talking to like is a 10 year

604
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:56,470
old you? What grade are you in a you
getting homework now? Oh that sucked.

605
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:57,070
I hated that.

606
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,830
Like I wasn't thinking that I was and
they kind of liked it that they were

607
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,090
talking to adult like, oh this is,

608
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:05,170
this is somebody older who they think
knows everything he's saying how he hated

609
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:09,010
it. Kinda gave him make an admitted
okay. To be like, oh this sucks man.

610
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:12,790
I hope that did make them not do their
fucking homework, but I would just,

611
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:15,970
you know, I would address it rather than
being like, no, you need to sit down.

612
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,630
You need to learn that this is what
life is. It's sitting there doing shit.

613
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:23,200
You don't want to do like that so much
that you learn that, that you like,

614
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,230
you don't think that you can
actually go out and achieve shit.

615
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,890
Like life becomes like, fuck, when
is this over? Just staring at it

616
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,940
at a clock and people saying that,

617
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:34,510
I think you have the times don't even
mean it. They just think it should.

618
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,370
An adult is supposed to stay like
to say like, you know what I mean?

619
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:38,720
You should know you buckled down.

620
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,840
You tell you what if I said that
anybody out internally beyond shut up.

621
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,500
You don't fucking believe that I cannot
wait to tell my daughter. I don't know.

622
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,120
I cannot wait to tell it. Why is this
blah blah blah. And I'll just, I dunno.

623
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,820
I don't know why I be like, well
you know, cause I don't read. Why?

624
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:56,030
I don't know cause it makes me sleepy.
I'm just gonna fuck brutal honesty.

625
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:58,910
I'm just gonna own up to
it. There's a lot of stuff.

626
00:31:58,911 --> 00:32:01,310
Your dad isn't good at sweetheart.
You want some ice cream? Yeah.

627
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,580
Cause you want, I, I'm, I'm in
the middle. Like I, you know,

628
00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:08,210
I'm at a point where I'm 48 no wife,
no girlfriend. Like I, you know,

629
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:10,410
I don't know if I'm, if I'm
the best boyfriend candidate,

630
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,340
but I'm tired of being single. Like
I'm, I'm kind of, oh, there you go.

631
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:15,170
That's where I take of it.
You got sick of it, right?

632
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,930
Yeah, I got a no, you know
what he did was I finally,

633
00:32:18,931 --> 00:32:22,650
I just looked at like what I was doing
and then you know, we have to like,

634
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,330
I used to joke about that on stage Jeff,

635
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:29,220
like the 90th fucking person that
doesn't go well and there's only so long

636
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,190
you've been doing these chicks are fucking
psychos and after a while it's like,

637
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:33,030
what am I doing?

638
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,610
I chased him away in tech.

639
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:40,400
I've had some updated dated
literally for I lose in text message.

640
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,210
Oh I'm so, I'm so like I want
to either talk dirty or I just,

641
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:47,350
I just want to keep pushing the envelope
and the next thing you know I'm,

642
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,880
they stopped talking to me so I
know I'm doing something wrong.

643
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,710
It's not them then and I'll talk it over.

644
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,110
I'm just creeping them out on
some level. I don't know why.

645
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:57,380
That just reminded me this
last night, I was watching a,

646
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,730
what does that fucking show with Andy
Cohen where he does the wrap ups of the,

647
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,110
uh, the real housewives. Oh, Ron, not
his talk show is look what happens live.

648
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,590
Yes. That shot. Oh, that one. So
my wife always watches that show.

649
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:11,950
That's one of those crossover
shows. I have to watch what they're,

650
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,760
so we don't battle over
the T. Right, right.

651
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:18,860
So I'm watching it with Jennifer
Lopez and I'm, oh Jesus Christ.

652
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,170
It just went blank on
his, uh, Ray Liotta dude.

653
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:25,010
Ray Liotta was fucking hilarious. He
just answers, he doesn't give a shit.

654
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,250
You know, he doesn't, he just answered
everything straight up. Straight up.

655
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:30,900
They were like, what? So for
cocaine, like in Goodfellas,

656
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,400
like what are they using? It was
like cocaine just to say that.

657
00:33:34,401 --> 00:33:37,160
And they would be like, who's the
most, he, they play this thing.

658
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:41,240
You can plead the fifth. And He, oh yeah,
he never, p never pleaded the fifth.

659
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,340
Would they ask him? They
asked him like, uh, Oh,

660
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:49,670
who's the worst kisser of, of anybody?
He said, you've been with this person,

661
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:51,500
but that's what was first. And you
know, Andy's doing all the things.

662
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:55,580
So who was the worst kisser? Like this
was going to be the thing. He goes, uh,

663
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,940
well, I don't think I kissed
any of them. And he goes,

664
00:33:58,941 --> 00:34:00,260
well then who would you
guess? And he goes, oh,

665
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:03,550
Sigourney weaver just set him bigger.

666
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,280
Who's the worst act or most overrated
actor or the 90s? And he goes,

667
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:10,370
most overrated. He goes back and
I'd probably say Clint Eastwood,

668
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,650
and then somebody mumbled,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

669
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:16,510
blah was surely [inaudible] want. He
goes, I don't give a shit. Just like

670
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:22,230
he is kind of untouchable at this point.
He is rally Yoda. He gets, you know,

671
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,430
he know. But it was real. It wasn't
a cop trying to be dangerous.

672
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:27,620
He literally goes, I don't give
a shit. I don't give a shit.

673
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:32,530
I don't give a shit. I'm fucking, I'm
Ray Liotta. And by the way, I who I am,

674
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:34,900
I don't give a shit what
a brilliant game that is,

675
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,960
plead the fifth on one of these
three questions. Then what it'll do,

676
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,960
it was then it would then pass it over
to you and then you gotta you know,

677
00:34:40,961 --> 00:34:44,830
and it's all this, this, uh, you know,

678
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:47,860
he did all these squirming questions
like he was asking like Jennifer Lopez.

679
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,460
Okay. When you, you know, I mean, you've
been proposed to five times, did you?

680
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,050
Who did you say no to? And she's
nice person doesn't want to say it.

681
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,720
And Ray Liotta was just sitting
there going, just plead the fifth on.

682
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,470
I'll answer something like he just
completely didn't give a shit. Oh,

683
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,360
who is the two of them together? Yeah.
Cause they're on that cop show together.

684
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,040
Oh, you know, it's fun. I audition
for that. Uh, I did. Yeah, I did.

685
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:11,440
Doug Davidoff got the
part and he lazy. He,

686
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:14,290
I think he's better for that than I
am anyway. Not just acting ability,

687
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,060
but you know, he looked
more of the part of a,

688
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,010
a kind of a slick like internal
affairs guy if that's who he was.

689
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,490
I didn't know Doug was on that shit.
Yeah. Yeah. He's got a good part.

690
00:35:21,491 --> 00:35:24,760
He brought railroad into the comedy
cellar one night. Um, but you know,

691
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,220
if I'm not going to get it, I'd
rather see somebody I like yet.

692
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,970
That's great. Now he brings in a glimpse
of what your life would have been.

693
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:36,980
Yeah. Cool. Hanging with Bailey
odor, that would've been fun.

694
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,630
That would've been kind of
Nice. Jim, you're on next.

695
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:43,050
What should I say about you? Yeah, it'd
be the, you know, she'd gone up. Sorry.

696
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,680
That was my bad STM. Pros like she
announces you before you go on,

697
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,880
but I understood what you're saying. Oh,
like is bad is that joke was everybody,

698
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,540
uh, Chuck Norden special is going to be
the opposite of that mouthful of shame.

699
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,490
I, I, it's so stupid to
keep going back to this.

700
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:59,490
When people listen to a podcast, it's
not like that because there's no, right,

701
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,820
there's no commercials coming in for it,

702
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:02,720
but I just feel like I have
to keep going back to it.

703
00:36:02,721 --> 00:36:04,350
March 14th in case you forget,

704
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,430
because then they got to rewind and
try to remember where and way of course

705
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:10,770
we'll probably tweet it
out. I did love Netflix too.

706
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:11,910
I've never done anything with them before.

707
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:14,610
I know you've done a bunch of stuff
with them, but they're so easy.

708
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,940
They're like, all right,
just put it together. I need,

709
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,340
Robbie had a couple of minor suggestions.
They don't overly manage you.

710
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:21,600
It was like fucking great.

711
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:25,500
It was so nice to do it and I'm
actually happy with it. Like,

712
00:36:25,501 --> 00:36:27,750
you know you shooting at me like
this one. I actually feel it's,

713
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,550
it's dirtier than I kind of intended.

714
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,940
And wait till next time you go to
Australia, now that it's on, on Netflix,

715
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:36,170
like you'll sell tickets. You
go home. I'm going to a you.

716
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,360
I told you you inspire
me completely to to do,

717
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,840
I'm only doing this stuff because you
got in my head and I hear bill burn my

718
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:45,180
fucking head all the time. God Damn.
What are you waiting for? And I'm like,

719
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,480
I gotta do it. I really do. It's
like, but you are right now.

720
00:36:48,481 --> 00:36:51,000
Watch y'all stop selling
tickets. And I'll be like,

721
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,830
you watching Davidoff coming in with ray.

722
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,640
I'll be watching you selling out the
fucking, what does that thing and Sydney,

723
00:36:56,641 --> 00:37:00,120
the Opera House. I'll be like. I used
to do that. I, I, you know it's funny,

724
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:03,860
I did one show there. It
was a TV tape. No it was,

725
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:07,620
it was a TV taping and something else.
And I enjoyed Sydney. Melbourne was good,

726
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:10,890
but Sydney was really good and I'm like,
like Melbourne a little bit better.

727
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:11,783
You did? Yeah,

728
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,570
I got then park was fun cause I landed
there and was Australia day and everybody

729
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,860
was just fucking getting hammered
and shit. So I was like, hey this,

730
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,530
this country. I didn't go to Perth.

731
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,370
I didn't go was your first time through
was great. And Perth as the Bond Scott.

732
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:27,990
Oh, buried there. They got the stash.
Yeah, we did it. We went to the bond.

733
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:29,100
Scott Wall and Melbourne.

734
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:32,040
It was like in one of the things someone
painted attribute all the bond. Scott,

735
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:36,060
you know it's Bon Scott because they says
ACDC. But if it didn't, you'd be like,

736
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:39,090
you know, or say they say acadeca
down there. I don't know why. Oh,

737
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:42,390
do they really? Yeah. And then what is,
what is Burger King call down there?

738
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,680
I don't remember a
fucking cheese. Yeah. No,

739
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,210
it's something enough friends. No,

740
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:51,420
cause somebody down there actually had
already had a burger king and he sued the

741
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,630
corporation and they, what the fuck
is it? You're looking it up, Jonathan.

742
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:01,050
Um, did you still take us when you
first went through the first time? No.

743
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,651
You know,

744
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:06,180
I think I did the first time I went out
there it was like an oh four and I did

745
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:11,010
something for a comedy central and
we flew in from, from New York,

746
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:15,540
so it was like six hours to five and a
half to la and then lay over and then 14

747
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:20,190
hours and you land, they let you
sleep a little bit and then it's like,

748
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,660
it's already the next day.

749
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,960
And then we taped it and then the next
day he's supposed to go back with so

750
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:26,970
fucking nuts. And so I was
just like, well fuck that.

751
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,900
I'm going to stay here for a few days.
Hungry Jacks, Hungry Jacks. That's right.

752
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,410
Hungry Jacks. That means nothing
to anybody listening to this.

753
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:35,800
But I thought it was cool. Um,

754
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,700
and I just hung out there and I bought
all these ACDC albums on CD that the,

755
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,350
the original like, like was t and
t h to know the names of these,

756
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,960
like t and t was the original album
that then became high voltage,

757
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,330
but their version had
like dirty deeds on it,

758
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,830
which later became [inaudible] album and
an EAP over here. So we went, you know,

759
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,330
I bought like a, all these, you know,

760
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:58,440
cause I got a big family so I just bought
them for all my brothers and sisters.

761
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,330
Yeah. And uh, drove around,

762
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:04,540
saw the apostles and just driving on
the other side of the road was really

763
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:07,090
fucked up. And anytime I went to
take a turn, like the joke was,

764
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:10,480
I would just pretend that I wanted to
kill myself and then I would actually make

765
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,150
the right decision. Cause everything
else, it doesn't even make sense.

766
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,090
You're like, what the fuck? This makes
no sense. Especially when you're, um,

767
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,430
when you make a right turn and
you're sitting, you're sitting on,

768
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,370
on the passenger's side and you gotta
go wide. You're like, what the fuck?

769
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,110
You just picture like a semi. But
late at night when I came out,

770
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,530
I didn't know where the fuck I was
at, but I was with this other comic,

771
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,750
one of those comics.

772
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,700
It was from like Scotland or some shit
and ex patriot and I just met him and I

773
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,080
never saw him again. But uh,

774
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:43,210
we got on the road with no streetlights
and drove probably maybe eight,

775
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:47,470
900 feet and the same time we both went
like, oh shit. Oh Shit. And got over.

776
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,500
But there was nobody coming. We're
definitely was starting to go up a hill.

777
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,740
So yeah, I'm sure people get car
service when you're out there. Jimmy.

778
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:56,230
That's what I'm trying. I, we overheard
when I was there, I mean Uber's there,

779
00:39:56,231 --> 00:39:57,200
it was great, but I'm,

780
00:39:57,201 --> 00:40:00,190
I'm mostly going to Norway and I think
I'm doing something Scandinavian and I've

781
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,320
never been to any of these
places. I'm doing all of them.

782
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,770
That whole run through a Oslow, Helsinki,

783
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,210
Stockholm Dude [inaudible] the best,
but they see those are just places that,

784
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:13,750
you know, as an American to
actually go there. I mean,

785
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:14,740
I think you gotta be like,

786
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:18,610
either you're either in the Illuminati
or you're like a downhill ski or some

787
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:19,444
shit.

788
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,020
Cause other than that you're not going
to go there as far as just not on our

789
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:27,370
radar to go there. Beautiful countries
and the people that the people are great.

790
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,430
Do you fly in and out the city? Can
I have sleep apnea and I fucking,

791
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,060
I take Dramamine to fly. Like I came
this morning from Portland, so I'm like,

792
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,800
I'm very loopy and I'm tired and you'd
just do a show that night and then fly

793
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:41,950
out the next morning. I can't, there
was a, um, I'm panicking about that.

794
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,600
What I do is I turn it into
like a paid vacation. So, um,

795
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,660
what I do is I fly over there and I
either do the tour and then I meet my wife

796
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,010
afterwards or other times I've done it
like just because of our schedules that

797
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,720
work out. Like, all right, let's do
the vacation first. Um, and then, uh,

798
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,600
not only will I be
rested, I'll be, you know,

799
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,960
talking about to acclimate it to
the time and that type of thing.

800
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:12,530
So I've done both, but, uh, you know,
there's all, you know, I build a little,

801
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,890
I build a lot of shit around
sporting events and stuff. Like,

802
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:16,270
you know what I wanted
to go to this year. I,

803
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,060
I don't think it's gonna work out
though, but I was going to go to that,

804
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,400
there's this motorcycle
race on the Isle of Man,

805
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:25,460
which is an island between Britain
and Ireland home saying that, right?

806
00:41:25,461 --> 00:41:27,660
A fucking whales, whatever the
fuck you want to call it. Um,

807
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,300
and it's just this fucking motorcycle
race that's just like, I mean,

808
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,380
more people have died than
years. They've had it.

809
00:41:33,381 --> 00:41:37,850
It's just finally they go on like fucking
200 miles an hour down these country

810
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:40,820
roads and shit and they go, go
like come blazing through town.

811
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:45,260
I mean it's like if you love the
beginning of the last mad max,

812
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,930
this is like the closest you're going
to see to the real version of it.

813
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,410
I mean it, dude, these
guys are fucking lunatics.

814
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:55,220
Like you know that going so fast and
it takes little ass country roads and

815
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,730
there's like stone walls and
shit and trees like yeah,

816
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,350
dead and pedestrians are getting
killed once in awhile too.

817
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm actually surprised that so many
people stand so close that my only

818
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:08,890
nervousness about it is how can I get
high up enough to see a little bit more of

819
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:13,400
it. Right. Because I'm worried that
it's just going to be like, you know,

820
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:16,190
I'm going to stand and go fly halfway
around the world and just see he like

821
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,180
and then stand there for like another
fucking 20 minutes because they go buy

822
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:24,860
that fucking fan and that's it. Yeah.

823
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,500
I went to the Daytona 500 and we
were on the Indian field on like,

824
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,770
I'm like this little building so I could
actually stand and kind of watch him go

825
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:34,310
all the way around. Um,
but like if you just stand,

826
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:36,470
the first time I went to
the Indy 500, I was just,

827
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:40,160
you're just in a corner and it just
becomes this drinking game and everybody's

828
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:43,490
bet on like four different cars and you
just pray to God there's going to be an

829
00:42:43,491 --> 00:42:46,550
accident or some shit in front of you.
Right. Just something interesting. Yeah.

830
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,890
And it's actually really amazing the first
time you see it and you actually hear

831
00:42:48,891 --> 00:42:51,740
this tire skid like a real
accident. You're like, oh yeah,

832
00:42:51,741 --> 00:42:54,860
I guess it is a car for some reason I
never thought it would sound like that.

833
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,740
But the thing is that going so fast as
they'll hit the wall in front of you and

834
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:01,130
then the debris just, they fly down
the scene. The accidents. Yeah.

835
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,250
I saw a guy hit a wall in front of
you one time, but it's like, it's,

836
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:07,890
he hits it in front of you and by the
time your brain reacts to what that is,

837
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,940
he's already a quarter mile away. It's
not like they hit it and just stop.

838
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,170
Do you watch like boxing and MMA cause
you such as sports care, do you watch uh,

839
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,500
combat sports? Yeah, I keep
going in and out of MMA.

840
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:21,650
It's like to pence up my road
schedule where it's like, you know,

841
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:26,480
I work a lot on Saturday night if a couple
months goes by and I keep missing the

842
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:28,730
fights. I hate it, but it's a
big thing that me and my wife do.

843
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:32,320
Like she fucking loves it. The
shit like UFC dude, she's old.

844
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,830
She's almost embarrassing. Like she
gets up and yells at the TV. Oh Great.

845
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,480
She totally gets into it. When, um,

846
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,200
Anderson silver like had the compound
fracture of his leg, I was like,

847
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:43,120
oh my God, look in away.

848
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,380
And she has this weird thing where
maybe she should have gotten the medical

849
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:48,080
field cause she was, it wasn't
like she was happy it happened.

850
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:51,650
She was just more fascinated by what
it looked like. It was just like,

851
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,740
good Lord. Oh yeah. I always
call it. That's like the uh,

852
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:56,630
when they break that fucking thing,

853
00:43:56,631 --> 00:44:00,410
that's like you have a like a little kid
put on like his dad's rain boot steps

854
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:03,160
on the side and just folds up.
Like I can't, I cannot look at it.

855
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:05,600
I was at that fight. That was
their second fight. That was a,

856
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,740
nobody knew what happened like until the
replay you just saw him fall and then

857
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:13,640
the replay played the whole place was
like, oh it was, that was a horrible,

858
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,280
but he's still kicking.
He's still using that leg.

859
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,730
He thought I heard when you break the
bone though doesn't come back stronger.

860
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:22,280
Some weird reasons they might
have strengthened it with metal.

861
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,820
I heard it was a pretty clean break.
Here we go. We're going into the best.

862
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,060
Doesn't make it stronger. You
heard they did metal? Yeah.

863
00:44:29,061 --> 00:44:32,160
We don't know but he's able to
fight with it. Let's just give

864
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,050
answers Jeff. We don't
see why it happened.

865
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,190
I remember over hearing somebody say
that and I never did any background check

866
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:42,450
on them. And have you gone to one
of the fights? Yes. Yes I did.

867
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,130
What is that? Oh is that the picture
of him going by on the stretcher?

868
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,450
Jesus Christ. Jim, you look like
you're in a fucking band dude.

869
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:54,330
I gotta tell you, this guy took
this weight off, what, two,

870
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:59,170
three years ago and you've kept it
off. What are you doing? I just,

871
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,100
just eating in the gym. Just
that, that really is it.

872
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,320
But when did you find that? Cause you,

873
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,490
you are you one of those
up and down there is awful.

874
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:07,470
It's just that moment of
clarity. I'm just like, ugh.

875
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,200
Just so much fucking self discussed.

876
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:12,150
What were you eating and
where were you when you,

877
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:14,850
when you finally were just like,
I can't do this anymore. You know,

878
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:19,380
I really don't remember. I W I do remember
is just going to the gym and going,

879
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:22,620
I am going to go. I, I was
fucking, I was just sick of like,

880
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:27,570
when you feel it in your back above your
belt, that little bit of fucking fat.

881
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,860
It's just soft. Like a little
lamb. I started getting the, uh,

882
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,630
the effort noises, putting on socks.

883
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,360
I was just like, Oh God, I'm becoming
that guy. So I just like, uh,

884
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:42,420
this last trip I just had, I got off the
road two days ago now I've just been,

885
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:43,561
it's so funny,

886
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:48,561
I literally just two days of not eating
burger king or steak and shake and I

887
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:51,120
never, I just kind of fell into this.

888
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,800
I think it was just because of the lack
of sleep I've been getting and just

889
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:58,380
going out on the road and then having
to do the shows and the pressure,

890
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,850
putting them together in the new hour.

891
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,600
I just spent under a lot of stress
that I've just been like last second,

892
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:06,120
I'll fuck, I'm hungry now. Let's
go here. I don't give a shit,

893
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:10,290
just stuff they send me and fill up
the hole. And it just was, uh, yeah.

894
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,420
So La is dangerous for me cause I go,

895
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:17,280
this is what a fucking fruit I'm turning
into. Jonathan and I will look at word.

896
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,300
It is a great fucking fruit. We
eat. Uh, I like eating Sushi here,

897
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:23,670
but then we go to the yogurt
stop on Santa Monica Ball.

898
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,030
I've been going there for years.
They think we're a couple.

899
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,360
It's my favorite place in the world.

900
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:30,810
There's The fucking yogurt stop on
Santa Monica. I love, where is that?

901
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:34,880
It's on Santa Monica by rage West.
Target. Get get, get on. Mike.

902
00:46:34,881 --> 00:46:37,950
I know you're just talking
to Jonathan. Forgot. Put on,

903
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:40,760
put on the fucking headphones. You just
speak into thinner. Jonathan Brownstein.

904
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,710
Everybody. Oh, hello?
Yeah, Jonathan [inaudible],

905
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,080
who was very instrumental when we
first started doing the poetry.

906
00:46:45,081 --> 00:46:46,560
So Neil benefit. That's right.

907
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,260
What's helped me get in touch with
all the guys and everything like that.

908
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:53,400
And uh, it's an amazing thing. It's
still going on. It's incredible. Yeah.

909
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,320
Just let you know how much you
have. No, no, no. It's more retard.

910
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,960
[inaudible] Taryn deals with
all the infrastructure and a,

911
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,160
the heard of add that is booking a
bunch of comedians. Dude, it's hard.

912
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:08,650
Literally, it's like you got 12
cows just fucking, oh, I guess what,

913
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:11,250
what runs cows don't run.
You've got 10 things.

914
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,400
You got 10 fucking things that run
there. We're going a different direction.

915
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:17,790
Things that run all going in different
directions. But if February 21st,

916
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:20,130
that normally wouldn't this,
right? Yes. So we kind of,

917
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:22,650
we kind of know it's going
to be in February now.

918
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,160
Now she lets us know when enough
advanced, that's why we do it Tuesday.

919
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:28,620
Cause sometimes fans go, why the
fuck is this on a Tuesday night?

920
00:47:28,621 --> 00:47:29,980
It's cause cause

921
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,490
guys are working for free and this is
what, that's the day when comedians are,

922
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,480
uh, are in town. So, uh, next year, uh,

923
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,530
I already know like one of
the guys out here every year,

924
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:41,680
we try to like maybe
fly somebody in and uh,

925
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,010
we got an idea of possibly who we're
going to try to use this next year. But,

926
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,410
uh, it's been a great thing
cause I just hate like, you know,

927
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:50,950
like when someone passes away like
with unfortunately where at that age,

928
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,850
you know, and where you had that one
time benefit and you're like, okay,

929
00:47:54,851 --> 00:47:59,500
here's your Sacca cash, good luck
for the next 40 years. And it's um,

930
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,520
you know, he was taking care
of those people. So it's,

931
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:05,170
it's definitely been a great thing.
So the, and the thing about us,

932
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:09,430
here's the B I think of this too this
year, is that it's the fifth annual one.

933
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:13,030
I have officially done this four more
times and Patrice would've done it for me.

934
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,360
[inaudible] this year, I
think might've been this year.

935
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:23,120
I thought it was perfect combination
of a great mix of people.

936
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,950
The ball breaking was on a whole
other fucking level. And then, uh,

937
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,750
when Leslie Jones told that Patrice
Story, oh my God, it was just fucking,

938
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:36,890
no dude. The shit that you said. When
Keith to Keith and Keith Robinson,

939
00:48:36,891 --> 00:48:41,590
Keith Robinson, Keith unfortunately,
uh, suffered a mild stroke. Uh,

940
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,120
was it moment coming up on two years
ago? Was it? No, less than a year. Yeah,

941
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:48,550
a year and a year ago.
And um, he's, you know,

942
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,320
of course now he's doing like some of
the funniest shit or whatever. So Jim,

943
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,110
when he out-tro to meet, goes
keeping going for Keith Robertson,

944
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:57,910
he should have had a stroke 15 years
ago. The place fucking dies laughing.

945
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:03,070
And then your other one was like, uh,
what's funny is even after a stroke,

946
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:06,210
Keith is easier to understand
than rich Vons. That was,

947
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,760
I don't know how you followed it with
the rest of your jokes, but people like,

948
00:49:09,761 --> 00:49:11,580
yeah, people like the
attacks on each other that,

949
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,140
that's always a crowd favorite.
You had one where you said,

950
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,370
I think Colin came after you and
you said, Da, he's here. He's a,

951
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,180
has to be back at men's warehouse soon.

952
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,060
Cause he was wearing a suit
that night and it was, oh God,

953
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,940
my boss's awful hat this year.

954
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,780
And Pete Davidson kept telling them the
truth going, it looks off. I'm like,

955
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:30,040
Pete, that's not how this game works.

956
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:33,210
Tell him it looks good and you wait
till he goes out on stage. Yeah.

957
00:49:33,211 --> 00:49:34,540
You don't try to discourage him.

958
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:37,270
You wait until he's on and then you
fucking attack him in front of the entire

959
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:38,980
theater. It was another, another one.

960
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:41,140
That's the first time we had him
and he came out and he was trashed.

961
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:44,830
And Voss has had, I think they actually
made making fun of us as the old guys.

962
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,440
Um, I, I, yeah, I think that,
but then vos leveled him. Oh.

963
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,230
Cause Pete Pete Talks about his dad dying
on at 11 and voice said the one good

964
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:56,070
thing is that, uh, uh, he,

965
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:59,080
Pete's dad didn't have to see him in
that blouse and he said he would have

966
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:03,370
thrown himself in another fire. Oh yeah.

967
00:50:03,371 --> 00:50:05,700
That fucking, oh my God,
that terrible sweater.

968
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,690
He had artsy golden girls sweaters.
Yeah. That was really bad. It was really,

969
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:13,780
really shitty. I wanted to make fun
of it, but I knew I didn't like it.

970
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:15,430
I'm like, you're on a TV show,

971
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:19,090
you're your fucking good looking young
guy and if you dressed slightly a

972
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:21,070
feminine, it's like you're
not getting enough put sticks.

973
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,720
So I knew that that's what I was
going to come out. And I was like,

974
00:50:22,721 --> 00:50:26,620
I can't come at him. Like the potential
was wrong. Yeah. I knew that I was just,

975
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,360
uh, an old man getting jealous, you know,

976
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,700
now I had Derosa just showed
up and that then I, I have,

977
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:36,230
I mean the sweater off by itself should
have been burnt. It was brutal. It was,

978
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,230
it was bad. But you knew the reasons
for attacking it would have been more.

979
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:42,020
Yeah. It's like one of those
fucking guys. Remember those,

980
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,400
those all those people that Madonna used
to fucking sell home in New York City.

981
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,280
Those, yeah, those Jelly Bean
Beneatha's. Those artists. Yeah.

982
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:51,540
He looked like he fucking,
when he dies his artwork,

983
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,610
it was going to be worth something.

984
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:57,300
Yeah. Like a young, uh, I
believe I have a Basquiat. Yeah.

985
00:50:57,330 --> 00:50:59,310
The young guy of AIDS. That's
what I'm thinking of. Yeah.

986
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:00,471
Kenny, those guys,

987
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:02,990
because it always makes me feel foolish
because everybody looks at this shit

988
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:06,890
like it's fucking amazing. And
like one of the, uh, I dunno,

989
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:10,610
like the two ladies when I always know
that I'm a dope was when I tried to read

990
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:14,150
out loud that and when I go to a museum,

991
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:15,990
because I mean,

992
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,770
do you want to just talk about
flatlining emotionally and it just,

993
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,870
it means not dude. I went,
when I went to Paris,

994
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:25,760
I went into a Lulu. I could not
get out of there fast enough.

995
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:28,850
I was like literally almost shouting
at people. Like, where is it?

996
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:29,930
Where is the fucking,

997
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:33,620
where's the Monalisa so I can look at
it and get the fuck out of here and you

998
00:51:33,621 --> 00:51:35,420
get out of it. And there's all
these people that just, you know,

999
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:39,350
just creating like a alleged with their
other hand and then fucking holding

1000
00:51:39,351 --> 00:51:42,380
their chin with the other one.
And I was just, I just sort of,

1001
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:47,520
I peered over like it was the presidential
motorcade drive and by on book.

1002
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,040
That was it. Did it move you? And he
didn't give a fuck. The only thing I was,

1003
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,700
cause it's been recreated so many times.
He'd be like, that's the actual one.

1004
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:00,600
That's it. Yeah. Dude, I saw the Sistine
Chapel. I could be all fucking smaller.

1005
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,690
Was I think that guy was dogging it.

1006
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,590
I mean it's saying it took
them that fucking long.

1007
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,890
Yeah. I walked in, I literally
was like, this is it.

1008
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:11,430
And somebody went sh sh like shushed me.

1009
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,900
I'll tell you what would be on inspiring
that they recently dug up Christ's tomb

1010
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:20,480
and the church and they had to do
something. They know where he's buried up.

1011
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,110
They know where the suppose the
tomb of Christ. They do know. Yeah,

1012
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:28,020
it's is supposedly fucking Al Capone's
vault probably is the shroud of Turin.

1013
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,840
It probably is bullshit, but
I mean it is in Catholicism.

1014
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,700
They do kind of revere it somewhere
and you know Jerusalem I guess.

1015
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,210
But these guys had to go down and they
were doing some kind of maintenance work

1016
00:52:39,211 --> 00:52:42,750
on it, which they had to be done on
the lid over the tomb. But I'm like,

1017
00:52:42,751 --> 00:52:46,530
that would probably get me like, Ooh,
this is a pretty important place.

1018
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,840
But then the art museum
to do nothing for me.

1019
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:52,410
I did see the Washington crossing the
Delaware painting. It's fucking massive.

1020
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,760
It's probably the size of this room
right now in the Metropolitan Museum art.

1021
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,880
That was kind of,

1022
00:52:56,881 --> 00:53:01,230
what was it that I would rather look at
that shit than something like abstract.

1023
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,040
Yeah, me too.

1024
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,960
That look like you've rolled a baby and
paint and just fuck it through it. Yeah.

1025
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,453
Canvas. I liked

1026
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:10,810
to the van goal one when where? Wherever
the fuck whatever country that's in.

1027
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,850
I went to that and I
actually liked that one.

1028
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:15,040
And it's not because he's a fellow
fucking redhead. It was just,

1029
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:17,590
I actually liked within Netherlands. Yeah.

1030
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,290
How about uh, I like a Norman Rockwell.

1031
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,050
You sure it's not in Denmark? Copenhagen?

1032
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,350
I thought it was Amsterdam, but maybe it
could be the whole way. You dressed me.

1033
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:30,360
Let's me know. I know, I
know that you're right.

1034
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,390
He has his initials on his shirt.
He gives like the air of authority,

1035
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:34,800
but half the times he knows
what he's talking about.

1036
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:36,080
Half the times he does that. Oh,

1037
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,780
this is that what you have your initials
right there? Yeah. That's very unique.

1038
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:42,540
Yeah. The Taylor's, is that
near your, uh, your pancreas?

1039
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:45,360
Is that why you put it there? I
thought you did it on the cuff link.

1040
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,920
On the cuff. There's two styles. You
can do it. The cuff. You can do it here.

1041
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,680
You can. What is that and what
does that style? I don't know.

1042
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:54,150
I've always had it here though,

1043
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:58,520
so I don't know the tailor that I got
this made yet. He did it there, gentlemen.

1044
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,380
Yeah. John does a true
gentleman. Yeah, the truth.

1045
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:04,080
I can tell how difficult you are as a
client because I know when you're not

1046
00:54:04,081 --> 00:54:08,130
around, his shirt is untucked. Yeah.
He's got a little rock and roll.

1047
00:54:08,131 --> 00:54:12,810
Cause I'm in town case, there's chicks
to talk to get him to the Greek.

1048
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:16,650
Um, all right, well coming up on an
hour here at Jim, I'm, I'm s, you know,

1049
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,200
I'm such a fucking huge fan. You
and I always tell you this dude,

1050
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:23,100
I owe so much of the tickets that I sell
to on the road that you were generous

1051
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:23,581
when you got,

1052
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:26,070
a lot of guys would've got that opie and
Anthony Gig and they would've kept the

1053
00:54:26,071 --> 00:54:30,960
fucking door closed and you let us all
run in. So, uh, I I want to thank you.

1054
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:32,740
You know,

1055
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:35,710
you can see I'm blowing all my money
on footlocker tee shirts here now.

1056
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,300
But you do it. You do a well,
deservedly like you're a great comic.

1057
00:54:39,301 --> 00:54:40,430
And I mean it's like, yeah,

1058
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,140
we're going to try to top my compliment
with the compliment you send them.

1059
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:48,860
It is nice to see like mouthful
of shame on Netflix March 14th.

1060
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:52,980
I love you to death, Jimmy. Uh, all
the success in the world to you.

1065

together Monday through Friday,

1066
00:55:08,791 --> 00:55:10,650
eight to 11 on Channel One oh three.

1067
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:13,440
I have satellite radio now and I look
at the list of new guys all the time.

1068
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:15,480
It's great. It's really
finally get caught up. Oh,

1069
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,030
I can't believe how long I did
satellite radio before I got it.

1070
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,880
It's fucking tremendous. You
just got it. I just got it.

1071
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,070
I never had it in my car
and I finally just said,

1072
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:24,720
I finally never bought myself a nice car.

1073
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,420
I'm one of those frugal fucking
Douche bags. So I finally just said,

1074
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:31,610
I'm buying a nice car. Have an idea.
I was just like, whatever. They said,

1075
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,050
you want this? I was like,
yes. Do you want that? Yes.

1076
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,550
Treating yourself climate control.
Yes. I just said yes to everything.

1077
00:55:38,551 --> 00:55:41,400
That's why it gets shitty gas mileage is
so fucking heavy with all the options.

1078
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:45,210
Thanks for have me. Sorry, I was late
too. Oh, you weren't late, Jimmy.

1079
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:49,170
I appreciate you. We're building
anticipation and I'll see you guys.
