00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:04.704
I wrote it, I sent it, I'm ****d

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.376
- So a few years ago,

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.111
in a little apartment
in West Hollywood,

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.947
I was having trouble sleeping.

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:14.880
(cartoon blinks)

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.249
So I was prescribed Ambien.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.383
(thud)

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.352
Then I discovered if I stayed up

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.621
just a little bit
past when I should,

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.124 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
I became someone my
friends fondly named--

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.358 line:0%
- [Voiceover] Jambien.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.394 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Now Jambien loved
to call people,

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.597 align:start size:97% position:3%
she loved to play her
ukulele and sing for people,

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:32.899
she loved to eat.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.134
But in the rare occasion
there wasn't enough food

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.770
in the fridge and there was
nobody answering their phone,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.307 align:start size:94% position:6%
she would send text
messages, she would tweet,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.576 align:start size:88% position:13%
and she would post at
people's Facebook pages.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:47.313 align:start size:97% position:3%
All of these have been erased
in protection of Jamie,

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.548
but this Facebook post:

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:51.650
"U are something else okay.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.719 line:0%
"Just feed me tomorrow morn...

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:54.554 line:0%
"O-kay?

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:56.822
"I want to screens it all

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:59.092
"and set a pop tart
in my mouth to eat.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:00.427 line:0%
"It is T-J, R-E,

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.463 align:start size:84% position:16%
"K-W," which I think
meant can't wait,

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:06.399
"for this to happen
ohzz and it will.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.300 line:0%
"The whoo, whoo bandit.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.403 line:0%
"Toldja she'd be behind it all.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.904
"K bye."

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:14.340 align:start size:97% position:3%
The Who-Who Bandit is somebody
apparently I tweeted about,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.175
about 30 to 40 times.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:19.011
I have no idea who that is,
it's the alternative universe

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:20.279
that Jambien lives in.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.782
I've retired from
my Jambien days,

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.016
at least for the time being.

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:25.685 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
Pro tip: if you've
always wondered

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.588
who your alter ego
is, take Ambien.
