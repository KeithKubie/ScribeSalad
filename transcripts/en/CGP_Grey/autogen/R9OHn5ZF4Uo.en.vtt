00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.020
 On the Internet, your algorithms are everywhere. 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.320
 You are watching this video because a certain algorithm has chosen it (among other videos) to click on it, 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.160
 As you have done, the algorithm has stored this information 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.660
 When you open TweetBook, A algorithm decides what you see 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.960
 When searching between your own images, the algorithm performs the search 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.960
 He may be making a short film for you 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.800
 When you buy something, the algorithm determines the price 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.000
 The algorithm monitors conversions in your bank account if a fraud occurs 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.180
 The stock market is full of algorithms 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.740
 Currency exchange is done by algorithms 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.240
 Given this, you probably want to know how these robots algorithm can organize your world 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.040
 You may want to know what will happen if they do not 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.080
 In the past few days 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.900
 Humans have designed algorithms by giving them steps that humans can understand 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.780
 If this condition is met, then do so 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.080
 But there are many major problems that are difficult for humans to solve with a series of relatively simple codes 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.560
 There are a huge number of financial statements occurring per second, which one is a scam? 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.980
 There are a huge number online 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.680
 Which eight videos should appear as user suggested videos? None of them should be blocked from the entire network. 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.940
 For this flight seat, what is the highest price a user can pay now? 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.500
 Algorithms answer all these questions 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.920
 There are no perfect answers, but they are much better than anyone in it 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.820
 But how these algorithms work, no one knows 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.920
 Not even humans who designed these algorithms 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.880
 Or "built them", 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.860
 As we will see ... 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.420
 Now companies that designed these algorithms do not want to detect the mechanism of action of these robots 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.820
 Because algorithms are considered to be high-value employees 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.300
 Very high value, too 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.660
 And how her mind was programmed is a dangerous secret, can never be revealed 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.640
 I hope that linear algebra has impressed you 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.340
 But what is the current heat in a specific place 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.300
 And how robots work algorithm, is something that is not specifically known and will remain so 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.600
 Let's talk about simpler ways, but closer to understanding, robotics algorithm can work 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.320
 Without having to understand how their minds work 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.240
 Let's say you want a robot that can recognize what it contains 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.220
 Is it a bee, or the number three 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760
 Humans can easily recognize this 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.820
 But it is impossible to tell Bout in his own language about how it works 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.680
 Because the fact that we only know that this bee and that figure three 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.100
 We can tell the bots in our language how they can distinguish between the two pictures, but the bots do not understand our language 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.980
 It is the neural connections in our minds that make it happen anyway 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.800
 While a single neuron can be understood, a cell of cells can not be fully understood 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.020
 However, it works 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.120
 So as to get a bot that can do this sort of sorting, 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 You can not build them yourself 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.200
 You build a bot that builds other bots 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.680
 Brains of these bios "are the simplest, something a smart human programmer can offer. 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.140
 Bot builder builds BIOS, although it's not very good at it. 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.360
 Initially it connects the wire units in the brains of the bot almost randomly. 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.480
 This leads to some very ... 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.440
 "Special" student bots sent to the teacher bot to teach. 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.700
 Of course, the teacher bot can not say bee of three either. 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.220
 If a human can build a bot teacher to do this, well, then, the problem is solved. 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.780
 Instead the human gives the bot teacher a group of images "bees", "three" pictures, 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.960
 And the answer key that is what. 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.440
 Bot teacher can not teach, 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.680
 But bot can teacher test. 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.840
 Adorkable student Sir to stick to their tongues, try very hard, 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.780
 But they are bad at what they do. 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.160
 very bad. 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.040
 And it's not their fault, really, it's built that way. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.600
 Stairways at hand, the student walk takes the march of shame to the construction bot. 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.760
 Those that have been best put on one side, 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.420
 Others recycled. 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.700
 The bot builder is still not good at the construction walk, 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.520
 But now it takes those left and makes copies with changes in new combinations. 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.480
 Back to school they go. 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.940
 The teacher bot teaches - er, tests again, and bot builder builds again. 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.920
 Again, again. 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.240
 Now the builder to build randomly, the teacher who does not know, only tests, 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.020
 Students who can not learn, they are just what, in theory should not work out, 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.760
 But in fact, it does not. 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.000
 Partly because of each iteration, the botanist slaughterhouse stays better and ignores the rest, 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.840
 Partly because the bot teacher does not honor an old-timey, one-room school with dozens of students, 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.460
 But an infinite warehouse with thousands of students. 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.740
 This experience is not ten questions, but millions of questions. 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.420
 How many times do not test, build and test repeat loop? 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.920
 Up to necessary. 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.579
 In the first students that survive is only luck, 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.460
 But by combining the lucky enough walkers, just save what works, 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.240
 And randomly messing with new versions of this 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.020
 The ultimate bot student shows that he is not lucky, 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.540
 Which could hardly possibly say bees of thirties. 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.320
 As this bot is copied and changed, slowly rise the average test score, 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.120
 Thus the degree of need to survive the next round gets higher and higher. 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.580
 Keep this command in the end of the infinite warehouse 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.100
 (Slaughterhouse) 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.760
 Bot student will emerge, who can say a bee of three in an image never before seen well. 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.760
 But how a bot student does this, neither the bot teacher nor the bot builder, 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.100
 Nor human supervisor, can understand. 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.500
 Nor the student's own bot. 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.320
 After saving many useful random changes, the wiring in the head is incredibly complex, 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.140
 While an individual line of code may be understood, general-purpose clusters are available for vague use, 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.920
 All after him, 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.600
 However, it works. 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.220
 But this is frustrating, especially since Bout is a very good student in full 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.000
 Only types of questions have been taught to. 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.520
 It's great with photos, but useless with videos or bewildered if the pictures are upside down, 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.120
 Or things that are obviously not bees, she's sure she is. 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.520
 Since the teacher bot can not teach, 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.240
 All the human supervisor can do is give her more questions, to make the test longer, 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.720
 To include the types of questions the best bots get wrong. 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.640
 This is important to his understanding. 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.540
 It's why businesses are obsessed with data collection. 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.860
 More data worth longer tests equals the best bios. 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.860
 So when you get "Are you human?" Tested on a website, 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.460
 Only prove that you are human, (hopefully), 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.240
 But you also help build a test to make sure the bios you can read, or count, 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.640
 Or say lakes of mountains, or horses of humans. 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.080
 Seeing a lot of questions about driving lately? 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.880
 they ...! What can a test be built for? 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.380
 Now reveal what is in the picture, or videos on the banner, or filtering, 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.260
 Requires humans to make the tests correct enough. 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.220
 But there is another type of test that makes itself. 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.520
 Tests on humans. 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.180
 For example, a virtual hypothetical NetMeTube wanted users to keep watching as long as possible? 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.540
 Well, how long the user stays on the site is easy to measure. 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.620
 So, Bot Tut gives every bot a group of NetMeTube users to watch, 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.580
 The BIOS student watches what user watches, looks at their files, 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.820
 And do their best to capture the video that keeps the user on the site. 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.300
 The son is an average, high test score. 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.380
 Build, test, and repeat. 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.040
 After a million cycles, there is a bot student who is very good at keeping users watching, 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.640
 At least compared to what a human can build. 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.200
 But when people ask: "How does the NetMeTube algorithm select videos?" 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.040
 Again, there is no other big answer from the reference to Bot, 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.140
 And user data has access to 

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.420
 The most vital, how the human supervisors Bot direct teacher to score the test. 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.800
 This is what bot is trying to be good at surviving. 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.420
 But what bot thinks, or how he thinks so, can not really know. 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.000
 All this can be known is that this bot student gets to be an algorithm, 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.160
 Because they indicate the best one percent of the former bot in humans test design. 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.780
 So everywhere on the Internet, behind the scenes, there are tests to increase interaction with the user, 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.240
 Or just set prices right to maximize revenue, 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.180
 Or choose jobs from all your friends you'll like more, or the stuff people will share more, or whatever. 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.840
 If they are testable, they are teachable. Well, "Educable", 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.900
 The student bot graduated from the warehouse to be the algorithm of his own field. 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.540
 At least for some time. 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.440
 We used to the idea that the tools we use, even if we do not understand them, someone does not, 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.980
 But with our machines that know we are growing in position where we use tools, 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.460
 Or are used by tools, 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.720
 That no one, not even the creators, understand. 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.220
 We can only hope to guide them with the tests we take, 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.940
 We need to get comfortable with it, 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.020
 As we have bots my bots are everywhere, and I do not go anywhere. 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.140
 Okay. The walk is watching. 

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.960
 You know what will come. 

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.480
 This is where I need to ask you ... 

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.700
 To love ... 

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.060
 Suspension... 

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.820
 ... and subscription. 

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.620
 And bell me. 

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.040
 Participated in TweetBook. 

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.140
 The algorithm monitors. 

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.200
 It will not show people video ... 

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.560
 Unless you do this. 

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.060
 Look at what you've cut me, and walk. 

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.340
 what do you want? Do you want to watch the time? 

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.600
 Is that what you want? 

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.820
 Fine. 

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.260
 (Sigh ...) Hey guys, do you know I also have w you listen to? 

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:40.200
 Maybe just in the background while you're arranging those in your room for hours? Or whatever? 

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:47.020
 There are hours of audio entertainment for you, watching the time for the walker overseeing your actions. 

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.900
 Go ahead and take a click. Give yourself up. 

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.340
 help my. 

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.420
 Help BIOS.
