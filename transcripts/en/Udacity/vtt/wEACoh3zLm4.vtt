00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.006
[Sebastian:] Welcome to Unit 6 in CS373: Programming a Robotic Car.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:10.974
This is the final unit focused on putting it all together.

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:12.970
Let's now review some of the things you've learned.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.490
You learned about localization, tracking, planning, and control.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.640
And you also learned about probabilities, so-called filters, you learned about A*, dynamic programming (DP),

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.330
and about PID control. This is a lot of stuff, and you implemented quite a bit.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.730
So today, we take all those pieces, and we put them together to build a true, robotic, self-driving car.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.770
Let's start with localizing.
