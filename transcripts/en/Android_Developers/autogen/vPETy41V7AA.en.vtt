more or less the same way when you don't
 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.229
more or less the same way when you don't
have any favorites it's literally just a

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239

have something at the top of the screen
 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.440
have something at the top of the screen

to try and be more positive in terms of

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:33.020
to try and be more positive in terms of
 

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.289
to try and be more positive in terms of
the messaging in terms of just what this

00:29:35.289 --> 00:29:35.299
the messaging in terms of just what this
 

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:36.850
the messaging in terms of just what this
will allow you to do rather than how you

haven't done this thing okay cool yes I
 

00:29:44.779 --> 00:29:46.299
haven't done this thing okay cool yes I
think that's about all of the feedback

00:29:46.299 --> 00:29:46.309
think that's about all of the feedback
 

00:29:46.309 --> 00:29:47.680
think that's about all of the feedback
that I had enough there's any more

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:47.690
that I had enough there's any more
 

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.510
that I had enough there's any more
specific stuff it's it's the thing is

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520
specific stuff it's it's the thing is
 

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.279
specific stuff it's it's the thing is
it's not it's not particularly complex

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:51.289
it's not it's not particularly complex
 

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:54.190
it's not it's not particularly complex
which means that you know once you get

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200
which means that you know once you get
 

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.320
which means that you know once you get
kind of past those those initial sorts

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:56.330
kind of past those those initial sorts
 

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:57.820
kind of past those those initial sorts
of bits of feedback there's not too much

00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:57.830
of bits of feedback there's not too much
 

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.250
of bits of feedback there's not too much

the so what we've done is we're actually
in the process of making this Android

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600
in the process of making this Android
 

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.220
in the process of making this Android
app and it's an alpha at the moment and

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:13.230
app and it's an alpha at the moment and
 

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:17.139
app and it's an alpha at the moment and
it's a few months away from launch and

00:31:17.139 --> 00:31:17.149
it's a few months away from launch and
 

00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:19.639
it's a few months away from launch and
it's the first time we actually showing

00:31:19.639 --> 00:31:19.649
it's the first time we actually showing
 

00:31:19.649 --> 00:31:22.669
it's the first time we actually showing
it off to anyone outside Finn so that's

00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679
it off to anyone outside Finn so that's
 

00:31:22.679 --> 00:31:27.470
it off to anyone outside Finn so that's
pretty cool thank you yes and the idea

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480
pretty cool thank you yes and the idea
 

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.879
pretty cool thank you yes and the idea
behind the app is to make it faster for

00:31:31.879 --> 00:31:31.889
behind the app is to make it faster for
 

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:35.869
behind the app is to make it faster for
people to access the content of thin so

00:31:35.869 --> 00:31:35.879
people to access the content of thin so
 

00:31:35.879 --> 00:31:40.909
people to access the content of thin so
at the moment we have we have a sort of

00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919
at the moment we have we have a sort of
 

00:31:40.919 --> 00:31:43.029
at the moment we have we have a sort of
like a web platform for mobile phones

00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039
like a web platform for mobile phones
 

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:46.879
like a web platform for mobile phones

00:31:46.879 --> 00:31:46.889
and what happens is that if you go onto
 

00:31:46.889 --> 00:31:48.859
and what happens is that if you go onto
Finn you have to go through a number of

00:31:48.859 --> 00:31:48.869
Finn you have to go through a number of
 

00:31:48.869 --> 00:31:51.289
Finn you have to go through a number of
steps in order to do a search so what a

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:51.299
steps in order to do a search so what a
 

00:31:51.299 --> 00:31:53.090

lot of people do is they go on to Finn
 

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.269
lot of people do is they go on to Finn
and then dream about like you know

00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279

Finn and in our current web app for
 

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:07.430
Finn and in our current web app for
mobile what you have to do is see you

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440
mobile what you have to do is see you
 

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.619
mobile what you have to do is see you
open it up and then you click on a

00:32:09.619 --> 00:32:09.629

and then you click search and then
you're at the results page so it's like

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:19.289
you're at the results page so it's like
 

00:32:19.289 --> 00:32:21.200
you're at the results page so it's like
a pretty long process so what we wanted

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:21.210
a pretty long process so what we wanted
 

00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.419
a pretty long process so what we wanted
to do with this app was try to squeeze

00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:23.429
to do with this app was try to squeeze
 

00:32:23.429 --> 00:32:27.200
to do with this app was try to squeeze
down the navigation path a little bit

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:27.210
down the navigation path a little bit
 

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.479
down the navigation path a little bit
and also do something that we haven't

00:32:29.479 --> 00:32:29.489
and also do something that we haven't
 

00:32:29.489 --> 00:32:32.090
and also do something that we haven't
done before and that is to try to be a

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100
done before and that is to try to be a
 

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.450
done before and that is to try to be a
little bit smart about how we deliver

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:34.460
little bit smart about how we deliver
 

00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:38.570
little bit smart about how we deliver
updates and relevant info to the user so

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580
updates and relevant info to the user so
 

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.700
updates and relevant info to the user so
we have so the main page the landing

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:40.710
we have so the main page the landing
 

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.320
we have so the main page the landing
page that you see when you open app is

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:42.330
page that you see when you open app is
 

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.549
page that you see when you open app is
like a stream of content and the idea is

00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559
like a stream of content and the idea is
 

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:49.899
like a stream of content and the idea is
for that content to show new hits on

00:32:49.899 --> 00:32:49.909
for that content to show new hits on
 

00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:53.529
for that content to show new hits on
searches that you have going on

00:32:53.529 --> 00:32:53.539
searches that you have going on
 

00:32:53.539 --> 00:32:56.229
searches that you have going on
and updates to things that you were

00:32:56.229 --> 00:32:56.239
and updates to things that you were
 

00:32:56.239 --> 00:32:59.080
and updates to things that you were
looking for all right well yeah why

00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.090
looking for all right well yeah why
 

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.070
looking for all right well yeah why
don't you tell us a little bit about

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080
don't you tell us a little bit about
 

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.509
don't you tell us a little bit about
what we're missing while I get installed

00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519
what we're missing while I get installed
 

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:04.210
what we're missing while I get installed
over here well it's very pretty up the

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:04.220
over here well it's very pretty up the
 

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.930
over here well it's very pretty up the
now that the navigation departs pretty

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:07.940
now that the navigation departs pretty
 

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.499
now that the navigation departs pretty
significantly from what we consider the

00:33:10.499 --> 00:33:10.509
significantly from what we consider the
 

00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:14.619
significantly from what we consider the
current android standards um we

00:33:14.619 --> 00:33:14.629
current android standards um we
 

00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:17.080
current android standards um we
certainly can't say that it's bad it's

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:17.090
certainly can't say that it's bad it's
 

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.499
certainly can't say that it's bad it's
just it's non-standard so it has a

00:33:19.499 --> 00:33:19.509
just it's non-standard so it has a
 

00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:23.340
just it's non-standard so it has a
possibility of confusing the user and

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:23.350
possibility of confusing the user and
 

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.450
possibility of confusing the user and

anything why I asked about the headers I

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.030
anything why I asked about the headers I
 

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.570
anything why I asked about the headers I
may be able to locate our that I'm

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:11.580
may be able to locate our that I'm
 

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.430

looking for afterwards just by looking

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:13.440
looking for afterwards just by looking
 

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.660
looking for afterwards just by looking
at the header so you could give them

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:14.670
at the header so you could give them
 

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:17.420
at the header so you could give them
something like slide parts over the top

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:17.430
something like slide parts over the top
 

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:21.170
something like slide parts over the top

the sliding drawer for search so this is

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:53.220
the sliding drawer for search so this is
 

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.740
the sliding drawer for search so this is
basically where you have your categories

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:54.750
basically where you have your categories
 

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.270
basically where you have your categories
as well as the actual searching is that

as well as the actual searching is that
 

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.090
as well as the actual searching is that
right yeah that's right so that's all

00:37:59.090 --> 00:37:59.100
right yeah that's right so that's all

different states for the drawer I really

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:05.540
different states for the drawer I really
 

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:07.599
different states for the drawer I really
try to simplify that the other thing is

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:07.609

that I mean we obviously do have

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720
that I mean we obviously do have
 

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.030
that I mean we obviously do have
guidelines I want to talk too much about

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:10.040
guidelines I want to talk too much about
 

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.849
guidelines I want to talk too much about
guidelines here but we do navigation to

00:39:12.849 --> 00:39:12.859
guidelines here but we do navigation to
 

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:15.160

our guidelines he's dude apart quite a

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:15.170
our guidelines he's dude apart quite a
 

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.410
our guidelines he's dude apart quite a
bit from there so I've possible or try

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:17.420
bit from there so I've possible or try
 

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.960
bit from there so I've possible or try
to follow those and really I mean like

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:19.970
to follow those and really I mean like
 

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.880
to follow those and really I mean like

going into the flow doing the search you

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440
going into the flow doing the search you
 

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.780
going into the flow doing the search you
may want to just replace the main

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:25.790
may want to just replace the main
 

00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:29.559
may want to just replace the main
content with each search filter that

00:39:29.559 --> 00:39:29.569
content with each search filter that
 

00:39:29.569 --> 00:39:32.650
content with each search filter that
done might simplify things mmm yeah I

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:32.660
done might simplify things mmm yeah I
 

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:34.359

think that's that's where you're

00:39:34.359 --> 00:39:34.369
think that's that's where you're
 

00:39:34.369 --> 00:39:35.319
think that's that's where you're
absolutely right thing that's where it

00:39:35.319 --> 00:39:35.329
absolutely right thing that's where it
 

00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:37.150
absolutely right thing that's where it
gets confusing is that once you're on

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160
gets confusing is that once you're on
 

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.809
gets confusing is that once you're on
this screen here then search actually

00:39:40.809 --> 00:39:40.819
this screen here then search actually
 

00:39:40.819 --> 00:39:44.799
this screen here then search actually

except that it's different from what you

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520
except that it's different from what you
 

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.099
except that it's different from what you
have in the home screen where search

00:39:48.099 --> 00:39:48.109
have in the home screen where search
 

00:39:48.109 --> 00:39:50.290

sort by category so it's kind of

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400
sort by category so it's kind of
 

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.309
sort by category so it's kind of
different content even if it's related I

00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:54.319
different content even if it's related I
 

00:39:54.319 --> 00:39:56.770
different content even if it's related I
also found it a little bit I I always

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:56.780
also found it a little bit I I always
 

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.210
also found it a little bit I I always
find a little bit disconcerting when you

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:58.220
find a little bit disconcerting when you
 

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:00.670
find a little bit disconcerting when you
have sort of two sliding panels so we

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680
have sort of two sliding panels so we
 

00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.079
have sort of two sliding panels so we
have the sliding drawer on the left

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:02.089

bar or something like that I think this

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:13.910
bar or something like that I think this
 

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.589
bar or something like that I think this
is very non discoverable and I assume

00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599
is very non discoverable and I assume

that pressing that is the same thing

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920
that pressing that is the same thing
 

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.650
that pressing that is the same thing
right so you press the the profile

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:20.660
right so you press the the profile
 

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:24.099
right so you press the the profile
button and that drags it across but I

00:40:24.099 --> 00:40:24.109

think you know this is the idea of the

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:25.970
think you know this is the idea of the
 

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.940
think you know this is the idea of the
way that we use you know there's the

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:27.950
way that we use you know there's the
 

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:29.859
way that we use you know there's the

sliding panels and the drawers as Roman
 

00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:31.839
sliding panels and the drawers as Roman
says this is very different from the way

00:40:31.839 --> 00:40:31.849
says this is very different from the way

says this is very different from the way
we have on the design guidelines and so

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:33.530
we have on the design guidelines and so
 

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:34.990
we have on the design guidelines and so
it can be a little bit disconcerting

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000
it can be a little bit disconcerting

definitely um and I'd love to see some
 

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.750
definitely um and I'd love to see some
of those elements prepped right just

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760
of those elements prepped right just
 

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.520

yeah you have to think about what are

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:00.530
yeah you have to think about what are
 

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.920

it's always tempting to go with an

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:04.910
it's always tempting to go with an
 

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:08.920
it's always tempting to go with an
entirely new design or to have you know

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:08.930
entirely new design or to have you know
 

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:10.780
entirely new design or to have you know
it's also very tempting sometimes to

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:10.790
it's also very tempting sometimes to
 

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.120
it's also very tempting sometimes to
just import design from another mobile

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:13.130
just import design from another mobile
 

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.490
just import design from another mobile
device family but you have to remember

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:15.500
device family but you have to remember
 

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.650

and this will be a learning experience

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:31.820
and this will be a learning experience
 

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.330
and this will be a learning experience
and learning experiences are sometimes

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:34.340
and learning experiences are sometimes
 

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.340
and learning experiences are sometimes
fun but they're often frustrating when

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:36.350
fun but they're often frustrating when
 

00:41:36.350 --> 00:41:38.140

you have a task in mind that you want to
 

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:42.280
you have a task in mind that you want to
get done right I just want to mention

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:42.290
get done right I just want to mention

that we're actually struggling a little

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000
that we're actually struggling a little
 

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.380

look through quite a few android apps

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:50.600
look through quite a few android apps
 

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.350
look through quite a few android apps
and android guidelines and looking for

having the filter stir and part of
reason we did it like this was because

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:02.630
reason we did it like this was because
 

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.690
reason we did it like this was because
it sort of scaled up quite nicely when

it sort of scaled up quite nicely when
 

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:06.340
it sort of scaled up quite nicely when
you're on their tablet so you can have

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:06.350
you're on their tablet so you can have
 

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:10.630
you're on their tablet so you can have
the filter like constantly available on

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640
the filter like constantly available on
 

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.550
the filter like constantly available on
the left-hand side so you can tweak the

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560
the left-hand side so you can tweak the
 

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.680
the left-hand side so you can tweak the
filter as well see in real time updates

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:14.690
filter as well see in real time updates

know this was something that kind of we

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:22.460
know this was something that kind of we
 

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.250
know this was something that kind of we
kind of know that it's not optimal but

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:24.260
kind of know that it's not optimal but
 

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.950
kind of know that it's not optimal but
we didn't we didn't find a better

solution to be honest yeah I he was

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:29.090
solution to be honest yeah I he was
 

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:31.630
solution to be honest yeah I he was
saying I think for the tablet layout it

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640
saying I think for the tablet layout it
 

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.250
saying I think for the tablet layout it
would look great I think it's exactly

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:33.260
would look great I think it's exactly
 

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.810
would look great I think it's exactly
the sort of layout that you want to use

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:34.820
the sort of layout that you want to use
 

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.390
the sort of layout that you want to use
where you have everything on screen you

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400
where you have everything on screen you
 

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.090
where you have everything on screen you
know here it almost feels is the I think

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:40.100
know here it almost feels is the I think
 

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:42.490

it's it's as well rather than any
 

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:46.510
it's it's as well rather than any
individual problem it's more of a

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520
individual problem it's more of a
 

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.610
individual problem it's more of a
combination of a lot of paradigms that

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:48.620
combination of a lot of paradigms that
 

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.380
combination of a lot of paradigms that

then as a as a experienced Android user
 

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.579
then as a as a experienced Android user
you start to get confused as to what you

you start to get confused as to what you

is an UP button which looks similar to

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:12.530
is an UP button which looks similar to
 

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:14.500
is an UP button which looks similar to
what i would expect an UP button to be

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:14.510
what i would expect an UP button to be
 

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.049
what i would expect an UP button to be
but looks different so it again gives me

how you solve them and see if we can
find something that fits into the

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:22.730
find something that fits into the
 

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:24.849
find something that fits into the
Android standard that solves them as

00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:24.859
Android standard that solves them as
 

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:27.220
Android standard that solves them as
alligator now I think there's there's a

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:27.230
alligator now I think there's there's a
 

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.220
alligator now I think there's there's a
lot of there's a lot of hierarchy here

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:30.230
lot of there's a lot of hierarchy here
 

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:31.630
lot of there's a lot of hierarchy here
that's one of the hardest things you

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640
that's one of the hardest things you
 

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.519
that's one of the hardest things you
look at the designers even with

00:44:33.519 --> 00:44:33.529
look at the designers even with
 

00:44:33.529 --> 00:44:34.900
look at the designers even with
different hierarchies and different

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:34.910
different hierarchies and different
 

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:37.480
different hierarchies and different
flows as well as obviously you know when

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:37.490
flows as well as obviously you know when
 

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:39.880
flows as well as obviously you know when
you mentioned before the tablet versus

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:39.890
you mentioned before the tablet versus
 

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:41.710
you mentioned before the tablet versus
one area how the things

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720
one area how the things
 

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.810
one area how the things
kind of things respond to that in sizes

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:43.820
kind of things respond to that in sizes
 

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.849
kind of things respond to that in sizes
definitely no the next few episodes of

00:44:45.849 --> 00:44:45.859
definitely no the next few episodes of

kind of get back into the into the
 

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:53.500
kind of get back into the into the
redesign or the reimagining world so

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:53.510
redesign or the reimagining world so
 

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:54.430
redesign or the reimagining world so
definitely this is one of the absolute

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:54.440
definitely this is one of the absolute
 

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.890
definitely this is one of the absolute
authority yeah I think it's one of the

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:56.900
authority yeah I think it's one of the
 

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.240

challenges that I've seen this a lot

00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:58.250
challenges that I've seen this a lot
 

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.640
challenges that I've seen this a lot

where you have to navigate through
 

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.220
where you have to navigate through
multiple categories and then do multiple

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:06.230
multiple categories and then do multiple
 

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:09.070
multiple categories and then do multiple
sort of filtering you know on each of

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:09.080
sort of filtering you know on each of
 

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.390
sort of filtering you know on each of
those categories it becomes a real

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400
those categories it becomes a real
 

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.070
those categories it becomes a real
challenge I've seen people try and do it

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:12.080
challenge I've seen people try and do it
 

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.800
challenge I've seen people try and do it
using drop downs in the action bar or

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:14.810
using drop downs in the action bar or
 

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:17.349
using drop downs in the action bar or
having you know the the filter controls

00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359
having you know the the filter controls
 

00:45:17.359 --> 00:45:19.720
having you know the the filter controls
here on the top of the screen but then

that sort of multi-level hierarchies
 

00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:29.680
that sort of multi-level hierarchies
definitely a challenge so I would be

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:29.690
definitely a challenge so I would be
 

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.599
definitely a challenge so I would be

things notice actually yeah and pressing
up should actually take you back to the

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:11.000
up should actually take you back to the
 

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.730
up should actually take you back to the
top with the stream in the navigation of

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:12.740
top with the stream in the navigation of
 

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.130
top with the stream in the navigation of
the web so basically you have to give to

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:15.140
the web so basically you have to give to
 

00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.960
the web so basically you have to give to
activities at the top you have the

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:16.970
activities at the top you have the
 

00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:19.150
activities at the top you have the
stream as well as a navigation drawer

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160
stream as well as a navigation drawer
 

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.880
stream as well as a navigation drawer
but as soon as you jump into like cars

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:21.890
but as soon as you jump into like cars
 

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:24.160
but as soon as you jump into like cars
or something else you get taken to a new

so

00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559
so
 

00:46:36.559 --> 00:46:38.589
so
I mean that's one way brochure but I

00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599
I mean that's one way brochure but I
 

00:46:38.599 --> 00:46:39.999
I mean that's one way brochure but I
definitely you know frames with design

00:46:39.999 --> 00:46:40.009
definitely you know frames with design
 

00:46:40.009 --> 00:46:41.199
definitely you know frames with design
an action if you get a chance to take a

00:46:41.199 --> 00:46:41.209
an action if you get a chance to take a
 

00:46:41.209 --> 00:46:43.209
an action if you get a chance to take a
look at this we'll see if that pans out

00:46:43.209 --> 00:46:43.219
look at this we'll see if that pans out
 

00:46:43.219 --> 00:46:45.549
look at this we'll see if that pans out
it's just kind of a off-the-cuff idea

00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559
it's just kind of a off-the-cuff idea
 

00:46:45.559 --> 00:46:48.130
it's just kind of a off-the-cuff idea
yeah I have to admit the that's the one

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:48.140
yeah I have to admit the that's the one
 

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.469
yeah I have to admit the that's the one
thing so I feel every single nature is

00:46:50.469 --> 00:46:50.479
thing so I feel every single nature is
 

00:46:50.479 --> 00:46:52.539
thing so I feel every single nature is
beautiful but the navigation is a little

00:46:52.539 --> 00:46:52.549
beautiful but the navigation is a little
 

00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:55.329
beautiful but the navigation is a little
weird and right now I'm just trying to

00:46:55.329 --> 00:46:55.339
weird and right now I'm just trying to
 

00:46:55.339 --> 00:46:56.349
weird and right now I'm just trying to
figure out how to get back to the

00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359
figure out how to get back to the
 

00:46:56.359 --> 00:47:01.689
figure out how to get back to the
sarcastic yeah yeah it's definitely it's

00:47:01.689 --> 00:47:01.699
sarcastic yeah yeah it's definitely it's
 

00:47:01.699 --> 00:47:03.549
sarcastic yeah yeah it's definitely it's
a beautiful app and I think you know we

00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559
a beautiful app and I think you know we
 

00:47:03.559 --> 00:47:04.870
a beautiful app and I think you know we
really want to emphasize the fact that

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880
really want to emphasize the fact that
 

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.660
really want to emphasize the fact that
it looks great it even understanding

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:07.670
it looks great it even understanding
 

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:10.719
it looks great it even understanding
nothing in terms of Norwegian you're

00:47:10.719 --> 00:47:10.729
nothing in terms of Norwegian you're
 

00:47:10.729 --> 00:47:12.279
nothing in terms of Norwegian you're
still able to navigate it and understand

00:47:12.279 --> 00:47:12.289
still able to navigate it and understand
 

00:47:12.289 --> 00:47:15.309
still able to navigate it and understand
what's going on you've used icons in the

00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319
what's going on you've used icons in the
 

00:47:15.319 --> 00:47:17.199
what's going on you've used icons in the
right places to be able to understand

00:47:17.199 --> 00:47:17.209
right places to be able to understand
 

00:47:17.209 --> 00:47:18.400
right places to be able to understand
like again here even without

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:18.410
like again here even without
 

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:20.529
like again here even without
understanding what these categories are

00:47:20.529 --> 00:47:20.539
understanding what these categories are
 

00:47:20.539 --> 00:47:21.789
understanding what these categories are
it's obvious to me that they are

00:47:21.789 --> 00:47:21.799
it's obvious to me that they are
 

00:47:21.799 --> 00:47:23.650
it's obvious to me that they are
categories and that i can use them to

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:23.660
categories and that i can use them to
 

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:25.689
categories and that i can use them to
navigate into the app and i can figure

00:47:25.689 --> 00:47:25.699
navigate into the app and i can figure
 

00:47:25.699 --> 00:47:27.939
navigate into the app and i can figure
out where searches I understand how to

00:47:27.939 --> 00:47:27.949
out where searches I understand how to
 

00:47:27.949 --> 00:47:29.859
out where searches I understand how to
change prices I understand what I'm

00:47:29.859 --> 00:47:29.869
change prices I understand what I'm
 

00:47:29.869 --> 00:47:32.259
change prices I understand what I'm
looking at what it represents and it

00:47:32.259 --> 00:47:32.269
looking at what it represents and it
 

00:47:32.269 --> 00:47:34.749
looking at what it represents and it
actually it represents a really good

00:47:34.749 --> 00:47:34.759
actually it represents a really good
 

00:47:34.759 --> 00:47:36.729
actually it represents a really good
example of what we should all be doing

00:47:36.729 --> 00:47:36.739
example of what we should all be doing
 

00:47:36.739 --> 00:47:39.309
example of what we should all be doing
when we create our apps which is try and

00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319
when we create our apps which is try and
 

00:47:39.319 --> 00:47:40.900
when we create our apps which is try and
use it without being able to understand

above the map yeah there are some issues

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:27.730
above the map yeah there are some issues
 

01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:30.360
above the map yeah there are some issues
of course with which showing the the

of course with which showing the the
 

01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:32.880

yeah looks so I'm curious to know if

01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:45.910
yeah looks so I'm curious to know if
 

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:48.720
yeah looks so I'm curious to know if
there was a specific driver behind the

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:48.730
there was a specific driver behind the
 

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:50.850
there was a specific driver behind the
creation of the app you know is there a

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:50.860
creation of the app you know is there a
 

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.380
creation of the app you know is there a
reason that you put it together or is it

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:52.390
reason that you put it together or is it
 

01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:54.600
reason that you put it together or is it
kind of an experimental hey we have this

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:54.610
kind of an experimental hey we have this
 

01:02:54.610 --> 01:02:58.230
kind of an experimental hey we have this
real-time data wouldn't it be awesome it

01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:02.650
Android development privately I was
 

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:05.930
Android development privately I was
private prediction I'd never really

01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:05.940
private prediction I'd never really
 

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.830

and work very well designed so it was

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:13.210
and work very well designed so it was
 

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:18.330
and work very well designed so it was
really an idea I had to force myself to

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:18.340
really an idea I had to force myself to
 

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.010
really an idea I had to force myself to
make enough that I would actually have

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:20.020
make enough that I would actually have
 

01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:21.900
make enough that I would actually have
to think about the design and make it

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:21.910
to think about the design and make it
 

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:26.070
to think about the design and make it
usable yeah so it's really it sort of

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:26.080
usable yeah so it's really it sort of
 

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:31.050
usable yeah so it's really it sort of

like that where you can just show
 

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.020
like that where you can just show
multiple lines if you decide that it's

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:52.030
multiple lines if you decide that it's
 

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:54.240
multiple lines if you decide that it's
really like it's not useful to see lines

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:54.250
really like it's not useful to see lines
 

01:03:54.250 --> 01:03:56.520

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.950
be cool to at that point you know when
you get into a detail screen for that

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960
you get into a detail screen for that
 

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.270
you get into a detail screen for that

its projected route or something like

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:09.330
its projected route or something like
 

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:11.510
its projected route or something like
that something something more than just

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520
that something something more than just
 

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.910
that something something more than just
kind of showing on screen but yeah I

01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920
kind of showing on screen but yeah I
 

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.400
kind of showing on screen but yeah I
think the utility of this app is

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:16.410
think the utility of this app is
 

01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:18.560
think the utility of this app is
probably obvious to folks that are that

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:18.570
probably obvious to folks that are that
 

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:20.480

are using this transit for daddy that's

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:20.490
are using this transit for daddy that's
 

01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:22.790
are using this transit for daddy that's
more a bug report or any than anything

01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:22.800
more a bug report or any than anything
 

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.860
more a bug report or any than anything
and I'm like a future requests to I

01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:24.870
and I'm like a future requests to I
 

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.710
and I'm like a future requests to I
think if I were using this app I would

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720
think if I were using this app I would
 

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.780
think if I were using this app I would
also want to click on the station and

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:29.790
also want to click on the station and
 

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:32.960
also want to click on the station and
see when the next train is arriving you

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:32.970
see when the next train is arriving you
 

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:34.790
see when the next train is arriving you
have that information if I click on the

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:34.800
have that information if I click on the
 

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.370
have that information if I click on the
train but if I'm at a particular station

01:07:37.370 --> 01:07:37.380
train but if I'm at a particular station
 

01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.760
train but if I'm at a particular station
and I might be more interested in when

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:40.770
and I might be more interested in when
 

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:42.910
and I might be more interested in when
I'll see the next train at that point

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920
I'll see the next train at that point
 

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.810
I'll see the next train at that point
also I was a bit worried about

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:44.820
also I was a bit worried about
 

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.250
also I was a bit worried about
cluttering them up with too much

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:46.260
cluttering them up with too much
 

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.110
cluttering them up with too much
information so I wasn't really sure of a

01:07:48.110 --> 01:07:48.120
information so I wasn't really sure of a
 

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.180
information so I wasn't really sure of a
clever way to do that because obviously

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:50.190
clever way to do that because obviously
 

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:51.770
clever way to do that because obviously
once the trains around them up which

01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780
once the trains around them up which
 

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:53.960
once the trains around them up which
then on the moment it's quite a lot of

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:53.970
then on the moment it's quite a lot of
 

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:56.150
then on the moment it's quite a lot of
data on screen at one time yeah but

01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160
data on screen at one time yeah but
 

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:58.940
data on screen at one time yeah but
you're always going the the station it's

01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:58.950
you're always going the the station it's
 

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:00.230
you're always going the the station it's
part of the Google Maps there's a little

01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:00.240
part of the Google Maps there's a little
 

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:06.200
part of the Google Maps there's a little
tea in a circle yeah so and in fact if I

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:06.210
tea in a circle yeah so and in fact if I
 

01:08:06.210 --> 01:08:08.090
tea in a circle yeah so and in fact if I
were in the Google Maps application and

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:08.100
were in the Google Maps application and
 

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.310
were in the Google Maps application and
clicked on this key that's exactly what

01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:10.320
clicked on this key that's exactly what
 

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.860
clicked on this key that's exactly what
I would see is the the trains I that

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:15.870
I would see is the the trains I that
 

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:17.300
I would see is the the trains I that
were available at that station I don't

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:17.310
were available at that station I don't
 

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:19.040
were available at that station I don't
think I'd see the real time data that's

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:19.050
think I'd see the real time data that's
 

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:24.019
think I'd see the real time data that's
the value that you provide yeah

01:08:24.019 --> 01:08:24.029
 
 

01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:26.129
 
the other thing which might be useful as

01:08:26.129 --> 01:08:26.139
the other thing which might be useful as
 

01:08:26.139 --> 01:08:28.800
the other thing which might be useful as
well as to provide some kind of link

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:28.810
well as to provide some kind of link
 

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:31.649
well as to provide some kind of link
into to google maps so that once you're

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:31.659
into to google maps so that once you're
 

01:08:31.659 --> 01:08:33.090
into to google maps so that once you're
looking at something here so again if

01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:33.100
looking at something here so again if
 

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.879
looking at something here so again if
you're a if you're a local resident of

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:35.889
you're a if you're a local resident of
 

01:08:35.889 --> 01:08:38.760
you're a if you're a local resident of
oslo and you know where the stations are

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:38.770
oslo and you know where the stations are
 

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:39.809
oslo and you know where the stations are
and you know how to get there and

01:08:39.809 --> 01:08:39.819
and you know how to get there and
 

01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:41.039
and you know how to get there and
everything else and you are really just

01:08:41.039 --> 01:08:41.049
everything else and you are really just
 

01:08:41.049 --> 01:08:42.840
everything else and you are really just
looking to to get an update as to

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:42.850
looking to to get an update as to
 

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:44.459
looking to to get an update as to
basically how long you need to wait for

01:08:44.459 --> 01:08:44.469
basically how long you need to wait for
 

01:08:44.469 --> 01:08:47.129
basically how long you need to wait for
your for your next train to arrive then

01:08:47.129 --> 01:08:47.139
your for your next train to arrive then
 

01:08:47.139 --> 01:08:49.320
your for your next train to arrive then
you know then it's fine but it may be

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:49.330
you know then it's fine but it may be
 

01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:52.200
you know then it's fine but it may be
worth considering you know visitors

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:52.210
worth considering you know visitors
 

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:53.669
worth considering you know visitors
people who are new to the city who might

01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679
people who are new to the city who might
 

01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:55.470
people who are new to the city who might
want to download the app and be able to

01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:55.480
want to download the app and be able to
 

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:57.689
want to download the app and be able to
find out how to get to that particular

01:08:57.689 --> 01:08:57.699
find out how to get to that particular
 

01:08:57.699 --> 01:08:59.910
find out how to get to that particular
station from wherever they are so rather

01:08:59.910 --> 01:08:59.920
station from wherever they are so rather
 

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.559
station from wherever they are so rather
than building all of that into your mat

01:09:01.559 --> 01:09:01.569
than building all of that into your mat
 

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.359
than building all of that into your mat
which i think is fair to say would be

01:09:03.359 --> 01:09:03.369
which i think is fair to say would be
 

01:09:03.369 --> 01:09:06.090
which i think is fair to say would be
overkill would be able to have a way of

01:09:06.090 --> 01:09:06.100
overkill would be able to have a way of
 

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.010
overkill would be able to have a way of
being able to you know as i say when you

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:08.020
being able to you know as i say when you
 

01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:10.320
being able to you know as i say when you
press on a station be able to say you

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:10.330
press on a station be able to say you
 

01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:12.030
press on a station be able to say you
know get directions to here which then

01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040
know get directions to here which then
 

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.470
know get directions to here which then
keeps you out into google maps to

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:13.480
keeps you out into google maps to
 

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.269
keeps you out into google maps to
actually you know show you how to get

01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279
actually you know show you how to get
 

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:21.240
actually you know show you how to get
there yeah yeah it's a it's a nice app

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:21.250
there yeah yeah it's a it's a nice app
 

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.919
there yeah yeah it's a it's a nice app
it's it's really well-designed really

01:09:22.919 --> 01:09:22.929
it's it's really well-designed really
 

01:09:22.929 --> 01:09:25.740
it's it's really well-designed really
clean really uncluttered yeah i think

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:25.750
clean really uncluttered yeah i think
 

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.260
clean really uncluttered yeah i think
it's think it's a really good effort

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:27.270
it's think it's a really good effort
 

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:30.359
it's think it's a really good effort
