00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.236
We use scientific notation to write extremely large numbers or small numbers,

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:08.326
let's review that real quick. At the beach, we could think about measuring a

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:12.509
tiny grain of sand, that grain would measure this many meters. We can rewrite

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.550
this number in scientific notation, using what we learned from Unit 1. For

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.905
scientific notation, the absolute value of our first number, a, must be greater

00:00:20.905 --> 00:00:25.524
than or equal to 1, and less than 10. So we know we need to move the decimal to

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:29.976
the 6. We'll have 6 and 25 hundredths. Next, we need a power of 10 so we can

00:00:29.976 --> 00:00:34.914
move this decimal back to its original position. I know this decimal should move

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:39.104
five places to the left in order to get this number. So my exponent is negative

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:43.124
5. We learned about negative exponents at the beginning of this unit and this

00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:47.095
should make a ton of sense now. Multiplying by a negative power of ten makes a

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:51.166
number smaller because we're really dividing the number by a power of 10. And,

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:55.198
if we carried out the math and moved the 10 to the denominator and then divided

00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:59.238
by 100,000 we would get this decimal. And, remember a positive exponent would

00:00:59.238 --> 00:01:03.055
make sense here. Positive powers of ten make numbers larger but this one's

00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:03.551
smaller.
