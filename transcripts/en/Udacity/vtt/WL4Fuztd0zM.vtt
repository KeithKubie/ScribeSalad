00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.229
So the last integrative therapy that we'll discuss today is called dialectical

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:08.048
behavior therapy which uses a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and

00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:14.465
mindfulness but without the meditation element. This is a common treatment for

00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:19.244
borderline personality disorder. And the idea here is that in this treatment,

00:00:19.244 --> 00:00:23.148
the person will earn to accept without judgement their actions and their

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:29.645
emotions. And if this occurs, then they can have a great reduction in self harm

00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:36.624
behaviors, in substance abuse, and risk for suicide, and depression. And these

00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:40.846
are all common symptoms in borderline personality disorder. And dialectic

00:00:40.846 --> 00:00:44.994
behavior therapy can also be used in treating eating disorders, conduct

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:48.140
disorders, and domestic violence.
