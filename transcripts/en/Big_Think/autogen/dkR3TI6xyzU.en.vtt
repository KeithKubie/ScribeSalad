of that was you could also ignore facts

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010
of that was you could also ignore facts
 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.910
of that was you could also ignore facts
of science for a while and now it's

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920
of science for a while and now it's
 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.559
of science for a while and now it's
coming to a head but man it's really

Wallace called natural selection or
 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.330
Wallace called natural selection or
descent with modification that's those

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340
descent with modification that's those
 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.030

and the world's getting warmer because
of human activity that's a fact if you

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390
of human activity that's a fact if you
 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.850
