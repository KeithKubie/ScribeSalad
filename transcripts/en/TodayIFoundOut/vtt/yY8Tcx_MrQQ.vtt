00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.260
While David Belle is unquestionably known
as the original innovator and spiritual figurehead

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.760
of parkour, the discipline’s origins can
be traced directly back to his father, Raymond,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.189
and his time as a child in Vietnam.

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.830
Though details surrounding Raymond’s early
life are rather hazy, it’s generally accepted

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.590
that he was separated from his parents during
the First Indochina War and taken in by the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.810
French military in the city of Da Lat as an
orphan at just age 7 in 1946.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.500
According to later interviews with his son,
Raymond was routinely abused as a child, which

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.390
motivated him to become as physically fit
and strong as possible so that he could protect

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.930
himself and escape danger if it ever presented
itself.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.220
While being raised in the Da Lat French military
orphanage, Raymond underwent basic military

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.469
training and education, the former of which
he excelled at.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.670
As it turns out, Raymond would regularly sneak
out at night and secretly use the obstacle

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.760
course, repeatedly performing the same actions
again and again until he’d boiled them down

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.470
to their most efficient and basic forms.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.519
To test himself, Raymond would also devise
his own obstacle courses consisting of objects

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.280
in the natural environment and attempt to
move across them in the quickest manner possible.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.330
Because he wasn’t really supposed to be
doing this and faced harsh punishment if he

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.100
was ever caught, Raymond attempted to train
in silence, spending countless hours practising

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.469
how to land without making a sound.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:23.100
Along with learning to be silent, Raymond
would throw himself from increasingly dizzying

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.299
heights to learn to land without hurting himself.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.260
After the culmination of the Indochina war
in 1954, Raymond was granted French citizenship

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.140
and taken back to France where he stayed in
military education right up until just before

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.820
his 19th birthday in 1958.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.090
After graduating, he decided to put his athletic
skills to good use and become a member of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.970
the Paris military fire-fighting regiment
(known in France as the sapeurs-pompiers).

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.640
georgeIt was during his training with the
Paris fire service that Raymond is said to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.840
have encountered the teachings of one Georges
Hébert, a famed physical education expert

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.540
who also happened to be the original inventor
of the military obstacle courses Raymond had

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.420
used to hone his body and skills in his youth.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.200
Raymond became fascinated with Hébert’s
so-called “méthode naturelle” (French

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.369
for Natural Method) of training.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.370
In a nutshell, the “natural method” consisted
of a series of 10 basic exercises that Hébert

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.290
believed were essential to good, all round
physical fitness.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.930
These exercises included running, climbing,
walking, both on two feet and on all fours,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.780
swimming, throwing, lifting, self-defence,
jumping, and balancing.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.809
Hébert was supposedly inspired to create
this more natural approach to physical fitness

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:30.930
during his time as a naval officer in the
early 20th century, during which he often

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.629
encountered indigenous peoples whose physical
fitness and ability to move across uneven,

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.360
sometimes dangerous terrain in a seemingly
natural and fluid way made him believe that

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.459
an organic approach to fitness was superior
to the more regimented one favoured at the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.459
time.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.519
Hébert’s favourite motto, “Être fort
pour être utile” which roughly translates

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.889
to “be strong to be useful”, is also said
to have deeply resonated with Raymond.

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.900
During his fire-fighter training, Raymond
established himself as one of the most capable

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.689
recruits by smashing virtually every record
they had for the obstacle course and then

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.999
doubling down by winning several fire-fighting
competitions, particularly being adept at

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:07.999
rope climbing.

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:12.129
After training, Belle’s superior athleticism
swiftly saw him become a legend in the fire-fighting

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.169
community, with Belle often being called on
to take on the most dangerous missions the

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.209
service faced.

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.040
Perhaps Belle’s most famous exploit, at
least as far as the general public is concerned,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.980
is when he hung from a helicopter in order
to grab a Vietnamese flag that had been attached

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.339
to the top of a flagpole about 300 feet up
on the top of Notre Dame in Paris the day

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.339
before (noted as being the first helicopter
mission ever undertaken by the service).

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:34.059
Raymond would also astound his peers by scaling
buildings in seconds without a ladder by climbing

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:39.569
up the drain pipe and walking naturally along
small ledges, dozens of feet in the air without

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.569
assistance.

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.019
However, it’s the stuff Raymond did behind
the scenes that really made him famous amongst

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.019
fire-fighters.

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.200
You see, due to his almost unique ability
to traverse the environment using what could

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.639
be viewed as a rudimentary form of parkour,
Raymond was often tasked with training new

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.439
recruits and even members of the military
in how to move more efficiently through an

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.989
urban environment.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.159
During one such training exercise, it’s
said that Raymond spoke to a number of new

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.549
recruits about how not fearing heights was
essential to being a good fire-fighter, before

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.680
running at full sprint to a nearby window
and doing a front-flip out of it in full fire-fighting

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.680
uniform.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.790
Stories like these were passed on to Raymond’s
son David, who was so inspired by his father’s

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.289
almost superhuman exploits that he began to
emulate them, eventually resulting in him

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.040
developing parkour- a more flexible version
of the “méthode naturelle” system of

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.340
training Raymond believed in that stressed
efficiency of movement over natural obstacles.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.659
Raymond’s teaching lives on not only through
his son David, but through the French fire

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.350
fighting service of which his other son is
a member.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.030
To this day, the sapeurs-pompiers hone their
skills by engaging in competitions between

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.380
one another to scale obstacles, climb ladders
and carry weights over uneven ground.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.390
They’ve also been known to train in parkour
from time to time with David.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.330
The word “Parkour” is taken from the French
word for the classic obstacle course designed

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.010
by Georges Hébert for the military, “parcours
du combattant” on which David Belle’s

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.010
father trained in his youth.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.900
It’s noted by David Belle that the word
parkour was first coined by a close friend

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:19.240
called, Hubert Kounde.
