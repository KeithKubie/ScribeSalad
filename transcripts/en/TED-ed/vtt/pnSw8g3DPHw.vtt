00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.249
You heard the traveler's tales,

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.029
you followed the crumbling maps,

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.899
and now, after a long and dangerous quest,

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.024
you have some good news and some bad news.

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:19.469
The good news is you've managed to locate
the legendary dungeon

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:22.661
containing the stash 
of ancient Stygian coins

00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:25.595
and the eccentric wizard 
who owns the castle

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:29.244
has even generously
agreed to let you have them.

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:31.964
The bad news is that he's not
quite as generous

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:37.703
about letting you leave the dungeon,
unless you solve his puzzle.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:39.683
The task sounds simple enough.

00:00:39.683 --> 00:00:44.284
Both faces of each coin bear
the fearsome scorpion crest,

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:45.373
one in silver,

00:00:45.373 --> 00:00:47.113
one in gold.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.844
And all you have to do is separate them
into two piles

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:56.294
so that each has the same number
of coins facing silver side up.

00:00:56.294 --> 00:01:00.305
You're about to begin when all
of the torches suddenly blow out

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:02.943
and you're left in total darkness.

00:01:02.943 --> 00:01:05.022
There are hundreds 
of coins in front of you

00:01:05.022 --> 00:01:08.756
and each one feels the same on both sides.

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:11.602
You try to remember 
where the silver-facing coins were,

00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:13.273
but it's hopeless.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:14.771
You've lost track.

00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:17.141
But you do know one thing for certain.

00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:18.612
When there was still light,

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:23.382
you counted exactly 
20 silver-side-up coins in the pile.

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:24.842
What can you do?

00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:29.437
Are you doomed to remain in the dungeon
with your newfound treasure forever?

00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:31.529
You're tempted to kick the pile of coins

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:34.892
and curse the curiosity 
that brought you here.

00:01:34.892 --> 00:01:37.302
But at the last moment, you stop yourself.

00:01:37.302 --> 00:01:41.815
You just realized there's 
a surprisingly easy solution.

00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:43.463
What is it?

00:01:43.463 --> 00:01:46.763
Pause here if you want to figure
it out for yourself.

00:01:46.763 --> 00:01:47.793
Answer in: 3

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:49.163
Answer in: 2

00:01:49.163 --> 00:01:50.893
Answer in: 1

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:54.185
You carefully move aside 20 coins
one by one.

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:57.775
It doesn't matter which ones:
any coins will do,

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.323
and then flip each one of them over.

00:02:00.323 --> 00:02:02.063
That's all there is to it.

00:02:02.063 --> 00:02:04.505
Why does such a simple solution work?

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:08.044
Well, it doesn't matter how many
coins there are to start with.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:12.924
What matters is that only 20
of the total are facing silver side up.

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:15.503
When you take 20 coins in the darkness,

00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:19.088
you have no way of knowing how many
of these silver-facing coins

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:21.947
have ended up in your new pile.

00:02:21.947 --> 00:02:24.274
But let's suppose you got 7 of them.

00:02:24.274 --> 00:02:27.715
This means that there are 13
silver-facing coins left

00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:29.606
in the original pile.

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:33.215
It also means that the other
13 coins in your new pile

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:35.796
are facing gold side up.

00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:40.500
So what happens when you flip
all of the coins in the new pile over?

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.771
Seven gold-facing coins and
13 silver-facing coins

00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:47.995
to match the ones in the original pile.

00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:52.930
It turns out this works no matter how
many of the silver-facing coins you grab,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.930
whether it's all of them, 
a few, or none at all.

00:02:56.521 --> 00:03:00.515
That's because of what's known
as complementary events.

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:04.227
We know that each coin only has
two possible options.

00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:08.476
If it's not facing silver side up,
it must be gold side up,

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:09.847
and vice versa,

00:03:09.847 --> 00:03:12.117
and in any combination of 20 coins,

00:03:12.117 --> 00:03:15.289
the number of gold-facing
and silver-facing coins

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:17.777
must add up to 20.

00:03:17.777 --> 00:03:20.927
We can prove this mathematically
using algebra.

00:03:20.927 --> 00:03:24.498
The number of silver-facing coins
remaining in the original pile

00:03:24.498 --> 00:03:29.167
will always be 20 minus
however many you moved to the new pile.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:32.517
And since your new pile also
has a total of 20 coins,

00:03:32.517 --> 00:03:35.257
its number of gold-facing coins will be

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:39.487
20 minus the amount of 
silver-facing coins you moved.

00:03:39.487 --> 00:03:42.318
When all the coins in the new pile
are flipped,

00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:45.966
these gold-facing coins become
silver-facing coins,

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:51.538
so now the number of silver-facing
coins in both piles is the same.

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:55.159
The gate swings open
and you hurry away with your treasure

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.268
before the wizard changes his mind.

00:03:57.268 --> 00:04:00.877
At the next crossroads, you flip
one of your hard-earned coins

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.800
to determine the way 
to your next adventure.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.350
But before you go, we have another 
quick coin riddle for you –

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.549
one that comes from this video 
sponsor’s excellent website.

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.010
Here we have 8 arrangements of coins.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.790
You can flip over adjacent pairs of coins 
as many times as you like.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.919
A flip always changes gold to silver, 
and silver to gold.

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.176
Can you figure out how to tell, 
at a glance,

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:29.636
which arrangements can be made all gold?

00:04:29.636 --> 00:04:33.916
You can try an interactive version of 
this puzzle and confirm your solution

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:36.296
on Brilliant’s website.

This way, you're building up a 
framework for problem solving,

00:04:52.928 --> 00:04:55.728
instead of just memorizing formulas.
