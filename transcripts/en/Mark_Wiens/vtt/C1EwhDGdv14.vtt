00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:01.345
- Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.345 --> 00:00:03.532
I am hangin out with my buddy.

00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:04.365
- Anton Diaz.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:05.768
- This is Anton.

00:00:05.768 --> 00:00:07.527
And we are in Manila,

00:00:07.527 --> 00:00:09.676
in the heart of Manila in Quiapo,

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:12.380
and we came here to eat
Filipino street food.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.843
So we're gonna show you some of the most

00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:15.951
iconic Filipino street foods,

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:17.884
right in Quiapo market.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:20.634
(Filipino music)

00:00:27.905 --> 00:00:29.011
Along with the Quiapo church,

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:30.245
which you can visit,

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:32.799
you can come here for
a really interesting,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.882
unique market in Manila.

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:36.737
There's lots of street food there.

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:37.864
It's like a flea market,

00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:38.946
an open air flea market,

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:40.576
where you can buy all sorts of things

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:42.556
and even just walking around here

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:46.459
and just observing the
cultures is very fascinating.

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:48.811
(announcement in foreign language)

00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:49.777
So packed,

00:00:49.777 --> 00:00:51.679
and there's so much going on

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:52.749
there's fruit,

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.456
there's a lot of fresh
ingredients as well.

00:00:55.456 --> 00:00:57.668
But then I'm also seeing
a lot of dried fish,

00:00:57.668 --> 00:00:59.359
a lot of street food snacks,

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.790
full of everything you can imagine,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.275
and lots of street food
tucked in every corner.

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:04.708
(children singing)

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:07.375
Oh look at all these dried fish.

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:15.278
(people shouting)

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.205
- Sotanghon? You want Sotangon?

00:01:19.205 --> 00:01:20.460
- [Mark] Yes, please.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.749
It's called Tanghon?

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:22.582
Sotanghon.

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:25.828
The first street food we're gonna try is,

00:01:25.828 --> 00:01:27.367
they have a number of different

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:28.799
noodle-looking dishes,

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.303
and I think this one is Mung Bean noodles,

00:01:31.303 --> 00:01:33.745
and I'm not sure what else,

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:34.963
but some spices,

00:01:34.963 --> 00:01:38.296
and it's made into kind of a soupy dish.

00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:43.275
(people talking)

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:52.266
What is the name of this dish?

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:53.444
- [Anton] Sotanghon.

00:01:53.444 --> 00:01:54.761
- [Mark] Sontanghon.

00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:58.094
- Soup. So it's a glass noodle with egg,

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:01.184
and then palabok,

00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:04.101
one of the popular Filipino pansit.

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:08.658
- [Mark] We just got some front row seats

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:10.908
on some chef's table, yeah.

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:12.985
Okay.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.352
There's an egg in here,

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:17.685
there's the Mung Bean noodles,

00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:18.643
they're long beans,

00:02:18.643 --> 00:02:19.476
there's shallots.

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:23.643
Oh and there's some bits
of meat in here too Anton.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.327
Oh it's hot! Mmm! Oh yeah.

00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:34.311
It's a little bit salty and a little bit,

00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:35.248
kind of like oily,

00:02:35.248 --> 00:02:36.831
the broth is kind of oily,

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:38.288
but then those noodles,

00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:40.202
they just kind of slide right down,

00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:42.429
you barely need to chew
them and they just slide.

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:44.762
I'm gonna dig into this egg.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.653
Oh yeah, an egg makes everything better.

00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:54.611
Oh yeah.

00:02:55.823 --> 00:02:59.573
You cannot eat this fast
because it's so hot.

00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:02.197
Oh that yolk is on fire.

00:03:02.197 --> 00:03:03.493
So now you can do some seasoning,

00:03:03.493 --> 00:03:05.962
so I'm gonna squeeze in a calamansi,

00:03:05.962 --> 00:03:09.569
give it a little bit of
a citrusy-ness to it.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.453
And then also,

00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:13.714
this is like fish sauce.

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:15.974
Add in a little bit of fish sauce.

00:03:15.974 --> 00:03:17.974
Sprinkle in some pepper.

00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:24.722
(dishes clatter)

00:03:24.722 --> 00:03:26.449
This is really a slurping,

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.074
oh, that almost slurped
right out of my mouth,

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:32.491
this is really a dish you've gotta slurp.

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.779
Just been given some rice cakes,

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:37.612
and these are like,

00:03:37.612 --> 00:03:39.159
I think they're steamed rice cakes.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.139
Break a piece of this,

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.494
and they said that it should be eaten

00:03:41.494 --> 00:03:43.161
along with the soup.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.682
It's a little bit sweet,

00:03:47.682 --> 00:03:49.432
and very very spongy.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.280
And a little bit sour as well.

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:00.391
This little street food stall is so tight

00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:02.431
that we had to set up the camera

00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:04.871
across the food from us

00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:06.928
so then Anton and I had got front row,

00:04:06.928 --> 00:04:08.595
these are the best seats in the whole

00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:09.557
street food stall.

00:04:09.557 --> 00:04:10.627
(Anton laughs)

00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:12.465
And we just finished with our bowl

00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:13.440
of the glass noodles,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.722
and now we've got another dish.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:16.555
What's this dish?

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:18.021
- [Anton] This dish is palabok.

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:18.897
- [Mark] Palabok?

00:04:18.897 --> 00:04:21.147
- Yeah, and also, actually,

00:04:22.438 --> 00:04:26.284
(Anton speaks Filipino with vendor)

00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:29.284
topped with poku, tinapa, chicharon.

00:04:31.006 --> 00:04:33.537
- [Mark] Chicharon, okay.

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:35.443
- Before you eat it, you have to

00:04:35.443 --> 00:04:36.859
- Squeeze out some calamansi?

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:37.727
- [Anton] Of course!

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:38.725
- [Mark] Of course!

00:04:38.725 --> 00:04:40.505
(both laugh)

00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:42.341
- [Anton] And you also eat it with puto,

00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:43.174
the rice cake.

00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:44.890
- Oh this is a great atmosphere.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.056
(Anton laughs)

00:04:46.056 --> 00:04:47.375
Awesome place.

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:48.348
And then the key to this dish

00:04:48.348 --> 00:04:49.381
is you've gotta fully mix it all

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:51.883
with the sauce, with the noodles,

00:04:51.883 --> 00:04:54.175
with all those toppings,

00:04:54.175 --> 00:04:55.680
that chicharon in there.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.687
and there's minced meat
I think in here as well?

00:04:57.687 --> 00:05:00.643
- [Anton] Yeah, yeah,
tinapa, which is fish.

00:05:00.643 --> 00:05:01.715
- [Mark] Oh and fish also?

00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:02.548
And tofu?

00:05:03.548 --> 00:05:04.381
So there's a lot of ingredients

00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:05.717
in this little plate of food.

00:05:05.717 --> 00:05:06.550
You gotta eat it fast

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.467
before it all slides off your fork.

00:05:14.788 --> 00:05:15.865
That's awesome man!

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:17.916
It's kind of like goopy.

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:19.013
But then you've got,

00:05:19.013 --> 00:05:23.718
what I can really taste is
the fried garlic in there.

00:05:23.718 --> 00:05:26.342
The fried garlic is really nice in there.

00:05:26.342 --> 00:05:28.203
And it's like goopy and sticky

00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:30.326
and this is just a wonderful street food,

00:05:30.326 --> 00:05:32.297
Filipino street food.

00:05:32.297 --> 00:05:33.275
Thank you very much!

00:05:33.275 --> 00:05:34.543
Thank you very much.

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:35.794
- Thank you, bye bye.

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:36.811
- [Mark] Sarap.
- Sarap.

00:05:36.811 --> 00:05:38.018
- [Anton] And you say salamat.

00:05:38.018 --> 00:05:39.435
- [Mark] Salamat.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:45.650
Okay that was absolutely awesome.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.742
And you just cannot get a better

00:05:47.742 --> 00:05:49.547
street food environment than that.

00:05:49.547 --> 00:05:52.297
(Filipino music)

00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:02.999
This is a market where you can come

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.070
to really get a feel of the real Manila.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.903
It really feels like

00:06:06.903 --> 00:06:08.553
you're in the heart of Manila here.

00:06:08.553 --> 00:06:10.535
The action, every,

00:06:10.535 --> 00:06:11.918
there's so many things for sale

00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:13.963
and people are really friendly
at this market as well.

00:06:13.963 --> 00:06:14.796
Hello!

00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:15.629
- Hello!

00:06:16.913 --> 00:06:17.797
- It's a great place.

00:06:17.797 --> 00:06:19.364
When you're in Manila,

00:06:19.364 --> 00:06:21.301
this is a place you wanna come explore

00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:25.218
if you wanna really feel
the culture of Manila.

00:06:28.983 --> 00:06:30.605
(people shouting)

00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:32.079
It's very busy today.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.203
Is it like this every day?

00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:36.241
Oh okay, it's like this every day.

00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:39.908
(music playing in distance)

00:06:41.131 --> 00:06:44.518
This is a super human traffic jam.

00:06:44.518 --> 00:06:48.268
Alright we made it
through that intersection.

00:06:50.501 --> 00:06:54.001
(announcement over crowd)

00:06:57.698 --> 00:06:59.404
- [Anton] One of the iconic places here

00:06:59.404 --> 00:07:00.630
is the Quiapo Church.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.960
- Okay, and we're standing right next to

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.256
Quiapo Church right now.

00:07:03.256 --> 00:07:06.332
- Yes, and it's home
to the Black Nazarene,

00:07:06.332 --> 00:07:08.972
which is very miraculous.

00:07:08.972 --> 00:07:11.241
People believe if you pray to,

00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:13.751
if you have a devotion
to the Black Nazarene,

00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:15.981
it creates miracles in your life.

00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:18.198
- [Mark] Wow that's awesome.

00:07:18.198 --> 00:07:21.448
(announcer over crowd)

00:07:24.107 --> 00:07:25.909
- [Anton] When we were
growing up as a child,

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:28.491
so fish ball, fish ball carts.

00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:29.383
- [Mark] Are they all fish balls?

00:07:29.383 --> 00:07:30.230
Is there chicken balls as well?

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.340
- No, this is fish ball,

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.094
squid ball, and what you call kikiam,

00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:33.927
like a Chinese.

00:07:33.927 --> 00:07:34.850
- [Mark] All mixed?

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.683
- Yeah.

00:07:35.683 --> 00:07:36.516
- [Mark] Okay.

00:07:36.516 --> 00:07:38.516
- Yeah, so you just get.

00:07:41.205 --> 00:07:42.869
- [Mark] We're standing
right in front of the church

00:07:42.869 --> 00:07:43.844
so it's a little loud.

00:07:43.844 --> 00:07:45.362
I hope you can hear me.

00:07:45.362 --> 00:07:46.516
And so Anton,

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:48.018
you just grab a stick yourself?

00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:49.309
- Yeah.

00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:51.285
- [Mark] And then you just
poke whatever you want.

00:07:51.285 --> 00:07:54.027
- Yes, but you get the toasted ones,

00:07:54.027 --> 00:07:55.861
usually the brown ones.

00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:56.944
- [Mark] You want the brown ones

00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.260
because those are more crispy.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.888
- Yeah, in a sense.

00:07:59.888 --> 00:08:00.867
- [Mark] Okay, so you then just

00:08:00.867 --> 00:08:02.715
choose as many as you want on a stick.

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:05.391
- Yeah, ah you can put it here, yeah.

00:08:05.391 --> 00:08:08.040
- You just choose as many
as you want on a stick

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.577
and then you add the sauce, okay.

00:08:10.577 --> 00:08:12.329
- You can, now it's water,

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:15.746
and you have to, you can put it in a cup.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.267
- [Mark] Oh you have a
fork here to push it on.

00:08:24.267 --> 00:08:26.680
(Mark and Anton laugh)

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.851
That's awesome.

00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:29.055
Come on.

00:08:29.055 --> 00:08:32.638
(man singing over speaker)

00:08:33.743 --> 00:08:34.576
Alright.

00:08:38.136 --> 00:08:40.025
Then you stick it in the cup?

00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:41.764
- [Anton] Yeah, you put it in the cup.

00:08:41.764 --> 00:08:42.847
Then you put,

00:08:46.561 --> 00:08:48.151
- [Mark] And then you move over to the

00:08:48.151 --> 00:08:49.133
sauce station

00:08:49.133 --> 00:08:49.966
- [Anton] Sauce bar, yeah.

00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:51.024
- [Mark] Where you add in your own

00:08:51.024 --> 00:08:52.086
sauce into the cup.

00:08:52.086 --> 00:08:54.483
- Filipino food is known for sauces.

00:08:54.483 --> 00:08:55.826
- And lots of vinegar as well yeah?

00:08:55.826 --> 00:08:57.339
- Lots of vinegar, lots of sauce,

00:08:57.339 --> 00:09:01.255
so you can add with
onions, with chili, yeah.

00:09:01.255 --> 00:09:03.253
And so you usually have a cup

00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:05.138
so that people don't double dip,

00:09:05.138 --> 00:09:06.599
so you create your own sauce.

00:09:06.599 --> 00:09:09.457
- I think this is my favorite sauce here.

00:09:09.457 --> 00:09:11.374
And you take the spoon.

00:09:13.442 --> 00:09:16.525
(stall owner shouts)

00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:21.446
Oh ya that looks good.

00:09:21.446 --> 00:09:22.640
Do I need more, or is that good?

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.816
- [Anton] Yeah just put more, and vinegar.

00:09:25.816 --> 00:09:27.943
- [Mark] Add some more vinegar.

00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:30.432
- [Anton] Alright, and then.

00:09:30.432 --> 00:09:32.008
- [Mark] And add some more sauce?

00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:35.286
- [Anton] Yeah, this is sweet.

00:09:35.286 --> 00:09:36.702
- [Mark] I'll just go with vinegar,

00:09:36.702 --> 00:09:38.486
let it absorb all of that vinegar,

00:09:38.486 --> 00:09:41.403
and those onions, and those chilis.

00:09:42.796 --> 00:09:44.201
Grab some of those chilis.

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:47.721
Alright I got three different
types of fish balls here.

00:09:47.721 --> 00:09:50.388
(choir singing)

00:09:51.376 --> 00:09:54.229
Oh it's still pretty hot!

00:09:54.229 --> 00:09:56.415
It kind of has a gooey texture.

00:09:56.415 --> 00:09:59.671
The vinegar mix is what
really makes it good.

00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:03.024
The vinegar and those onions and chilis.

00:10:03.024 --> 00:10:04.774
Oh look at that bite.

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:10.638
(choir singing)

00:10:10.638 --> 00:10:12.286
They're like hardy fish balls.

00:10:12.286 --> 00:10:14.320
- [Anton] These are a childhood favorite.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.038
Brings back childhood memories.

00:10:16.038 --> 00:10:18.280
You know and having mass,
and then after mass.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.244
- [Mark] Okay.

00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:22.391
And I love the culture of just

00:10:22.391 --> 00:10:24.880
standing here around the cart, eating.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.880
It's so atmospheric and so much fun.

00:10:29.241 --> 00:10:30.885
Anton was just talking to the owner

00:10:30.885 --> 00:10:32.479
of this street food stall,

00:10:32.479 --> 00:10:34.918
and he actually said that
they are chicken balls.

00:10:34.918 --> 00:10:37.034
- Yeah, because they like it bigger,

00:10:37.034 --> 00:10:39.045
and it's two pesos.

00:10:39.045 --> 00:10:40.693
- Two pesos per ball that we just ate?

00:10:40.693 --> 00:10:41.526
- Per ball yeah.

00:10:41.526 --> 00:10:42.435
So it's more profitable.

00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:43.442
- Ah okay.

00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:47.055
- The fish balls are smaller
and one peso or less.

00:10:47.055 --> 00:10:50.152
- [Mark] Okay, okay so they're
actually chicken balls here.

00:10:50.152 --> 00:10:52.224
And then right next door
to the chicken ball stand

00:10:52.224 --> 00:10:54.439
is a dried squid stand.

00:10:54.439 --> 00:10:56.049
And this looks delicious.

00:10:56.049 --> 00:10:57.007
I smelled it,

00:10:57.007 --> 00:10:59.652
and I knew that's what
we need to eat next.

00:10:59.652 --> 00:11:02.319
These are just the squid bodies.

00:11:03.875 --> 00:11:06.208
And then I'm also gonna get,

00:11:09.584 --> 00:11:10.501
two please.

00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:15.182
And those are the squid heads.

00:11:15.182 --> 00:11:16.752
So those are just gonna grill,

00:11:16.752 --> 00:11:18.415
those are gonna toast over the hot coals,

00:11:18.415 --> 00:11:20.165
it looks really fast.

00:11:29.632 --> 00:11:31.215
Go ahead, go ahead.

00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:33.348
- [Anton] With chili, of course!

00:11:33.348 --> 00:11:34.668
- [Mark] Chili.

00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:36.045
- [Anton] Tastes so good.

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:37.176
- [Mark] Tastes so good.

00:11:37.176 --> 00:11:38.426
- [Anton] Yeah.

00:11:39.477 --> 00:11:41.520
- [Mark] You need to get
a lot of onions on there.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.726
Is it onions or shallots?

00:11:43.726 --> 00:11:45.057
- [Anton] Onions, yeah?

00:11:45.057 --> 00:11:46.078
- [Mark] And what you can do is

00:11:46.078 --> 00:11:48.444
you can try to scoop up as much onions

00:11:48.444 --> 00:11:50.462
and chilis and vinegar as you can

00:11:50.462 --> 00:11:52.212
on top of your squid.

00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:54.255
Alright man.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:55.172
- Alright.

00:12:00.343 --> 00:12:03.429
(both laughing)

00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:05.929
- I was trying not to do that.

00:12:07.733 --> 00:12:09.368
They're really tight.

00:12:09.368 --> 00:12:11.987
They're really tight on the skewer

00:12:11.987 --> 00:12:13.945
so if you pull too hard

00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:15.488
all the onions come flying off.

00:12:15.488 --> 00:12:16.901
- [Anton] That's what happens.

00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:18.286
- Oh, that's amazing though.

00:12:18.286 --> 00:12:19.535
Oh that's delicious.

00:12:19.535 --> 00:12:20.445
It's like, yeah,

00:12:20.445 --> 00:12:22.151
it's salty dried squid.

00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.392
Has a little bit of a crispiness to it.

00:12:25.392 --> 00:12:26.524
And then,

00:12:26.524 --> 00:12:27.357
hello.

00:12:27.357 --> 00:12:28.568
- Hi.

00:12:28.568 --> 00:12:30.120
- But I love it with that
vinegar and those onions.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.260
- [Anton] Yeah.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.843
- That's delicious.

00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:39.365
That is a wonderful Filipino street food.

00:12:39.365 --> 00:12:41.239
- Hey, we have to go, because of the mass.

00:12:41.239 --> 00:12:42.996
- Oh.
- You have to dip this.

00:12:42.996 --> 00:12:43.829
- Okay.

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:44.662
What's your name?

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:45.495
- Patrick.

00:12:48.781 --> 00:12:49.724
- [Anton] This is yours.

00:12:49.724 --> 00:12:51.974
- [Mark] You can have that.

00:12:53.505 --> 00:12:54.338
- Nano.

00:12:54.338 --> 00:12:55.171
- Natali.

00:12:55.171 --> 00:12:56.012
- [Mark] My name is Mark.

00:12:56.012 --> 00:12:57.158
- Patrick.

00:12:57.158 --> 00:13:00.075
- [Mark] Patrick. Nice to meet you.

00:13:01.173 --> 00:13:03.148
(speaking Filipino)

00:13:03.148 --> 00:13:04.565
- [Mark] Bye bye.

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:09.003
Quiapo market, there's two sides, right?

00:13:09.003 --> 00:13:09.847
- [Anton] Yeah, yeah.

00:13:09.847 --> 00:13:11.555
- One is by the church,

00:13:11.555 --> 00:13:12.856
surrounding the church.

00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:14.913
- And one is around here.

00:13:14.913 --> 00:13:18.580
- [Mark] So we just
crossed over the street.

00:13:21.023 --> 00:13:24.523
(woman speaking Filipino)

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.137
Oh do you pick and choose?

00:13:39.137 --> 00:13:40.259
Oh you get bowls.

00:13:40.259 --> 00:13:41.092
Oh okay.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.867
(Anton speaking Filipino with vendor)

00:13:58.303 --> 00:14:00.032
We are at the next street food stall,

00:14:00.032 --> 00:14:01.837
and here we're gonna eat kwek-kwek,

00:14:01.837 --> 00:14:02.798
which are,

00:14:02.798 --> 00:14:04.308
it's one of the most famous of all

00:14:04.308 --> 00:14:05.532
Filipino street foods.

00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:07.012
- Yeah, it's quail egg.

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:08.762
Quail egg with flour.

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:11.876
- Looks like it's ready.

00:14:11.876 --> 00:14:13.305
Thank you.

00:14:13.305 --> 00:14:15.473
And then you add your own sauce.

00:14:15.473 --> 00:14:16.306
Thank you.

00:14:17.202 --> 00:14:19.413
These are one-day-old chickens.

00:14:19.413 --> 00:14:20.386
And she deep fried them

00:14:20.386 --> 00:14:22.438
and then she put it on
top of our kwek-kwek,

00:14:22.438 --> 00:14:25.485
which are quail eggs with flour batter

00:14:25.485 --> 00:14:26.649
deep fried around it.

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:29.304
And so then you move
over here to the sauce,

00:14:29.304 --> 00:14:30.750
condiment station.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:33.083
Gotta go in for some onions.

00:14:35.439 --> 00:14:38.606
And also a lot of that chili, oh yeah.

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:42.303
A one-day-old with some good chili on it.

00:14:42.303 --> 00:14:43.454
And then I think I'll just go straight

00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:45.204
for the vinegar next.

00:14:49.258 --> 00:14:50.692
You can never have too much vinegar

00:14:50.692 --> 00:14:52.071
on a one-day-old.

00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:54.821
(Filipino music)

00:14:59.599 --> 00:15:03.766
(Anton speaks Filipino to vendor)

00:15:07.195 --> 00:15:08.028
Okay.

00:15:15.154 --> 00:15:16.214
- It's so good.

00:15:16.214 --> 00:15:17.312
- It's boney.

00:15:17.312 --> 00:15:18.665
It's crispy.

00:15:18.665 --> 00:15:21.270
It's like meaty, it's rubbery.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.834
Okay, next up are the kwek-kwek,

00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:25.692
which are quail eggs in the batter.

00:15:25.692 --> 00:15:29.192
And I think you can one-bite this as well.

00:15:32.602 --> 00:15:35.269
Oh yeah, that is a big mouthful.

00:15:36.326 --> 00:15:38.745
But you got the really creamy egg yolk

00:15:38.745 --> 00:15:40.277
in the center

00:15:40.277 --> 00:15:41.300
and then it's like crispy

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.800
and very fluffy batter on the outside.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.151
Alright, so we are moving on

00:15:45.151 --> 00:15:47.117
to the next street food.

00:15:47.117 --> 00:15:49.867
(Filipino music)

00:15:51.794 --> 00:15:53.794
So this is for takeaway.

00:16:00.321 --> 00:16:03.952
Very cool, yeah, the national sport.

00:16:03.952 --> 00:16:06.108
Basketball is the favorite
sport in the Philippines.

00:16:06.108 --> 00:16:08.445
So you'll just walk around
in the neighborhoods

00:16:08.445 --> 00:16:12.757
and basically in any spare
place throughout Manila

00:16:12.757 --> 00:16:14.384
you'll see little basketball courts.

00:16:14.384 --> 00:16:16.164
So this is just in the neighborhood.

00:16:16.164 --> 00:16:17.876
What's up man?

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:18.995
Hi.

00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:20.194
Watch out.

00:16:20.194 --> 00:16:21.326
(kids speaking Filipino)

00:16:21.326 --> 00:16:22.705
Watch out, watch out.

00:16:22.705 --> 00:16:25.788
(car engine rumbles)

00:16:35.713 --> 00:16:36.713
Yeah, balut.

00:16:39.552 --> 00:16:42.319
- [Vendor] 18, oh maybe 16, 17.

00:16:42.319 --> 00:16:44.322
- [Mark] These are duck eggs right?

00:16:44.322 --> 00:16:45.155
- [Vendor] Duck eggs.

00:16:45.155 --> 00:16:46.748
Anton and I still have not eaten

00:16:46.748 --> 00:16:48.273
the most famous,

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:50.720
or maybe it's the most infamous,

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.160
Filipino street food,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.925
and that is balut.

00:16:53.925 --> 00:16:54.894
- Balut.

00:16:54.894 --> 00:16:57.710
- [Mark] And Balut is a duck egg

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.590
which is partly fertilized,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.595
it's an embryo.

00:17:01.595 --> 00:17:04.884
- [Anton] Yeah, and
usually it's 16, 18 days.

00:17:04.884 --> 00:17:07.372
These one are 18 days old, okay.

00:17:07.372 --> 00:17:09.227
- Okay so they have different stages

00:17:09.227 --> 00:17:10.060
of the duck egg.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.108
You can get one that's eight days,

00:17:12.108 --> 00:17:13.684
or you can get one that's six, 12 days,

00:17:13.684 --> 00:17:15.086
or 16 days, or 18 days.

00:17:15.086 --> 00:17:15.974
- Or 18 days.

00:17:15.974 --> 00:17:17.915
- 18 days. That's what he
said, these are 18 days?

00:17:17.915 --> 00:17:18.748
- So, if it's 18 days,

00:17:18.748 --> 00:17:21.248
just imagine you would see the

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.638
chicken developed already, in a sense.

00:17:24.638 --> 00:17:25.870
- [Mark] A more developed chicken.

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:26.753
- Yeah, with beak.

00:17:26.753 --> 00:17:28.838
(Anton laughs)

00:17:28.838 --> 00:17:29.775
- [Mark] With feathers and, okay.

00:17:29.775 --> 00:17:32.507
- [Anton] More developed duck, sorry.

00:17:32.507 --> 00:17:36.170
- Okay so he said he has 18-day-old balut,

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.222
and that's what we're ordering right now.

00:17:38.222 --> 00:17:39.055
Here's the balut.

00:17:39.055 --> 00:17:40.301
Oh it's nice and hot.

00:17:40.301 --> 00:17:42.930
This is a steamer so the
eggs are kept nice and hot.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.142
And this is a pretty good-sized egg.

00:17:45.142 --> 00:17:46.392
Check that out.

00:17:47.384 --> 00:17:51.134
That's a fistful and
it's very nice and warm.

00:17:53.837 --> 00:17:57.242
(vendor speaking Filipino)

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:58.452
Crack this egg?

00:17:58.452 --> 00:17:59.312
This one yeah?

00:17:59.312 --> 00:18:00.145
- Yeah, yeah.

00:18:00.145 --> 00:18:00.978
- Okay, alright.

00:18:00.978 --> 00:18:02.586
- So the pointed one.

00:18:02.586 --> 00:18:05.000
- Oh the pointed side down.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.833
It's pretty even.

00:18:05.833 --> 00:18:06.666
Oh this is the pointed side?

00:18:06.666 --> 00:18:08.411
- Yeah this one is pretty
even, but they know.

00:18:08.411 --> 00:18:09.600
(both laughing)

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.412
- [Mark] Okay so then you crack it.

00:18:11.412 --> 00:18:13.959
(egg shell cracking)

00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:15.366
And then kind of peel back

00:18:15.366 --> 00:18:17.820
a little bit of that.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.325
There should be some soup in here right?

00:18:19.325 --> 00:18:20.650
- [Anton] Yes.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.770
- One of the best things
about eating balut

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.823
in the Philippines is that

00:18:23.823 --> 00:18:25.234
there are many different components

00:18:25.234 --> 00:18:26.836
all in a single shell.

00:18:26.836 --> 00:18:29.293
So first you've got to drink the soup.

00:18:29.293 --> 00:18:32.142
There's some natural juices and soup

00:18:32.142 --> 00:18:36.227
inside of the shell, so
you drink that first.

00:18:36.227 --> 00:18:37.060
- Alright.

00:18:39.253 --> 00:18:40.806
- Oh that's delicious.

00:18:40.806 --> 00:18:41.986
(Anton laughs)

00:18:41.986 --> 00:18:43.942
Oh, that's just like
concentrated chicken soup.

00:18:43.942 --> 00:18:45.221
- Yeah, it's chicken soup.

00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:46.054
- Oh wow.

00:18:46.054 --> 00:18:48.667
That's like the purest of all chicken soup

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:50.808
because there's no added anything,

00:18:50.808 --> 00:18:52.206
it's just straight from the shell.

00:18:52.206 --> 00:18:53.039
- Yeah.

00:18:56.148 --> 00:18:58.607
- [Mark] Oh yeah, you can now see

00:18:58.607 --> 00:19:02.024
you can start to see the embryo in there.

00:19:02.878 --> 00:19:03.725
- [Anton] The hairs.

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:06.252
- Oh the hairs, oh some juices.

00:19:06.252 --> 00:19:10.011
Alright, there we go, yeah
you can see those feathers.

00:19:10.011 --> 00:19:11.038
- [Anton] Wow.

00:19:11.038 --> 00:19:13.159
- [Mark] You can definitely
see those feathers now.

00:19:13.159 --> 00:19:14.388
Okay I'm gonna add some salt.

00:19:14.388 --> 00:19:15.221
- Yes.

00:19:16.491 --> 00:19:17.770
- [Mark] And vinegar, chili vinegar.

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.306
Okay, I'm gonna season my balut next.

00:19:20.306 --> 00:19:22.862
So add a little bit of salt.

00:19:22.862 --> 00:19:26.029
- [Vendor] A little bit, a little bit.

00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:28.631
- [Mark] Alright, a little
bit of salt on there.

00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:30.779
And then, so I wanna
get some chili vinegar,

00:19:30.779 --> 00:19:31.802
which is my,

00:19:31.802 --> 00:19:33.853
yeah this is my seasoning,

00:19:33.853 --> 00:19:36.179
my condiment of choice in the Philippines.

00:19:36.179 --> 00:19:39.674
(Anton chuckles)

00:19:39.674 --> 00:19:41.715
Oh yeah, season that
with some good vinegar.

00:19:41.715 --> 00:19:45.034
- [Anton] Oh, yeah. Yeah good.

00:19:45.034 --> 00:19:47.436
- You can definitely
see all of the feathers,

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.821
all of the feathers on this balut.

00:19:49.821 --> 00:19:52.148
That is 18 days old.

00:19:52.148 --> 00:19:53.989
Okay I'm gonna go in for the chick

00:19:53.989 --> 00:19:56.225
since it's on the top here.

00:19:56.225 --> 00:20:00.214
Oh I think that is a
chicken foot right there.

00:20:00.214 --> 00:20:01.047
See that?

00:20:01.047 --> 00:20:01.981
- [Anton] Ah yeah.

00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:03.398
- [Mark] Alright.

00:20:07.131 --> 00:20:10.048
Wow, those are definitely feathers.

00:20:11.878 --> 00:20:14.740
There's no denying that in your mouth.

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:17.907
But they are kinda like slimy feathers

00:20:20.871 --> 00:20:23.868
with a very strong poultry flavor.

00:20:23.868 --> 00:20:26.420
A very strong like duck,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.966
actually I taste more of a chicken flavor

00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:30.253
than a duck flavor.

00:20:30.253 --> 00:20:31.213
- [Anton] That's the best part.

00:20:31.213 --> 00:20:33.947
- [Mark] That's a giant yolk, wow.

00:20:33.947 --> 00:20:34.848
- [Anton] Ah that's so yummy.

00:20:34.848 --> 00:20:35.775
- [Mark] Wow look at that,

00:20:35.775 --> 00:20:37.139
Anton check that out man.

00:20:37.139 --> 00:20:39.556
- [Anton] Ah yeah, very good.

00:20:40.683 --> 00:20:42.540
- Oh that yolk is gigantic.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.124
I think I'm gonna add a little more of the

00:20:44.124 --> 00:20:47.159
chili vinegar on this bite.

00:20:47.159 --> 00:20:48.808
You can never have enough chili vinegar

00:20:48.808 --> 00:20:49.944
in the Philippines.

00:20:49.944 --> 00:20:51.491
When you're eating Filipino street food

00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:54.908
that is the, one of the ultimate flavors.

00:21:01.479 --> 00:21:02.787
Oh yeah.

00:21:02.787 --> 00:21:03.742
- That's the best part.

00:21:03.742 --> 00:21:04.987
- That is awesome.

00:21:04.987 --> 00:21:05.869
(Anton laughs)

00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:08.335
Oh it's just like so creamy,

00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:11.842
but it tastes almost like
it's whipped a little bit.

00:21:11.842 --> 00:21:13.177
Really creamy and fluffy.

00:21:13.177 --> 00:21:14.269
And then at the bottom of your balut

00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:16.515
you have this like rock hard,

00:21:16.515 --> 00:21:17.758
what is it?

00:21:17.758 --> 00:21:19.129
- It's the white part.

00:21:19.129 --> 00:21:20.454
- That's the white that's undeveloped?

00:21:20.454 --> 00:21:21.287
- Yeah, yeah.

00:21:21.287 --> 00:21:22.120
- It's the white part of the egg

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:22.953
that it's undeveloped,

00:21:22.953 --> 00:21:25.140
and it's like rock hard
so you don't eat that.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.723
That was delicious.

00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:30.969
(Anton chuckles)

00:21:30.969 --> 00:21:32.447
I'm not saying that balut is something

00:21:32.447 --> 00:21:34.706
I would crave all the time,

00:21:34.706 --> 00:21:38.022
but I think it's actually
tastes pretty good,

00:21:38.022 --> 00:21:40.708
and it is quite fun to to eat as well.

00:21:40.708 --> 00:21:44.960
It's like the ultimate
hard-boiled duck egg

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.617
that you could possibly have.

00:21:46.617 --> 00:21:49.654
Within a shell you have all
the different components

00:21:49.654 --> 00:21:51.862
and all the different textures and tastes.

00:21:51.862 --> 00:21:52.911
And it's so pure,

00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:54.749
it's all just in a single shell.

00:21:54.749 --> 00:21:56.346
When you come to the Philippines

00:21:56.346 --> 00:21:57.940
Balut is something,

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.615
if you're up for an adventure,

00:22:00.615 --> 00:22:01.770
you gotta try balut,

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.113
and yeah, I think it's
pretty delicious actually.

00:22:05.113 --> 00:22:07.950
We have come to the end of
this Filipino street food tour,

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:09.357

00:22:09.357 --> 00:22:10.190

- I wanna say a big

00:22:30.846 --> 00:22:32.010
