00:00:00.325 --> 00:00:01.611
- [Voiceover] Ionic bonds are the bonds

00:00:01.611 --> 00:00:04.026
that hold together ionic compounds.

00:00:04.026 --> 00:00:07.254
So basically it's what holds
together cations and anions.

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:09.297
An example of a compound that's

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:10.992
held together with ionic bonds

00:00:10.992 --> 00:00:15.032
is sodium chloride, also
known as table salt.

00:00:15.032 --> 00:00:16.797
So here we have a close-up picture

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:19.816
of some really nice
crystals of sodium chloride.

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:21.952
And this is something that
you could try at home.

00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:25.156
You can take any table
salt that you might have,

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:27.455
dissolve it up in some water,

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:29.731
and then let that water slowly evaporate.

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:31.170
And if you're lucky, you might get some

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.073
beautiful symmetric crystals like these.

00:00:34.073 --> 00:00:35.419
For me personally at least,

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:37.486
growing crystals that look beautiful

00:00:37.486 --> 00:00:40.737
is one of the most fun
things about chemistry.

00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:42.339
You can see when we look at the

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:44.754
close-up shapes of these crystals

00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:47.331
that they have some
very beautiful symmetry.

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:49.351
That symmetry tells us a little bit

00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:51.743
about the structure of these compounds

00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:53.740
on a molecular level.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.644
If we zoom in on these crystals,

00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:59.429
we can imagine, actually
we don't have to imagine,

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.285
you can look at these with
different kinds of instruments

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:03.678
like x-ray crystallography,

00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:05.977
and you can look at the crystal lattice

00:01:05.977 --> 00:01:07.708
and get information about

00:01:07.708 --> 00:01:11.875
how the different ions are
arranged in the solids.

00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:14.638
So the way that the ions are arranged

00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:16.240
determines a lot of things

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.469
about the properties of these compounds.

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.277
So these ionic bonds and
how the ions are arranged

00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:26.736
tell us a lot about the
solubility of the compound.

00:01:26.736 --> 00:01:27.653
Solubility.

00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:33.921
And other properties like
melting or boiling points.

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:37.510
And it even can be related back to things

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.010
like how hard a particular ionic solid is.

00:01:43.106 --> 00:01:46.147
So the ionic bonds here,
in the sodium chloride,

00:01:46.147 --> 00:01:47.935
are the ones that hold together

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:50.397
our sodium ions and our chloride ions.

00:01:50.397 --> 00:01:52.974
So our sodium plus and our chloride minus.

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:54.599
And the strength of an ionic bond

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:57.766
is related to the electrostatic force.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.812
The electrostatic force between them.

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:08.639
And I'm going to abbreviate
the electrostatic force

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.056
as F subscript e.

00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:16.098
So this is the force
between two charged species.

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:19.098
And it's equal to some constant k...

00:02:25.804 --> 00:02:28.730
Times the two charges that are interacting

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.897
divided by the distance between
the two charges squared.

00:02:34.256 --> 00:02:37.173
So here, q1 and q2 are the charges,

00:02:38.134 --> 00:02:42.569
and in the case of sodium
chloride for example,

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.319
q1 and q2 would be...

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:49.645
q1 might be one plus, from our sodium ion,

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.383
and q2 might be one minus,
from our chloride ion.

00:02:56.942 --> 00:02:58.753
And we could also just switch those two,

00:02:58.753 --> 00:03:01.888
we could say chloride
is q1 and sodium is q2,

00:03:01.888 --> 00:03:06.067
and that wouldn't change what
we get from this equation.

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:09.318
And then r2 here, is the
distance between the ions,

00:03:09.318 --> 00:03:11.965
and we usually approximate it as saying

00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:14.798
it's the sum of the ionic radii...

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.417
for the two ions we're looking at.

00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:22.670
So we can use Coulomb's law here

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.736
to explain some properties
that are related

00:03:24.736 --> 00:03:26.872
to the strengths of ionic bonds.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.868
And so the example we're
gonna go through today

00:03:29.868 --> 00:03:32.956
is going to be that of melting point.

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:35.487
So we're gonna look at
some melting point trends

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:37.461
and try to relate them to the

00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:40.544
different variables in Coulomb's law.

00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:43.591
So the first thing we'll look at,

00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:46.517
the first two compounds we'll compare

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:48.350
are sodium fluoride...

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:52.108
and magnesium oxide.

00:03:55.478 --> 00:03:59.645
Sodium fluoride has a melting
point of 993 degrees Celsius,

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.791
and magnesium oxide has a melting point

00:04:04.791 --> 00:04:06.791
of 2852 degrees Celsius.

00:04:11.942 --> 00:04:14.775
The other information we know
about these two compounds,

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:16.819
if you look up the ionic radii,

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:18.723
it turns out that sodium fluoride,

00:04:18.723 --> 00:04:20.513
the distance between the ions

00:04:20.513 --> 00:04:23.529
is about the same as magnesium oxide.

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:26.525
They're not exactly the same,
but they're pretty close,

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:28.498
so if we were to say that r is

00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:30.565
approximately the same for these two,

00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:32.422
then we can explain the difference

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:35.186
in melting points using the charges.

00:04:35.186 --> 00:04:37.531
Since melting point is a measure of,

00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:39.644
basically how much energy do you need

00:04:39.644 --> 00:04:42.639
to add to these compounds
to break apart your ions,

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.238
we would expect melting point to go up,

00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:48.655
to increase, as Fe increases.

00:04:52.252 --> 00:04:54.481
As the force between the ions increases,

00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:57.268
we would expect to have to add more energy

00:04:57.268 --> 00:04:59.938
to break those ions apart.

00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:02.423
And we can see that in our first example.

00:05:02.423 --> 00:05:05.279
Magnesium oxide, if we look
at the charges on the ions,

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:09.412
magnesium is two plus,
and oxide is two minus.

00:05:09.412 --> 00:05:12.523
In sodium fluoride, sodium is one plus,

00:05:12.523 --> 00:05:14.776
and fluoride is one minus.

00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:18.632
So we would expect, assuming
that r is about the same,

00:05:18.632 --> 00:05:22.369
this q1 times q2 is four times bigger

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:25.869
in magnesium oxide versus sodium fluoride.

00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:30.858
So q1 and q2, the product of q1 and q2...

00:05:33.073 --> 00:05:35.573
is higher for magnesium oxide,

00:05:36.626 --> 00:05:38.321
and that's why we would expect

00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:40.916
the melting point to be higher.

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:45.083
We can also look at sodium
chloride versus sodium fluoride.

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:55.132
And in this case, let's look at,

00:05:55.132 --> 00:05:57.361
well, I don't know, maybe
this is kind of artificial,

00:05:57.361 --> 00:05:59.033
the boiling point, the melting point,

00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:02.383
sorry, the melting
point of sodium chloride

00:06:02.383 --> 00:06:04.466
is 801 degrees Celsius...

00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:11.290
and the melting point
of sodium fluoride is,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.623
like we said early, 993 degrees Celsius.

00:06:17.118 --> 00:06:20.857
And so this time, the charges
are the same on our ions,

00:06:20.857 --> 00:06:24.874
our q1 and q2 is one plus for
the sodium in both compounds,

00:06:24.874 --> 00:06:29.123
and one minus for the
chloride and the fluoride.

00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:32.490
So q1 times q2 didn't change
for these two compounds,

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.657
but since we changed the anion
from fluoride to chloride,

00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:39.418
we increased r here,

00:06:41.104 --> 00:06:43.821
and increasing r in the denominator makes

00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:47.211
the electrostatic force goes down.

00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:50.810
Another way we could put it
is that since r decreases,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.804
as we go from sodium
chloride to sodium fluoride,

00:06:54.804 --> 00:06:56.971
the melting point goes up.

00:06:58.241 --> 00:06:59.982
So in each of these pairs,

00:06:59.982 --> 00:07:03.861
the compound that has
the higher melting point

00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:05.778
is the one that also...

00:07:08.485 --> 00:07:11.612
has the higher electrostatic forces,

00:07:11.612 --> 00:07:14.399
and that's either because
the charges are higher,

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:15.838
q1 and q2 are higher,

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:19.275
or because the distance
between the ions went down.

00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:22.201
So these are some examples
for how we can relate

00:07:22.201 --> 00:07:24.174
the properties of ionic compounds

00:07:24.174 --> 00:07:27.750
to the electrostatic
force using Coulomb's law

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.500
between the cation and the anion.
