00:00:01.182 --> 00:00:02.443
Voiceover: I'm here
with Elizabeth Slavitt.

00:00:02.443 --> 00:00:04.511
What do you do here at the Khan Academy?

00:00:04.511 --> 00:00:07.073
Elizabeth: Well I work on the
school implementations team,

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:11.553
which means that I work with schools
that want to use Khan Academy software,

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:15.478
to individualize in their classrooms
and to be really innovative.

00:00:15.478 --> 00:00:17.651
I work with them to figure
out how to make that happen.

00:00:17.974 --> 00:00:20.809
I also work on lots of different
parts of the product and things too.

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:22.810
Since we're a startup we
all kind of do everything.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.250
Voiceover: And what were
you doing before this?

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:29.368
What's kind of the arc of your career?

00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:32.441
What did you think you were going
to do when you were in college,

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:35.307
and what did you end up doing, and then
how did you essentially end up here?

00:00:35.307 --> 00:00:36.082
Elizabeth: Sure, yeah.

00:00:36.082 --> 00:00:36.934
Those are great questions.

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:40.347
So, in college I studied history at Penn.

00:00:40.347 --> 00:00:43.685
I studied, actually, intellectual
history, so the history of ideas.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.443
I focused a lot on human rights.

00:00:46.443 --> 00:00:49.278
I really was interested and still
am interested in human rights,

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:53.185
and how that term changes
in meaning over time.

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:57.658
I thought about spending my career
in human rights in some way,

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.536
which is very vague and
kind of very esoteric idea.

00:01:00.536 --> 00:01:01.272
Voiceover: Idealistic.

00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:02.270
Sounds good though.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.842
Elizabeth: Idealistic, yes.

00:01:03.903 --> 00:01:04.692
Also kind of vague.

00:01:04.692 --> 00:01:08.175
After college I wanted
some tangible skills,

00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:11.313
so I went and worked as a
management consultant at McKinsey,

00:01:11.313 --> 00:01:14.407
where I got to help solve a lot
of really interesting problems.

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.009
Voiceover: So to work at
McKinsey coming out of U,

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.773
you must have been a pretty good student.

00:01:17.773 --> 00:01:19.217
Elizabeth: Yeah, I was a good student.

00:01:19.463 --> 00:01:22.686
Voiceover: Like McKinsey, if
you have straight C students
they don't interview, right?

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.400
Elizabeth: Yeah, I guess not (laughs).

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:26.468
Voiceover: Well anyway.

00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:27.388
What was your thought [unintelligible],

00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:31.611
because went from a very idealistic
human rights, save the world,

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:36.327
to oh I'm going to go whisper in CEOs ears
and tell them how to run their company.

00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:36.963
What was the-

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:37.812
Elizabeth: Yeah, there's
a lot of whispering.

00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:39.422
Voiceover: Yeah, exactly [unintelligible].

00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:42.330
So what was the thought, McKinsey's
a great company obviously.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.830
What was the thought process
of deciding to do that?

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.499
Elizabeth: Yeah.

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:48.124
I guess I felt like coming out of college,

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:52.172
there was actually an interesting article
recently about this in the Atlantic,

00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:55.250
about how a lot of people go and
study these really esoteric things,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.619
and then they're like, "I don't have any
skills. Let me go become a consultant,

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.033
"or work on Wall Street or
something and learn some skills."

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:02.421
That was kind of true for me.

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:05.110
I knew I wanted to solve
complicated problems.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.822
Wasn't quite sure how to do that.

00:02:06.822 --> 00:02:08.870
I knew McKinsey solved
complicated problems.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.268
Even if they weren't exactly the
problems I wanted to solve long term,

00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:13.782
I thought it'd be a good
way to get some skills,

00:02:13.782 --> 00:02:17.323
and also just to understand how the
world works, how the economy works.

00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:19.745
All these thing that
seemed kind of vague to me,

00:02:19.745 --> 00:02:21.846
that I thought I could
kind of get a window into.

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:23.316
Voiceover: So what was
that experience like?

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:25.673
Was it what you expected?

00:02:25.673 --> 00:02:26.737
Elizabeth: Yeah.

00:02:26.737 --> 00:02:27.621
I learned a lot there.

00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:29.358
It was a great education.

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:31.129
In a lot of ways it was
like being in school,

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.823
because every few months
you're learning something new,

00:02:32.823 --> 00:02:35.004
and you're learning all
these different industries,

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:38.511
and solving all these crazy problems
that are probably way beyond,

00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:40.997
anything I should have been thinking
about at that point in my life (laughs).

00:02:40.997 --> 00:02:42.442
But it was fascinating.

00:02:42.442 --> 00:02:45.500
The people were really smart so
I got to learn a lot from them.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.168
Voiceover: And you were very
young and you were in rooms,

00:02:47.168 --> 00:02:52.440
with heads of corporations and executives
and that must've been pretty neat.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.276
Elizabeth: Yeah it was cool and
also kind of scary and weird.

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:57.292
There were times I thought like, "Man
this should be a novel or something."

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:58.415
Voiceover: Oh really?

00:02:58.415 --> 00:02:59.356
I haven't heard about those.

00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:00.115
Elizabeth: It's just so weird.

00:03:00.115 --> 00:03:01.850
Voiceover: That'll be future videos.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.266
We'll change the names.

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.343
Elizabeth: No, I mean, it was great.

00:03:04.343 --> 00:03:07.897
I learned a ton but I knew
I still wanted to get back,

00:03:07.897 --> 00:03:11.189
to the problems that were
really interesting to me.

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.936
And McKinsey does work
on that to some extent,

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:16.022
but a lot of what I was doing
were problems that were different,

00:03:16.022 --> 00:03:17.927
than the ones I really
wanted to spend my time on.

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:19.852
I thought maybe I'd go
get some more skills,

00:03:19.852 --> 00:03:21.147
and go to law school.

00:03:21.147 --> 00:03:25.179
As we've talked about, I was planning to
go to law school right after McKinsey,

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:29.702
and work on human rights, go back to what
I really had wanted to do for a while.

00:03:29.702 --> 00:03:34.225
Then I heard about Khan Academy
and just sounded really exciting,

00:03:34.225 --> 00:03:37.495
and of course, I know I'll embarrass
you, but I watched the Ted Talk,

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:39.372
I was very inspired.

00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:40.451
I'm very excited.

00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:44.794
I heard that Khan Academy was looking
to put together a schools team,

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:45.793
to work with schools.

00:03:45.793 --> 00:03:48.906
It sounded exciting to
me and so here I am.

00:03:48.906 --> 00:03:51.240
Voiceover: Was there anything that was ...

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.262
because you were on
this kind of fast track.

00:03:53.262 --> 00:03:54.289
You were at McKinsey.

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:55.535
You spent what 2, 3 years?

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:56.142
Elizabeth: 3 years, yeah.

00:03:56.142 --> 00:03:58.177
Voiceover: 3 years at McKinsey and,
actually, I saw some of your reviews.

00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:00.648
You were like one of the most
highly rated person we've ...

00:04:00.648 --> 00:04:03.761
[Shadnu] told me that, "The
type of ratings Elizabeth gets,

00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:06.141
"not very few people at McKinsey get."

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:08.758
So you were on this fast track, you're
set probably for a very good law school.

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:12.779
Was it just the mission?

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.152
That we're education?

00:04:14.152 --> 00:04:18.335
What spoke to you about this whole thing?

00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:20.116
Elizabeth: Yeah, it was
largely the mission.

00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:23.094
I think that mission means a lot to me.

00:04:23.094 --> 00:04:24.758
Knowing that I could get up every
morning and work on something,

00:04:24.758 --> 00:04:28.800
that I'm really excited
about was a lot of it.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:29.911
It was also something even
bigger than the mission,

00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:32.843
if there's anything bigger than
educating the whole world for free,

00:04:32.843 --> 00:04:33.369
I don't know.

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:36.196
I think it was getting
to start something new.

00:04:36.196 --> 00:04:38.398
It was this idea that,
how often in your life,

00:04:38.398 --> 00:04:41.477
does someone come along and say
to you, "Be part of this team,

00:04:41.477 --> 00:04:43.674
"that's building something
that doesn't yet exist."

00:04:43.674 --> 00:04:46.768
It's not just sort of different than
a bunch of other things that exist.

00:04:46.768 --> 00:04:50.885
It's something totally new that's
trying to solve a really, really tough,

00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:52.376
entrenched social problem.

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:55.549
It's a start up and maybe
it'll work and maybe it won't,

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:58.532
but it's going to be with a lot
of really smart, dedicated people,

00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:00.503
who really want to make a go of it.

00:05:00.503 --> 00:05:01.722
That's exciting.

00:05:01.722 --> 00:05:06.345
I think that I just felt like I could
stay on the tried and true path,

00:05:06.345 --> 00:05:08.398
and I'm sure that would have
been rewarding in its own right.

00:05:08.398 --> 00:05:12.210
Or I could branch off that and try
to build something from scratch,

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.715
with a lot of other awesome people.

00:05:13.715 --> 00:05:15.306
And try to make a goal of it.

00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:17.388
Really try to solve this problem.

00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:19.513
I just felt like I couldn't
pass up the opportunity.

00:05:20.835 --> 00:05:23.314
Voiceover: You joined,
about 7 or 8 months now,

00:05:23.314 --> 00:05:27.489
at the time we're doing this
interview in late February of 2012.

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:30.614
Is there anything that's been surprising,

00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:31.986
or it's just as you expected?

00:05:31.986 --> 00:05:35.640
Exactly as you visualized it while
you were about to leave McKinsey?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.569
Or disappointing?

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:38.679
What's your view of things so far?

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:42.208
Elizabeth: Yeah, I think I'd have
to have an amazing crystal ball,

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:44.393
or something to know exactly
what it would look like.

00:05:44.393 --> 00:05:47.948
I really didn't exactly know what
I was getting myself into at all.

00:05:47.948 --> 00:05:49.139
It's been exciting.

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.162
Voiceover: That's how I live my life.

00:05:50.162 --> 00:05:51.674
Elizabeth: Yeah (laughs).

00:05:51.674 --> 00:05:52.782
It's been really fun.

00:05:52.782 --> 00:05:55.027
I've been really happy to be here.

00:05:55.027 --> 00:05:57.129
I think some of the things
that have been surprising,

00:05:57.129 --> 00:06:01.641
have just been the scale of change,

00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.456
and the pace at which we're working.

00:06:03.456 --> 00:06:07.775
I guess, when I joined in July, we'd
worked with one school district,

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:09.748
Los Altos, and we're
still working with them.

00:06:09.748 --> 00:06:12.238
But instead of working with
4 teachers they were working,

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:15.164
with a whole bunch of teachers in
the district, about 40 of them.

00:06:15.164 --> 00:06:17.791
Then we have all these other
schools we're working with as well.

00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:18.871
Voiceover: It's like
10,000 people sounds like.

00:06:18.871 --> 00:06:19.996
Elizabeth: 10,000 people yeah.

00:06:19.996 --> 00:06:21.016
Voiceover: It's probably
12,000 now [unintelligible].

00:06:21.016 --> 00:06:21.905
Elizabeth: Yeah.

00:06:21.905 --> 00:06:22.900
It's growing so fast.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.206
And what's amazing is we're working
really closely with these schools,

00:06:26.206 --> 00:06:28.210
and that's great for those few schools,

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.130
and that's where we're really
seeing a lot of the innovation.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.847
But then, every time we discover something
exciting at a school we're working with,

00:06:33.847 --> 00:06:37.174
we can just throw it up online
and then all these other people,

00:06:37.174 --> 00:06:39.186
around the world can
see it and use it too.

00:06:39.186 --> 00:06:42.597
Or we'll say, "Oh wow. It'd be great
if we had exercises on this topic,

00:06:42.597 --> 00:06:46.215
"or features on our site that
would help schools in these ways."

00:06:46.215 --> 00:06:48.296
Then we can create them
with the rest of the team,

00:06:48.296 --> 00:06:50.587
and then suddenly there's millions
of people around the world,

00:06:50.587 --> 00:06:52.203
who are benefiting from those.

00:06:52.203 --> 00:06:56.767
It's really fast, rapid
movement from having an idea,

00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:58.102
to making the idea happen.

00:06:58.102 --> 00:06:59.814
To having it affect a lot of people.

00:06:59.814 --> 00:07:03.014
I think that's something that's exciting,
probably about software in general.

00:07:03.982 --> 00:07:06.978
But especially here, where
it's like we don't have a way,

00:07:06.978 --> 00:07:09.265
for people to graph linear equations.

00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:11.641
Let's create a way for them
to graph linear equations.

00:07:11.641 --> 00:07:12.399
Oh wow, look.

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.365
A million people just
graphed linear equations.

00:07:14.365 --> 00:07:16.050
That's exciting to see.

00:07:17.973 --> 00:07:19.189
Voiceover: What are your hopes?

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.038
Over the next couple of years or whatever.

00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:22.614
What are you hoping to see happen?

00:07:22.614 --> 00:07:25.081
Elizabeth: Well, I'm hoping that we're
going to reach a lot more people,

00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:26.178
around the world.

00:07:26.178 --> 00:07:27.299
I'm hoping for a lot of things.

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:30.393
As someone on the schools
team I'm really excited,

00:07:30.393 --> 00:07:33.722
about helping to push the
boundaries on education.

00:07:33.722 --> 00:07:35.496
I think there's a lot
of people in education,

00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.994
who've been coming up with
lots of innovative ideas,

00:07:37.994 --> 00:07:40.006
and wanting to do a lot
of things for a long time.

00:07:40.006 --> 00:07:42.505
Teachers really want to meet
the needs of all their students,

00:07:42.505 --> 00:07:44.649
but they haven't had the
tools to be able to do that.

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:47.804
Teachers might have been willing
to question a lot of assumptions,

00:07:47.804 --> 00:07:50.613
in education but haven't
really had the right tools,

00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:51.484
to make that happen.

00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:53.636
I'm excited to work with
those kinds of teachers,

00:07:53.636 --> 00:07:54.804
in those schools.

00:07:54.804 --> 00:07:57.628
To say, "Let's get rid of age
based grouping. Let's throw out,

00:07:57.658 --> 00:08:01.026
"all these basic assumptions we
have about a 9 month school year,

00:08:01.026 --> 00:08:04.372
"and about students plodding
along from 45 minutes of this,

00:08:04.372 --> 00:08:07.510
"to 45 minutes of that. Why do you
have to have math class separate,

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.415
"from science class,
separate from art class?"

00:08:09.415 --> 00:08:12.562
I'm excited to work with schools that
want to break those boundaries down,

00:08:12.562 --> 00:08:14.921
and see what we can do to
make learning more exciting,

00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:16.672
and more engaging for students.

00:08:16.672 --> 00:08:18.929
Then take whatever we learn
there and help translate that,

00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:21.281
through our platform to
the rest of the world.

00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:23.331
So that people who even
aren't in schools like that,

00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:25.860
can still have similar
exciting learning experiences.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.106
Voiceover: Very cool.
