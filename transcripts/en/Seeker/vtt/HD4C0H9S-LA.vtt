00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.500
BAN THE TRAMPOLINES! AND THE BICYCLES! AND
THE SCOOTERS! Cuz...who needs childhood anyway?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:16.350
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews. How
many ER visits would you guess resulted from

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.820
trampolines from 2002-2011? If you guessed
over ONE MILLION, then dang....you're good

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.060
at guessing. It's a number thats got at least
one group of researchers from Indiana University's

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.619
Medical School a liiiiittle concerned. Of
those 1 million injuries, almost â…“ of them

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.220
were broken bones. Now I grew up around trampolines,
everybody seemed to have one in the 90s, and

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.630
I'll admit: there were definitely a lot of
broken bones. And really, broken things in

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.320
general. Kids elbowing each other midair and
getting bloody noses, falling through the

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.270
cracks and pulling a muscle, landing on a
broken spring and tearing their flesh open.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.190
I mean, it's just par for the course when
it comes to trampolines.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.260
The study, which was published in the Journal
of Pediatric Orthopaedics, found that the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.261
trampoline injuries cost Americans 1 billion
dollars, and the scientists believe that it's

00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:03.161
something parents should seriously think twice
about. They're not the only ones either, the

00:01:03.161 --> 00:01:07.690
American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended
against trampolines for 15 years.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.250
So, the question remains...should we do away
with trampolines? One way to answer that question

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.070
would be to look at how trampoline injuries
measure up to other recreational activities,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.880
like say...skateboarding or cycling. Bicycles
alone are responsible for over 250,000 children's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.630
injuries every year. But, bicycles are also
much more common than trampolines....so while

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.270
the exact numbers don't exist, I'm gonna guess
that trampoline for trampoline and bike for

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.270
bike, trampolines are probably still more
dangerous. Another important thing to consider

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.870
is that trampoline injuries have definitely
fallen in recent years since the glorious

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.750
invention of safety nets came along -- the
injury rates fell from about 110,000 a year

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.200
to 80,000 a year. But the doctors say LOOK,
THESE INJURIES ARE PREVENTABLE. And 80,000

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.490
is still too many.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.770
I gotta admit: they have a point. But I just
had SO MUCH FUN on trampolines as a kid. Good

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.250
times, good exercise...but the responsible
adult in me acknowledges that they can be

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.610
kind of dangerous. Especially when they're
not properly maintained or when a bunch of

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.780
kids are bouncing around on them without supervision.
Just between you and me, I probably wouldn't

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.820
mind getting one for my kid, so long as it
has a safety net. OK so they break few bones...fracture

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.280
their spine....it'll be good for em! Toughen
em up a bit.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.590
Thanks for joining me for DNews folks: what
do you think? Is the trampoline our friend

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.879
or a foe? Let me know down below and we'll
see you next time.
