&gt;&gt; Now nature and nurture is a great starting point for our discussion on

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:07.960
different theories of language acquisition. How about if I discuss Skinner and

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.088
his theory on verbal behavior and you can discuss Noam Chomsky's theory. And

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:14.986
then we can leave it to the students to decide what parts of which theory they

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:18.794
think best explain language acquisition. Sound good?

00:00:18.794 --> 00:00:19.649
&gt;&gt; Sounds good to me.
