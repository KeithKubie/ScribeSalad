00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.920
Sometimes when you search for
something in Firebase,

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.540
you get a huge number of responses,
but that's not always ideal.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.200
For example, sometimes you might want
to find the first 20 results, but

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.710
ignore the rest.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.130
So for situations like this,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.470
you want to truncate your query
results by using limit queries.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.630
Firebase has two limit queries,
limitTofFirst and limitToLast.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.890
Each method will limit the number
of children returned from a query.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.540
For example, if you set a limit of
three, when you use limitToFirst,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.880
the first three children will
be returned from the query.

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:38.460
LimitToLast functions similarly
with the only difference being

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.090
that it will return
the last three children.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.265
Both methods can be used with
orderByChild or orderByValue.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:48.035
OrderByChild to choose
which attribute to query.

00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:50.770
OrderByValue to return
a limited set of results for

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:51.867
something like a leader board.
