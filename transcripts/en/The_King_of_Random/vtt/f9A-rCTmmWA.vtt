*sound releasing*

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.170
I love that every time. I love that. Hey what's up my friends it is summertime so for this video

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.649
I thought it might be fun to try experimenting with water balloons. Now for this project

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.809
I stopped by Walmart and picked up a pack of bunch of balloons

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.829
You're about seven and a half dollars they claimed to be able to fill up a hundred water balloons in 60 seconds

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.990
I don't think that technically true unless you have like three different hoses and three different bundles going at the same time however,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.420
It's still very quick and very convenient so here's the idea guys when we put water in a vacuum chamber in a previous experiment

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.960
We saw the water start to boil

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.349
This is a common fact we've also seen videos where people put balloons and vacuum chambers and we watch them expand

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.129
So we know what water does in the vacuum chamber we also know what balloons do in a vacuum chamber

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.370
But what do water balloons do in a vacuum chamber? That's the question we're here to answer now to make this experiment work today

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.680
I'm bringing back the vacuum Chamber. We made in a previous video

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.759
This is designed to suck all the air out of the container and to get our water balloons ready

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.710
We'll need to pop outside for a second so we can fill them up with the garden hose. Let's go

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.649
Ok i'm outside, you can see I've got the garden hose hooked up to the blue bunch of balloons here

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.899
We're just going to turn the water on let these things fill up

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.158
I guess about half way full and then drop them into a container of water just to protect them then I'm going to do the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.159
Red and the yellow for variety then we're going to go back inside

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
*Water balloon dropping in water*

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.549
All right back inside guys. We got our bunch of balloons filled up a lot of variety here

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.859
We got our yellow blue and our red

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.610
So I'm just going to take a few of these transfer them over into our cookie jar vacuum chamber

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.249
And then replace the lid and we'll fire this thing up and see what happens

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:40.880
[Music]

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.020
Let's start with that and call it good

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.130
Quick update guys, we're back

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.630
I got all the balloons filled up

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.530
And we've transferred enough of them in here to fill this jar halfway full so at this point

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.890
All we have to do is take our lid

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.459
Replace it on the top and basically turn on the vacuum chamber and see what happens. how are water balloon is going to react in

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.420
The vacuum chamber, let me know your guess in the comments below, and let's see if you're right. here we go. let's See what happens

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:10.580
[Music]

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.080
Okay, we're just going to close this valve here and turn off the vacuum pump for a second and talk about what we just saw

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.799
Now what's really interesting about this is we definitely see air bubbles collecting on the side of the water balloons

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.149
But they're not rapidly boiling like you would expect to see in a glass or a bottle of water

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.029
They're just kind of hanging out and all the water down here that's boiling,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.559
I'm not sure if it's the water itself that's boiling, or if it's just gas escaping from these balloons

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.280
themselves. These little O-rings on the next to the bottle are great for holding in the water

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.169
But I'm not sure they're strong enough to actually prevent the air from coming out so let's go ahead and try opening up this vacuum

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.459
Chamber very quickly to see if there's any kind of a dramatic difference, and then I've got one more modification

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.459
I want to try making with them

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.459
*Air releasing*

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.619
Yeah, so did see the balloon shrink down a little bit so that definitely means that there was air

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.139
That was being expanded, but I'm thinking you know these shrink down more than normal size

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.449
These were some of the balloons that we started off with these are the balloons that we ended up with I don't really notice

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.499
Too much of a difference. It's kind of hard to tell. For round two,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.699
I think what I'm going to do is actually physically tie off the next of these balloons. So that no air can escape

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.789
We'll see if that makes any difference because mostly balloons right now

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.709
don't really have any air in them so it will be interesting to see what happened under vacuum

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:28.320
[music]

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.320
It's a little Runt

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.040
[music]

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.510
All right, so we got one layer of balloons here. That's all I really had left

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.120
I tied these manually so there's no air that can escape

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.820
So when we throw the lid on and secure the valve this time is it going to make any difference?

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.840
Here we go

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.800
[Music]

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.840
All right, it's sucking

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.460
[Music]

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.440
Looking at the water balloons themselves. You can see air bubbles forming on the inside

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.340
Now a lot of these didn't have much air in them to begin with, but you can see

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.169
Any air that was there is starting to expand and because they're manually tied off

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.909
I'm interested to see whether the water will start boiling inside the water balloon itself

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.029
There's no place for the pressure to leach out like it was in the first batch.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.720
So I really really want to see water boiling inside of a water balloon. That's my goal. That's what I'm going for

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.280
[Music]

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.740
Now if I tip this forward you can see if there is a bit of water in there

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.880
And I do see from time to time little bubbles in the water like it is starting to boil

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.389
What I love is around the next to some of these balloons the air that was trapped in there bubbling up

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.240
making a little deformity

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.940
So I'll pop that with a pin

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.769
If anything you can see the tops of these water balloons where the air is is expanding even further

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.079
You give them a nice like easter egg looking shape all those dots around the edges makes it look pretty

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.940
But other than that, there is really nothing happening. Just going to let that sit for about five minutes then

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:04.780
[Music]

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.880
Guys we have had this running for 10 minutes solid, no joke, and I really haven't seen much difference

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.990
We shake them around the bubbles just kind of dissipate, but that's really about it

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.260
Alright, let's open this batch up and see if there's any difference

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.680
I love that, every time I love that. so the balloon shrinks down. I'm a little bit disappointed I didn't

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.740
see these boiling I mean

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.400
I was really really hoping to see the water start boiling in the balloon expanding to the point where they all

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.360
exploded, but that didn't happen

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.590
They just kind of hung out. Even with them tied off at the necks

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.940
But now you know if you were ever up late at night wondering What water balloons did in space?

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.089
I think the question is successfully been answered they don't really do much.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.560
Thanks for joining me for this experiment. It is always an adventure,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.140
and I'll be looking forward to the next video. Talk to you then

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.200
There we go nailed it

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.440
These are like the kind of juggling balls. You don't want to drop indoors

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.440
