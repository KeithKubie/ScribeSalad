00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.220
Also something to keep in mind. Pretty
basic, but: L.O.U.I.S.C.K.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.820
Listen, only under intimate situations, caress knob.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.440
[laughter]

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.320
Great.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.040
It’s been a year since the #MeToo movement made headlines,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.180
and since then, we’ve realized  there are creeps everywhere.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.220
In Hollywood, on the news, in orange crocs...which we could’ve seen coming...

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.040
and now on the Supreme Court – for a second time!

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.180
It’s caused many to redouble their efforts against sexual assault,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.540
and others to miss the point completely.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.280
It’s a very scary time for young men in America.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.280
REPORTER: Who are you scared most for, your sons or your daughters?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.340
Right now, I’d say my sons.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.160
Beyond the trolls though, some men are taking it upon themselves

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.940
to right the wrongs exposed by the #MeToo movement.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.040
Meet Matthew Solomon.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.720
I am an empowerment coach, I specialize in relationships and communication.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.060
And I wrote the book “Man School: Relating With Women In The MeToo Era.”

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.360
Do men need a class on not sending an unsolicited dick pic?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.880
A whole class on that, maybe not, but as part of a class, evidently, because it happens all the time.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.360
“Man School” covers topics like rape culture in movies, toxic masculinity,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.820
and issues that have stumped dudes for millennia such as “Women are not men.”

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.920
What compelled to write "Man School"?

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.000
Women started posting their stories with the hashtag MeToo.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.940
And even knowing the magnitude of it, seeing it there was so humbling and it was so overwhelming.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.860
But there were all these men who had no idea.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.600
And they didn't know how to react and how to respond,

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.160
because they would speak up and do the stuff that people do.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.800
Things like harassment, gaslighting, whataboutism, and telling women their experiences don’t matter.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.800
Yeah, we’ve been on the internet.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.900
Do you find it ironic that you're a guy that has to explain all these things

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.120
that women have been saying for years?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.980
No.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.160
Why not?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.140
Because I know that men haven't generally been listening to women for years.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.000
So you're like mansplaining sexism which is...

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.120
To men.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.160
It's like good mansplaining.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.700
If you're mansplaining to men, maybe it's good.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.200
If a man’s mansplaining ... I don't know, I got lost in the  space continuum of sexism.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.300
Everything you’re saying sounds great, but, like,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.060
how do I know you're not like that guy who wears a feminist t-shirt

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.260
but then is secretly kind of a creep.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.720
Yeah. I'm not.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.500
You sure?

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.460
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.500
Ok Matthew. Let’s put your methods to the test with a real Man School.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.440
We gathered seven dudes in a room on a Friday to give them a lesson

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.460
in how to be one of the good guys in the MeToo era and also to hear from them.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.040
Welcome to Man School: Unlearning 2000 Years of Patriarchy. Thank you for being here.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.360
I would love to know from each of you what you hope to get out of today.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.160
I realized how sexist I’ve been, and even not realizing that was a problem.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.340
You know, it’s been a continual process for me to learn

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.000
how to interact with women especially compared to, I don't know,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.100
my freshman year of college where you get tons of bad advice.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.080
I’ve been getting close in relationships but once I hit a certain point, I kinda screw it up.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.140
I want to know from you guys, what are your fears?

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.020
Men are becoming uncomfortable in their own skin because of what we’re seeing.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.100
Is there a concern about where the line is?

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.120
What you can or can’t do?

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.300
You know, there are people who legitimately...

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.160
when they interact sexually, like play violence or something like that.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.960
I think that’s maybe one thing that some guys are worried about.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.880
There is that fear that, you know, hey

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.060
so you get with someone in Palm Springs during a film festival

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.300
and you have mad rocking sex
because you drank a bunch of Tito's and soda...

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.760
Why does this example feel not hypothetical.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.000
That’s ok, they’re sharing.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.600
Why isn’t there like a consent app?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.880
People can sign in and you say yes or no.  I think that would be -

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.180
I bet there is a consent app. I bet that exists.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.440
But my understanding is that consent has to be a continual thing.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.300
So even if you hit “Yes, I’m down right now,”

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.360
you have the right to change your mind,

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.620
unless the app is constantly sending you notifications to re-up the consent.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.020
Oh my god. They are pitching an app.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.700
Triggered.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.460
So let me ask you this. What are some of things that you as men do to ensure your safety on a daily basis?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.800
I try to have different passwords for all my different websites.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.840
[laughter]

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.260
So in regards to personal safety, women have shared 34 things that they do on a daily basis.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.060
Want me to read these?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.000
Yeah.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.660
34 things...

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.860
For their personal safety.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.080
“Walk with our keys grasped between our fingers in case we need to use them as a weapon.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.480
Never leave a drink unattended at a party.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.760
Cross the street when we see men who look like they might be drunk.” Definitely do that.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.020
“Make sure we’re not the only woman on the subway or bus.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.660
Parking next to a lightpost when it’s dark outside.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.340
Decide not to open Facebook messages from unknown men

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.280
who could see the messages have been read and become hostile and harassing.”

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.860
Yes you do become hostile.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.080
It would never occur to me to do 90% of the stuff on that list,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.540
but it’s shocking to see you go “yup, yup yup” to everyone you recognized.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.180
There’s one I kind of have questions about details on, for example,

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.420
if you do happen to be walking behind a woman at night,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.640
is it better to speed up and pass her, slow down, build distance?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.880
I mean, what about bells?

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.440
[laughter]

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.000
Could also work. We have whistles, you have bells.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.080
It’s just a very merry sidewalk. What else can we do to make women feel safe?

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.340
Use our male privilege to call out problematic males.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.760
Go out and affirmatively express your support

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.280
when there’s an issue that’s being discussed that’s of importance to women.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.120
Some orange-haired knucklehead a couple weeks ago said

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.340
it’s a rough time for young men in this country.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.120
We need to be held accountable, we need to educate ourselves, we need to educate our young sons.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.900
Her experience is her experience, the thing that she’s telling you, that’s what happened.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.460
So in other words, a helpful acronym -

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.240
B.R.A.H. Believe rape accounts, homie.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.440
[laughter]

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:35.420
H.O.M.I.E: we believe those rape accounts with heart, open-mindedness, intelligence and empathy.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.720
So we’re gonna put that into practice.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.320
Yeah let’s put that into practice.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.340
We need a volunteer.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.740
Francesca is confiding in you something that happened,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.920
possibly a MeToo moment or a story with someone who’s been misbehaving so you get as a man,

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.380
get her experience and support her in that moment.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:02.480
I know this is hard to hear, but your brother just grabbed my butt completely,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.360
like two hands. Full palms.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.140
I’m so sorry to hear that. I mean, I’m surprised to hear that but I'm really, really sorry to hear that.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.420
Because that’s not ok, that’s not cool. Is there anything I can do?

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.300
Just tell him not to touch your friends. Or tell him not to touch anyone.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.740
Obviously. Yeah.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.780
Awesome, how was that?

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.000
I’m thinking about my own brothers. I can’t imagine that happening with my own brothers

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.740
so it was hard for me to put myself in a place where I would relate to that,

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:37.360
but I suppose in life you have to get over that because there are people in your life that are gonna surprise you.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.760
For this next scenario,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.380
Francesca’s gonna be playing the man who’s saying inappropriate things about women,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.360
so Juan here gets to speak up and be an ally.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.180
Brett is a really good guy like I don’t know what all these women are talking about.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.160
I never saw Brett act that way. I’ve known him for years.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.160
But you’re a dude, you’re not gonna see it with him.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.880
But I was with him through all of high school, prep school, college.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:09.000
Obviously she’s doing it for the money and for the fame.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.060
Name one of Cosby’s accusers. One that got famous.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.220
Um, there’s a tennis player.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.280
Time out. Awesome.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.600
So in this scenario we’re getting into the debate. Right?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.680
What if instead of arguing the facts, you came from, “what do you suppose it was like for her?”

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.860
Interesting, so I’m supposed to get him to empathize with the victim.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.800
Try that.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.920
OK, Cool.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.980
How about you have evidence of the rape before you go around accusing a bunch of men...

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.700
Am I really friends with this dude?

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.560
[laughter]

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.660
Dude what are you talking about? You’ve known me forever! It’s Chad.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:54.220
Three hours later and these males are finally ready to be released back into the wild.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.200
You guys made it, you’ve done Man School! Give yourselves a round of applause.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.200
And while there are no cookies for doing the right thing in real life,

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.240
there are in Man School. And prizes.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.400
I learned about B.R.A.H. Believe rape accounts, homie ...

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.820
I need to be more sympathetic in conversation and ask more questions,

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.020
I think are the big two things to take away.

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.000
You don't really get too many opportunities to see people open up

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.340
and actually express what their innermost thoughts and feelings are.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.000
Especially men. So that was really refreshing for me.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.500
What should women understand about men in the Metoo era?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.500
That men are extremely sensitive.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:39.020
You know we have feelings and emotions that we're not really taught that we're allowed to have those,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.960
and then we sure as heck can't express those.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.800
Do you think there should be a Man School?

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.740
Absolutely. I think there should be a Man School, a teen school.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:52.260
Relationships and communication should be taught as part of curriculum.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.340
So will men ever be able to unlearn patriarchy?

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.340
Maybe not after one class, but hey, the first step is showing up.
