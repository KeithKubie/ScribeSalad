1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,550
The Joe Rogan experience, this and that.
Like keep you the best years of my life.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,210
Oh, that's my favorite. I did. I did to
grow once more. We broke up. She said,

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,860
I wasted all this time with you said,
oh, I go, I thought we were dating.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,140
Yeah. I didn't know you were
investing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wasted it.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,130
Oh, you wasted it. Well,

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,740
I guess every relationship when
it's over as a waste, like what?

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,720
That's so bizarre. Yeah. Bizarre way of
looking at it. Yeah. Enjoy the present.

8
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:33,180
Enjoy the time you had together.
Yeah.

9
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:37,890
But if you thinking about in terms of like
hitching around on a successful train.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,311
Yeah.

11
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:41,500
If your goal is to get married and you're
with someone for five years and then

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,550
you break up like, oh, you know,

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,760
I should be with someone
else who would have married,

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,660
now I've got to find someone else.
Yeah.

15
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,970
The jealousy thing about the, the
breakup is so, it's so normal.

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,330
It's so hard for people to
not be jealous. Like, no.

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,890
Very few people ever break up and go, hey
man, she's cool. Just didn't work out.

18
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:06,450
I was Dick. She was, she
needed some growing. We needed,
we both needed time away.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,850
Hey, I wish her well. I've
never really gotten jealous.

20
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,130
Like I always like when they move on,
you know what I mean?

21
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:13,560
When like when they get a new boyfriend,
you're just like, oh thank God.

22
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,560
Oh that's cause you're a comic.
You have opportunities. Yeah.

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,040
But it's like if it's like you're
not their responsibility anymore,

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,470
you know what I mean? They can
still like, if they're single,

25
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:25,840
they can still call you up, you know,
in the middle of the night. Yeah.

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,130
I still get mad about things like still
want, let's talk about this again.

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,190
Once dating someone else,
you're like, all right.

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,850
You said you're someone else's problem.

29
00:01:32,851 --> 00:01:35,520
Now the best is when they have a kid
with someone else. You're like, yes,

30
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,320
that solver baby. Yeah. It never
talked to you again. I'm free. Yeah.

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,440
It's interesting. Then it's, it's a,

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,620
it's an interesting thing when you decide
to touch naked bodies with the person,

33
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,380
right?

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,180
You like create this bond by doing
things with your bodies and spending time

35
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:58,050
together and then you separate.
But you're always gonna have this yet.

36
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,030
But I used to touch naked bodies with her.
Yeah.

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,480
We used to get together and
we used to do things together.

38
00:02:03,481 --> 00:02:06,390
We don't do it anymore, but I
did it. I did it back in the day.

39
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,960
I got her naked and we got naked together.
Yeah. History. Yeah, it's history.

40
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:13,500
It's weird. You know, she'll
never forget. I won't either.

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,430
We touched each other. Yeah. I like
the idea of like relationships.

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,570
Looking back fondly on relationships.
I never felt like I wasted my time.

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,570
There are people that I've dated that I'm
like probably shouldn't have done that.

44
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:28,710
But uh, but for the most part I try
to, uh, have good feelings about it.

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,520
You don't want to,

46
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
you want to hate like a period
of your life now it's pointless.

47
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,310
But there's lessons learned. Those
ones that I've had that were like, Ugh,

48
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,420
that's how, you know what, when you
date someone and it's cool when they're,

49
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:45,180
they're good. You get it.
Like I dated this girl long,

50
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:48,360
long time ago who's super negative,
just super negative all the time.

51
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,110
And then I dated this other girl right
afterwards who was non negative at all.

52
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:55,020
She was always laughing about stuff
and joking around. No matter what.

53
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,080
Like even if like a car getting an accent,
she'd take a deep breath and go,

54
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,910
well that car's fucked up. And she
would start laughing and I was like,

55
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,340
oh this,
there's different ways to handle things.

56
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:09,490
Like if you get stuck with your
high school sweetheart and and,

57
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,590
and she's a pain in the ass forever.

58
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,880
Like you never understand like there
are the exact same circumstances.

59
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,690
One person's going to handle it completely
differently and if you're with that

60
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:23,860
person, it's going to be a
totally different experience
where it'll be a bonding

61
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:28,300
experience versus dem woe is me being
for the next six months and bringing it

62
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:28,931
back to,

63
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:31,630
I can't even look at a tourist because
it reminds me of when I got in that

64
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,430
accident,
touristic parts

65
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,790
woo

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,980
like fuck, that was a year ago. I like
when people are together for a long time.

67
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:43,730
They break up and then the guy gets
married to the next woman he runs into

68
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:44,930
instantly,
instantly.

69
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,990
It's like he just like found the opposite
of what he'd been dealing with and was

70
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:50,900
just like so over the moon about it.
They had to marry her right away.

71
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,680
That happened to a buddy of mine.
He did an actress and then it was just,

72
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,530
you know, it was just brutal.
Everything was career.

73
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:02,340
This career that was about her career
was trying to help her career and then

74
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,650
they broke up and he's like,
I'm never getting married again.

75
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,130
A month later he's with this new check
and he's living with her two months later

76
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:10,680
and then he's married six months later.
I'm like, what happened? He goes,

77
00:04:10,681 --> 00:04:14,490
I realized it wasn't that I didn't
want to be married. He goes,

78
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:16,320
I just didn't want to be married to her.

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,610
Is I realized like there's some people
out there that I get along great with.

80
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,350
Yeah, and if you don't, if you
don't bail on a bad relationship,

81
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:28,770
you don't know that there's you can
be and you are going to be different.

82
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,820
That's the other thing. Like your d
I'm different with different people.

83
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,350
You're different with something like
you react better to certain people and

84
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:40,050
certain people's personalities,
you jive better with them,

85
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,770
you have more fun with them.
It's more entertaining. It's,

86
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,740
and you get to like reintroduce yourself.

87
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:48,100
You know the other person knows you for
this like five year period of time when

88
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:50,640
you maybe you weren't at
your best. Yeah. You know,

89
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,320
and like when you've already used all
your tricks. Yeah. You know what I mean?

90
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:55,480
Like if you give a girl diamond earrings,

91
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,460
you can never give her diamond earrings
again for as long as you lived.

92
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,660
You know what I mean? It's like that
the president is over right for now.

93
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,910
And then when you get to spend
with someone new, you can,

94
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,300
you know it's a clean slate, right?
You can impress them. Yeah. They, yeah.

95
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,940
They haven't heard you're fucking dumb
stories already that you can like you can

96
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:10,810
like,
I'll listen to this.

97
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,430
Why I always tell guys strive to be the
person you pretend to be when you're

98
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:20,260
trying to get laid. If you can be that
person, that real person all the time,

99
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,210
but this is very difficult to do, but if
you can be that person most of the time,

100
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:29,320
if not all the time, you'll have a better
life. Yes, I would agree with that. Yeah.

101
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,370
But it's fun to try to impress people.
It's fun when you meet someone like, boy,

102
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:38,110
wait til they see how witty I am.
Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. Like with me,

103
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:38,944
I'm like,

104
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,570
I don't like when someone just ended me
just because they know who I am at the

105
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,220
like you're a famous comedian.
I'm like a little annoyed,

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,380
but if they have no idea who I am,
I'm also a little annoyed like this.

107
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,170
There should be perks to this. Yeah.
That I'm missing out on him. Yeah.

108
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,470
Did you not Google me?
Yeah. Yeah. He's not a fan.

109
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,570
What are you from another country?
What's going on?

110
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,200
Could you imagine dating someone who
didn't like comedy? Anthony, I love you.

111
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,730
You're amazing. But I don't
like stand up. I mean,

112
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:10,820
if it was someone who just like didn't
like stand up and thought I was great,

113
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,840
I could handle it.
They didn't like stand up in general,

114
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,430
but they like your material in particular.
