00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for preparing this
opportunity to discuss about

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.700
a little bit to you words about the World
Economic Forum this year.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:20.250
And to my understanding, this year this forum
was more brave than

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.350
previous years.
And they could raise a part, some parts of

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:34.360
their global problems.
If you look to three keywords of this year's

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.900
pamphlets of World
Economic Forum, you will find these three

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.420
words: Rethinking,
redesigning, and rebuilding trust.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.760
These three words shows the world is facing
with entrusting, facing

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.820
with the bad thinking and wrong thinking,
and the design which is there

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:11.970
for that managing of the world is not acceptable.
This is part of the problem.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:21.040
But the second step is what is the main root
causes of these problems?

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.780
We should find out.
The root causes of this problem.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.780
To my understanding, first the mechanism -- rules
and regulations which

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:40.850
is created not only for the economy affairs
but also for the political

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:49.420
and social affairs goes back to more than
six decades ago, of the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.130
second World War.
We should rethink about these mechanisms which

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:06.200
is called [INAUDIBLE].
The second point is who are going to rethink,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.960
redesign, and rebuild?
Who are they?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.930
Are they the same thing which have created
these problems?

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.459
Are they, again, the winner of the second
World War?

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.230
It can't be.
If they rethink, they will think in the same

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.489
direction.
If they redesign, they will design in the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:45.170
same direction.
And definitely rebuilding the same building.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.480
That's why we need some new.
We are facing the different problems in the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.950
world today.
The drug problem which the young generation

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.750
are facing, $60 billion is
the black money which is coming from the opium

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.330
only.
If we move to heroin and the others, it will

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.120
be hundreds of billions of
dollars.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.569
A part of this black money goes for terrorism
but the main part goes to

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:36.050
the banking system to different markets.
What the money laundering money thing systems

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.989
are doing for this
hundred, hundreds of billions of dollars in

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:48.140
the world economy, I think
these are good topics for thinking.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.200
Thank you for your patience to hear me.
