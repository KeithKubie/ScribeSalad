00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.170
The last view I'd like to talk about is not really a view but a miscellaneous

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.890
category indicating that there's a lot of other information having to do

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.890
with system structure that hasn't been conveyed by the other views we've seen.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.870
Okay? This has to do with supporting software in files which are, are,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.410
are part of the system but maybe aren't part directly of the executing software.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.040
Okay?

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.180
And I'm suggesting that this information be conpeyed, conveyed in,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:37.550
in tabular text it includes things like installation scripts, log file analysis,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.740
statistical processing, the make files that are there the configuration files

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.840
for different configurations for the system, any documentation.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.660
Okay, the project manifests which describe system structure as part of a,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.410
a large delivery package.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.380
And any supporting tools.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.390
Okay, when you're building the system all of these pieces have to

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.690
actually be there to contribute to the build and

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.750
hence they're part of this kind of grander architecture of a system.
