00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.360
- So, John, how has the role
of the presidency changed

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.060
over the last several hundreds of years?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.140
- It's changed dramatically.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.760
First of all, when the founders created

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.540
the presidency, they left it kinda loose.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.140
They weren't exactly very specific

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.520
about what a president would do.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.400
And they realized that
the first president,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.570
George Washington, and this
is why he was so important,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.640
was a man of virtue and
that he in his behavior

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.710
would set the precedence for
the next president after him.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.590
That means the job is basically
handed off by tradition

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.087
from president to
president but that also--

00:00:29.087 --> 00:00:30.680
- And the reason why they
didn't know what a president

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.830
should do is that there
wasn't a notion of a,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.720
there wasn't a precedent
for being a president.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.000
- That's right, they knew
what they didn't want.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.050
They didn't want two things,
they didn't want a king,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.450
they'd just gotten rid of one of those.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.080
They didn't want a king
and they also didn't

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.333
want somebody who's
whipped around by mob rule.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.220
Those were the two things they were

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.300
trying to get between.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.150
But, a president has a lot of room

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.290
to move in between the two of them,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.123
and they thought we'll put it

00:00:51.123 --> 00:00:53.150
in the hands of a virtuous American.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.640
George Washington, a good
first virtuous American,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.440
and that person, through
their virtue and character,

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.850
would stay in the right place.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.940
Would not become a king and
would not give over to the mob,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.480
but it also meant that it relied

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.330
on the character of the
person in the presidency.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.981
And so, each president
in subsequent years,

00:01:08.981 --> 00:01:12.080
has taken shape in the presidency both

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.740
by what was determined
by their predecessors,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340
but also by what they could do in the job.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.410
And what's happened is,
a job that started out

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.780
very weak in the American system has now

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.420
become one where some people think of all

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.100
the entire of American
government as the president.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.330
And that's not what the founders wanted.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.320
- But how does that evolve?

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.140
'Cause obviously the constitution talks

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.680
about the powers of the president.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.030
So, how does it change so much over time?

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.510
- What happened was, when they originally

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.200
created the presidency there was a debate,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.130
and the debate was, we need
somebody who can move quickly.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.010
We can't always be calling
them in to Congress

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.000
because, of course, when the America

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.790
was started they used
to take several months,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.140
or sometimes it would take weeks

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.010
to get on a horse and get to Washington.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.500
So, we need an executive
who can move quickly.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.610
Well, what happened was, in various wars,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.070
America needed to move quickly,

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.660
and they needed one person to act

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.490
on behalf of the entire Union.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.830
Well, there's only one
person who can do that.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.300
But, as people wanted
quick action they handed

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.800
over more power to the president.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.520
Congress, which used to fight
with the president a lot,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.730
during the Second World War

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.520
and then on into our present day,

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.570
has given up a lot of its
power to the president.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.150
One of the key ones being
the power to make war.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.680
Presidents can now go and make war.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.710
Well, that's not the
original way it was arranged.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.090
And they've done it
because there is a hunger

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.990
in the country for quick action,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.910
but the problem and challenge of that is,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.130
if you invest somebody in with power

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.590
to do things quickly in an emergency,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.300
they hold on to that power
and they don't let it go,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.620
and that means that they start

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.960
doing things when it's not an emergency,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.540
that is then not vetted
by the American system.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.760
And that system has both the judiciary

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.630
and the legislative which are meant

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.650
to hold back a president who's trying

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.480
to act too quickly and do too much.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.080
- Let's go on this notion
of making war as an example.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.610
There's clear powers that Congress has

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.990
to approve a war, has
the power of the purse,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.410
So, how did this happen?

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.490
They just do that as a ritual now?

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.030
- Well, basically there are times

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.870
and Congress tries and makes attempts

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.740
to try to pull power
back from the president.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.240
The only times they've been successful

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.750
after the Second World War
is really after Watergate.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.230
The view was that the president
had gotten too powerful.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.030
That President Nixon, who left the office,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.060
had abused the office
and so Congress tried

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.510
to pull some power back, but again,

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.530
political parties which are now
very close to the president.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.940
It used to be that political
parties were not so powerful.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.410
If I'm a Republican in Congress

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.160
and I want my Republican
president to do well,

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.870
I'm gonna give him the power he wants

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.210
because we're connected.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.560
In the old days, if the
president in the office

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.650
was my party, well that's nice,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.960
but I've got my own views
and I'm in Congress,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.450
and I'm gonna do what I want.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.120
And so, essentially a lot of these powers

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.690
that have gone to the president

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.660
have been handed over to
him, not with a ceremony,

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.860
but just by a lack of a
fight by members of Congress,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.020
in withdrawing from their traditional role

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.570
as the founders wanted it as the key actor

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:02.860
in American government.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.030
That's no longer case, in America today,

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.710
the president is the key actor.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.270
- And then every time that happens

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.870
the next president or the
next several presidents,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.550
we allowed that to happen to that person.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.383
I should have that power as well.

00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:15.620
- That's exactly right.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.630
It's almost like the powers conveyed

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.930
to the new president like the
furniture in the Oval Office.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.813
And so, they think, well this
chair's pretty comfortable.

00:04:21.813 --> 00:04:22.646
(Sal laughs)

00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:24.070
I'm not gonna get rid of that and sit

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.010
in the old uncomfortable wooden chair.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.210
I want all the plush trappings.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.450
And here's another reason.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.410
American politics has created a situation,

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.110
and television has made
this so much worse,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.860
where people run for office promising

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.290
the sun, the moon, and the stars.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.950
So, they say I can, Donald Trump,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.490
when he was running
said I alone can fix it.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.040
That is not the way the
country was originally founded.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.610
That one person could fix or unfix things.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.360
It was supposed to be a country

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.270
with representatives
of the entire country.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.040
But, politics has created a system

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.610
where, whether it's a
Republican or Democrat,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.220
they run by saying I can do anything.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.610
Well, that means when
you get in the office

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.500
you want those quick powers that allow

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.480
you to keep those campaign promises,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.020
and those quick powers are only quick

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.470
if Congress and the
courts aren't in the way.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.210
So, politics and the way you run

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.020
for office makes presidents want

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.523
to have every possible
power at their disposal.
