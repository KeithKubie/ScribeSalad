00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.560
RACHEL: But let me introduce
Joe while he's setting up.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.350
I actually know Joe Kutchera.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.310
We are alumni from Fordham
Business School.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.700
So it's really exciting to
bring him in here today.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.550
It just happened that he's an
accomplished author, and also

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.180
has been working on bringing
assistance to the One Laptop

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.660
per Child, through the proceeds
of his new book,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.910
which he'll talk about.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.840
Joe Kutchera, who's based in LA,
is here today to basically

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.850
talk about how the Hispanic
culture can thrive in the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.280
digital marketing era.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.100
And he'll talk about what we can
do as Googlers, as well as

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.810
people who are interested
in that market.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.120
And what are the five
steps to success.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.390
Joe advises companies on how
to best develop culturally

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.980
customized content
for social media,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.830
newsletters, and websites.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.680
He has two books, including the
first book, which is out

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.930
today on Amazon, called "Latino
Link: Building Brands

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.010
Online with Hispanic
Communities." Joe's also a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.360
contributing author to blogs,
newsletters, and places like

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.840
the Fox News Latino station.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.010
All of that is where
you can find him.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.970
He's also a member of the IAB
board in Mexico, and is a

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.035
member of the Hispanic
Committee that is

00:01:28.035 --> 00:01:29.020
the IAB in the US.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.850
So please welcome Joe
as he's setting up.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.700
How are we doing?

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.340
Good?

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.930
JOE KUTCHERA: Perfect.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.180
RACHEL: Thanks.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.070
JOE KUTCHERA: Rachel,
thanks so much.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.090
Most Americans know three
phrases in Spanish.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.735
Any guesses what those are?

00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:52.661
AUDIENCE: Hola.

00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:55.580
AUDIENCE: Hast la vista.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.232
JOE KUTCHERA: Well, una
cerveza por favor.

00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:00.500
AUDIENCE: Corona.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.300
JOE KUTCHERA: Corona.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.640
After a few cervezas?

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.890
AUDIENCE: Tequila.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.669
JOE KUTCHERA: Un
taco por favor.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:17.100
And then after a few tacos and
cervezas, donde esta el bano.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.270
My presentation today, as Rachel
indicated, is about my

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.760
new book, which is actually
coming out in Spanish.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.640
But what I want to talk to you
today is about introducing a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.110
new word in Spanish to marketers
worldwide, and

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.620
that's the word for
success, exito.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.600
And it's actually a five step,
or five letter, acronym for

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.320
how to you develop successful
digital marketing campaigns.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.190
I have to admit, before I walk
you through the process, that

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.420
actually my first experience
with Spanish language acronyms

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.730
was, unfortunately
total disaster.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.530
I was actually working at Time
Warner, working at CNN Money,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.160
and then moved to Mexico City
to work at Grupo Expansion,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.150
one of the leading media
companies in Mexico.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.380
They have been the largest
business magazine,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.790
"Expansion." And together
with the team there,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.610
we started CNN Expansion.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.890
And in that first meeting on
that first day, they started

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.950
using the word SEP.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.030
And I thought to myself,
what is a SEP?

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.560
I had studied Spanish
for years.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.970
But totally lost the meaning
of the meeting.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.670
But SEP is a seccion especial
de publicidad, or special

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.190
advertising section.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.880
So unlike that experience, I'm
here to actually explain what

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.060
my five letter acronym means.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.220
We know the four P's--

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.630
place, price, product,
and promotion.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.670
And it's been used for decades
for marketing planning about

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.420
where we are going to
sell our product?

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.560
And what's the price?

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.990
How are we going
to promote it?

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.220
And the retail channel.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.360
But today there are a
lot of new factors

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.490
that we all know about.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:03.420
Technology, chief marketing
officers actually spend more

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.600
than chief technology officers
on technology and big data.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.210
There's a need for innovation,
coming up with new ideas.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.300
There's a need for community
and content.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.149
And there's a need to really
listen to our community, and

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.099
use that research.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.010
And really the benefits of a
model break down a complicated

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.720
process into simpler steps.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.290
And it makes things easier
to remember,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.540
and share, and replicate.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.630
Let me walk you through the five
step process for exito,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.270
the word for success
in Spanish.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.700
E is escuche a su audiencia--

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.670
listen to your audience.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.280
What are they saying about your
company, your brand, your

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.930
competitors?

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.210
X is experimente
como usuario--

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.090
put yourself in the
shoes of the user,

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.750
develop user profiles.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.440
We all know the importance
of that.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.520
The third step is I, integrate
your communication channels.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.140
How does social media and
customer service, are they

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.090
saying the same thing?

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.410
T is transform your audience
into a community using

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.010
storytelling.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:15.700
And O is optimize.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.810
These are all things we know,
but put into a format that are

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.590
easy to remember, especially
relevant for the Latin

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.310
American markets which, as
Rodrigo talked about, are

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.740
expanding so quickly.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.010
Let me share a few stories
from my book.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.360
And we'll walk you through
each one, one

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.550
story for each step.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.850
So E, escuche a su audiencia,
listen to your audience.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.100
We all know the importance of
user generated content, "Time"

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.790
named all of you the person
of the year in 2006.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:55.450
And because of things like
Google+ and YouTube, that's

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.730
fostered things like Occupy
Wall Street, and the

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.710
revolution in the Middle East.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.910
And here we see some graffiti
actually in Tunisia thanking

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.590
Mark Zuckerberg for providing
them with a platform for

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.840
organizing their revolution.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.860
While that has a huge
implication, obviously on

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.890
leadership of both governments
and businesses, I'm not here

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:20.580
today to talk about
Facebook or Egypt.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.690
But rather, how can visual
social networks change

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.620
marketers out there?

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.540
I'd like to share with you the
story of a case study from my

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.850
forthcoming book.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.050
It's the story of 3M--

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.610
actually 3M in Mexico.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.830
3M makes the post it
note, the square

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.500
colored pieces of paper.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.510
And when they did a listening
study about what people were

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.280
saying about their products,
they discover that people

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.570
weren't talking about the
practical elements of their

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.560
product, but rather how to draw
Marilyn Monroe's face in

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.860
the office, or draw Steve Jobs's
face on a window, or

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.470
even play pranks on a friend,
and cover their car with post

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:11.030
it notes, or maybe even put
Pac-Man in the window.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.830
So the folks at 3M Mexico, after
doing that listening

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.670
study, said why don't we just
create a marketing campaign

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.470
around what customers
are already doing?

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.010
So they actually created this
virtual wall where you and I

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.250
can create a profile, and
actually draw different

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.880
designs using different
colors.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.390
Here we see someone writing
out the word

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.990
for moda, or fashion.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.330
And then actually print
out a shopping list.

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:40.580
Put in your zip code.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.470
And then find out where you
can buy that, what's the

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.720
nearest retailer.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.770
In conclusion, really, the
benefits to listening that 3M

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.470
showed here are how an
inspirational idea can come

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.520
from the audience directly,
how it increased brand

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.940
awareness, how what was once
a commodity product became

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.440
differentiated through the
marketing and communication,

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.700
how it increased sales and drove
traffic to the stores.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.620
But I think what's most
interesting about this is how

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.310
this idea started in Latin
America, and is now being

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.800
replicated in South America,
in Asia, and how innovation

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.440
can start in the emerging
markets.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.490
Also very interesting, how
a paper product from the

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.580
pre-computer world has become a
pixel in the new world, and

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.720
become more relevant in
the interactive world.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.120
Step number two, X, experimente
como usuario a

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.780
traves de perfiles.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.390
How can we put ourselves in the
shoes of the user, using

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:50.870
user profiles?

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.780
This chapter in our book is
inspired by this behavioral

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.300
economist you see here.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.045
Dan Ariely, he teaches at
MIT and Duke University.

00:09:01.045 --> 00:09:04.260
And he's the author of
"Predictably Irrational."

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.290
And you see on his face there's
a scar on the lower

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.270
right side of this chin.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.240
And in his book he talks about,
when he was 18, he was

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.850
in a severe--

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:16.640
80% of his skin was burned.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.820
He was in a gas explosion.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.820
And that really changed the
direction of his life, and set

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.960
a course for him, for his
professional work.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.730
And while in the hospital,
he discovered--

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.870
his body was covered
with bandages.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.520
And every day, the nurses had
to change his bandages.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.390
But they removed them
very quickly.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:42.960
Because they didn't want to
experience the patient's pain.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.260
From his perspective, patients',
it was much easier

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:52.970
psychologically if the nurses
removed the bandages slowly.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.330
So really what it showed was how
can we get out of our own

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.150
head, and really think about
the user's perspective.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.850
We draw a parallel in the book
of how companies, we all want

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.800
to hit our monthly and
quarterly numbers.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.700
But at the end of the day, the
customers just want their

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.950
problems solved, which shows
why it's so important to

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.780
develop profiles.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.650
So when we're developing our
marketing campaigns, and

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.560
social plans, or marketing media
plans, how we can think

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.765
about it, according to
different profiles.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.660
The kids case study in the book
that we have here that

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.275
exemplifies the step
is Banamex.

00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:36.180
Banamex is the division
of Citibank in Mexico.

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:41.050
And they really successfully
developed user profiles to

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:45.140
understand, what do low income
consumers in Mexico and Latin

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.880
America need for a
banking product?

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.270
Currently most people
in that audience do

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.200
not have a bank account.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.910
So they went to the Mexican
government, and they reduced

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:57.220
the 20 pieces of information
that were required of people

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.710
down to eight.

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.740
And when they developed their
marketing program--

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.950
this is in Spanish here.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.340
But they developed a of three
step marketing and word of

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.590
mouth model for promoting their
product, and baked it

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.060
right into the product
development.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.770
Where, when someone signs up
using their phone, their phone

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.380
number becomes the
account number.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.050
And they can invite the people
that they have on

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.130
their phone to join.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.270
And when that person signs up,
each person that signs up gets

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.410
20 pesos deposited into their
Banamex transfer account.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.900
Obviously the word of mouth
element was baked right into

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.180
how the product was developed.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.260
In conclusion, for step X, or
the second step here, it's

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.530
important to understand the
perspective of customers, what

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.670
problem they need solved.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.090
Document how they spend
their time.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:54.930
And we can use day in the life
plans to develop our marketing

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.400
plans and understand what
motivates them.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.490
For step three, I, integrate
your communication channels, I

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.640
want to share a story that
happened to me while I was

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.430
actually writing the book.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.580
And this chapter, you could
say, was inspired by your

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.110
nemesis here at Google,
Bill Gates.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.980
"Your most unhappy customers
are your greatest source of

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.150
learning."

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.560
And of course the best place to
find those happy customers

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.900
is on social media.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.540
So much like this woman, I was
in the airport in Mexico City,

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.840
waiting for a flight
on Volaris, the

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.670
discount low cost airline.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.320
I'd printed my boarding pass
in advance, went through

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.130
security, was looking
at the screen.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:45.610
It said wait in area B.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.060
So I waited in area B. 20
minutes before the flight

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:53.470
left, I went up to customer
service and said, what gate is

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.940
the flight leaving from?

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.980
It still says area B. She said
they announced it many times.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.240
We don't control the screen.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.580
You're going to have
to run to Gate B.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.800
I, quick, ran to Gate B,
coffee in hand, coffee

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.990
spilling out of my cup.

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.090
And I got to the gate.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.020
And they had just
closed the door.

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:14.560
And I said, can I get
on the plane?

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.100
I have my ticket here.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.120
They said, no, I'm sorry.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.430
You're going to have to
buy another ticket.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.430
I said, what?

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:19.810
You're kidding me.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:21.590
It was still about 10 minutes
before the flight

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:23.110
was supposed to leave.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.630
A couple other guys showed up
with a similar situation.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.630
And we walked back to the
customer service agent,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:30.640
complaining.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.310
She said, no, you're going to
have to buy another ticket.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.120
I said, you're kidding.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.520
We went down to the ticketing
gate to complain.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.080
And explained it again
and again.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.600
I said, this is ridiculous.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.960
I'm going to go ahead and buy
another ticket instead of

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.170
wasting my time.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.710
So of, course later that day, I
complained on Twitter, just

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.855
to see what would happen.

00:13:49.855 --> 00:13:53.140
Would Volaris respond?

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.010
Using the quote from Bill Gates,
and using the airlines

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.720
username on Twitter.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.580
And what I get back?

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.780
Exactly what I didn't
want to hear--

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.480
a message in Spanish, an
automated response, saying

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.170
download our app.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.700
Buy your tickets on
our application.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.200
Clearly they weren't
listening.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.690
So the next day I sent
an email to them,

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:18.790
explaining my situation.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:22.350
And got a call back saying
we're so sorry,

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:23.470
please give us a call.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.170
Called them back, but then got
this email with my incorrect

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.120
phone number, saying, we
tried to call you.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.990
Please give us a call.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:37.030
Social media, email, and
phone, clearly saying

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:39.590
different things.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.930
So as this Volaris story
shows, the benefits to

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.710
integrating social systems with
customer service, how can

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:50.780
we develop better customer
service, learn how to improve

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:54.950
as a company, have happier
customers, and improve word of

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.200
mouth marketing?

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.890
The fourth step of the process
is T, transform your audience

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:05.310
and communities.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.750
This is step is all
about finding the

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.140
needle in the haystack.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.450
What's the content that can
attract our customers?

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:17.930
How can we create content that
has a magnetic force?

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.680
And when we developed our
process, my co-authors and I,

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.360
we really thought
about, how do we

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.860
learn lessons as children.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.450
And when we think about learning
life's lessons, we do

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.410
so through stories like Aesop's
Fables, The Bible,

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:35.840
movies, and stories like
"Winnie the Pooh."

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.410
Interestingly enough, business
really is no different.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:43.980
When we look at the management
guru Peter Drucker, who was

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:49.640
the author over 40 books, he
was once asked by "Fortune"

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.410
magazine, Mr. Drucker,
what are your

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.500
favorite business books?

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.250
And he said, actually I don't
read business books.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.430
I read Shakespeare.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.400
Because it provides the
most contextual

00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.800
lessons for being a leader.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.880
And when we analyze Harvard
business school case studies,

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.960
they're really no different.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:12.610
There is financial information
and bullet points.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.710
But it's really about a story
where the executives are

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.620
surrounded by contextual
information from the story.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:24.110
One great a company that's doing
a great job with that is

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.270
BabyCenter.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.170
Any of you here parents?

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:28.900
A few parents here.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.150
Perhaps some of you
know BabyCenter.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:37.490
Moms and dads sign up, put in
their email, the due date, and

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.350
then receive weekly updates
about what to expect when

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:42.870
you're expecting, or during
the first few years of a

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.110
child's life.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.660
But in addition to developing
that database and their

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.360
newsletter of content, they also
provided a platform for

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.920
moms to share their stories
of where they are in their

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.065
journey, not only in the US, but
all across Latin America.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:03.860
Next I want to show you two
videos from Mexico.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.430
The first is a viral video
that really exploded.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.730
And then the second video is
a video that Pepsi's cookie

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.560
division, Gamesa, in Mexico,
how their ad agency saw the

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.240
possibility to transform that
viral video into their own

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.319
story, and tap into the empathy
that some of the

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:23.520
viewers felt for the characters
in the first story.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.559
So let's take a look at those.

00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:26.549
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:26.549 --> 00:18:08.346

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:10.970
JOE KUTCHERA: So the viral
video brings out

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:11.720
the empathy in us.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.068
Let's see what Gamesa
did with that story.

00:18:15.068 --> 00:18:16.004
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:16.004 --> 00:19:06.572
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:19:06.572 --> 00:19:06.950
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.450
JOE KUTCHERA: How many
of you speak Spanish?

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:09.970
A few of you.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.790
Then, for those of
you that did, you

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.070
understood the tag line.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.020
Full of power, and how
these cookies can

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.980
actually empower you.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.510
And what's great about this is
not only how they turned that

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.000
first story into their own
story, but that that story

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.940
actually continues today, how
the emperors and the Roman

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.390
guards come in and
save the day.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:34.750
Although today they're actually
saving beautiful

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:37.820
women from being heckled by
construction workers in their

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.070
commercials.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.310
In conclusion, magnetic
content can

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.290
attract your audience.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.990
Stories can create ideas that
stick in people's mind,

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.450
engaging stories, and empower
people to communicate with

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.810
each other.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:01.660
The last step in our process
is optimize.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.520
We talk about A/B testing
and other things.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.240
But I want to show you an
example of how one retailer

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.200
actually optimized the retail
experience, and brought social

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.540
data into the store.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.430
Here you see the retailer C&amp;A,
a clothing manufacturer,

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:21.130
actually put the number of likes
that each product had on

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:27.190
its clothing hangers to show how
popular each product was.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:30.800
And here's an example of how
one supermarket chain used

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.320
Twitter, and developed
an algorithm.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.110
So that when you actually use
the hashtag in Spanish,

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.380
#quieroreceta, #iwantarecipe,
and then put all the

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.430
ingredients that you have in
your refrigerator with a plus

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.990
sign in between, it would send
back to you a direct message

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:50.980
about the recipe to use
with those things.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.190
We know optimizing helped
us react to

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.890
customers in real time.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:58.510
And it optimizes products to
benefit customers' needs, and

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.100
improves conversions.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.580
In conclusion, listening to your
audience, we heard the

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:08.220
story of 3M, and how the idea
came from the audience.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.770
X, experimente como
usuario, the

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.200
importance of user profiles.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.440
The story of Dan Ariely and
his experience in the

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.640
hospital, and Banamex.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.660
I, integrating your
communication channels, the

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.870
story of Volares, and how their
customer service and

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.400
social were saying
different things.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.520
Transforming your audience to
a community, we saw the

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.370
example of the Pepsi videos
there, and the guards.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.120
And O is optimize.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.710
The research phase, planning,
and launch and maintain.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.660
As I wrap up here, I just wanted
to share with you the

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.520
story about the next five to
10 years ahead for the next

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.920
generation of internet.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.250
How can we use a model like this
one to really innovate

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.760
new products?

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:55.770
David is originally from
Bolivia, moved to the US to

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:57.950
study computer programming at
the University of North

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.430
Carolina, and volunteered to
teach Hispanics about computer

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:03.410
and internet skills.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.480
And during the course of that
time, through listening, he

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.660
really understood their
need for developing a

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.180
new product for them.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.690
And developed Pase La Voz,
or Spread the Word.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.730
It's now the largest database
for US Hispanics in the US for

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.060
mobile or an SMS database.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:22.090
Where he sends in short form
English lessons, classified

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.310
advertising, and
traffic alerts.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.470
Which is exactly why we're
supporting Rodrigo's

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.620
organization, one laptop
per child.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.550
Because we really see that the
future the internet is going

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.000
to require innovating new
products for the billions of

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.810
consumers who only have a mobile
phone, who come from

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.440
low income households.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.660
And so we ask you just to spread
the word about the new

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.991
book, as it launches
this summer.

00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:51.610
By the way, joining us on the
phone today virtually was the

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:52.650
office from Mexico City.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:55.460
And I just want to thank two of
my co-authors for the book,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.340
Alonso Fernandez and Karla
Berman, who are joining us

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.190
virtually from Mexico City.

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:03.640
And again, the book's coming
out this June.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.130
So with that, thank
you very much.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:11.130
